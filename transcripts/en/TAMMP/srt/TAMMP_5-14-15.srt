1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,370
Hey, what's going on? Why
you're just checking in on you.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,040
I can't go up that.
Hi everybody.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:13,041
I am 10 shows in to my epic 19 show
run at the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

4
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:17,310
Massachusetts. And I got to tell
you, I'm a little bit, I got 10 down,

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,300
nine to go and I gotta tell
you this was a stupid idea.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,180
Should have played a
venue a little bigger. Um,

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,090
all the shows have been going great.
Um, but I've been doing all right.

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:34,740
I've been taking a steam every
fucking day. Little Eucalyptus spray.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,020
I'll be able to tough my way
through this shit, man. Um,

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,400
that's the extent of how difficult
my job is. I think my voice was,

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,790
I think my instrument will hold up.
You know,

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,590
you have all your other people doing the
fucking back breaking jobs right now.

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,250
You're not how many backbreaking jobs
or even left in this country, isn't it?

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,570
All infrastructure other than ups.
People will unload or load and unload ups,

15
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:02,430
trucks, construction. What
else is a difficult job?

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,340
Uh,

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,660
early on in your relationship and your
girlfriend as a fucking birthday coming

18
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,630
up? That's a difficult job, dude. What
do I get? Or, you know what I mean?

19
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:15,510
It's like I don't love it, but
I still want to fuck her. Right?

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,910
What kind of gift is that, dude?
You know, what should I do?

21
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:22,290
Should I get her a blouse?

22
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:27,120
Should I take it as a
box gift certificate?

23
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,710
Uh, my accent's going to be coming
back really strong. Jesus Christ,

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,110
I met this guy last night in so
many people think the Boston accent.

25
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:38,880
It's just that practicality in the habit.
Yet they met,

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,200
they miss all the law part of it.
This fucking game. Gramar George,

27
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,680
you've got to do your job.
Draw up Jay Jay,

28
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,890
WB guys comes walking.
You need,

29
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:54,590
he's not doing his fucking job
job. There it is. I can job job,

30
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,730
you know?
So anyways,

31
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,050
I got to tell you,
you know,

32
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:04,980
I was fucking rag in the last two podcasts
about Tom Brady and I gotta be honest,

33
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:07,200
man.
What a difference a couple of days makes.

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,040
This is all gradually just going
to blow over with real sports fans.

35
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,350
People who just straight up
hate the patriots will fucking,

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,120
now they're saying Aaron Rodgers
likes his ball a little over inflated.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,690
Minnesota heats up the
footballs and Tom Brady,

38
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,730
let's a little bit out the end of the day.

39
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,520
You still gotta throw
the fucking thing right?

40
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,980
It's fucking idiot saying he's cheating.

41
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,300
Is that all you have to do to
make it in the NFL is a little,

42
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,170
a little bit of air out and
all of a sudden the ball
goes exactly where you want

43
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:38,990
it to be. It's so fucking dumb. But I'm,
I'm looking for the Patriots to, um,

44
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,730
you know,
Brady's already hired a lawyer.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
They're going to go at this fucking
thing. I think we're sick of uh, uh,

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,390
the teams in the League fucking doing
all this country shit too is trying to

47
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:50,760
make it look like we're a bunch
of cheaters when we're not.

48
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,910
We're just kicking your fucking
asses and why don't you grow up?

49
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,570
Why don't you take your fucking skirt
off and just play the fucking game and

50
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,460
quit looking under every
goddamned jock strap.

51
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:03,900
Cause we can do the same thing to you
or write you a bunch of pussies. Sorry,

52
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,970
I'm really just talking about the jets.

53
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,840
I'm talking about the cults and I'm
talking about every other sports park

54
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:12,540
content out there.
I love to how everybody acts.

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,130
Like they've never been guilty of any
sort of gamesmanship looking for a fucking

56
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:17,761
edge.
Right.

57
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,880
You're never took a test and kind of
glanced over at the smart chicks fucking

58
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:24,150
paper over there. Right.
A little gamesmanship.

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,450
Okay.

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,290
Um, whatever. Uh, I'm
actually in a great sport,

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,160
smooth at this point because I've
realized at this point that, uh,

62
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,720
I think good Dale,
after all,

63
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:40,410
he went through last year with the ray
rice thing I'm with under suspending

64
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:44,550
somebody now. He's like a fucking
like a baby poisonous snake.

65
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,050
Just unleashing all the venom when he
doesn't need to do that, you know? Um,

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,030
I guess it's within every team's right.
If they want to fucking, I mean, I dunno,

67
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,180
I look at it like when they said George
Brett had too much fucking pine tar on

68
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:58,320
his bat.
Oh really?

69
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,230
Is that why you hit the fucking
home run to win the game really?

70
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:04,500
Because he had too much, too much sticky
stuff, so he got a better grip on it.

71
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,900
That little bit of extra sticky stuff,
you know,

72
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:09,180
if you never hit a home run
and a major league ballpark,

73
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,110
I don't know if you know this,

74
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:13,650
all you have to do is put a little pine
tar a little bit beyond the label on the

75
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:17,190
bat and you'll be, the thing's going to
be jumping right off the bat. It's crazy,

76
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,400
man. I don't know why McGuire
and those guys, you know,

77
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:22,470
poisoned their bodies
with all the steroids.

78
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,440
All they needed was just a little bit
of sticky stuff on that bat and then

79
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:29,920
forget it.
So anyways,

80
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,540
in other sporting news,
all Canadians,

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,000
you fucking lost again. I'm just giving
I, I would, I shouldn't be rubbing in it.

82
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,360
What the fuck am I to say?
My team didn't even make the playoffs,

83
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:47,170
but our congratulations to the Tampa Bay
lightning and Canadian fans as much as

84
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:51,220
I give you shit. Fuck it. I'm not, I,
you know, I want it. Am I going to do?

85
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:56,200
You guys got fucking 97 cups. You
know, granted both of them were one.

86
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,750
When your team was the team
plane was like a biplane.

87
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,950
You don't know or understand
about Canadian fans.

88
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:06,040
I always give you shit about how long ago
you won the cup and there was only six

89
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,070
teams in the league. Why don't you
guys ever say back to me? Yeah.

90
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:12,370
And the Bruins for one of them.
So why didn't you guys win 20 cups?

91
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,020
A bunch of people in French
just said, we exactly. Um,

92
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,600
let's see here. So I am, um,

93
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,140
10 shows in 10 shows.
And by the way,

94
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:27,160
the curse of Patrick Wall continues
the solemn saying, tell him saying,

95
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,920
and now I've got to congratulate
New York City. Well,

96
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,210
congratulations to the
New York fucking ranges.

97
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,860
I actually hate to admit this, but I
actually, I actually liked the ranges, um,

98
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,330
because I remember when they want it,
94 that uses like this. That's to me,

99
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:48,280
that was the greatest year in hockey ever
saw. Um, Mark [inaudible] we will win,

100
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,540
you know, breaking a fucking
50 [inaudible] 54 year curse.

101
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,500
I'm an original six team. It
was great, man. It was awesome.

102
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:00,020
And also at that point, the red sox
hadn't won the world series yet.

103
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,460
So I remember watching that going like,
wow,

104
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:06,230
maybe that's what that's gonna feel
like when we finally beat a beat,

105
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,350
somebody to win a world
series. So, um, God dammit,

106
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,210
Washington capitol fans. I mean,
what did you do? You know, you know,

107
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:16,490
we'd be a great fucking sports show

108
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,790
if you had like Washington capitols and
like San Diego charger fans sit down,

109
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,300
right? And just talking about all the
shit that they've been through. Right.

110
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,450
And then in the end,
you know, Jason Law had,

111
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:33,430
comes in crying worse than
anybody as a Cleveland Fan. Um,

112
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,700
and then a cubs fan walks in with
his horn rimmed glasses asking why?

113
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,410
Asking why anybody really gives a fuck.

114
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,490
As long as you take your shirt off and
have a good time, who cares? Right?

115
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,430
Who gives a fuck? Fucking red sox won. Oh,

116
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:51,110
I'm back in p town. I'm cage. People end
up with the sports. They're red sox one,

117
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,600
two to nothing. It gets, the
A's actually won the series.

118
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,300
I fucking miss it back here man.
I really do.

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,030
Sitting there talking to
my wife about it going,

120
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:02,240
what the fuck are we living out there?
And a God damn state that has no water.

121
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,730
You know what I mean? Coming back
here, lush land, bunch of trees,

122
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,630
lakes, you know, I
really miss my home town.

123
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,980
I fucking love it back here and I'm trying
to see like what I go fucking nuts if

124
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:20,120
I moved back here. I mean kind of be
difficult to still be in this business,

125
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:24,440
you know, to get acting work. We're not
be based here, but uh, I don't know.

126
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,310
I got to admit,

127
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,920
I got to admit it turned me on little
good fellas reference for you there.

128
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,190
Um, so anyways, uh, I got
to try to conserve my voice.

129
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,630
I don't even know what the
fuck I'm going to talk about.

130
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:38,030
This is how out of it I am.
Last night it came home.

131
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,130
I fucking come home late at night as
always. Oh, me and Rosie one night.

132
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:47,330
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Dude,

133
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:51,020
we fucking stayed out till
like five in the morning.

134
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,360
I was driving home and the sun was
coming up, was sitting here like,

135
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:56,150
what am I doing? We ended up, uh,

136
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,070
we finished our shows and then these
guys will say saying, Hey, you know,

137
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:05,420
you got to come to our dive bar, a dive
bar around the corner. And we're like,

138
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,710
Whoa, we got a couple of cigars. I know, I
know. I said I was quitting, but whatever.

139
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,240
Um, we've got a couple of cigars and I
wanted to fucking needed a place where we

140
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:17,710
could smoke them, right? So he goes, yeah,
yeah, you know, come on over, blah, blah,

141
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:19,730
blah, blah, blah. I'll probably get this
guarantee. I don't want to get this.

142
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,040
Get in trouble. And then we went
outside and we smoked him in the alley.

143
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,370
I want to thank everybody at a bitty
earlies flatten a smoke legally outside in

144
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,590
the alley. It's not even an alley.
They were outside on the sidewalk.

145
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:37,190
So when he was be fucking
ended up going there and um,

147
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:47,990
Cop is off duty firemen and they just
walked. They were already, you know,

148
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:51,890
fucking four hours into drinking at least,
you know,

149
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,460
and we just come walking in stone sober
and I had me and [inaudible] a little

150
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,590
hammered,
then we would've started telling stories,

151
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:59,660
but instead we just listened to the show.

152
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,820
And,
uh,

153
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,170
this fucking guy, man, I swear
to God, he's telling this
story and he's going like,

154
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,680
all right, you're not going to. But he's
like, fucking like leaning in on us.

155
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,800
He's gone. You know, I got fucking,

156
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,790
I got fucking two kids, right? I gotta,

157
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,880
I got a son and a daughter by two
different women. I know. I'm fucked up.

158
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,240
My life is fucked. I know.
So anyways, my daughter,

159
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,030
she's like fucking 10 years old and she
starts asking me about the birds and the

160
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:33,360
bees. I'm like, what the fuck? I
mean, I don't even know what to say.

161
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:36,960
So I just start, I, I freak out. So I,

162
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,510
I emailed my ex wife,
you know,

163
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,330
cause I can't call her because
of the restraining order.

164
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,800
And then he makes this face that looks
up in the air, like whatever that is.

165
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,640
And then he fucking goes,
I fucking end up telling,

166
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,090
I don't even know what I said to
her. I was like, you know a man,

167
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,650
a man's penis gets erect in it,
goes inside and it fertilizes I dude,

168
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:01,880
I fucking blacked out.

169
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,530
I came to like fucking 20 minutes later
and she's staring at me and my daughter

170
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:10,430
and then my new girlfriend's looking at
me like, dude, what the fuck did you say?

171
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:13,400
I mean, I see what, what am I supposed
to fucking, next thing you know,

172
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,870
he's talking about the marathon bombers
and how he was one of the guys that had

173
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:21,680
the rifle on the dude in
the boat and he's gone.

174
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,090
I got the FBI over here.
The fucking CIA is behind me.

175
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:29,570
I got my gun on his fucking
dude, right? I got it on him.

176
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,100
The FBI is in the other room,
fucking dude.

177
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,860
He started the story like 15 times
to the point. I finally go, Hey,

178
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:39,440
what side is the FBI on?
And he doesn't miss it.

179
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:43,580
Be the FBI is in the other room is
CIA is behind me. It's like, dude,

180
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,930
just get to it. And then the fucking
fireman guy goes and Yada, Yada Yada.

181
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:50,150
You didn't fucking shoot
them your bunch of pussies.

182
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,230
So those of you haven't been keeping
up on the, um, on the whole, uh,

183
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,500
that whole story there with
the Boston marathon bomber,

184
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:04,320
like he's on trial right now and uh,

185
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm listening on the radio was listening
to one of those NPR things in there

186
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,140
talking about how, uh, you know,
the big question is, you know,

187
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,220
when they convict this guy,

188
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:19,170
does he get life in prison or the
Dia fucking kill them and you know,

189
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,050
I think it's a no brainer.
You take them out,

190
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,460
okay,

191
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,520
his life has already over,
what are you going to deal with?

192
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:25,940
Just stick them in a cage.

193
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,330
Okay.

194
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,730
It's over. You know what I mean? They're
trying to pull that shit. You know,

195
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,460
he was really influenced by
his brother. Yeah. You know,

196
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:36,360
I was influenced by my older brother, but
you know, if the second he starts going,

197
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,940
hey,
let's stick a fucking bomb in a mailbox.

198
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,180
Okay

199
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,570
next to innocent people, children,
you know, at that point I'm like, hey,

200
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:46,120
all the brother, you know, I think
you kind of going down a road.

201
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:46,954
I don't want to be on it.

202
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,503
MMM.

203
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,670
I Dunno. Yeah, I think you put them,

204
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,530

like a rabid dog. Am I out of my mind?

205
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,340
I like when they go like we don't come
from a country that's an eye for an eye.

206
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,680
They'll fuck. We don't what fucking
history book are you reading?

207
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,170
What apple when they scalped a couple of
us. Jesus Christ, we committed genocide.

208
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,610
Can't take our one fucking
bomber. Come on. All right,

209
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,130
this has been conservative bill
coming at you here on the podcast.

210
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,760
Um, so anyways, for those of you
guys who are new to this podcast,

211
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:25,420

ride where people just, you know,

see how your week's going. You know,

213
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,670
I worry about you guys.

214
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,540
I worry about you guys just got my
head busted at this fucking place.

215
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,070
I haven't gone to since I was a kid.
You know, we just call it the hack shop.

216
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,410
I'm not going to say the name of it,
but that's what we used to call it.

217
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,350
It's fucking guy go in there.
He's like fucking, you know,

218
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,470
there's the guy that's kind of old and
then there's the guy that's really old.

219
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:51,940
So I'm going, you know, and they're both
finishing a haircut. So I'm like, come on.

220
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,480
Almost old. Come on kind of. Oh,

221
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:59,080
of course really old finishes
first we get there, right.

222
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,030
He's fucking funny as hell.

223
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,920
And I could just tell the
whole fucking thing's uneven.

224
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:07,030
So I had to try to fix it when I got
home, you know what I mean? And he goes,

225
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:11,520
we can, we need to say, hey, it got to
give the state troopers. Um, all right.

226
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,210
So anyways, um, let's get to the, uh,

227
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:19,750
the hashtags here.
Shit that you guys want me to talk about.

228
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,790
I got home so late last night.

229
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,940
I actually looked for some reason you
don't want just an old news stories pops

230
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:29,290
in. I started looking, I remember
Shondra is Shandra Levy, remember that?

231
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,320
And there was that politician and they
were about ready to fucking maybe make a

232
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:36,340
case on them. And then nine 11 happened.
He never fucking heard about it again.

233
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,860
I always wondered about that.
Okay.

234
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:43,570
The Thursday afternoon,
m m p for those,

235
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,120
uh, you people, you people that
want to fucking email in. It's uh,

236
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,050
for Thursdays it's a Hashtag
t a m. M. P. All right.

237
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,300
I know this one sucks so far. I'm going
to try to turn it around here. All right.

238
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,410
Aye. You got to talk
about dad bods. Oh yeah.

239
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,640
That was Michael Rappaport.

240
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,640
I am Rapaport podcasts where
he's talking about dead bodies.

241
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,550
I'm not a dad and I already have
that body. That fucking kills me.

242
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,330
It really kills me.
Um,

243
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,370
isn't an awful how in shape you can look
in with the shirt on fucking unreal.

244
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,010
Every time I'm thinking I'm
looking. All right. You know,

245
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:24,230
you catch that sideways
view of you in the marriage.

246
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,340
It's a fucking absolute shit show.
It's so fucking depressing.

247
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,980
Um, anyways, report show the
NFL may listen to podcast.

248
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,280
Brady suspension could be overturned.
It better be overturned. You know what?

249
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:39,100
I think all patriots fans should do,

250
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,170
every Patriot fan should go watch that
fed fucking documentary on Scientology

251
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,160
and rather than judging Scientology,
you know, he should really,

252
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:49,240
we'll look at it and be like,
well,

253
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:52,460
you could really make that documentary
about any religion, every religion,

254
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:54,930
if the core is a giant fucking guests.
Right.

255
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:00,020
But the greatest thing about getting
clear is Scientology wanted to be

256
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:05,250
recognized as a religion and then get
that tax break. And the IRS is like, no,

257
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:09,420
you guys are a cult gimme a break. You
know, you're talking about space ships.

258
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:13,950
We don't believe in that stuff, so fuck
you guys. And they basically sued them.

259
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:18,951
They had like 2,500 2,700 of their members
individually filed a lawsuit against

260
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:24,090
the IRS.
Never been defeated.

261
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,740
The fucking Mayweather,
right. The Rocky Marciano of,

262
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,170
uh, I, I don't even think they are a
government agency, are they? Aren't.

263
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,650
They worked for the Federal Reserve,

264
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:37,170
which is a private group of people
that don't, that print the money.

265
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,920
I don't fucking know. All I know
is the shit I over here and buys.

266
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,320
So they defeated them.

267
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,410
2,700 individual lawsuits from one
group defeated the fucking IRS.

268
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,360
So they go,
I say,

269
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:54,720
if they don't overturn this
fucking Tom Brady suspension,

270
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I am going to fucking rally every
Patriot fan I know to sue the NFL.

271
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,610
Alright, for emotional damage
done for you guys. Lion, our bod,

272
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:09,180
our quarterback who looks like
a fucking astronaut. Okay,

273
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,160
we'll fucking smell fucking show you when.
That'd be great.

274
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:15,330
Just fucking overturn it.

275
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,680
Then we'd be called a bunch
of cry and whine and assholes.

276
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,290
But who gives a fuck that do fun.
Gay coming to work today.

277
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:27,291
Don't talking to my lawyer about my
fucking lawsuit against the fucking NFL.

278
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,120
Um, I really think we ought to do
that fucking child. This one is one.

279
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:38,121
I'm still waiting for the day that the
light is gradually going to shine on a

280
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:41,340
gym or say somebody at some point.

281
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,230
Can you look under one fucking rock
and just take a look at that guy?

282
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,220
I'll give you a hint. He sits on the
competition committee. Start with that.

283
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,180
Just start with that. And Ben, you just
look what happened when he sat there.

284
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,300
What his team looked like,
what his team's strengths were,

285
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,100
and what were some of the new rules
that got implemented. I know, I know.

286
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,150
I'm fucking going crazy.

287
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:06,900
I should be standing here with a fucking
legal pad next to a fireplace doing

288
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:11,430
stand up in front of three people.
Um, all right. Uh, let's see,

289
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,264
what else do we got?

290
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,080
Yeah,

291
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,970
what do we got here? What if it's
California against Florida for the cup?

292
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,740
Your thoughts? Oh my God, I
didn't even think about that.

293
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,160
What if it's Anaheim
first fucking Tampa Bay.

294
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,820
Okay.

295
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,690
Ooh, just picturing that is really
cheesy. I would still watch. So,

296
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,530
cause there are great
teams, you know, something,

297
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:40,170
you know what gives 'em that really
gives Tampa Bay credit I think is Steve

298
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,760
[inaudible],
you know what I mean?

299
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,390
He's such a hockey guy is
such an ambassador for the
sport and I just think what

300
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:48,690
he's doing down there, it was great.
And uh, I have to be honest with you,

301
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:52,470
I love the lightning and I
also love the devil rays.

302
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,920
And I think I don't like about the
devil rays. Is it just called the race?

303
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,450
You know, I mean, I don't get why people
down there and Clearwater and Tampa.

304
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,590
I don't get what you're afraid of. I
bend down there. I've seen the people.

305
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,060
All right. The devil is
all over Tampa. Okay.

306
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,060
I don't think it's going to
influence anybody one way or
the other, um, with, okay,

307
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,710
if it was Tampa versus,
um, the ducks, you know,

308
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,740
I really liked both of those teams. I
gotta be honest with you. I like, uh,

309
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,900
I kinda like what's his face there?
The form of capital's coach.

310
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,420
Cause everybody was kind
of like, Eh, you know,

311
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,210
okay.

312
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,240
He doesn't have what it takes to get
them over the hump. I think either way,

313
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:37,040
it'd be a great story. And I also
love Ironman. So, uh, you know what,

314
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,730
I would, I would root for a seven
game series of that happened. But, uh,

315
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,930
the other option would be
Chicago verse the Rangers. Um,

316
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,890
I dunno, range has got a shot, man. They
got a shot. It definitely got a shot.

317
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,933
But,
um,

318
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,700
I think most people are saying whether
it be wins between the ducks and the

319
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,140
Blackhawks, but, you know, something,

320
00:18:57,141 --> 00:19:00,650
I've missed all of this shit cause I've
been doing two shows every night down at

321
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:05,470
the Wilbur and I want to thank
everybody who's, uh, who's been going,

322
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,670
coming out to the show is me.
It's been fucking ridiculous.

323
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:10,460
I'm doing a late show on a Monday
night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night.

324
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,860
Just the fact that people even
coming out to the early show.

325
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,950
So I'm blown away by the support out
here. So I hope you guys have been on, um,

326
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,930
enjoying the shows and it's certainly
having a good time performance for you

327
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:24,140
other than my voice being
a little fucked up. Um,

328
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,900
okay. Bill, do you have any
radio shows slash other podcasts,

329
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:34,160
not Diversey effect that you already
mentioned that, uh, you would recommend,

330
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
um,
that you guys don't know about?

331
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,473
Okay.

332
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,930
I mean, the shit, I like
the opiod Jimmy show. Um,

333
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,440
I always liked Howard Stern fucking,
um,

334
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,510
the other guys.
I was like the other guys in Atlanta,

335
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,680
mmm.

336
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,470
That she can actually, but listen to
online. This is a whole new game here.

337
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,030
Actually, Joe Rogan, you guys probably
already, if you listen to my podcast,

338
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:06,700
you know about Rogen and Marin
and all those guys. Yeah.

339
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,053
MMM.

340
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,360
You know what was a fault of my,

341
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:14,900
one of my favorite radio shows of all
time was to fill Henry Cho and he used to

342
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:18,980
do this thing where it was this amazing
thing where he would host the show,

343
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,110
he would bring up a topic and then
he would have a caller call in,

344
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,340
but the color was actually him and his
collar would just say the most craziest

345
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:32,480
shit and it would just get
other callers to call in.

346
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,220
He was like the original troll.

347
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,320
And then the other people would call in
and argue with this phantom color that

348
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,320
was actually fill Henry.
And then he would, uh,

349
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
and then he would moderate
it the same time I,

350
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,750
and he's actually doing a voice on
f is for family. And I finally got,

351
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,470
I was so such a thrill to talk to him.

352
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,350
I asked him how he did it and he just
said he was clicking off from one

353
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:57,190
microphone to the other and every once
in a while somebody would figure it out

354
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:01,960
and call a B, you know, is this the same
guy? And then you quickly hang up on them.

355
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,660
And some of the classic
ones at this point,

356
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,490
I think he can just listen to them online.

357
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,930
But he had one where he was talking
and was like this, like the 20th,

358
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:14,920
the 25th anniversary of
the Star Wars trilogy.

359
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,520
And he called in and you know,
called in his own show basically,

360
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:23,200
and he was pretending to be some big
star was fed. And he was going like,

361
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,930
and he was like, yeah
man. He's going like, uh,

362
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,710
in empire strikes back was awesome.

363
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:32,950
And I loved that po where we're
the with Darth Vader is Luke,

364
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,800
I'm your father, you bitch
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

365
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:39,640
And he just kept going back to that quote,
go on Luke, I'm your father, you bitch,

366
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,540
and blah, blah, blah. And Phil would
then as a host, go, yes, I remember that.

367
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:48,190
That was, that was an incredible, uh,
of credible twists in that trilogy.

368
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,380
I would think that all star wars fans,
uh,

369
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,330
we'll put that rank that in the top three
and the guys on. Yeah, man. He said, um,

370
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,400
you find that you bitch and then
somebody calls in, he's gone. Ah, yeah.

371
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:01,240
I just wanted to talk to the collar.
Yeah. He just says, Luke, I'm your father.

372
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:05,590
He doesn't say, Luke, I'm
your father. You Bitch. And he
just kept saying, yeah, yeah,

373
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,460
Luke, I'm your father. You Bitch. And the
people would sit there and argue with it,

374
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,900
wouldn't figure it out.

375
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:15,400
He pretended to be pilots talking
about seeing goblins on his, uh,

376
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,900
on his wings one time and some
real pilot calls and go and look,

377
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:21,580
I don't know who this guy flies forward,

378
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,770
but there's no way he saying that he
reported that to any sort of FAA agency or

379
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,110
he would be grounded immediately.
And then Phil just goes,

380
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,400
are you calling me a liar?

381
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,560
And then we'll just immediately
launch into this argument.

382
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,750
It was fucking tremendous.
Um, I dunno. Other than that,

383
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:41,140
you know, I'm an old guy and all the radio
shows I like to have gone off the air.

384
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,870
I was actually flipping through
the Boston stations here,

385
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:47,310
like what had happened to
BC and I couldn't find Waf.

386
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,840
Wh J why it's all gone.
It's got,

387
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,230
um, anybody else remember
that? The big mattress show.

388
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,630
Uh, all right, where are we going?
Oh, hey Billy drumming. Drumma boy.

389
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:04,040
What you know about Jimmy,
Jimmy Chamberlain, uh,

390
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,150
that's the guy from smashing
pumpkins. Um, I believe, right?

391
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,570
Not as much as I should
know. Does that, uh,

392
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,190
does that count a look at that?
Somebody made a new logo for the colts.

393
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,670
It's a blue and white pass a fire
right on the side of the fucking,

394
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,100
and it's Saturday omelette.
I love it. Please.

395
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:27,610
More of that. I would really
enjoy it. All right, so, uh,

396
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,830
let me read a little bit of advertising
here. Uh, for this week's podcast.

397
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,040
Dude, I am so fucking wiped
out. This was, you know,

398
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,530
this was such an amazing thing to
do to be able to do these shows.

399
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:43,180
And within three shows. I was like,
this is a really dumb idea. Um,

400
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,220
oh my God. Fucking voice.
All right, Uber, Hey,

401
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,050
oh fuck. This is part, this is, I thought
this was a question Uber. Everybody. Hey,

402
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,030
you like making great money,
right?

403
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,180
Here's a really cool opportunity that I
had to share with you driving with Uber.

404
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,180
Uber's that populous smartphone APP
that connects riders with drivers.

405
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,190
Um, my wife takes Uber all the time, um,

406
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,570
you know, when she seems to have a
good time with it. Um, and in chatting,

407
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,260
okay, I'm supposed to be saying
that I take it, well, I do take it,

408
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,960
I take it with my wife and every
dental guy loved them by the way.

409
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,360
And in chatting with different drivers,

410
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,630
some of them have really interesting
stories as to why they drive with Uber.

411
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,900
You know, what I do love about Uber
is it's a nice clean fucking car.

412
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,980
I will tell you that.

413
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,800
And I've yet to get in there with
somebody who smells like they just fucking

414
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:35,990
played a game. Seven. How about that?

415
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,960
Is that enough as a of a
personal endorsement for you? Um,

416
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,070
the people who drive love being their
own boss, they earn great money.

417
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,430
It's easy to start.
You just need a car and a license.

418
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,180
Do this really is a fucking
unbelievable employment opportunity.

419
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,550
Like back in the day when you
got laid off, he was screwed.

420
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,270
How do I make my car payment?

421

people. That's your arm out the
window. You're your own boss.

Uh,

431
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:35,150
I could be getting you into a car when I
could be getting into your car when you

432
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:38,690
drive with Uber and it would be weird.
Uh,

433
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,290
any big podcast listeners this
way you live, um, you got to go.

438
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,770
Um, I'll do it. If I was a young man,

439
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,750
if I had the fucking time I would do that
shit. I would definitely do that shit.

440
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,770
Beat stuff. Fuck gotta go into
one office, doesn't it? Um,

441
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,940
Bombus chances are if you have feet,
you wear socks. Everyone. And face it.

442
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,120
Socks haven't changed since they
were invented that we did not.

443
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,830
What ends up happening and they fall down.

444
00:26:18,831 --> 00:26:21,680
They were out and there was always the
toe seem that never seems to be in the

445
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,590
right place. You know what
happens? You Soc, Sag,

446
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:27,410
you bowl sag and then you
accept that weak fucking raise.

447
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,720
Your boss is trying to give you.
You know what I mean?

448
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,350
It's a metaphor you want you, if you
want your sock standing up straight,

449
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:37,520
just like you, Dick, our new
sponsors, Bombus has changed.

450
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,200
All of that bomb was,
is dedicated.

451
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:42,200
They actually make a sock for your Dick
too when it stands up straight. Okay?

452
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,370
You got to how much she can fill it up.

453
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:46,410
And if you fill it up
beyond the fucking heel,

454
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,040
they give you a free pair of thongs.

455
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,470
A bombers is dedicated to two years to
engineer socks that stay up last forever

456
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,270
and feel amazing on your feet.
Um,

457
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,540
they actually sent me a pair
of bomb as they feel great.

458
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,480
There's nothing better than new
socks. Puts you in a good mood, right?

459
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:07,140
Your wife could suggest
something horrific. Hey,
let's have a picnic. You know,

460
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:10,530
you got on a new pair of socks. You're
like, you know what? That sounds awesome.

461
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,440
I really think that my feet
feels so good right now.

462
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:16,070
I could actually tune you out
on the side of a hill. Uh,

463
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,590
there's so comfortable the honeycombs
stitching, it just hugs your foot.

464
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,990
You know these socks care mayor,
these socks care more than your mother.

465
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,290
Um, so whether you're walking or
running, you feet feel perfect.

466
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:31,590
I find myself washing them over
and over so I can wear them again.

467
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,460
I need to get more. Will you stop
fucking doing that with the copy?

468
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,220
I don't find I find myself washing them
when they're dirty. I enjoy the socks.

469
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:43,560
Isn't that enough? Jesus Christ. When,

470
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,050
when you guys led up to
know what I'm talking about,

you really need to try out a
pair for yourself. But listen,

472
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,690
Mama's doesn't stop with your
comfort with every pair of socks.

473
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:54,030
Bomba sells a pairs.

483
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,170
All right, I'm going to start wrapping
up the podcast here. You don't,

484
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:30,270
one of the great things this week,
um,

485
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,730
aside from seeing a bunch of people
that I'd gone to high school with,

486
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:34,230
people who have been coming in and,
and you know,

487
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,850
I've been having them come backstage
and, uh, like I said, it's been awesome.

488
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,550
You know, I just been running into people
and everybody seems to be doing well.

489
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:44,440
Everybody's happy,
seem to be happily married.

490
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,180
Actually ran into one of my friends who
just got divorced within the last couple

491
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,430
of years and I got to tell you,
he was fucking ecstatic.

492
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,750
Is there anything better as a guy than
meeting another guy that's happily

493
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:59,490
fucking divorced? He's just,
fuck, he's loving life. You
know, he's got an apartment,

494
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,590
a couple, two, three boys, you
know, he's like, oh dude, it
was time. It's tea. He goes,

495
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,690
you know what I love about it best?
He goes,

496
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,240
he'll be sitting in my apartment
and there's a bar across the street.

497
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,550
And he goes, see, I just
think to myself, wow,

498
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:14,610
if I want to I can just
walk right over there.

499
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,100
I can walk right in there and get a
beer, you know, very simple thing.

500
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,150
So I know right there, a lot of
women are probably thinking like, oh,

501
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:27,210
this guy was a bad husband. He was out
there drinking all the time. You know,

502
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:31,080
there's always that fucking option.
But then there is the other option that,

503
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:35,280
you know, sometimes ladies, you know, you
hold onto the reigns a little too tight,

504
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,940
you know what I mean? He kinda Yank
and they head back and uh, you know,

505
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,120
it's that horse wants to run,
going to have,

506
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,340
you're gonna have some problems.
You know,

507
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:47,960
if you get some old mayor that's
going to go to the glue factory,

508
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:50,440
I'll let you fucking lead them
wherever the fuck he wants. You know,

509
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,130
you married a stud, right? You
got yourself $1 million horse day.

510
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,570
You got to let that thing run every
once in a while. There you go ladies.

511
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,280
And then go off to the pub and get a
fucking good buzz going every once in a

512
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:05,680
while. You know, I know you're
married. I know you got kids.

513
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,070
I know he comes home and he fucking
mistakes to sync for the toilet,

514
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,270
but every once in a while, you know,
maybe once a month, once a month.

515
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,650
You know what? I would be
fucking amazing. All right,

516
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,560
let's just say you were in a marriage
right now and you know your husband is a

517
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,080
little, a little miserable, you know,

518
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,660
and every once in a while he needs
to go out and be frank the tank.

519
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,680
What if you just let him get Uber,
right? You get him a pair of Bomba socks.

520
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,500
You get them an Uber and
say, you know what, honey?

521
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,650
Once every four to six weeks you can
go out with the fellas and just get

522
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:40,660
absolutely fucking loaded.
All right?

523
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,540
You come walking in through
the fucking cellar doors.

524
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,030
We'll have a couch down there.
You pass out the next morning,

525
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:48,700
the kids won't know shit.
All right? Just fucking,

526
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:53,440
just blow out the pipes and then fuck.
And then he can come home.

527
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:53,981
And then,
you know,

528
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:58,210
once every four to six weeks I get to
go do whatever it is that women do that

529
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:02,170
they consider fun. I have no idea what
you guys do. What is it that you guys do?

530
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,191
You know,

531
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:07,030
I know women fucking love women love a
glass of wine around four or five o'clock

532
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,970
uh oh that is this a Gar,

533
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,310
Huh guys? She wanted your fucking
wife to chill out. You know,

534
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,570
just fucking pour a glass every day around
five o'clock and she's bitch moaning

535
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:24,370
and complaining as you just go shoo blub,
blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub.

536
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,200
Let it sit out right on the
back porch. Go ahead. You know,

537
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,030
she's in a really bad mood. Pour another
glass. She'll be asleep by six 30 right?

538
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,800
Then you go in with your kids.
What do you do?

539
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:40,510
You throw in the fucking talk in plain
movie with Dane. Cook is a voice,

540
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:44,530
right? Get Dane Cook a little
bit of scratch. Your kids
is staring there. You know,

541
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:47,500
you fucking poor a whiskey. That's,
that's what parenting is all about.

542
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,990
Working with your partner.

543
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,120
So that the two of you can get a good
buzz going every other day without the

544
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,870
kids noticing. And I know kids notice a
lot, but you stick them in front of a TV,

545
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:02,770
they got no idea what's going on right?
There you go. And you know something.

546
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:04,050
I think that that's one to grow on.

547
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,760
You guys ever watched those that I talk
about this. Did you guys ever watched,

553
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,790

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,900
will be on Monday and I'll have my
final two shows. Number 18. Number 19.

560
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:03,330
All right. Freddie Lynn, who's
a famous 19 Joe Thornton.

561
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,700
I'm trying to think in Boston sports.
Is that what he wore?

562
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:07,710
Okay,

563
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:12,420
Randy [inaudible], has there ever
been a great 19 and Boston sports?

564
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,610
Wasn't Fred Lynn 18 or was he 19?
Maybe?

565
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,660
[inaudible] was 18 and Freddie,
Freddie Lynn was 19. Uh, Fred Lynn.

566
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,930
Oh, what a fucking ball player
through the end of the day.

567
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:27,510
He was a California boy and
they ended up with the fucking,

568
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,060
ended up with the angels. All that
killed me. Do you know that was our, our,

569
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,943
our field.

570
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,640
We had Fred Lynn and center Santa
Dwight Evans, the greatest fucking,

571
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,001
um,

572
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:44,001
you have a saw and we had Jim rice
and we had butch Hobson at third.

573
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:48,180
Rick Bellson. It's short. Jerry
Remy, the ram dog. It's second.

574
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,490
We had George Scott at first,
Carlton Fisk behind the plate.

575
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,600
And we had Carl Yastrzemski at Dh.

576
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:03,430
We still didn't win a world series.
Fucking brutal. Absolutely fucking brutal.

577
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:08,020
So anyways, um, I think
that's it. That's the, uh,

578
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,780
the podcast for this week.
I know the energy's a little low here.

579
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:14,620
People just work with me here over
the next fucking podcast as I, uh,

580
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,190
I really gotta go easy here on the voice
because you know who's kidding, who?

581
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:19,570
I don't really know how to write a joke.

582
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:24,010
So I do a lot of silly faces screaming
the effort and I'm paying for it right

583
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:28,960
now. All right. Hey ladies,
once every six weeks, you know,

584
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,100
just let them go out and get fucked up.
You know,

585
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,630
dorm are solid and just say, listen,
I'm letting you get fucked up,

586
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:41,170
but you have to be fucking husband
of the year for a week. Is that cool?

587
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,350
It'd be site be fucking sites.
Right?

588
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,520
And all you guys got to do every once
in a while you pour a glass of wine and

589
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:50,650
then you've got,
and then you're good.

590
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,940
And then your kids grow up to be
raging alcoholics. And you know what?

591
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:59,860
A family that drinks together stays
together. All right, you guys have,

592
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,610
we, we can you have a great fucking
weekend? I'll talk to you later.

593
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,420
I want a girl with the mined diamond.

594
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,980
Have you guys seen this stuff about
the, uh, all the suicides at the, uh,

595
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,630
the apple plant. You know,
that really Canty commercial
where they go, uh, you know,

596
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:30,710
if you don't have an iPhone then
you don't have the iPhone, you know,

597
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,770
and I want it to get an iPhone until I
saw those God damn commercials and they

598
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:38,220
kept like, uh, just, it's most bizarre

599
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,300
advertising.
It makes me angry at the iPhone.

600
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:45,330
I've never had any anger towards the
iPhone or the people who had one.

601
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:50,010
I never gave a shit. I was
like that phones to shit.
I heard it. It drops calls.

602
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:54,330
I'll wait till it's on Verizon and then
right when it gets on Verizon and I'm

603
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:56,100
all ready to jump on board,

604
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,260
they come up with this Nananana
fucking country shit going. You know,

605
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,460
if you had an iPhone right now,

606
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:05,760
you could be looking at the inside
he your fucking throat and, uh,

607
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:10,050
diagnosing your fucking throat cancer
before it even happens. You know,

608
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,900
but if you don't have the iPhone,
you don't have the iPhone.

609
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,250
It's like well fuck you.
I'm Cuban sticking with the droid.

610
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,000
So anyways,
now I read they just had the 10th suicide

611
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,330
at the apple plant.
Now who's kid?

612
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:26,370
Until we all know that
everything that we're wearing,

613
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,230
everything that we're using is made by
some four year old making 6 cents an hour

614
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,430
somewhere. We'll evidently they,
these people have had enough.

615
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,440
They've had 10 suicides at
the apple plant. Here we go.

616
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:43,620
On the same day that apple,
Dell,

617
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,120
Hewlett Packard promised to look into
working conditions at China's Foxconn

618
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:51,240
plant,
a 10th worker committed suicide.

619
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,770
The death of a 19 year old male
male worker. Uh, it's too bad.

620
00:36:55,771 --> 00:37:00,330
He was like one year away from getting
his fucking severance pay or is a shit.

621
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:03,090
I fucked it up. What the hell do you get
it when you do 20 years in the force?

622
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,340
Ah God, I'm sorry everybody.
I'm on my fucking vacation mode.

623
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:11,400
What the Hell I get my pension.
What does that,

624
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:16,230
when you worked 20 years on the force
and he's only 19 you get it.

625
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,790
Cause he's been working since
he was two. Oh Jesus. Um,

626
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,430
the death of a 19 year old male worker
also came just after the company's

627
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:28,431
billionaire founder took the media on
tour of the sprawling complex in response

628
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:33,750
to accusations from Labor groups that
workers toiled and sweat shop like

629
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,230
conditions. All hilarious. So
then the billionaires shows up,

630
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,400
they cleaned the place up, stick in a
water bubbler and goes, see, it's great.

631
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:46,350
Um, and I know what a lot of you
fucking heartless consequent to say.

632
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,680
You're going to say, well,
sweatshop labor is necessary.

633
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,720
Do you want to pay $8,000 for a
laptop? What? Here's my rebuttal.

634
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,760
You know what if the content,

635
00:37:56,761 --> 00:38:00,690
the top didn't have to
make $1 billion a year?

636
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:05,700
You know, kind of like when they were
talking to the oil companies and they go,

637
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:09,960
you're projected to make 350 billion.
How about you just make 340 billion?

638
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,560
Do you have to make that much money?
That's the thing.

639
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:16,680
The people at the top are taken
way too much fucking money.

640
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,580
There's no fucking way that the only,

641
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,010
a reasonable way to make a laptop is
to give people such shitty wages that

642
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,590
suicide is a better fucking option.

643
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,470
And you do it at the fucking plant to
make some sort of political statement.

644
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,450
There's just no fucking way. How
about the people at the top? You mean

645
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,830
once you got $100 million to what?
What do,

646
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,710
do you ever need to get another paycheck?
I don't understand that.

647
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,510
I don't understand that.

648
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:53,750
And I'm not saying that the people
at the top shouldn't be filthy,

649
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:57,260
stinking rich because
they came up with it.

650
00:38:57,261 --> 00:39:01,070
But you shouldn't be paying people. This
shouldn't be sweat shops, everybody.

651
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,223
That's all I'm saying.

652
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,520
And what sucks is that we actually came
up with unions in this country because

653
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:12,950
of sweatshop like conditions. And, uh,

654
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,850
but what ended up happening was the
people in the unions took advantage of it.

655
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,710
And with their strength,

656
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,580
they became a bunch of sloppy Douche
bags to the point that there's a lot of

657
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:24,980
people who actually have
negative views about unions.

658
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,630
That's how bad it is in this country.

659
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,500
And they're actually excited that
they're going to do away with unions.

660
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,250
A lot of people want to do away with
fucking unions rather than reformed them.

661
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,440
But to do away with them is we're going
to end up like these poor bastards and

662
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:42,290
in fucking China, you know, so and
shit together and go and you know what?

663
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,830
I think I'd rather jump out the fucking
window then make another God damn iPhone.

664
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,910
Um,
so anyways,

665
00:39:47,911 --> 00:39:51,710
it says the company has
bought psychiatrist and
Buddhist monks to the factory,

666
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,580
to the factory complex to support workers
and now plans now play soothing music

667
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,020
along production lines. Why don't
you just fucking pay them? Um,

668
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,210
it plans to install 10 foot tall,

669
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,240
tall fences to stop workers jumping from
buildings and may give workers a 20%

670
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:18,950
pay raise. This is how tight
these fucking rich concer.

671
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,510
Let's play soothing music and
put a fence up. We'll try,

672
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:27,140
we'll try that first rather than just
giving them more money. What is it?

673
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:31,620
What is it 20% pay raise when
you make it 8 cents an hour? Um,

674
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,651
and anyways,

675
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:37,910
Foxconn representatives maintain that
the increase would not be in response to

676
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:42,010
the suicides, but it's being considered
because business has been good. Yeah.

677
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,630
Give me a fucking break.
Justice

678
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,430
my neighbor's ass.
Yes.

679
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,440
Generally speaking are we're going to go
with yes. A hey bill loved the podcast.

680
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,640
No. Yeah, that's east coast. Oh,
okay. Uh, that's why people bitch.

681
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:02,750
Where the fuck is a podcast?

682
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,130
I need some advice on what to do about
the got this guy lives in a few houses

683
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,370
down from me. I'm a third year
college student and I live at home.

684
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:14,780
My parents moved, uh, to go
live in the state above mine.

685
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:19,190
You mean north and I currently reside,
uh,

686
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:21,260
alone while they are
trying to sell the house.

687
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:23,930
A few months ago I was driving home,

688
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,510
coming back from a gym and while
I was driving in my neighborhood,

689
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,260
I saw this guy step in the middle of
the road, about 20 yards from my car.

690
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,780
He was yelling something at me,
but I couldn't hear what he was saying.

691
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,650
I slowed down to stop my car right in
front of him and he came to my window and

692
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:41,880
told me to get out. I was totally
confused and thought I'd run over.

693
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,520
I thought I ran over his cat or something.
Also,

694
00:41:44,521 --> 00:41:46,920
I think he just moved in because
I'd never seen the dude in my life.

695
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,250
So I rolled down the window and ass.
Why did you say he goes,

696
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:52,470
I'm going to kick your fucking ass.
Get out of the car.

697
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,680
This guy's probably in his forties
and has to be around five 10 is that,

698
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:02,640
does this me? Um, 250 pounds.
That's not me. I'm 21, six, three,

699
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:08,100
200. I do crossfit and I wrestle
occasionally at another gym I go to.

700
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,640
So I got out of the car and I'm standing
there trying to figure out what the

701
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:14,610
hell is going on.
The guy starts moving towards me,

702
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,220
so I take the initiative
and take a step towards him.

703
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:22,200
We ended up being an inch from each other
and he's trying to do some alpha male

704
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:25,350
shit by just staring at me.
But I have the height advantage.

705
00:42:25,351 --> 00:42:30,351
So I'm looking down at him at least
10 seconds go by before the guy goes.

706
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,160
How fast do you think you were going
back there? I say, I don't know,

707
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,540
probably around 30.
The speed limit in my neighborhood is 20,

708
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,630
and I know I wasn't going that
much over it. Then he goes,

709
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:46,890
I'm not going to have my children
playing in the yard if I no assholes,

710
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:50,880
like you drive in like that
and the neighborhood after, uh,

711
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:54,990
he said that I saw his wife and son were
a little off to the side of the road

712
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,980
once the word asshole left his miles,
I was fucking pissed.

713
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,790
I wanted to just tackle the Dick and put
him to sleep in front of his wife and

714
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:03,960
kid to teach them a lesson,

715
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,730
what I pussied out and just apologize
to them and said that I was really Solly

716
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,290
sorry.
And it wouldn't happen again.

717
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,910
The guy then gives me a fucking little
smirk and turns around and says while

718
00:43:14,911 --> 00:43:18,670
walking away with his back turned it
better not or you know what will happen.

719
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,570
Ah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,700
He definitely should have kicked his
ass. He said, I kicked his ass. Yeah.

721
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,180
What the fuck do you do?

722
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:32,320
You realize what a good do
you realize what this kid did?

723
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,090
He's such a fucking gentleman.

724
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,920
He could've kicked the
fucking shit out of this guy.

725
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:38,870
He saw his wife and kid there. It
would have been emasculated. Yes.

726
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,570
Dad Is Superman. He sits there. You know
what it is? It's that little smirk. Yeah,

727
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,620
that fucking smart. I bet that con steals
from work. Yeah, I bet he does. Sorry do.

728
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:51,760
That's the first time I literally
had to walk away. You fucking cunt.

729
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,250
Yeah. He should have kicked
that guy's ass. But it's a good,

730
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,190
it's good that you didn't do it,

731
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:59,740
but because you weren't as
the bigger person as they say.

732
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:01,780
But he definitely has a comment.

733
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:07,690
Then he writes now after that, that
shit, I want it to explode. I mean,

734
00:44:07,691 --> 00:44:08,890
the guy totally disrespected me,

735
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:11,620
so I get in my car and drive
off and his story wrong.

736
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,920
I couldn't get this fucking
guy out of my head. I do it.

737
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,150
I can't get it out of my head.

738
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,420
I'm going to actually fantasize
that I was there and he did that.

739
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:21,640
What I would want to do. I've already,
you know what I would fucking do?

740
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:25,450
I would wait till he was alone.
Don't do this shit. Don't do this.

741
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,470
But I know what you just want to get
up. Get the guy alone and be like, Hey,

742
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,190
what are you going to do now? Huh?
Huh? What are you going to do now?

743
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,030
You just get right in his fucking
grill and have him back down

744
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,650
or I, I would almost just say
we got to say, hey listen man,

745
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,810
just call them over the car and just say,
listen,

746
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:48,110
I just wanted you to know the other day
that if I wanted to I could have fucking

747
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,450
stuffed you in my trunk.

748
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,890
Tied you up like a fucking pressel and
ass rate you in front of your fucking

749
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:59,190
wife. But I chose not to. Okay.

750
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:03,060
Cause I didn't want your son to know
what a little fucking, I can't say it.

751
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,110
Pussy he has for that wouldn't
have been homophobic either.

752
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:12,840
I wouldn't mean me talking about gay
people. That's such a fucking pussy move.

753
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,900
Yeah. And if for some reason
but, but I'm putting no,

754
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:23,370
then that's what you say. Maybe do
it like Columbia to say, listen man,

755
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:27,870
I gotta ask you something because I'm
six foot three. I crossfit. I wrestle.

756
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,250
Okay. And just looking at you. I
know I could tie into a pretzel.

757
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,090
I know I could do it if I wanted to,
but the confidence you had,

758
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:39,330
I just want to know what is
your background. You know,

759
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,370
cause you know I'm a real competitive guy.
You know,

760
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,650
if you've got some sort of
martial arts training, you know,

761
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,680
I would love to have you once we didn't
she come down to the gym sometime when

762
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:47,760
your wife and kid aren't there.

763
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:52,020
So I don't have to feel guilty when I
fuck you up and close both your eyes with

764
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:54,120
this one and his friend over here.

765
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,250
What does the rest of the things say?
I don't even need to read it,

766
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,350
but it's not over though. I know.
Because this is what's happening now.

767
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,160
This is what happens when you do
the right thing in life. Okay.

768
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,710
When you know it, it eats away
at you. You have to make peace.

769
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,320
You have to make peace and eat and you
got to tell yourself the lie that someday

770
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,490
this guy's going to get his.
And you know what?

771
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,290
He doesn't guys like this don't get
theirs. Oh, that's smart. This kid,

772
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:29,370
this kid really painted a fucking picture.
I can. This is driving me nuts. He goes,

773
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,690
I couldn't get this guy to my head.

774
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,660
A week went by and I was still
thinking about that asshole too.

775
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,770
I would think about this guy. 20
years from now, two weeks later,

776
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,720
I was driving home from school and I see
the guy rolling is garbage can out to

777
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:43,230
the curb.

778
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,460
I slow down to fucking under 20 and I know
this because I looked down at my spit.

779
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,910
Tom's pedometer.
I pretend to stare the guy down.

780
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:55,260
So I look at him and he looks
at me and yell, slowed out.

781
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,330
Wow.
Now when he said that I am fucking raging,

782
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:04,650
I want it to stop my car and do some
ground and pound on his face. Yeah.

783
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:05,670
This kid knows what he's doing.

784
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,950
This isn't wrestling with
this kid's doing UFC shit,

785
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:13,310
but did I know I just drove off like a
fade the next day I talked to my friend

786
00:47:14,071 --> 00:47:14,904
about it,

787
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,930
about what had happened and he said
that this guy said the same shit to him.

788
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,110
If he said it, he would have put
him on his ass. I know you do.

789
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,780
You know what I would've
done? He told me that, uh,

790
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:26,820
if he says he's going to kick your ass,

791
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,800
then that's a threat so you can defend
yourself. Listen to your dumb friend.

792
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,200
He's saying you won't get arrested.

793
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:36,140
So a few months have passed and I'm still
thinking about this asshole every time

794
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:38,480
I drive by his house.
Fast forward.

795
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:39,920
Okay.

796
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,370
Uh,
two yesterday and um,

797
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:42,780
okay,

798
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,070
I'm biking in my neighborhood.

799
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:46,860
Let's do an I hop I and I
hear a honk from behind me.

800
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:50,460
So I pull my bike over to the side of the
road and it's none other than the same

801
00:47:50,461 --> 00:47:54,900
dude in his Ford F-150 driving along and
he looks at me and gives me the middle

802
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:57,000
fucking finger.
Wow.

803
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:58,380
Okay.

804
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:58,531
Now,

805
00:47:58,531 --> 00:48:01,350
granted I was in the middle of the road
and didn't hear the guy coming because I

806
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:04,620
was listening to music, but still
the middle finger. So I bike home,

807
00:48:04,621 --> 00:48:07,470
take a shower and try to convince myself
to walk over to the dude's house and

808
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:09,480
confront him.
But after a couple minutes of pacing,

809
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,740
I just decided to wait it out until the
asphalt does. One more thing. I mean,

810
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:17,760
I don't want to get arrested.
So my question is, what the
hell should I do? I mean,

811
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,380
every time I drive by this guy's house,

812
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:22,980
now I want to fucking veer off the road
and ran my car into the middle of his

813
00:48:22,981 --> 00:48:26,460
living room. Any advice would be good. Uh,

814
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:30,370
all of my friends think I should go over
there, but I want a second opinion. Um,

815
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,720
uh, you can't do anything to this
guy unless he puts his hands on it,

816
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:39,130
unless he puts his hands on you.
This is just one of these things,

817
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:43,500
but you can do to him what he's
doing to you. This guy has an insane

818
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,290
temper.
So,

819
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,010
uh, you know, I'm not advocating
legally so you don't do this.

820
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,430
But like,
um,

821
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,210
I don't, I dunno what I
would next time, you know,

822
00:48:56,211 --> 00:48:59,540
if you see him out in the yard or
something, this is what you do.

823
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,160
I have a great idea. Do you have any
friends who are really good mechanically?

824
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,670
Um,
why don't you take your credit card out,

825
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,920
go down to the fucking
auto store or whatever.

826
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,180
I'll go online and buy like one of
those fucking train horns and have it

827
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:18,590
installed in your car and next
time you drive down the street,

828
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:22,190
just be sort of zigzagging down the
street just to get this guy to be fucking,

829
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,670
you know, getting all like, oh, what the
fuck? And the second he starts screaming,

830
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:30,440
you lay on that fucking horn is loud as
humanly possible and you blow out his

831
00:49:30,441 --> 00:49:34,670
ear drums. That's what I would, but then
again, then no one too. She liked us.

832
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,950
He would say that I have
permanent hearing damage.

833
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:38,750
You know what I think you should do?

834
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,120
Maybe because I'm a female and I'm
all about the cycle of bench. Okay.

835
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,790
Psychological warfare. What should he
do? I think when the husband is not home,

836
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:49,490
I don't know if he,
if he knows his schedule or whatever,

837
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,000
he needs to go over there when the
wife is at home and be like, listen,

838
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,510
you know I'm so sorry about that time
that I was speeding. I really, you know,

839
00:49:56,511 --> 00:49:58,370
but your,
your husband's seems really upset.

840
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:01,130
I'm really not trying to be like that.
I would never do anything like that.

841
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:05,580
And women I, oh no, no, no, cause she
knows her husband is a psycho and like,

842
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,360
I mean she could turn it around and be
like, yeah, you shouldn't do that either.

843
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,440
But I have a feeling she's not like that
and he can just go over and just make

844
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:15,770
nice and be like the sweet
kid that's helping out or oh,

845
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:19,320
do you need me to take the mouse
out? And then, but then the,

846
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:22,190
I feel like maybe that would fuck with
the husband and he's like sitting there

847
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:25,160
sipping tea with the, the way
if it, oh look who came over.

848
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:28,070
He just wanted to apologize in person.
And you know,

849
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,510
I dunno. I Dunno. There's,
there's and then fuck the wife.

850
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,160
No, no, no, no, no, no.
He should fuck his wife.

851
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,550
He should fuck his wife.
Play with his kid in the backyard.

852
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,930
Like the toss the football around with
him and be more like, you know, like this.

853
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,200
You can't do it. There's
nothing like, just start
keeping them the finger. Listen,

854
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,660
this is a deal. All you gotta
do is just give him the finger,

855
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,630
give him the finger right back.
Cause uh,

856
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,690
this guy thinks you're a bitch right
now. So all you going to do is, you know,

857
00:50:56,691 --> 00:51:00,200
you can just yell back. Just say,
you know, just give him the finger,

858
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:04,580
yell back at him when he's in the
driveway. I would like swerve,

859
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:08,890
add him and then swerve back.
Just fuck with the guy. He's not,

860
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:11,990
I mean just do that once because the
next time you might have like a video

861
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:16,070
camera, but um, uh, I,

862
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,650
I just don't want to get any,
you know what,

863
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,690
if I was in that situation a dude,
you know what I would dope. Yeah.

864
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,510
Oh Monday morning quarterback.

865
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,930
Look while I was in that situation
with that other guy, right? Yeah.

866
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,070
At the last place we lived and I didn't
fuck with him cause he was an old guy.

867
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:34,940
I just didn't fuck with them.

868
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:38,120
And how we found out he has dementia
and all this shit. So I'm site.

869
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,090
I never yelled at the guy,
you know what you do now.

870
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:44,660
You know what's what really diffuses
angry guys like that or it makes him even

871
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:49,010
more angry. It's just laugh at
them. Just keep laughing at him,

872
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:53,720
laugh at them, give him the finger
and just keep calling them. Tough guy.

873
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,650
Tough guy.
Anything do anything.

874
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,550
You just keep calling them anything that
is remotely. All right dad, Chuck Norris.

875
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:06,530
Anything you want to say to this guy
that will bait him into hitting you?

876
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,240
This is a really a fuck.

877
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:12,200
This is a great question and I don't
want to get in trouble if some shit goes

878
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:16,760
down so you shouldn't do
anything, sir. Wink, wink, wink.

879
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:22,070
Um, this guy's such a dick. I
know. I always say, you know,

880
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:25,520
fucking with somebody whose car was like
a pussy move with this guy such a dick.

881
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,890
And he has like such
a, uh, oh my God dude.

882
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:34,030
How many times you thought about throat
to just choke slam and that guy ran into

883
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,810
the hood of your car repeatedly as
his wife and son. It's in my trunk.

884
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:43,970
Vanji like a friend saw an ass rapey
nobody if you just said it really calmly,

885
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,220
if you set a comedy,
it was sort of a smile on your face.

886
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:48,470
You come off like a fucking
maniac. Yeah, that's true.

887
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,850
If you scream that at somebody,

888
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,150
you just sound like you're quoting like
Hulk Hogan or something. Right? Yeah.

889
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,750
Let me tell you something,
brother, come this Saturday,

890
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:57,550
I'm going to beg in the
proximal and past white team.
