1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,520
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:05,460
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,410
December 31st,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,110
2018 case.
You thought there was 32 days in December.

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,490
This is the last day of 2018.
What are you going to do with it?

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,290
Are you going to theses the day?
Seize the day,

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:27,210
Aka cram too much shit into a 24 hour
periods so you're fucking stressed out for

8
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:31,830
the next day. That's how I do it.
That's how I do it. Oh, by the way,

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,950
guess what? I finally got that little
fucking piece I needed for my, uh,

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,060
for my headphones and it works
great. And uh, as you see,

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,520
I sat there and I fucking
pitched about it for what?

12
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,950
Six fucking felt like nine years.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,680
Yeah.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,870
I just ordered it on Amazon.
It showed up, you know,

15
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:51,700
some fucking eight year old put on
a welding mass. He made it there.

16
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:53,590
Then somebody else fluid on a fucking,

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,563
yeah.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,520
What do you call those goddamn things
that hover over your neighborhood? Drone.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,400
Yeah.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,070
Yeah. I Dunno. Anyways,
happy new year to you.

21
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:08,590
Happy New Year to you.

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,290
You're going to get shit faced.
Call an Uber or a Lyft.

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,750
Um, I'm actually going to be going out
tonight for the first time in a long time.

24
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:23,120
We're going to be going up, going
out with my, uh, my whole family,

25
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,110
my family back east. We're just
going to go out to dinner. Uh,

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,280
it's cool being a dad, you
know what I mean? Right.

27
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:30,000
Then I'll go on and go
booze and all that shit.

28
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,960
He just fucking call two days before.

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,040
Do you have a reservation
at four in the afternoon?

30
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,890
Four 30 the leg. Why? Yes. Yes we do.

31
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,500
It's like any other day here at four
or four 30 in the afternoon. However,

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,430
you know, started at
around seven. No, we don't.

33
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,470
I'm completely booked and everything's
going to be jacked up the a hole. So, uh,

34
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:57,400
we're all gonna go out and have a,
hopefully a pleasurable meal,

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,860
enjoyable dinner and
all that type of stuff.

36
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:04,780
And then I go to the rose bowl the next
day and then the following day gave me a

37
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:07,000
ticket on an aero plane.

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,210
Okay.

39
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,340
Gonna go fly to fucking eastern Europe.

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,700
I'm going to go to Cologne,
Germany,

41
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,220
and then I'd start and I am ready baby.

42
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,890
I put it at the time I
did the fucking work.

43
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,330
I was down in the comedy
store every night,

44
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:27,810
the last three nights and the ice house.
You know, I fucked up a Thursday night.

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,190
I fucking, I fucked up twice on my
gigs this week, which I never do.

46
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,950
I actually was headlining the
ice house and I'd forgotten.

47
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:36,210
I put in at the comedy store,

48
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:41,100
some pulling into the comedy store at
like nine o'clock and I just happened to

49
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:44,550
look down at my phone and I see a Joe
Rogan phone call and he was the one who

50
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,610
told me to, you know, that they
wanted to book me at the Ice House.

51
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,670
Then I was like, oh fuck. And then I saw,

52
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,930
I had a bunch of messages from the club
owner and they called up. I was like,

53
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,180
what time was I supposed to be on stage?
He's like right now, 10 minutes ago.

54
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:03,090
So I drove out there like a maniac.

55
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,330
I finally learned how to use
the supercharger in my car.

56
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,780
Okay.

57
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,950
You know, so I was in a intense
mode. Whatever the fuck they call it.

58
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:13,690
Like I drove that car
for fucking two years.

59
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,390
Never using the supercharger cause I
didn't know you had to push a button.

60
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,000
I just start when I stepped on the gas,
like the old days,

61
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,720
it would just engage over
there but it didn't. So uh,

62
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:25,360
I finally learned how to
use that thing and um,

63
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,520
what is going on with these fucking wires?
Why can't I get him ever? Not, we just,

64
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,010
I'd have someone understand how this
fucking happens every single time.

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,293
Every week,

66
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,060
every week. You know, it's weird.

67
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:39,960
You could take a handful of wires and
throw them on the ground and then once you

68
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:44,340
pick one of them up, they
all tied together. You know,

69
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,220
it's so weird that you can
do that with like wires,

70
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:48,540
but you can't do it with snakes.

71
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,570
If you throw them on the fucking ground
and you just picked one of 'em up,

72
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,790
they wouldn't be a bunch of
them all tangled up in it.

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,860
They all just fucking slither away.

74
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,630
Okay.

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,570
That's what I'm saying is we need to
start making wires the way the good lord

76
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:06,450
makes the snakes. Um, anyways,

77
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:09,430
so then I had to drive all the
way back to the comedy store.

78
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:10,930
Okay.

79
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,700
Because I was so fucking
late at the ice house.

80
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,940
I hung out and took pictures
and sign shit. Do you know
what to make up for that?

81
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,390
Did the full hour. Then I went all the
way back to the fucking comedy store.

82
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:24,280
I got there, but like a quarter to
12 at night and I got to tell you,

83
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,510
and I even gone up,
you know,

84
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:29,470
I never went up really late at the comedy
store because I never got past there

85
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,020
to go through that. And I
went back to me, you know,

86
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,500
I audition for Mitzi and she said I ain't,
she didn't say anything.

87
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:36,890
She left in the middle of my second.

88
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,660
That's how fucking awful she thought
I was. And she's probably right.

89
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,050
Um, if I'm going to be mature
about it. And then I just,

90
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,340
I moved back to New York and I sorta did
the late night thing in New York and I

91
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,970
never got to do at the comedy store and
that's probably the latest I've gone on

92
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:58,420
there since I can remember. And it was
just a completely different animal.

93
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,050
I went on in the main room and,

94
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:04,720
and then also when the original room and
in the main room I was on stage and I

95
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,630
was thinking about Richard Pryor for
some reason because I know that there's

96
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,860
some older guys there told me how he used
to work out his stuff late night there.

97
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,040
And then when I went into
the, or I was, you know,

98
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,370
I just went up there and I had like this
fucking set where it was just totally

99
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:22,180
free refund set, all his shit. Didn't
take any of it, just shit that I would,

100
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,600
a few things, I remembered
that now in my act, but like,

101
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,490
and I remember hearing this story that
Jim Carrey came up with fire Marshall

102
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,240
Bill late night in the or at the
comedy store and all that Shit.

103
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,800
So it was really ended
up being really cool.

104
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,390
And then I worked two shows Friday there
to show Saturday and then last night I

105
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:44,140
was running my hour in the main room and
then I was running over to the whiskey

106
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,020
because Steven Adler was playing.
And um,

107
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,690
I also had another spot in the AOR,
but instead of just doing an hour,

108
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,780
I did like an hour and 40 in the main
room and I was going to be late for the

109
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:59,140
Steven Adler show. So I was like, is
it cool if I just don't do that spot?

110
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,630
Because I didn't know that they
advertise me in that room too.

111
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,610
I thought they just advertise
me in the main room,

112
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,310
but they had also advertise me in the EOR.

113
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:08,590
Had I known that I would've
gone over there and done it.

114
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,850
I just thought I had a spot and I,

115
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,020
and I missed it because I was supposed
to go off at 10 15 and by the time I got

116
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:16,150
off stage in the main room,
it was like 10 40. I was like,

117
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:20,170
I don't want to fuck it up over
there, you know, for the other people.

118
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,060
So anyways,
long story short,

119
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:26,050
I saw Steven Adler fucking great show
at the whiskey and then I'm walking back

120
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,210
to the store and I'm walking in front
of the store and these four people are

121
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:31,960
standing there like fucking two of them,
one 30 in the morning going like,

122
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:34,460
you've gotta be shitting me,
you're going to go on now. I go,

123
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,670
we talking about it was on in the main
rooms, it could know you were in the Olr.

124
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,600
We were sitting there for five hours.
The whole crowd was fucking pissed off.

125
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:45,040
So I, I dunno, I got to try to figure
out how to fucking make that right.

126
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,360
But I felt like a fucking asshole.
So I took a picture with them and um,

127
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,370
I dunno. I Dunno. I was thinking,
why the fuck did I do that?

128
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,650
Cause then went over to the Adler
thing and it started like, you know,

129
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:59,260
20 minutes later I would have had
time to do it then I wouldn't have

130
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:02,800
disappointed those people and now
I feel like a fucking asshole.

131
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,850
Um, but I haven't said
that, you know, I, I,

132
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,430
I basically did like
seven sets in missed one.

133
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,200
So what are you going to do? Uh, but
dude, the fucking Adler appetite show,

134
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:20,950
that thing was fucking great man. And I
was just sitting there, the whole show.

135
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,980
I was just watching Steven
because I started listening,

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,573
you know?

137
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,890
Yeah,

138
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,380
I dunno.
I,

139
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,110
I kinda tuned up my drums and I got some
different heads and shit and they sound

140
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:38,960
fucking killer and a then my drum teacher
came over and he fined tuned it and

141
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:42,090
now it just sounds fucking unbelievable.
And uh,

142
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,110
I was listening to just that appetite
album again and I'm such a drum nerd.

143
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,400
Do you realize that Steven Adler
does not hit his rack Tom until like,

144
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,420
like the fourth song,
like halfway through the fourth song,

145
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,550
he crushes that album
just with a bass drum,

146
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:05,430
snare and his floor. Tom, the only
time we really hits the floor, Tom,

147
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:09,060
is the breakdown during
a welcome to the jungle

148
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,480
out to get me as all just kick snare.
Uh,

149
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,960
no, I'm sorry. Uh, what's the next
I would say to get me, it's uh,

150
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,090
it's so easy is our kick snare

151
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,190
and what's the next one?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

152
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,500
data that's on the other side. I
don't fucking know. But anyway,

153
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:33,970
so I was watching him and then
when I watched him last night,

154
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,850
the fill that I thought he was doing and
one of those fucking songs a actually

155
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:43,000
didn't do on the rack, he actually
went from the snare over to the floor.

156
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,780
So I actually think he goes
maybe to, uh, Mr. Brown stone.

157
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,720
Nobody even then that's a for Tom.

158
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,590
But I remember seeing this whole fucking
thing she does is born a lot of you

159
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:58,300
guys. But uh, I remember seeing this
whole fucking thing on that for awhile.

160
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,030
He only had a three piece and it's just
amazing how he's so style came out of

161
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:05,960
being a broke musician and just
crashing at people's places.

162
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:07,670
He couldn't have a big
drum kit if he wanted to.

163
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,920
He started out for the Double Bass Kit.

164
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,450
I remember reading in
his book and then um,

165
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,900
they got rid of that.
You got rid of that somehow?

166
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:19,240
Somebody said don't play the double
bass just played a single bass drum

167
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,710
assumption that long. It,
it's like a Barnum thing.

168
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,190
And then he was down to like just a floor.

169
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,183
Yeah,

170
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,770
kick and snare and just the, the amount
of music that that guy got out of it.

171
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:30,604
But uh,

172
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,130
yeah,

173
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,851
it was awesome.

174
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:37,380
It was just do what a bunch of
characters at the whiskey last night.

175
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:42,350
Jesus Christ, there was this fucking
guy there, right. And I just,

176
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,380
he, he looked and he looked like he was
like in his fifties but he looked like he

177
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:48,071
had a hard life.

178
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:52,630
So he was probably like in his
forties and he's just standing.

179
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:55,990
All of a sudden the bouncer comes up and
he just hit some like slaps him on the

180
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:59,830
arm, like what the fuck? And then the
guy kind of just is like, hey man,

181
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:02,560
you know what I mean? It's
cool, whatever. And the bounce,

182
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:07,390
it just grabs them if fucking throws him
out of the club is my buddy I was with

183
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:10,300
went up and said, hey man, just started
curiosity. What did that guy do?

184
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,110
And I guess the guy had
taken out his lighter

185
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,080
and was fucking lighten the ass of the
person in front of him like some other

186
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:23,500
dude. So when the bouts hit, I'm
like, what the fuck are you doing?

187
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,640
When he was making this gesture like yeah,

188
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,290
it's kind of funny right in the punches.
Just get the fuck outta here.

189
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,890
You fucking lighten people on 40. What
are you giving somebody have a hot foot,

190
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,830
50 years of fucking age.

191
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,760
And my other buddy was with was
laughing his ass off because so loud.

192
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:41,560
I mean I could have just gone to him,

193
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:43,870
but he was sitting there going
like was laughing going, yeah,

194
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:46,930
I saw the whole fucking thing.
Like you didn't even try to hide it.

195
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,590
It's a complete fucking asshole.
Um,

196
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,040
so anyways, uh, that's why I did it.

197
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,860
My apologies to the people that
came down to the, or last night.

198
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:59,650
I feel I really feel fucking
badly about that, man. I, I,

199
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,900
I mean there's a hand, I don't know how
many times in my life I've missed a spot.

200
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,310
I would, I would think it's under
10 my entire fucking career. Um,

201
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,950
the first nine times nobody gave a fuck.
Um,

202
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,450
so my apologies. I hope that somehow I
can make that up to you guys. Um, anyways,

203
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:22,450
plowing ahead here. Uh, speaking of shows,

204
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,370

guys are kids to me, but they're not,

205

lineup for the seventh annual Patrice

207

of working with both of them. Uh,

208

Mark Norman.

209
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,850
I worked at the West Side Comedy Club
in New York City and Joe Lists, uh,

210
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,610
when I did Gotham, uh, about a month
ago, I got to work with both of them and,

218
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,800
monster show and thanks to
the Joe Rogan experience. Uh,

York city. Oh, sorry.

221
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,670
And why city center.org or on my website,

222
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,610
which is [inaudible] dot com if you
just click on the events or whatever the

223
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:42,730
hell it is, road gigs or some shit like
that. If you just click on that shit,

224
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,500
you'll see, uh, the link
right there. Um, all right,

225
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,370
so they go speak in a rogue. And you know,
I mentioned when I did his podcast how,

226
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,350
uh, I took a sauna with them afterwards
and he has like a legit sauna, you know,

227
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,720
the ones would like to Kohl's and
shit that you dumped the water on.

228
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,840
So I felt so great after that.

229
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,290
That was kind of Jones and
for another one. So I went
to this fucking place, Audi,

230
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,800
I'm not going to say the name cause I'm
Kinda gonna like not shit on the place,

231
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,260
but it's just more like I,
it was a different kind of
different kinds of sauna,

232
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,203
um,

233
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,360
where Joe's is the old school one that uh,

234
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,570
that like, you know, the heat hits you
from the outside and you sweat like that.

235
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:35,080
I went to one of those infrared ones,
the clear light fucking ones,

236
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,100
which I realize is this whole debate on
whether or not those things are healthy

237
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,110
or not. And they say, yeah, you know,

238
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,840
we checked out the fucking
raise on this thing, it's fine.

239
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,930
And then you're supposed to ask them,
well, how did you measure those rays?

240
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,240
Is there any radiation?
Because they were like this thing,

241
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:53,440
like he eats you from the inside
is the way they described.
And I go, really? I go,

242
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,560
I feel like I'm getting into a
microwave and I got to tell you,

243
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:01,420
I stayed in there for a fucking hour
and when I came out I definitely felt

244
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:05,890
better. But afterwards I didn't feel
right. It just didn't feel right.

245
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:10,870
It wasn't that same peaceful feeling
that I had coming out of the other ones.

246
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,000
So, uh, I didn't like the infrared ones,

247
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,080
although I heard that some Hollywood
starlets that just whereby him,

248
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,050
I guess they use it for weight loss.
And I will tell you, I came out to them.

249
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,210
My stomach was definitely flattered,
but I have these, I'm like,

250
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:26,710
isn't that all water weight?
You know, he'd go out and
have one SAS Barilla there.

251
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:30,850
Your fucking belly comes right back.
Isn't, isn't that how it works? Um,

252
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,130
but anyways, some, uh, going to
go do this, this Europe tour,

253
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:39,900
and I'm hoping to hit a couple of
those places when I'm over there. Um,

254
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,680
this is going to be an unprecedented
road trip for me in that I won't be

255
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,514
drinking.

256
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,090
I don't even know that I'm going to smoke
cigars because I had like fucking 90

257
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,240
over the past week, you know,
catching up with end of the year. Hey,

258
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:54,840
let's get a fucking to go.
Um,

259
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,950
so I won't be smoking cigars.
I got vitamins with me.

260
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,230
I'm going to try to be hitting Saunas
and fucking getting eight hours sleep.

261
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,080
Uh, just cause it my fucking age, man.

262
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,560
I can't be doing like city to
city to city to city, 10 days,

263
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:16,170
two shows almost every fucking night, you
know? Oh my God, I was going to say this,

264
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,370
but by the end of the tour I'm
going to have a fucking cane.

265
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:19,540
I saw a guy last night,

266
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,120
it was people that have fucking
chains and it's just like, dude,

267
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,470
you don't need a fucking chain.

268
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,390
This guy was like walking with his
cane and he would take like three steps

269
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:31,840
before you put the cane down. You know,
it was like watching a point guard,

270
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:34,780
dribbling the ball up the court. Were
you just watching the whole time going?

271
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:38,800
Like the guy's fucking traveling.
If you ever sat on an NBA game,

272
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,270
like you fucking watch these guys,

273
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,070
the bouncing the ball like so fucking
high and he watched him. One, two,

274
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:48,850
three bounce. One, two, three
bounce. One, two, three pounds.
One to bounce, one, two,

275
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,110
three. It's just like,
and she's supposed to,

276
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:53,710
I mean that wasn't really a step and
a half. I Dunno how it fucking works.

277
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,620
I'm done. I'm done pitching about
sports and the way it is nowadays.

278
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,250
I've finally given into the fact that his,

279
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:03,700
his change and speaking of which
my patriots beat the New York jets,

280
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,290
who I was impressed
with their quarterback.

281
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,170
I don't know if he's going to be the
Guy Buddy. Uh, you know, you never know.

282
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,260
It might be coaching, might
be his line. I have no idea.

283
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,300
But he made some good frozen,

284
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,780
there was a lot of fucking heavy
hits by their defense. You know,

285
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,940
they have an another rough
year or whatever, but um,

286
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,420
we handled them.
We got a playoff spot.

287
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,440
We got to buy for the nighttime
nine years in a row we got to buy.

288
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,620
But that fucking mother fucking
stupid ass fucking Dolphin's game now.

289
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,590
Now we're going to have
to go through Casey.

290
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,220
If we win our game and
they win their game. Wait,

291
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:39,940
we're gonna have to go
through Kansas City.

292
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,960
We have to try to beat those fucking
guys again in their own goddamn building.

293
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,130
And, um, I dunno, I don't, I don't,

294
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:52,000
I just don't see that happening with the,
I dunno,

295
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,540
which weird this year we have actually
have a really good running game it seems.

296
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,213
Um,

297
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,220
but it's hard to gauge because we were
playing the jets and they were all banged

298
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:04,600
up on defense. So I don't, I don't really
know where the fuck we stand here, but,

299
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:07,690
um, but who knows. Kansas City,
you know, they also have to win,

300
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,990
which is not something that they've done
in the post season for a long fucking

301
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:15,610
time. But, uh, that my home's guys on a
whole other level and I don't know that,

302
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,090
you know,
Paul Versey made up a great fucking point.

303
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,460
I'm just saying that, you know, I don't,

304
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,940
I think this is the first time Andy
Reid has ever had a quarterback.

305
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,000
I know we had done of and
McNabb and all that shit.

306
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:34,690
But I really think this smart homes guy,
he has that,

307
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,020
he seems to have that you almost have
to be like not human at the end of the

308
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:43,240
game where you just don't feel emotion.

309
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,293
You know,

310
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,140
Bruce, he basically said,
all right, I don't like,

311
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,560
cause I liked him that if he goes, this
is the first time, you know, he had,

312
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,220
he has got a guy like bombs.
He didn't have a guy, you know.

313
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:01,890
Yeah.

314
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,160
You know, he was in Philadelphia and had
a guy who puked in the fucking huddle or

315
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:09,000
whatever. Um, which I don't
know, that's probably overblown.

316
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,580
Oh, who knows. He probably went
to a party the night before,

317
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:16,120
I'm sure fucking Ken Stabler puked
in a couple of fucking huddles.

318
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,740
Um, anyways, and uh,

319
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,690
congratulations to the Cleveland
browns and just a great season. And uh,

320
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,410
I was really pulling for you guys
yesterday just to see you have a winning

321
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,270
season and all that shit. Um, I dunno,

322
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,390
we'll say this is going
to be a great post season.

323
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,820
Of course I'm gonna be overseas and miss
some of it and if my patriots aren't

324
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:41,541
going to win at all,

325
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,960
I almost want us to lose in the first
round just so I can sit there and fucking

326
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:47,840
enjoy it. I know I'm going to enjoy, uh,

327
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,630
the NFC,
um,

328
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,440
playoffs just as far as like, you
know, the saints have home field.

329
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,070
I still don't think drew Brees has ever
gotten the fuck him respect he deserves,

330
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,000
he's one of those guys where he's going
to have to win two to people for people

331
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:06,010
to be oh yeah. But then
again, Elis one, two,

332
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,520
when they're treating him
like a fucking stepchild. Um,

333
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,470
I dunno when the rams were just killing
it the whole season and then they kind

334
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:17,180
of had that little dip there
and now they're kind of back.

335
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,410
But they also played the 40
niners so I dunno. I Dunno.

336
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,920
And then you got Seattle and they got
Pete Carroll's a great fucking coach.

337
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,160
Anything can happen and then
Chicago has that great tea.

338
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:30,740
This is going to be fucking fun.
It's going to be fun.

339
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,080
I always always kind of wondered too,

340
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,090
like what Brady must feel like being
this far into his goddamn career where he

341
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:39,440
must feel like a,

342
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:44,441
a fucking a townie at the bar and
everybody else has kind of gotten on with

343
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:47,300
their lives.
Just looking around the locker room,

344
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:49,520
like where the fuck is
everybody that I used to know?

345
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:54,521
They're all fucking gone and in like
there's no quarterback left in the league

346
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,260
that was playing when he started
out. I mean, I almost think like,

347
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,660
I mean he makes fucking Eli and
drew Brees look like youngsters.

348
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,483
Um,

349
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,520
kind of the way the rolling stones kept
Aerosmith young for so long where they

350
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:17,130
were able to kind of breeze through their
forties, 50s and into their sixties,

351
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,190
because the stones were always
10 years older than them.

352
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:24,900
So everyone was always making the
old jokes with, with them. So, um,

353
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,250
I dunno, and for all you fucking,
uh, Europe counts over there.

354
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:30,900
I did watch Liverpool arsenal,

355
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:34,610
I watched until it was three to
one and then daddy duty took over.

356
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:38,700
Bo Arsenal goes up one to nothing
and I'm thinking, okay, you know,

357
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:42,270
that fucking guy does his little dancey
slides on his knees. And I'm like, Oh,

358
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:44,610
here we go.
Arsenal.

359
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,680
I arsenals actually a team that
I've fucking heard they must be,

360
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,600
they must be one of the good fucking
teams. And then, uh, the Liverpool guys,

361
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,820
they just went right
down the fucking field.

362
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,620
Like fucking three minutes later,
Bam, 90 seconds later, Bam,

363
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:05,740
which you never see in fucking soccer,
football, whatever the hell you call it.

364
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,850
It's the same guy who are, you guys hadn't
scored at all in the premier league?

365
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,380
MMM.
Just weak ass fucking defense.

366
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,080
The one we're most salad kind of fucking
weaved his way through and then made

367
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,420
that sick pass to put the
third goal or something.

368
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,670
When they showed the diff defense
in slow motion, it looks lit.

369
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,920
Literally looked like they were extras
in a movie and mall was like the star

370
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:33,210
that they had to make look good. So they
would do in these halfhearted sort of,

371
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:36,930
I don't know what, trying to get
their foot in the way. It's like,

372
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:39,970
don't they usually just fucking stick a
clean right in the back of your fucking

373
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:44,230
Achilles? I Dunno. I don't know shit
about these Goddamn that God damn sport,

374
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:47,500
but I have been watching
or whatever. Um, all right.

375
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:50,470
Let me read a little bit
of advertising here. Um,

376
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,020
what do we got here? This is,
I'll simply safe everybody.

377
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,880
Don't you want to be simply safe in 2019?
Isn't that where you want to be?

378
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,950
Simply safe? Uh, we all put off doing
things we, we know we need to do.

379
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,760
I mean, we know we need to
do organize the garage or,

380
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,610
yeah,

381
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,620
please personalize your own ideas.

382
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,540
Yeah.
They literally trying to write this.

383
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,400
Yeah.

384
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,370
In my, my fucking, the way I speak,

385
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,970
this is all written like this. We all
put off things we know we need to do.

386
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,390
I mean,
we know we need to organize the garage.

387
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,620
Okay.

388
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,700
But something always gets in the way.
Funny how home security can be like that,

389
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,630
you know? Well, what I
need to organize, um,

390
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,970
I dunno,
I cleaned up my fucking drum room,

391
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,320
change the head on all my drums,
so you know what I actually do.

392
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,710
Yeah.

393
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,620
Moved all the drums out of there and I
brought a little vacuum cleaner and they

394
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:50,910
were, and I, all the fucking,

395
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,290
all the fucking shavings and shit and
broken drum sticks and all that from the,

396
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,380
uh, from the drum sticks, vacuumed
all of that shit up. And, um,

397
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,520
yeah. I don't know what
this has to do with safes,

398
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,240
but that was definitely a personal story.

399
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,590
Funny how some security can be like
that. You know, it's a good idea,

400
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:12,630
but there's always something
holding you back. Well,

401
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:15,840
now it's time to act because
simply safe home security,

402
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:18,660
extended holiday sale ends soon.

403
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:23,250
Simply safe believes nothing should come
between you and protecting your home.

404
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,940
So they've gotten rid of the
reasons not to get home security.

405
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,440
There's no contract,

406
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,910
no price markups from any middleman
and no installation windows.

407
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,150
Who has time for that? Who has
time for that? Most of them. Well,

408
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,890
you're not going to do it.
You can hire somebody to do it.

409
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:39,300
I guess most importantly,

410
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,750
their system is engineered to do
one thing brilliantly protect.

411
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,360
So if a storm takes out power,
simply safe is ready.

412
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,050
If an intruder cuts your phone line,
simply safe is ready.

413
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,800
If they destroy your keypad or a siren,
simply safe.

414
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,070
We'll get you the help you need.
Maybe it's overkill.

415
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,590
Maybe it's the last thing you
want to think about this holiday.

416
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:03,230
But with simply safe,
you're always ready for anything.

417
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:08,231
Just go to simply safe.com/burr and
order January before January 8th to save

418
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:13,130
with their extended holiday sale.
That's simply safe.com/bar hi,

419
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,290
simply safe.com/bar all right.
Simply spelled s, I. M p. L. I.

420
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,010
S. A. F. E has the eye instead of the why.

421
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,260
You know like the way a hot chick
spells her name, you know what I mean?

422
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,980
They always have like the I instead
of a y. You ever notice that?

423
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:32,930
Like have a chick has
the wire in their name.

424
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,340
Then they're just fucking regular looking
like you and you're not intimidated to

425
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:39,050
approach them and fucking
hit on him or whatever.

426
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:42,200
If you're still allowed to do that,
you know,

427
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,770
are you still allowed to do that?
You don't have to. One of my shows,

428
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:48,890
this woman came up to me, she's like,
ah, I just want to give you a hug,

429
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,400
and I just put my hand straight up in the
air and the whole town was like, ah, me,

430
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,900
Toby toe. Oh, I got
there. The whole thing.

431
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,040
That's, that's how I'm handling
every fucking situation like that.

432
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:09,140
I'm literally putting my hands
up like a cop has a gun on me.

433
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,693
Um,

434
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,050
the fuck away from me until they bring
back due process and burden of proof.

435
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,020
That's I'm telling you as a man,
that is the fucking way to go,

436
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:22,760
to stick your hands up in the air until
these fucking lunatics calm the fuck

437
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:27,320
down. And they realize that our judicial
system is the best that the world has to

438
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:29,720
offer and to not do away with.

439
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:33,920
The best fucking thing about it is the
fact that you actually get a fucking,

440
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,720
you know the chance to defend
yourself. You know, even the guilty,

441
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:43,370
get a chance to defend themselves so
that the innocent won't go to jail. They,

455
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:38,630
to Frank's the fucking, uh, the blooms.

week. Oh, you know what I did yesterday?

494
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:04,810
I had a buddy of mine, he's a,
he's a member at a country club.

495
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:05,880
Okay.

496
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,870
Now this is some shit that I would
never do. I would never think to do.

497
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,700
I would never think to join
a country club. I don't golf.

498
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,600
Um, although I watched
this thing on tiger woods,

499
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,643
mmm.

500
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,870
Tiger Woods last night with
some sort of fucking 30 for 30.

501
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,790
Okay.

502
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,520
Basically on his return to
finally winning, you know,

503
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:33,560
his body was all broken down on all that
shit and they came back and he won and

504
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:35,980
other ratings went like
through the roof and all that.

505
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:39,220
It was just fucking awesome
that she was back. And you know,

506
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:42,100
when people love to watch greatness,
if you love to watch greatness,

507
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:45,040
that reflects more on you rather than
the person that you fucking watching.

508
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,230
Cause you just fucking pissed
off about your own life.

509
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,380
Why wouldn't you want to see somebody
go out and be the greatest of all time?

510
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,150
And anyways,
um,

511
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,450
so I went over there to
smoke a cigar and um,

512
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,080
okay.

513
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,810
And I went over there. It
was, it was a fucking utopia.

514
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,730
Like I would literally join a
country club and never play golf.

515
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,030
Yeah.

516
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,500
I went over there. They had all the
NFL Games on, they had all this food,

517
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,450
they were pouring booze the way I pour
booze at home, I call it like a home poor.

518
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,540
They were pouring in like that.

519
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,180
Fortunately I wasn't drinking because
I drove over there and that would have

520
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:29,120
been a situation. It would have to look
left my fucking car there. But, um,

521
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,820
everybody just hanging out break
and fucking balls. It was great.

522
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:36,100
And I gotta be honest with you.
It was nice,

523
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,410
okay.

524
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,850
As a guy to know that that still existed.
It was just fun.

525
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,253
You know,

526
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,000
that's like one of those things that like
feminists go after and it's just like

527
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,980
we're not doing anything wrong.

528
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,730
And then I hung out over there for like
three hours hanging out with all the

529
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:56,790
guys, everybody breaking balls,
telling stories, watching the game,

530
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,290
trying to fucking coach what was on the
TV, smoking cigars, classic Guy Shit.

531
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,800
And then I was done. And then I came
home to my wife and I was psyched.

532
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:08,160
And then it was around this female
energy. It was perfect. It was like,

533
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,430
dare I say balanced and um,

534
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,770
okay.

535
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,040
Do you know how this is this whole
fucking weird thing going on right now,

536
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,760
that if everybody is not included,
meaning both sexes,

537
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,710
that for some reason that means that
there's something wrong about it.

538
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,720
You know, I don't know. I don't
fucking get it. Like, you know,

539
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:34,090
a bunch of women going out
to Brunch is great for them.

540
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,170
They get to be around that. They
totally vibe with that fucking energy.

541
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:41,440
Then after a while, I imagine they,
you know, go onto my fucking dumb guy.

542
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:46,280
I'm with absence, makes the
heart grow fonder, you know,

543
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,870
and I understand to a certain level
where there was just like, you know,

544
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,650
entities and business and schmoozing
and all that that weren't letting,

545
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,990
you know, forget about women but other
races of people and all that, you know,

546
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,120
I'm, I'm, you know,
obviously not down with that.

547
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:06,760
I think everybody ought to be able to
go wherever the fuck they want to go as

548
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:09,040
long as you're not a fucking jerk off,
but I don't,

549
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,480
but I draw the line at that thing where
it's just everything has to have men and

550
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:17,010
women mixed together. I think, uh,

551
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,420
that a lot of shit should, but
I, there's definitely they do it.

552
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:24,610
They should just be some shit that's
just for women. Oh, just for men.

553
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,570
And even then just for men, you know,
when you call you here, I, even,

554
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,770
the way I worded that,

555
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:34,771
I made sure they said just for women
first before these fucking lunatics with,

556
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:38,450
I don't know what the f I've been doing
this bit right now, talking about, um,

557
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,840
how these private schools work.

558
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,480
Okay.

559
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,450
Now where you have to like audition your
kids over there and they're trying to

560
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:51,310
like get this perfect
balance racially and, and,

561
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,920
and gender and all of that.
And it's just like, it's,

562
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,230
it's like their heart
is in the right place,

563
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:01,970
but it just feels like this giant fucking

564
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,310
okay.

565
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,480
Like experiment, like some weird like
Nazi shit. Like what are you doing?

566
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:13,130
What the fuck are we,
the kids just let them be kids and they,

567
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,580
this is all gonna work out
itself. They're trying to, like,

568
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,380
they're trying to curate the,
the painless childhood.

569
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,960
I think that that's
what they're going for.

570
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:27,230
They're going to try to like
have kids have, you know,

571
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,770
a childhood without any pain.
Um,

572
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,220
which I guess then the theory is, is that
then they would go out into the world.

573
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:37,790
Okay.

574
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:42,080
And they wouldn't inflict any pain on
anybody, but it's just like eventually,

575
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,513
you know,

576
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,790
okay,

577
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,070
you got to go out in the real
world and this is going to be pain.

578
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,610
There's going to be
disappointment, there's gonna
be people stealing your shit,

579
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,650
and you're going to have to
know how to deal with that.

580
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:54,970
And that's kind of like what school is.

581
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:56,740
You learn how to stand up
to bullies and all that.

582
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:59,080
I'm not saying the kid should go to
school and have a miserable fucking

583
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:02,050
experiences, but like there is like
a certain element of it that you got,

584
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:03,880
you gotta let him fucking
handle it themselves.

585
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,413
Right.

586
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,890
The only way that you could possibly,

587
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:11,780
okay.

588
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,710
I don't know how it would work.

589
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:16,700
You would have to get rid of all the
sociopaths in all the selfish fucking

590
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,620
people in the world first.
He would literally have to,

591
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:19,670
and you'd have to kill them.

592
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,610
This whole fucking thing that you're
going to stick them on a fucking island.

593
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,210
He ended,

594
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,650
all they're gonna do is just fuck each
other and make like fucking roided up

595
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,420
sociopath's selfish people.

596
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:32,480
And then eventually one of them is going
to not to make a boat and then that's

597
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:33,021
going to be yet,

598
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:35,540
then they're going to come over and
we're all going to be over here like,

599
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:39,790
you know, puts you right
in, take your right hand up,

600
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,770
fucking singing the Hokey pokey and
weren't going to get steamrolled.

601
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,150
You like how I put myself not on the
island. You like, I want that story.

602
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:50,060
I was the fucking hero and I wasn't,
I wasn't a selfish cunt.

603
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,620
Like I wouldn't be over
there. Um, I dunno.

604
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,950
It is, it is weird. But, uh, I already
know what I'm going to do. I'm going to,

605
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm going to, uh, get my daughter
enrolled in some sort of like a,

606
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,410
you know, anti bully,
Jujitsu fucking Shit,

607
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:10,290
just so my daughter knows how to
handle herself and then that's it.

608
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,310
And then just make sure you don't
abuse the skill set that you now have.

609
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,550
And if anybody comes out, yeah.
You know, you fucking handle it.

610
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,970
It gives you confidence and then you
don't have to spend your whole fucking

611
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,360
childhood in this depressive fog of
dreading going to school and shit.

612
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:26,671
You know,

613
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:29,760
and I think back as some of the periods
I went through and some of this shit,

614
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,970
some other kids that I picked on went
through, I'd fucking, it was like, Oh man,

615
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:33,804
that's,
that's,

616
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,730
that's why I'm surprised too that like
teachers intervene a little bit more,

617
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,450
not to the point that they're doing it
now to the point that they're doing it

618
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:46,860
now, where they're just fucking like
a, it's almost like reverse Hitler

619
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,930
where everyone is included,
but they're also deciding like,

620
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,710
who is the number one draft
pick? There's still, you know,

621
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,940
boxing out other people. It's weird.
It's just a really fucking weird,

622
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,420
I dunno, it's just such a weird God
damn time. All right. That's, that's it.

623
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,540
When my little fucking
pontificating there. Let's, uh,

624
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,130
let's do a little bit of the, uh, some
of the reeds here for the week. Um,

625
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:21,340
all right. What do we got here?
Who as far as twos first? Um,

626
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,800
yeah.

627
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,130
All right. Good Times. Bad Times. How
I learned. Hey Billy Bass drum balls.

628
00:36:28,131 --> 00:36:31,520
I learned good times,
bad times when I was 12 or 13.

629
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,590
You mother fucker.
Thanks to my drum teacher.

630
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,570
No, that's awesome man. He taught me,

631
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,810
he'll doubt he taught
me heel down technique.

632
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,370
It showed me that the trick to getting
those fast flutter kicks was to move your

633
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:51,200
foot halfway down the pedal. Your heel
should be completely off the pedal.

634
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,120
Oh yeah. I've seen that. You
just slide up and down. Uh,

635
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:58,520
this counteracts the spring tension and
helps you play faster at the expense of

636
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:02,540
power. Oh, at the expense
of power. All right.

637
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,070
Eventually by doing this enough,

638
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:08,110
you will be able to play those
flutters without this. Uh,

639
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,460
okay.

640
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,570
Without this trek. Uh, it's like
training wheels. If you play heal up,

641
00:37:13,571 --> 00:37:17,200
you should be able to make the swivel
technique work. It's a valuable trick.

642
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:21,670
I have tab up your sleeve
and you don't lose any punch.

643
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,570
I've included a link on how to
do it if you aren't too sure.

644
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,070
I also recommend playing cashmere is a
warmup before jumping into good times,

645
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:34,520
bad times. He does some slower flutter
kicks that will loosen you up. I hope.

646
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,423
Uh,

647
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,710
okay.

648
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,220
I hope I could help you on happy
new year and go fuck yourself. Um,

649
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:43,850
what I learned finally because
I was doing it the wrong way,

650
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,050
the first way I did it before I took
any drum lessons. When I would do it,

651
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:51,000
I would do this weird thing, what
I would curl my toe down. Yeah.

652
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,950
Push. And then almost like I
was almost doing that slide,

653
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:58,520
move with like my toes and I got
plantar Fisher, I to my foot.

654
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,790
My technique was so bad that
my drum teacher was teaching
me his technique and I

655
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:07,370
didn't understand it. And then I didn't
go in for a while and I learned it.

656
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:12,050
I was almost doing like a reverse slide.
Like I was,

657
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:15,320
I was bringing my foot back
and that was the slide.

658
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:18,500
And then pushing forward down.
Um,

659
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,110
okay.

660
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,300
So the first one was like,

661
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:27,220
light was almost like an unaccented
beat. So it was like, Duh, Duh,

662
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,300
Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. And then another time
I was doing it, the first one was louder.

663
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,640
It was like Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh.

664
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,020
And it never sounded even so
the way he just taught me,

665
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,990
which is it was,

666
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,780
has been a total game changer in like
the last fucking three days I've been

667
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:44,860
messing with this shit

668
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,810
is all right, I play a
DW drum pedal. All right?

669
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,700
So when you just play in a
single, the Bali of, first of all,

670
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:58,610
you sit back and he should be able
to see your ankles a little bit.

671
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,830
I was sitting too close,
so my,

672
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:05,600
my knee was directly above my foot
and that was fucking with, you know,

673
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,870
my technique and they was in the
own past up to a certain tempo.

674
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,810
It was getting in the way.
So we had me move back,

675
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:14,900
which felt really fucking weird
at first and now it feels great.

676
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,760
So basically if you were playing a
single, you felt you're just, you know,

677
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:24,230
lift your leg up and boom, come right down
on the DW. But when you play, hang on,

678
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:28,880
oh fuck. Hang on. She's coming
in the island. All right.

679
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:31,760
The lovely knee is here. Let me, I've
got to finish, explain something here.

680
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:36,170
How are you, you know, your shirt oddly
matches the, uh, the windscreen there.

681
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,900
Yeah. Um, so anyways, the windscreen
that I use when I'm inside, so anyway,

682
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:44,030
it's self, you're playing a single,
you just lift your foot up and hot air,

683
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:45,200
you're blowing and that's right.

684
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,350
You bring it right down on the DW,
but then if you're going to play a double,

685
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,910
all you do is you slide your foot back
where you are right below the nine,

686
00:39:55,911 --> 00:40:00,010
I played the 9,000. So if you play the
5,000 right below the five and then you,

687
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:02,480
you just bring your foot down
like you're playing a single.

688
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:06,320
So that first one is
strong. Okay. Like a single.

689
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,350
And then as,
as you know,

690
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,710
and you let the beat or come off the head
and you catch the rebound as you slide

691
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:17,210
it up and then they're both
strong in both even. Um,

692
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,490
and sound powerful.
Yeah,

693
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,850
it was just a completely different thing.

694
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:25,620
And what I ended up doing at
a slow tempo was just play.

695
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,660
Um, like in my time a dime, not
playing 16th on the high hat,

696
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,100
I was just playing dumb

697
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:37,200
boom Bopa debt, but bump up on
debt, gone to the tech boom,

698
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,580
boom, bump the tempo,
something like that, whatever.

699
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,540
So it makes sense to drummers.
Okay,

700
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,681
sends to drama.

701
00:40:45,681 --> 00:40:50,440
So what's is key and that it was what I
being played like the immigrant song is

702
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:52,510
if you're playing singles and doubles,

703
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,360
you get that muscle memory
that if you play in a single,

704
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:58,720
you just keep your foot up at the top of
the pedal and then when you played the

705
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:00,400
double you B,
you're bringing it back.

706
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:03,160
And what happens is your muscle
memory is as you're playing,

707
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,980
whatever the fuck you playing right
before that first note of the double,

708
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:08,710
your foot's already moving back into
position and be the same thing if you're

709
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:10,900
playing a double pedal where after what?

710
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,240
Like when you first go from
a single to a double pedal,

711
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,960
that the fucking brain power that you
have to use to move your left foot from

712
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:20,980
the high hat over to the slave pedal if
you play a double pedal is like fucking

713
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,230
ridiculous.
But then after awhile you just,

714
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,920
your foot just knows to
just sort of just slide,

715
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:30,640
just to come over that, you
know, literally four inches.

716
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,350
But when you first start out, it's kind
of the same. Things like that. All right,

717
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,170
I'm done.
Sorry

718
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,930
Nia,
you literally just fucking glazed over.

719
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:38,900
Like probably 80% of the
people sit upon boom,

720
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,620
boom gap. Now. Those were all single

721
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,360
bull tap, boom, a wound,

722
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,420
whatever. It's soundproof.
It's something that I do.

723
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:58,610
It's something you should have. Good.
They sound it. You can't hear it.

724
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,300
Can you hear it? No, I can't hear it
from the house now. Yeah. Perfect.

725
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,410
That's fucking perfect. So how are you,
how was your Christmas? It was lovely.

726
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:10,010
How's your Christmas? It was
wonderful. How was your New Year?

727
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:12,620
You're doing Christmas?
Yes we did.

728
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,800
Or Cutie Pie still doesn't
get the whole concept.

729
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:18,320
She was more into like
opening the presence.

730
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,560
She liked the opening and the
ripping of the wrapping paper.

731
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,430
But after that she was like
done. Yes she was. She was like,

732
00:42:25,431 --> 00:42:30,290
no point has no present, no present.
So that was that. So when I also love,

733
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,430
what does she call the Christmas tree?
Mcmurtry momentary like Christmas tree.

734
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:36,110
She was like, Mama, Mama,

735
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,350
she's so manipulative already and now
she knows how to get you, you know,

736
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:49,070
cause she knows how desperate we are for
her affection and her hugs and kisses.

737
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:53,210
So she just uses that. They know that
already, don't they? Yeah, absolutely.

738
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:54,021
So it's like,
you know,

739
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:57,290
she'll ask for something that she knows
she's not supposed to have and I'm like,

740
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:00,290
no, you can't have that. The Sonata.
And she'll wear me down. I'll be like,

741
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:05,120
all right, you can have a little,
she almost, you go mama, please Mama.

742
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,210
Or She sees that I'm about to do it.
I've given it.

743
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,030
And she rushes over and gives me
a kiss and a hug. So I was like,

744
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:15,170
she just knows she knows what to do.
So what's happening over here?

745
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:19,510
On the old a podcast, they attract
suit. Um, oh, I'm loving this tracksuit,

746
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,800
tracksuit, tracksuit, got bill all the,

747
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:26,510
a couple of tracks suits for Christmas
because it's just like what he likes to

748
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:30,810
live in slash travel in.
So you really never do what,

749
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,440
what's verse he's been
telling me to do forever.

750
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:37,650
And I never had always had like track
pants on and stuff at the airport and like

751
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,210
a zip up. No, cause you know
what happens is because I,

752
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,870
I forget my wallet or phone,
most of them don't have back pockets.

753
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,440
That was that time I went to the airport
and I missed my flight because I had my

754
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:53,830
phone in my front pocket and I wasn't
even thinking I didn't have my wallet and

755
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,860
I didn't have my license.

756
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,410
And then I had a flight fucking private
that costs me a zillion dollars. That's,

757
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,170
it was an afternoon gig. Yeah. So I get
super paranoid and then I don't like,

758
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,970
I don't like sweatpants when I fly because
shit just slides out of your pockets

759
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,720
and then your wallet goes underneath
the seats if somebody has to find the

760
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:15,950
fucking thing. So, um,
but other than that,

761
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:18,080
they're great to fly in. So
I just, you know something,

762
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:22,470
I put it in the the hopefully, yes.
See these don't have zipper pockets.

763
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,700
Yes.
So this is a very vulnerable,

764
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,330
this is like the thing that the Gypsies
over there and you're not supposed to

765
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:33,540
say Gypsies by the way. I don't
know what, see if that's no offense.

766
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,050
I don't think so.
I think you're,

767
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:40,110
you're not supposed to say I got gypped
anymore cause I think that's offensive.

768
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,990
Um, Gypsies, Gypsies,

769
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,330
but I actually like you're not
supposed to call them. I don't know.

770
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:53,200
Isn't there a TV show called like
Gypsy nation or something? I Dunno.

771
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,410
I think Gypsy's is fine.

772
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,860
But maybe you associate them with like
pick pocketing and being scammers or you

773
00:45:01,051 --> 00:45:03,630
mean like what happened to us
when we were over there is rude

774
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,690
and you're not supposed to say that.

775
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,880
You're not supposed to say what the
fuck is happening. No. All right,

776
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:11,431
well then fine.

777
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,950
I don't need to get involved in this
cause I'm going to fucking eastern Europe

778
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:19,000
of right, exactly. Probably
lay off the old gray,

779
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:22,140
the harmful history of gypsy.

780
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,680
This is on bitch media.
So I don't think that this is going to be

781
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,500
what is with all these fucking people
asking for money. All right. Uh,

782
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,660
as a Romanian woman,
right,

783
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,250
more often called by the racial slur
gypsy, I didn't know that was a,

784
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,520
that's a racial slur. Yeah. I, I feel
like I learned that a couple of years ago,

785
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,950
but I'm,
but I watch TV networks,

786
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,100
original Siri Gypsy with some trepidation.

787
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,060
The show is a psychological
thriller for the most part,

788
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:55,260
without many thrills, but blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

789
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,770
He watched show that I watched two
episodes and then for the show takes its

790
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:03,771
inspiration from Stevie Nicks Song Gypsy
about a free spirited woman who loves

791
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,930
and disappears.
So to me that's what a gypsy was.

792
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,670
A Gypsy was just the nomadic person.

793
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:12,330
Like I didn't know any of this shit
about pickpocket and all that shit.

794
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,160
The mythos. So he said, oh,

795
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:20,370
the gyms is of the Gypsy is a
steward stereotype. The thief,

796
00:46:20,371 --> 00:46:24,750
the Fortune Teller, the free
spirit, the seductress and the liar.

797
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,820
And Jean hits all of them,

798
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,410
rebranding them as characteristics
of a wealthy white woman.

799
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,500
Just trying to find herself. That's
kind of true. Wait, what's that song?

800
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,010
Gypsy was, man, what's that? What's
that song that's from the said no,

801
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,710
it's witchy woman.
Oh,

802
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,610
you're so racist against gypsy.
You're throwing that word in. Wow.

803
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,970
I'm not, no, I, you know, I tried
to be sensitive to stuff like that.

804
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,910
Oh,

805
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,080
what is it now? It's witchy
woman. Ooh. Where'd you

806
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,060
Ooh,

807
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,840
it's not gypsy.
We'll see how

808
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,070
you obviously know the lyrics more than
I do. Well I think just for, you know,

809
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,070
just don't call anybody a
gypsy. Alright, I'll try it.

810
00:47:14,071 --> 00:47:15,870
If I have a Stevie nicks song,

811
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:20,871
the Romanian people are an oppressed
ethnic minority who's disparate roots date

812
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:23,040
back to the 10th century,

813
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:28,070
India and are currently in the midst
of century long human rights crisis.

814
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,990
See now it's interesting to me cause they

815
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,020
have their own country because
of Romania. Right? Don't they?

816
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:34,100
Isn't that their own country?

817
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,250
I feel like everything that I'm saying
is fucking offending somebody here.

818
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,130
Probably who,
who are who

819
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,680
passing them? Um, I don't know. I mean,

820
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:47,820
I know Russia controlled a lot of that
part. Can we blame them? The Russians,

821
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,670
can we blame them? They're like, you
can blame the Russians and it's okay.

822
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,560
I don't know.
Probably not long

823
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,681
when rights crisis,

824
00:47:56,681 --> 00:48:01,681
one part is one that is
in part perpetuated by the
stereotypes of the Gypsies

825
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,120
yet almost no one but the,

826
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,800
but the Roman themselves are pushing
back on the series title slur,

827
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,580
the writing to the network and producers
are creating petition to change the

828
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:14,890
show's title along with simple ignorance.

829
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,920
Anti Romanian sentiment is so normalized
that in 2017 a premiere streaming

830
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:24,931
service can release a show that takes an
actual racial slur and its title and no

831
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:28,660
one bats an eyelash. Well, in
defense of Netflix over here,

832
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,330
Gypsy sort of a cool,
hey man,

833
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:34,660
like I'm not stuck in the matrix
kind of thing like over here.

834
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,530
It doesn't mean that

835
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,310
like I never thought like Gypsy
yet was definitely fortune teller.

836
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,820
It was us and then I then think of
like a just a frisk, bearded hippy.

837
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,880
I would like growing up,

838
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:52,440
you hear like a gypsy person that
someone who is, you know, yeah.

839
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,090
Doing like scams and stuff.

840
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:58,050
So you heard that I didn't
even know I associated it with,

841
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,870
and then we'll either go to
Europe and people were like,

842
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,240
be careful of the Gypsies,
a Rabi let you know what I mean.

843
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:08,220
And then I didn't know that Gypsies
were an af actual ethnicity. Right.

844
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,970
I just thought it was like a hippie.
Anybody can be a fucking hippie man.

845
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:14,460
And you get a tambourine and grow your
fucking hair and smoke a little grass and

846
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:16,130
all of a sudden the hippie and all this.
Yeah.

847
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,880
All of a sudden you're in the drum
drum culture. Right? That's not it.

848
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,560
That's not inferior in a drum
circle and hippie. But I'm
no bro. No, no, no, no, no,

849
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:25,500
no, no. But I'm saying, I thought
Gypsy was like that. Well, I could,

850
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,010
I could become a hippie if I've got some
hair transplants and started smoking

851
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:32,850
some weed man. And just did
you know, wearing Birkenstocks.

852
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:36,300
I could be considered a hippie. I didn't
know that it was an ethnicity. Right.

853
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,580
So we're learning something here.
Wait,

854
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,820
would you ever get one of those
scalp Taiwan? Let you do it.

855
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:45,060
One of those scalps what did they call it?
Scalp transplants.

856
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:50,000
Like the Tattoo Scalp. Oh yeah, no, it's,

857
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,520
that's different than a scalp
transplant off a murderer.

858
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,080
And then I have even more of a temper.

859
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,490
I can help transplant scouts or has flat,

860
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,570
uh, yeah, I forgot what
it's called. Anyway, someone
else people don't follow on.

861
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,220
Instagram does it for people.

862
00:50:05,221 --> 00:50:09,330
Like it's a new thing that he started to
do and he calls it like the scalp shop

863
00:50:09,331 --> 00:50:11,790
or something. And so I was
watching a video of the process.

864
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,700
It's not a new thing that's been
around for a while. Oh, it has.

865
00:50:14,701 --> 00:50:19,530
I know it's a Tatsu. Yeah, I knew a guy
that did it is a, it's permanent then.

866
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,160
No, it actually fades. You supposed
to keep your head out of the light.

867
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,790
But what it looks like, it ends up
looking like I have a full head of hair,

868
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,020
but just tried to shape

869
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,370
a, decided to shave it down. It's not
like a five o'clock shadow on your head.

870
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,860
Yeah. But then what? This
is what's weird to me.

871
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:35,900
It's like now I got to shake
my head every fucking day.

872
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,650
A variety because that is going to
be weird because then the stumbled,

873
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:42,530
the real hair is going to be coming
up and then the rest of the shit,

874
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:47,660
I think you can go like a day or two
before it starts looking stupid. Yeah,

875
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,890
I know. I am not a, I am not a big
believer in fucking with nature.

876
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,310
Okay. So if, if nature has matrix

877
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,673
then letting you know,

878
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:02,290
play the hand that you're dealt and
you, you play it to the best. Right.

879
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,620
So I keep myself in shape. I grew the
beard, I just shaved it off and you know,

880
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,400
this is who I am talking about
shaving your beard off the other day.

881
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:15,140
And I was just like, why would you ever
do that? Because I miss my face. Oh Jesus.

882
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,070
Nia, you may be familiar,
familiar with the word Jip,

883
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,870
which means to cheat someone
right as a gypsy would.

884
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:28,040
It's a slur as obviously
offensive as Jew down.

885
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,630
And yet people still say it.
Say what you down,

886
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,170
you never heard that you grew
up in Massachusetts for awhile?

887
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,470
I mean I lived there until I was like sex.

888
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:40,930
I grew up in Atlanta once you would think.
Yeah,

889
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,953
yeah,

890
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,450
I know there,
there are Jewish people,

891
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:48,140
they got tails like they went to a whole
other level down there and yet people

892
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:51,170
still say in everyday
and everyday combination.

893
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:56,171
Imagine replacing Gypsy Gypsy as the
show title with another ethnic slur.

894
00:51:56,241 --> 00:52:00,860
The show would never have been made and
yet gypsy was made riding on the back of

895
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:04,550
their romantic popularization of the
world of fashion, beauty and social media.

896
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:05,750
Yet that's how I view it.

897
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,180
No. So I guess I will stop
saying gypsy. Yeah. And sobs.

898
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,010
I will say Romanian

899
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,490
we speak. Speaking of tails,
cause you mentioned tales earlier.

900
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:22,290
Did you see that video on Twitter?

901
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,210
Ooh,

902
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,690
Romanian woman?
No.

903
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:31,010
Did you see that video on Twitter
of the raccoon? This is in Florida.

904
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:36,410
Raccoon. You know Mike, one of my least
favorite animals, like attacking a lizard,

905
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,110
like one of those big
fucking lizards and like,

906
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:42,350
like chasing it through a
parking lot. Oh my God, man.

907
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:43,610
The heebie jeebies just thinking about it,

908
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,210
chasing it through a parking lot and
just like thinking it's like tea than to

909
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:51,350
its neck and just holding it down and
then like dragging it out of frame and

910
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:55,610
then the person pans over to what looks
like a snake flapping around and you're

911
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:58,730
just like, what the fuck is going
on? Then you realize it's the tail.

912
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,470
It's the Lizard's tale that has somehow
gotten like away from the lizards body

913
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:06,350
and it's still flapping around on its own.
It's the most spots of video.

914
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:10,430
Everett's and I love nature video
watching. I fucking hate falls.

915
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:15,600
It's so, I don't hate
reptiles. Ooh, regret

916
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,100
rub. Can you imagine calling
your show reptiles a yes.

917
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,860
Did I come in here to answer
a question or no? No, no.

918
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:27,380
I to see a raccoon

919
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,630
verse Lizard. Yeah. Florida.

920
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:37,790
Cause you know all that shit
always happens. Oh yeah.
Florida is fucking crazy.

921
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,930
Raccoon kills a Guana and Guana.
Oh Man,

922
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:46,550
I like Iguanas AG.
You're bound to get your heartbroken.

923
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,940
Oh No. Oh yes. Oh I like, Rudolph was

924
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,480
so brutal,
Dude.

925
00:53:56,481 --> 00:54:00,200
What the fuck does Gordon Ramsay have
to do with the goddamn lizard eat. Oh,

926
00:54:00,201 --> 00:54:04,070
I see. He's fixing these people's
restaurant. That's hilarious.

927
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,570
Do my favorite part about him going to
his restaurants is when Gordon Ramsay

928
00:54:08,571 --> 00:54:12,410
starts gagging. Right. There's always
something in the fucking freezer.

929
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,640
No, it smells that bed when
they have meat from like, yeah,

930
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,350
2002 when there, yeah. Oh my
God. He one time, like he,

931
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,170
I thought he was just acting and then
the camera man almost puked. I was like,

932
00:54:24,171 --> 00:54:27,830
Oh wow, that's real.
[inaudible]. Here we go. Oh No.

933
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,440
Oh No.
He's going,

934
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,373
oh,

935
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:36,620
should I stop the fight?

936
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:37,970
No.

937
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,230
Yeah, he's dead. Let him go dog.

938
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,370
Where the fuck did that?
God Damn

939
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,093
Holy.

940
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,633
It's on a basis,

941
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,523
please.

942
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,753
Sure.

943
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,100
Oh Jesus Christ. Let me ask
you this question. Who Does?

944
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,920
Nobody has an Iguana in flips a pet,
so we just let that thing go.

945
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,340
Hmm. Well, you just saw was how
long I would last in prison.

946
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:10,710
You know?

947
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:15,470
I was really like that guy was saying
that fucking lizard did not have a goddamn

948
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,900
chance. Yeah. It's not
natural to fucking Florida.

949
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,640
Somebody got sick of feed
nick grasshoppers and it,

950
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,050
it is let it go and then it got eaten by
a fuck. You might not lizard been like,

951
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:26,490
what in the fuck is this thick?

952
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:30,720
You would survive in prison based
on your windows and your yeah.

953
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:35,721
Well no because you like have so much
anger inside of you that you would be able

954
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:39,450
to channel it and you'd be able
to like the funny like killer guy.

955
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:43,700
He'll make you laugh but all
he'll make you cry. No, sorry.

956
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,560
I was thinking I've learned
from anybody in prison.

957
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:49,980
It's just like some of the
toughest fucking guys I
haven't met. They were like,

958
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:54,060
do not go in there acting like you're the
toughest fucking guy cause you're not.

959
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,780
Who has conversations like this?

960
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,070
Like why do you even think about like
how you would do in prison? Like are you,

961
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:02,370
is there something that
you need to tell me? No,

962
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:05,910
it's just she just watched those things.
They made some fucking option. Yeah.

963
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,120
Can happen.

964
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,170
I never think about that and everything
about how would I do in prison.

965
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,190
Even your privileged
world. Oh here we go. Wait.

966
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:18,270
But I want to say something about the,
um, we'll try to say, oh wait, wait, wait.

967
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,840
So that guy on the video was saying,
oh, should I break up the fight?

968
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:23,580
Should I stop it? And I said, no,

969
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:27,630
I don't understand why people where
people feel like they need to get like

970
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:30,910
involved in nature and nature. I was
reading this article, I saw that.

971
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,350
What do you mean?
Because whoever,

972
00:56:34,351 --> 00:56:39,351
I probably fucking bought that Lizard
to Florida was a white person on some

973
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:44,090
levels. Guessing. Well, I'm just saying
like sometimes you just have to let,

974
00:56:44,091 --> 00:56:47,480
I left this comment on New York,
the New York magazine Instagram page,

975
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:52,580
because they had a whole article about
how seals are snorting eels, seals,

976
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:55,730
sea lions are snorting eels as like this.
They're like,

977
00:56:55,731 --> 00:56:59,030
they're young and they snore them.
It's like for fun or something like that.

978
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:02,870
And someone left a comment like, oh,
I hope whoever took that picture,

979
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:06,980
like put the camera down
and like intervenes and like
help that poor sea lion.

980
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,580
And I was like, sometimes you've just got
to let nature nature wait, wait, wait,

981
00:57:10,581 --> 00:57:14,170
wait, wait. This snorting,
they're snorting yields. Wait,

982
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,970
you have to Google as sea
lions are snorting eels,

983
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,160
like following like a line of coke.
Yes.

984
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:23,150
And there's a picture of a snail with
like a sea lion or the very satisfied look

985
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:27,980
on his face with an eel up its nose.
That's just what they're doing now.

986
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:31,060
I don't know why, but
someone was like, oh,

987
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,270
somebody should intervene and pull it out
and just let nature do what it's gonna

988
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,710
do. Planking or like throwing the
water bottle and having it land. Yeah,

989
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:42,910
they were little Instagram. Yeah, that's
exactly what scientists were saying.

990
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,221
They like,

991
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:46,520
it's a new thing that they just apparently
are just doing for fun because they

992
00:57:46,521 --> 00:57:49,070
can do so it's like just let them smart.

993
00:57:49,071 --> 00:57:52,430
Like you don't have to get involved to
like seal. Like why? What does, I dunno.

994
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,870
I don't understand that impulse to
intervene when nature is nature occurring,

995
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,030
people are control freaks.

996
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,350
It's one thing if you see iot
attacking your cat or dog of course.

997
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:04,540
But I mean if it's,

998
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:09,410
if it has sea lion and the eel or an
Iguana and a flush of what you're saying,

999
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:15,030
you're saying that a dog and a cat is
more of an animal worth saving than a

1000
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:20,980
lizard or an eel. One of them
is that his animals, racism,

1001
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:26,050
animal phobic. Speciesism you're wild
a phobic. You don't like wild animals.

1002
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,210
No, I'm saying if they're in the wild
and they're doing their thing, just let,

1003
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:32,380
let them do what they're going to do.
Why do you need to get involved and like,

1004
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:36,610
oh, how do you decide whose side to
beyond just because the iguanas losing,

1005
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,540
all of a sudden you're anti the
raccoon like you know, go lighter skin.

1006
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,950
You pick the lighter skin analog.
Okay.

1007
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,870
Repairing electronics. All right,
so I'm not saying Gypsy anymore.

1008
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:52,460
My apologies to a Romanian people.
Yeah, you don't have that screwed,

1009
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,040
but then that's saying
offensive prostitutes.

1010
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:00,840
I'm going to say like boxes or something.
No carpenters.

1011
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,480
All right on on. He screwed
me. Hey, I've been a carpenter

1012
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,580
on repairing electronics.
Hello Bill.

1013
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,570
You mentioned in a previous podcast
that you like getting your electronics

1014
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:15,820
repaired and even knew
a guy that did that.

1015
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:20,590
It's amazing with a quick youtube video,
people can repair their own products.

1016
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,100
Well guess what apple

1017
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:26,920
like always is that one company that
likes to shit all over that they seize

1018
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,440
shipments with quality third parties,

1019
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:35,890
party parts from these repair shops
because they want you to pay the 800 plus

1020
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,540
she would otherwise be saving.
Wow.

1021
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,860
Trusted repair shops get
third party parts illegal.

1022
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,090
But apple likes legally sorry,

1023
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,710
but apple likes to have customers hold
them from these guys and make them pay

1024
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:52,670
obnoxious fees to receive the packages.
When you have the time,

1025
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:57,200
take a look at this short video. You know,
we should ask the pys. It goes too far.

1026
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,980
Are Our electronics are parents
like our computers and stuff?

1027
01:00:00,981 --> 01:00:04,130
We should ask them about that.
You know what?

1028
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,000
We found a repairman who uh,

1029
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,850
just fixed our stove and it's fucking
amazing. He, what did you say?

1030
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:15,350
He made that stuff is bad. He did. He
took the whole thing apart. So now we had,

1031
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:15,680
we had,

1032
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,680
we have a 10 year old Viking stove that
is now 2018 it's basically a resto mod.

1033
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:24,650
If you were into cars,
which is if you had an 1965 whatever,

1034
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:28,160
and on top it looks like 1965 oh wait,
so it doesn't do,

1035
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,090
it doesn't do that anymore when
I wish you wouldn't either.

1036
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,480
I don't have time to watch this,
but I'm definitely going to watch this.

1037
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,493
It's called a,

1038
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:41,570
the name of this video is apple under
fire for allegation of controversial

1039
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:46,130
business practices. Did you
get this for the baby? Oh wait,

1040
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,840
is this yours? Oh yeah, I was going
to give that the Bert Kreischer,

1041
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,880
I forgot that is a Florida state half
shirt that I bought in 1981 or 82 and

1042
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,860
never wore it.
I crop top.

1043
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:02,720
I never wore vintage Florida
state crop top half shirt.

1044
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,720
Crop top. No, they'll call
the half shirts back then.

1045
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:09,530
You're going to give it to
time for Chrysler? Yeah. Wow.

1046
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,470
Can he fit like an arm in
here? No, I didn't realize
it's a small, you know what?

1047
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:19,490
Yeah, I'd like to see you
wear that now. So not an owl.

1048
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,120
You know what shape it is,
what it is.

1049
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,070
I think you were also,

1050
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:30,071
you mentioned your DVD or Blu Ray player
didn't have HD m I for your new TV you

1051
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:32,410
can buy in RCA to HTM.

1052
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:37,430
I converted for a couple of bucks to plug
in an old video equipment or our GB to

1053
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:39,860
HD.
M I depending on what you have,

1054
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,480
RCA is the red is the cable with red,
white and yellow.

1055
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,070
RGB is the cable with red,

1056
01:01:46,071 --> 01:01:50,240
green and blue as this is a real
fucking nerdy ass podcast today, Huh?

1057
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:55,870
No, this asshole.

1058
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:00,590
Ooh, bitchy will bay. Watch it.

1059
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:04,310
Watch it all. We got time to
read two more here. Home Sauna.

1060
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,590
Merry Christmas, Billy. Big Balls.

1061
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,950
Merry Christmas to you and yours and
I hope you're having a lovely restful

1062
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:13,940
festive break. I just wanted to
weigh in on your home saunas.

1063
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:18,980
Som Sana comments. I couldn't remember.
I couldn't recommend getting one more.

1064
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,700
I live in west Wales and
built a sauna three years ago.

1065
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:26,540
It's the perfect way to level your body
and mind three times a week is perfect,

1066
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:27,650
but I generally do to,

1067
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:32,860
the best way I found is 15 minutes in
the sauna to a cold shower out cold

1068
01:02:33,411 --> 01:02:37,880
outdoor shower, three repeat steps
one and two, three times and all.

1069
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:38,600
Uh,

1070
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,800
the level of chill I have afterwards can
only otherwise be obtained by illegal

1071
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:43,760
means.
It's awesome.

1072
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:47,210
I'm telling you any of this is going to
help us if I get something like this.

1073
01:02:47,211 --> 01:02:52,040
Looking forward to seeing
you in Manchester. I fucking
love Manchester. Okay. Yeah,

1074
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,570
they are like, I went to,
I went there. I was like,

1075
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:56,750
these guys are like the same kind of
fucking lunatics I remember in Boston.

1076
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,880
Same thing, Paul breaking,
drinking, fucking I love it. Uh,

1077
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:04,670
and I'm thinking Liverpool's going to
be the same way in all like all up to

1078
01:03:04,671 --> 01:03:06,380
there. I'm not doing a
new castle, I don't think,

1079
01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:11,030
but I just feel like all up there is that
type of shit where London is more like

1080
01:03:11,031 --> 01:03:14,960
Manhattan, where it's all
refined oils, real phones. Uh,

1081
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,240
thanks for bringing up my
workweek and look after yourself.

1082
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,450
I would love to figure out a way to do
this. I just don't have the room here.

1083
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,390
What's wrong with the steam though?
That's different from, well,

1084
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:29,080
a sauna you can go way harder
because with steam it's, it's,

1085
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,920
it's so wet.
Like I mean is steam.

1086
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:35,570
You can actually sit in a sauna it like
close to 200 degrees and if you were in

1087
01:03:35,571 --> 01:03:40,550
a sauna where it was just all, all
on Asana, fucking steam. Yeah. Yeah.

1088
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:43,910
You literally be getting to the point
where the water on you was getting close

1089
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:47,510
to starting to boil. You
know, he could burn yourself.
I never understood. This is,

1090
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,980
and this is also me speaking,

1091
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,640
just trying to remember repeating
what people were talking about Saunas,

1092
01:03:52,641 --> 01:03:56,540
but I am sold on them. Um, to the point.

1093
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:59,210
There's one I know that,
you know, maybe we could go,

1094
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,250
maybe we can go take a sauna
today if you want it to.

1095
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,710
And they have like the Finnish one,
not like finish. I'm done like Finland.

1096
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,400
And then also they're known for that shit.
Yeah.

1097
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:12,110
Although recently just had a competition.
So many fucking died over there.

1098
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,020
I'm like sitting in like hot they hot box.

1099
01:04:15,021 --> 01:04:17,360
You can't say I didn't try.

1100
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,530
I would try but I don't know.

1101
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:23,040
I said has never been my thing to just
like sit in like wow, I'm very hot.

1102
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,540
My things just sit in the hot.

1103
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:33,230
The old hot box. I like to hotbox
to sit in the hot bar. Right.

1104
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,470
I gotta wrap this up cause I got a
phone call in a minute. All right.

1105
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:39,160
Threesome with my ex girlfriend a deal.

1106
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:42,280
Dear Billy Barron's skull birth.
Oh,

1107
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,640
I recently been going through some of
your Cadillac podcasts and highlights and

1108
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:50,641
become a huge fan of always have your
podcast playing at any opportunity I get.

1109
01:04:50,681 --> 01:04:55,430
But without further ado, here's
my dilemma. He 16 in high school,

1110
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,910
recently started dating
this girl at school.

1111
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,610
We've been going steady
and pardon my graphing.

1112
01:05:00,611 --> 01:05:03,640
This had been doing it like rabbits.
Now these are like underage people.

1113
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:07,180
My allowed to read this. Feel like
this is the point where you stop, stop.

1114
01:05:07,181 --> 01:05:09,070
This is where I stopped.
Right. Okay. All right.

1115
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,960
I'm going to stop with
underage threesomes.

1116
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:16,520
Um,
is it the cops?

1117
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:22,020
I'm not cool. Yeah, mania and I go there.
Why don't you a hype your Instagram page?

1118
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:26,580
Hey everybody, follow
me on Ige. Sorry. Wait,

everybody knows my Instagram.

1120
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:33,410
It's a Nias alter ego.
Everybody talk.

1121
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:37,470
He is that he is all three of
ego. Alter Egos. The same one.

1122
01:05:37,471 --> 01:05:42,390

Instagram. Ma. Um, yeah,

1124
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:48,050

as I build my brand. Uh,

1125
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:52,410
can we come to England when you do that,

1126
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:58,050

England? No. Can we, me and the baby come.

1127

Yeah. Know. Asking me on the market. Okay.

1129
01:06:07,111 --> 01:06:11,300
Evidently this trip is going to cost.
Uh, well I figured you do your short,

1130
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:16,470

know, I dunno. You know, I love London.

1131
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,320
I love London. Don't make me
laugh and made me laugh alone.

1132
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:25,530
Face
to me,

1133
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:31,470
that's our favorite movie of all
time. I'm sweating here, a roasting,

1134
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,770
baking, boiling, boop,
boop, boop, boop, boop.

1135
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,320
And it's like a sauna. Zuora. Oh,

1136
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,930
it's came full circle. That's
me and bbs. Favorite movie.

1137
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,550
Kalimari what you have, what you
have in, what were you having?

1138
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:53,310
And we ran into them that time
when we met down tree. Yes.

1139
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,310
Roundtree yes you will. You will. You will

1140
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,710
find fuck off. You're doing it.

1141
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:08,070
I hope this plane crashes.
That's my favorite line.

1142
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:14,880
The Egd movies. So cool.

1143
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:18,920
I love when he talks about
it. I get molested. He
touched me on the plane. Yeah,

1144
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:23,590
I was scared. I didn't know what to do.
I've been, I've been touched up and touch.

1145
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:29,400
He totally fucking gets out of
it. Um, Kelsey, a sexy beast.

1146
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:32,490
If you haven't not go see it,
I guess rented or,

1147
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,610
I don't know how you
procure old movies nowadays,

1148
01:07:35,611 --> 01:07:40,290
but I'm sure it's on one of these
streaming services. Streaming services.

1149
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,810
Streaming services.
If it's not on Netflix,

1150
01:07:42,811 --> 01:07:45,300
we need to have a conversation
with Ted Sarandos about that.

1151
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:50,290
Ted Sarandos sexy beast on Netflix.
And that was,

1152
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,660
what is it? The good guys? What's that?
Ryan Gosling movie that I fucking love it.

1153
01:07:55,661 --> 01:07:58,930
I have a sense of that. I fucking loved
it. I still haven't seen that movie,

1154
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:03,760
Ryan Gosling and, um, um, um, Russell,

1155
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,530
Russell Crowe also cross will always be
my favorite because he threw that phone

1156
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:10,390
at the fucking guy,
wouldn't help him with the phone.

1157
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,690
And I always thought how satisfying that
would be when someone is not helping

1158
01:08:13,691 --> 01:08:16,580
you with something and you throw
thing that literally the thing,

1159
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:19,160
they're not helping you with.
You throw it at them. Sure.

1160
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:23,480
There's regret afterwards in
the mall in the moment. Again,

1161
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:26,480
it felt so good.
The release.

1162
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:32,540
That's an angry sauna. All right. I gotta
go. Happy New Year everybody. Thank you.

1163
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:34,071
Thank you.
Once again,

1164
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:38,780
my apologies to the people in the or
last night I fucked up had I know. Uh,

1165
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,940
that's all on me.
That's not on the comedy store.

1166
01:08:40,941 --> 01:08:45,350
So send all your complaints to me. Um,
all right, that's it. Go fuck yourselves.

1167
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:49,100
And I'll check in on you hopefully on
Thursday. I think I'll still be traveling.

1168
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,140
I'll be ahead of the game. I'll be ahead
of the game. See you in 2019. Oh, Jesus.

1169
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:58,010
All right. Bye. Bye.
