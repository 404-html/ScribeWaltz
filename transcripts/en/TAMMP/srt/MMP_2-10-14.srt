1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,400
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,440
February 10th, 2014 how's
it going? How are you? Yes,

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:10,951
I know.

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:15,951
I realize the podcast is actually
air quote on time this week.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,550
Okay. Don't even start that
shit. It's never late. All right.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,790
I always take on Monday mornings.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,840
That's why I call it the Monday morning
podcast. You fucking myopic cons.

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,850
All right. The only reason why you're
getting it this early on Mondays,

9
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,360
because I'm taping it on Sunday. The
only reason why I'm taping it on Sunday,

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,920
which I shouldn't even be doing
because it's a day of rest. All right?

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,940
It's a day to sit back after a week of
farming. Phil give you a fucking oxygen,

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,740
some oats, whatever. You feed them
Hay. Is that what you feed them?

13
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:50,730
I know what the fuck you feed them.
All right. All I know is they don't,

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,750
they're fucking jacked and then the,

15
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,110
you never see them fucking
drinking a protein shake. Delia.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,430
People would drink protein shakes,
you know something?

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,020
Years later when you get
the powder cancer, I don't
want to hear about it. Okay.

18
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:08,790
You're drinking a goddamn powdered shake.
What do you want the fucking Jetsons?

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,780
Sit down and have a pork
chop like the rest of us.

20
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,680
He's fucking idiot. Say they are
these goddamn workout people for.

21
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,710
He'd go out there and you dress like
the green lantern and then you take out

22
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:21,940
your little fucking powder thing.

23
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:25,870
He's a little thing and you shake the
thing up and then you suck it down.

24
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:29,690
Just have a fucking salad.
You know dude,

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,570
you know pissed off those people who was
selling the Twat of nature where it me,

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,240
they were actually upset so they
won't be on my podcast anyway.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,990
They were mad.
They were mad.

28
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,500
Is this selling that box full of lies?

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,570
You're you get hungry in the
afternoon? Yeah. J what do I do?

30
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,490
You can have a fucking banana. Get
them an apple. You're going to be fine.

31
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,140
Watch the pounds melt off.

32
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,250
I don't need you to come over
with your tray of snacks.
Cigars, cigarettes, cigars,

33
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,990
cigarettes.
No Fuck Outta here.

34
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,390
Okay, and shame on you for
going in order in that shit.

35
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:21,440
You Lazy fucking Tba Shit.
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,490
I know you're not supposed to fat shame,
but I,

37
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,860
you know it's time we
start fucking some point.

38
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:30,920
You got to tell him to like, look, I
know you can't see your bootstraps,

39
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:34,190
but you still should try to reach down
and find them and pull them up over your

40
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,720
fucking meetings. Fat,
flabby shoulders. All right?

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,310
You ate your way into this situation.
You can eat what you eat your way out.

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,180
Just do everything that you
were doing the opposite way.

43
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,920
It's like playing a record
backwards, except now you're
playing it the right way.

44
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:56,220
You've been listening to it back,
which [inaudible] Sundays,

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,180
chocolate Sundae ships sharp,
right? You've got to have
it. Go on the other way.

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,720
Oh, this is some Broccoli and Brussels
sprouts. It's not a nice song.

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh fuck.
I hate taping on Sundays.

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,670
I'm not funny on fucking Sunday Stair.
I admitted just like,

49
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:21,450
God, I need a rest. I don't
have time for this shit.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,270
I don't have time to be
solely on a fucking Sunday.

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,500
I worked all God damn week.
Do you have any microphones?

52
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,620
I did fucking take out of
a Mike stand this week.

53
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:38,880
Do you understand how sore my wrist is?
The fucking,

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,700
Hey, are you guys doing
all right? All right.

55
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,550
Keep it going for whoever the fuck was
just on the front of me. All right.

56
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,310
How's it going? Oh, look
at this guy. This guy,

57
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,070
he's got snaps on his shirt or
the buttons too hard for you.

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,490
I'm the smartest guy ever. Fuck
his job. Look at me. I'm amazing.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,940
I got to do that every
fucking night on Sunday.

60
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,990
I give it a rest.
I don't say funny things on Sundays.

61
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,880
So you probably ask yourself,
well,

62
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,090
build and why don't you just do it
on fucking Monday? I'll tell you why.

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,320
I'll tell you why. Because,
um, my wife is actually sick.

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,180
He's got a 24 hour a virus,
which I did not think was contagious.

65
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,640
I thought she thought she
had food poisoning is what
it was. What I thought was,

66
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,280
so I was laying next to her bed,
we'll use in the same fucking bathroom.

67
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:28,570
So basically I'm probably going
to get sick and the next 24 hours.

68
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,230
So what I'm trying to do is get this
podcast out before shit starts coming out

69
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:39,040
of me on both ends, if you know what I
mean. All right. I got the wife upstairs.

70
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,930
I'm downstairs. I feel like I feel
like my wife got bit by a Zombie,

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:44,741
you know,

72
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:48,670
and I ever upstairs chained
to the Devonport there and
I'm just waiting to see

73
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,620
if she's going to turn. All we need is
Brad Pitt in here telling us what to do.

74
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,820
We got ourselves a goddamn movie.
Um, yeah. So that's why, uh,

75
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,910
that's why this thing is actually
out early. And, uh, and once again,

76
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:05,270
fuck all you guys are going to be
like, oh, if she gets sick every week.

77
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,390
So it could be on time and fucking,

78
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,650
I wish the Twat of nature
on anybody who says that.

79
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
Um, all right, sorry. That was
me. It was all mean. So anyways,

80
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,980
this is the podcast for this week. Uh,
has anybody been watching the Olympics?

81
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,950
Olympics. Olympics? Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Nothing.

82
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,970
I actually,
I really enjoy watching the Olympics.

83
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,180
I like just watching in the games. I don't
like all the other horseshit. You know,

84
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,490
all the journalists complaining that the
water isn't running and all that type

85
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,170
of shit.
I mean,

86
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,710
am I the only guy who watched all those
cold war movies coming up when I was

87
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,890
growing up?
You know what it's like over there.

88
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,530
You got the haves and
you've got to have nots.

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,870
There's like 20 people who have some
shit over there and everybody else is

90
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:58,490
getting fucked. It's,
it's unbelievably corrupt.

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,530
You know what's going on over there,

92
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,693
you know,

93
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,690
I don't know. I don't know what
the fuck's going on of the, I just,

94
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:10,280
I just want to watch a fucking games,
you know, I get it. I get it. They don't,

95
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:14,290
they don't treat gay people the way that
they should. I mean, why, why would they,

96
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,810
they,

97
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,920
they don't even have running water over
there surprised in a club in women over

98
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,600
their head and dragging them down
the street by the fucking hair. Um,

99
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,650
have you read some of the shit that
they've said about gay people? I mean,

100
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,830
it's like feist is this from the,
the 18 hundreds,

101
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,900
some guy in the Russian government,
he, this is what he said.

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,500
Um, he told, gave,

103
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,540
he also told gay visitors to not touch
the kids like he's confusing pedophiles

104
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,210
with, with, with gay
people and fucking real,

105
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,460
no wonder the water's not
running over there. Now listen,

106
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:56,740
I don't want to take a bunch
of pot shots at Russia.

107
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,760
I don't want to do this because for
some fucking reason I actually like him.

108
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,200
I miss him.
They were fun.

109
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,560
It's like when the red sox are good
and the Yankees suck, it's no fun.

110
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,770
And for like the last, I dunno, 20
something years they've been there,

111
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,370
they're in a Rut right now. They're like
the Michigan Wolverine Football Program.

112
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,870
Like what the fuck happened?
What are you going to get good again?

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,910
And it's starting to get
to the point like, fuck,

114
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,210
are they going to turn this around?
So I dunno,

115
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,520
I don't even know what to tell you.
I,

116
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,210
you know,
I don't understand

117
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,460
how you can have the technology to blow
up the world and then you still not

118
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:43,750
understand humanity at that point.
Right?

119
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,400
Don't they get will and
grace like translated over
there? Can't they see that?

120
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,540
There's nothing to worry about.

121
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,200
If you guys watched any of the, any
of the Games I actually watched, uh,

122
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:56,970
I watched some of the,

123
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,210
the cross country ski and I don't know
if I'm a f and I in some of the speed

124
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03,900
skating,
like I watched this,

125
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,030
the snowboarding I think
is fucking amazing,

126
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:11,830
but after a while it just looks like
they're all doing the same trick. Okay.

127
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:16,831
And I don't need a bunch of shit from
people in their teens and twenties with

128
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,590
half your head shaved and the rest of
it looking like a comb over. I get it.

129
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,470
I'm old.
I can't tell the difference.

130
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:26,980
We've seen a backside
fakey in a fucking gumby.

131
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:31,750
Twizzler three 60, whatever the
fuck you, I don't know. I'm amazed.

132
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,880
I don't know how they do it,

133
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,750
but I can only watch like four runs.

134
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,150
The, you know, uh, I did just
all looks the same. I don't know.

135
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,020
I know what they're doing. You fucking,
you go down the hill, you jump on the,

136
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:50,440
on the railing or the banister,
whatever it is.

137
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:55,441
You do a little grindy thing and then
you land and then you in and then you

138
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,860
fucking do a little low.
Whoop de do B. Do you grab it?

139
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,490
You grab this and grabbing the board
with the hands. That's a big move.

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,140
This is me trying to explain it.

141
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,580
And then I also learned that when you go
to land you're actually looking up the

142
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,590
hill. You have your head looking
up. They I haven't seen my,

143
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,440
I would have looked down the hill.
He supposed to look up the hill.

144
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,740
Okay.

145
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,460
All right. I've learned that, eh? Uh,

146
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,540
okay.

147
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,260
I Dunno. Then you do a lot of high
fiving and hugging of other um,

148
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,710
other people that you're
trying to beat for some reason.

149
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,200
There's a lot of comradery and that sport.
Other than that,

150
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,160
I don't know shit about it,

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,530
but the speed skating I like and
a cross country skiing. Go figure.

152
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,680
I liked that shit cause it
makes me want to go work out.

153
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,140
Like I was watching the
women doing it and I'm like,

154
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,020
they have burned so many calories,
they don't even have titties anymore.

155
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,570
Can you imagine? I could get rid of the
giant teddy that's right above my pubes.

156
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,150
If I started cross country ski,

157
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,010
that's what I'm getting out of it though.
These women were flying

158
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,430
okay up the Goddamn hill and then down
Ellie actually they said this year they

159
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:09,431
might actually hit speeds of 50 miles an
hour and they are so fucking exhausted

160
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,990
by the end of it.
You cross the finish line,

161
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,550
they all of them collapsed
and just fall in the snow.

162
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,300
Like they were going to make a snow angel
and then they just passed out from too

163
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:23,900
much booze or something and then
they're laying on the fucking ground

164
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,450
doing that shit and I'm just like, I
dunno. There's something about you don't,

165
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,590
it is, I'm not fast. So
I like endurance shit.

166
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,030
You know gymnastics and that type of shit
for having a hang from some do an iron

167
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,450
cross. Like I look at that stuff
and I actually think like, you know,

168
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:46,110
if I tried to do that
long enough I could do it.

169
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,380
I couldn't do it at an Olympic
level, but I could do it. All right.

170
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,890
I can watch a guy run a four 40
all day long dunk a basketball.

171
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:55,350
I hit a fucking home run.

172
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,830
Okay.

173
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,620
In a major league stadium. I'm never
going to be able to do that shit.

174
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,160
Did I just say I could do an iron cross?

175
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:07,210
Maybe I'm already getting sick right
now. Maybe I'm a fuck you. I can do it

176
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,180
all.
I need some rings.

177
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,360
Yeah,

178
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,020
and an old tree to hang them
from. Oh my God. Can you imagine?

179
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,700
What do you what?
What is even,

180
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:22,230
what is the muscle you tear trying
to fucking do that. That's your lats.

181
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,680
I want to how long that takes a little
district. All right, so all you would do,

182
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:32,220
you'd fucking hanging from the tree.
You know, once your wife is like dog,

183
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:36,840
so we don't hurt yourself.
Once you get through that,

184
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,070
okay.

185
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,370
You know a few people with kids and
I'm just putting it up for the kids.

186
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,770
Don't worry, I'll put some match down or
put some leaves here. There'll be fine.

187
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,350
I figured what you gotta do,
you hang the,

188
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,920
have things hanging down and you got
to get into the dip position first

189
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,970
and then what you do is you gradually
start bringing it out and then when you

190
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:58,750
start feeling the fire under your armpits,
you bring it back real quick.

191
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,590
And just every day you go out there or
every other day and he tried to go a

192
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,120
little bit farther as
is that how you doing?

193
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,620
Anybody can anybody who listens
to this podcast do an iron cross?

194
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,040
Do I have to be wearing like those pants
like the feet pajama grape smuggling,

195
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:19,240
fucking a lower pants,
lower pants, lower leotard,

196
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,430
section of the pants there. Ah, fuck.

197
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,310
Why do I try to do this on Sunday
five this is why I don't go to church.

198
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,700
It's just Sunday. So you
know, I don't fucking know.

199
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,230
I'm always coming back from the
road. I'm always traveling, you know,

200
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,380
I fly back and then I'm just, I
just lay here catatonic. I'm I,

201
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,000
this isn't what I'm supposed to be
doing here. Trying to be fucking funny.

202
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,440
Anyways, I had a great show this
weekend. I was actually out in, uh,

203
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,670
Minneapolis,
Minnesota at this casino,

204
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:53,590
I believe was called treasure island. I
was there, so fucking quick, I flew in,

205
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,600
I did the show and I came right back out.

206
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,310
It was like minus two degrees the
entire fucking time I was there.

207
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,360
And that is a level of
cold you don't like.

208
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,883
I love the winter.

209
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,030
I don't give a shit until it gets down.
Once it gets into the teens,

210
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,670
that's when I give a fuck. That's what
I'm like, all right. Enough already.

211
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,460
But I don't even mind if it's in
the teens and Christmas is coming.

212
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:22,180
It's when it's in the teens and
it's just February or January.

213
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,020
That's when it's fucking miserable.
And it was so fucking cold out there.

214
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:30,430
Even people from Minnesota, we're
saying that it was like cold, but, um,

215
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,380
anyways, I went out there
and, uh, had a great time.

216
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,780
Thank you to everybody who showed up.
I'm

217
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,190
still on the wagon. You know,
it's funny, after the show, um,

218
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,770
I was hanging, it was me and the other
rack that was out there. Jade cat,

219
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,240
a prater hope I said that right.
Um,

220
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,030
I've never known how to say the last name.

221
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:59,590
I came fucking read who fucking
killed him in front of me. By the way,

222
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,750
I had a great set.
So afterwards we're hanging in,

223
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,990
we're hanging with the promoter and I'm
sitting at the bar and I'm not drinking

224
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:08,580
and I'm fucking drinking oh duels
and like how many, oh duals.

225
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,900
He literally going to have,
so I get one, oh duals.

226
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:11,920
And I'm just sitting there like,
all right,

227
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,580
I'll sip on this fucking thing and
smoke God damn cigar or whatever.

228
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,510
And um, so people after
the show and go, Hey,

229
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:22,510
can I get you a drink and get your
drink? I'm like, I'm like, no,

230
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,480
I really appreciate it. Thank you for
coming out, but I'm not drinking. Sorry.

231
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,070
You know, you know, whatever. Get Jay
born if she wants one of Blah, blah, blah.

232
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:34,210
So then people started buying me
rounds. They were buying me. Oh duals.

233
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,100
So then I'm like, well I got
drink it, somebody gave it
to me. So like an asshole.

234
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,440
All the weight that I've been losing,
cause I haven't boozed in like two weeks.

235
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:49,030
Like, now I'm just sitting here pounding
out duels pounding, pounding, oh,

236
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:49,864
duels.

237
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,340
The dumbest fucking like the emptiest of
all empty calories. Just sitting there,

238
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:59,840
slam of things. I got to tell you
something for a non alcohol beer, it's,

239
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,290
it ain't that fucking bad.
And if you have to be at a bar,

240
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,160
I dunno. I think I followed
it. I think I phoned.

241
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:12,440
See I never yarn on Monday
mornings. I think I found, um,

242
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,600
I think I go on a nice little run here.
If I can just still have my cigars,

243
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,950
I have to have some sort of vice.
Um,

244
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,220
well that'd be bad if I go back upstairs.
Right.

245
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,050
And my poor wife flag, you know, she's,
she's up there right now in Gatorade,

246
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,070
saltine cracker, um, hell right now.

247
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,470
And she's cool too. She's cool about
it. She's cool with me being down here.

248
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,240
You know, a lot of women would
be like, why can't a conference,

249
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,840
you get at least sit in the chair near me.

250
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,190
I can't believe that I have, you know,
and then you get sick and they're fucking,

251
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:58,140
they don't give a shit.
Right. Um, anyways,

252
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,390
I didn't tell you guys this. I actually
bought off of Ebay. I bought a fucking,

253
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,470
I bought a drum kit.

254
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,260
You know the one thing that sucks about
drums as you cannot play them in a,

255
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,990
unless you get it soundproofed in
your fucking house. So I actually,

256
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,200
I got some drum cases and I'm going
to bring these fucking things up.

257
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:25,990
I can't wait to play these goddamn
things. I get an old Ludwig Kit. Um,

258
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,100
I know what you guys are saying.
Send me a picture and that senior picture,

259
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,480
just know that there it's an
old Ludwig kit. I do time.

260
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:38,620
I will and do time. Let me get my
drumming up to a certain fucking level.

261
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,480
Cause I know I've promised you guys that
I was going to start doing drum covers.

262
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,310
I gotta I'll fucking do one.

263
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,020
I just got to get somebody to videotape
these fucking things in an edit it and

264
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:52,540
all that shit. I just don't know
how to do that. And furthermore,

265
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,070
I don't want to learn how to do it.

266
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,220
I don't need another goddamn
hobby. I just, I don't know.

267
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,860
You know what it is. I, I
have like computer phobia.

268
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,950
That's basically what earlier when I was
trashing everybody with the new phones

269
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,290
and all that, part of that was true. Like,

270
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,350
I really think you should pay down your
debt before you get another flat screen

271
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:16,300
TV. Before you get another fucking phone.
I can, if I could just get anything,

272
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:21,160
just get something through
to the listeners on this
God damn podcast other than

273
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:25,420
to go after what you want in life
as soon as you can. It would be,

274
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,900
you know,
to just pay down your credit cards.

275
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,400
Don't start a fucking
life, a death, death,

276
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,700
life of debt before you even get married
and start having kids and then come out

277
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,680
of it, you know, 40,

278
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:46,240
50 fucking years later when you're
in your sixties or seventies. Um,

279
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,410
I'm telling you just within your means
and you will have the gift of free time,

280
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,460
you'll actually get a good night's
fucking sleep. Um, but anyways,

281
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,050
yeah.

282
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,370
Yeah. So, but that, um, generally
speaking like I have, I have major, uh,

283
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,530
I don't know, I learned a lot about
myself in the last week. Like, my wife

284
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,400
finally convinced me that I have add and
I know a lot of you guys who listen to

285
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:20,430
this shit. I'll probably
just laughing like, yeah. How
the fuck did she know that?

286
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,490
You know why? Cause I'm the one
trapped in this fucking skull. Okay,

287
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,100
sure. You guys have problems too.
No, fucking come at me like that.

288
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,400
Trying to open up here.
Um,

289
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,940
I have the yellow wind screen
on the mic this week. Okay.

290
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,790
Trying to come from my hat here.
I get a little sunshine on the Mike here.

291
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,390
Um,
and I didn't think

292
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,680
I didn't think she was right
and she was like, no, she goes,

293
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:52,040
I went on a website and I looked up a,

294
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,330
and you have every fucking symptom and
I always just thought add was just a

295
00:18:57,851 --> 00:19:02,650
crutch. Like people, I'm sorry, I have
add. I'm sorry. Every add. Oh, I got,

296
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,770
I have add. I saw people, you know, I
drove into the back of your car. Sorry.

297
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,370
I have add. Like it just seemed
like this fucking excuse.

298
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,810
It seems something like for just
something that week people said.

299
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,660
So, um, I was just like,
no, I'm, um, I'm stupid. Um,

300
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,370
and uh, I need to read more. That's
basically how I looked at it,

301
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,890
which still might be the case. But, um,

302
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,350
I finally understood what
she was saying cause she,

303
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:35,351
she read some of the symptoms and then
I was sitting on the couch and I was

304
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:38,550
talking to her about the Patrice
O'Neal benefit coming up.

305
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,980
And I was saying how happy I was that,
you know,

306
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,010
we're doing it two years in a row,

307
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,670
we're helping out all the
people that he loved. Well,

308
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:51,210
but now people that you know,

309
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,300
okay,

310
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,360
you know, diabetes, stroke and that type
of thing, we've given some money to them.

311
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,490
And I'm really talking about how
site Diane, that everybody, you know,

312
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,950
bought the tickets and opie and Anthony
helped out in all the comics. Like,

313
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,470
I mean, I have more than enough
comedians on the show this year,

314
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,750
but she said everybody loved Patrice,
want to be on it.

315
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:13,250
So I'm in the middle of this heartfelt
conversation with my wife and in,

316
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,650
and I'm sitting on one end of the couch.
She's on the end.

317
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,070
And I sit there and I kind of leaned my
head back and I look up at the ceiling

318
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,580
and I'm in the middle is talking about
how much I love for Teresa and how much I

319
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:26,690
miss him. And I looked up and I went,
oh, a spider, there's a spider up there.

320
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,640
And I just started talking about
the spider. And then I hear her,

321
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:36,050
she starts laughing and
I look at her like, what?

322
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,020
And it was one of those things
she needed to have to say it.

323
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,280
She just had this look in her eye,

324
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,490
like that shit we were
talking about earlier as you
leave buried her face in the

325
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:46,550
pillow and just started laughing at me.
And I was like,

326
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,930
and I actually know typical guy thing,
I had to try to defend myself. Mike, no,

327
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:53,440
I mean there's a spider and how
do you not address the spider?

328
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,120
And then I really thought about it later,
like the level of,

329
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,190
of emotional shit that
I was talking about.

330
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,950
And then just one stupid fucking
spider. Oh, there's a spider.

331
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,720
Like did another thing that when
I go to leave the fucking house.

332
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,580
Okay.

333
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:09,850
I Dunno.

334
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,610
Maybe I'm trying to help out other people
who might have this fucking problem

335
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,760
is like, and she told
me she would go, well,

336
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:18,100
you should go talk to somebody bought us.
Like,

337
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,080
I don't want to talk fucking
talk to somebody about it.

338
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,130
They're going to give me a god damn drug
that they pushed through the FDA that's

339
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,800
going to fuck up my liver
and do something else to me.

340
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,490
But I can really focus when the doctor
tells me I have this new kind of fucking

341
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:34,960
cancer,
whatever happened to just toughen it out.

342
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,140
You know, you fucking Rogaine
pussies just go bald like me.

343
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,000
Um, anyways, how many times do I say this?

344
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,520
What the fuck was I talking about?
The same goddamn thing. This is it.

345
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,240
I made your fucking problems. So she
wanted me to go talk to somebody about it.

346
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,480
I'm like, I'm not fucking
doing that. But uh,

347
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,330
I've just really noticed like the amount
of times, like take something simple.

348
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,390
I'll have like a grocery
list or something.

349
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,020
If I ever made a grocery list in my life,
let's just say for shits and giggles.

350
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:11,854
I do.

351
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,850
I'll have that on my or my
phone or something like that.

352
00:22:16,851 --> 00:22:20,290
I have my phone and I'm going to
leave the house and I go, Oh fuck.

353
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,610
Where are my keys?
I need my keys.

354
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,860
So then I walk over and I go over
and I pick up my keys. All right.

355
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:29,980
See you later honey. And I walk
out of the house. I sit in the car,

356
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,140
I turn on the fucking car and then
I look around. Where's my phone?

357
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,280
I left it the fucking house.

358
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,550
Okay.

359
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,580
How did I do that? I had the
phone, I knew I needed the phone,

360
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:44,240
I needed the keys and it's just like I
walk up there and my brain is thinking

361
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:48,830
about 90 other fucking things other
than in somewhere in there is I need the

362
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:53,831
keys and I walk over to get the fucking
keys I guess with the same hand and I

363
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:57,540
sat down the phone. It's like,
almost like you don't, like when you,

364
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:02,450
when you're blackout drunk,
it's like technically you passed out,

365
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:06,500
but somebody is still awake in your body
walking around talking to people that

366
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:10,040
you're later going to have to apologize
for this kind of the sober version of

367
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:14,090
that. For those of you who
aren't afflicted with this,
whatever the hell I have.

368
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,570
Okay.

369
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,160
Maybe that's why I suck at reading.
I don't know what it is.

370
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:21,960
Okay.

371
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,840
Because I, I really want to sit here
and say that I'm not a dumb guy,

372
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:25,950
but fucking everything.

373
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,650
And I always talk about how much I sucked
in high school. I haven't went like,

374
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,100
I want one time like,
well,

375
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,400
we had to do a book report
and I got this book,

376
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,300
it was about this German shepherd in
World War Two that fall along side.

377
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:42,970
This guy who was a great fucking book.

378
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,823
MMM.

379
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,940
And uh,

380
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,930
I remember the first night I sat down to
read it and it took me like four hours,

381
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,280
couldn't have been four. It was
like three hours to read, 30 pages,

382
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,590
two and a half hours to
read 30 fucking pages.

383
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,690
And the next day I went into school. I
still remember the kid, I said this too.

384
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:07,310
I said, yeah man, it took me fucking,

385
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,340
I was reading the book for two and
a half hours and they were like,

386
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:13,220
how many pages? You got to say,
wow. I mean, Paige is into a,

387
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:18,221
and I said 30 and he just started
laughing at me and I said to him,

388
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:22,940
he goes, I go, what? He goes, it took you
two and a half hours to read 30 pages.

389
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,250
And I was like, what? I
said, I read to understand

390
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,040
it. He just started laughing at
me, thought that was the funny.

391
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,360
He thought I was trying to be funny and
what I was really was trying to convey

392
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,680
to him was I had to,

393
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,430
I kept reading paragraphs and my brain
would be thinking about other shit and I

394
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:48,431
had to go back and reread it over
and over and over and over again.

395
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,340
So I had to go that slowly
so I could understand it.

396
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:56,690
It was basically my naive way of I guess,
explaining.

397
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,750
Look. All I'm saying is if I don't
have add, I am surprisingly stupid,

398
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,693
but whatever.

399
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,120
It's helped me like maybe that's
why I can't write a fucking script,

400
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,260
but I can write bits cause
this this short. Right.

401
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,670
You know what I like about this add shit.
I can explain away all my problems.

402
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,380
This is phenomenal.

403
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,940
Hey,
guess what?

404
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,670
All right. Does that mean anything
to, she's looking at me right now.

405
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:34,340
She was laying down. She just picked
up her head. She was awake. By the way.

406
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,180
It's one of those deals with it.
She's got one year down and one year up.

407
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,370
You know?
Can you get any fucking,

408
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,470
I challenge you right now to tell me
something cuter in the animal kingdom than

409
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:50,060
a fucking jacked animal that could rip
your fucking face off that anytime it

410
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:52,890
decides to waking up from an,

411
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,380
from a nap with one year down in one
year up. Commit Cleo, Kimmy up buddy.

412
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,750
Come here. Oh, big stretch. A big stretch.

413
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,250
Come here. Let me fix your ear.
I'm not saying jump up on the bed.

414
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,750
There you go. That's her saint alone.
Sniffing the microphone. What's up buddy?

415
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,640
But even your head has muscles,
Huh? This is what I do every day.

416
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,760
Cause even,
I don't know how to express love.

417
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,340
This is what I do every day with Cleo.
I grab her by both ears.

418
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,310
Not Hard.
Now she's walking away.

419
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,610
I grab her by both ears and I just make
her look up at me and when she looks up

420
00:26:34,891 --> 00:26:36,020
at me,

583
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,860
Uh Oh, you know, the one that I always
forget to bring up is a amazon.com.

00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,920
You look over on the right,

588
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,990
there's the amazon.com a banner you
click on that takes you right to Amazon.

589
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,620

if I drive track of traffic to this site,

590
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,600
they give me a kickback
on whenever you guys buy,

591
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:19,210
it doesn't cost Shani any more money.
I just takes a little bit of,

592
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:22,360
you're a little bit of life out of your
index finger with a couple of extra

593
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:25,750
clicks. That's all. That's all it is. If
you'd like to do it, do it. If you don't,

594
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:30,450
I understand you're busy.
You got shit to do. Uh,

595
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,910
all right, let's move on here. Hey,

596
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:38,911
how fucking weird and awful is right
after the super bowl that first Sunday

597
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,120
without football. I don't know about you
guys, but it's always so goddamn jarring.

598
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,463
MMM.

599
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,650
Because you're so watching the playoffs
and you're so getting into it and your

600
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:57,460
soul trying to guess who's going to
win the Superbowl and fucking get,

601
00:37:57,461 --> 00:38:02,110
get your bets going and all of that shit
that you don't even contemplate that.

602
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,810
The second that game's over,
football is now done.

603
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,470
Okay,

604
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,370
dawn until September. Fuck that
bullshit in August. All right.

605
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,890
It's done until September.

606
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,170
What in God's name are we going to do now?
I'd say turn on the fucking hockey,

607
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,220
but it's the Olympics,

608
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,323
so,

609
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,510
oh, actually can actually watch women's
hockey because the men's hockey doesn't

610
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,530
start for a minute. Please.
Everybody. Do me a favor. Watch.

611
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:32,790
Some of that Olympic hockey sit down and
enjoy it. It's going to be phenomenal.

612
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,970
And when you do enjoy it,
don't say that dumb shit like,

613
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,500
like everybody says actually
tweeted about this, you know,

614
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,740
every four years during
the winter Olympics,

615
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,870
people who don't watch hockey
get to lie and say that if NHL,

616
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,620
if the NHL was like Olympic hockey,

617
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:57,370
that they would actually watch Olympic
hockey. You wouldn't, you would,

618
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,740
you were either a basketball
person or a hockey person.

619
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:03,100
There's very few people who have
the time to watch both. All right.

620
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,560
Another thing that always happens during
the Olympics is when people praise the

621
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:13,270
Olympic game, um, they
start talking about the NHL.

622
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:16,640
Like it's still 1975. I heard, uh,

623
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,140
Mike Wilbon who I love and one of the
few shows that I actually like PTI on a

624
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,230
ESPN. He even hinted like that. He goes,
it's great. I love the Olympic hockey.

625
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,200
You know, if the Nh, he goes, you know,

626
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:36,140
at the NHL would get the fighting and
all this stick work, all this stuff.

627
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,290
What does that mean? All the
stick work? What the fuck?

628
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,950
What does that mean? That guys are just
club and each over the fucking head.

629
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,380
You know why they say that? Because
once every four or five years goes by,

630
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,240
somebody does that shit actually club
somebody in the face with a goddamn and

631
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:58,600
then that's the thing that gets on sports
center and then all these people who

632
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:03,601
don't watch hockey at all or or or watch
it in passing then start going like

633
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,510
nice is a card game and they
always go in the fighting.

634
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,670
Dude, this, I've been
saying this for years,

635
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:17,671
I said this in 2010 during the Olympics
there's barely any fighting left in NHL

636
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:21,460
hockey compared to the way it used to be.
Okay.

637
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,770
Back in the day you used to have like
at least two if not three guys on every

638
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:33,090
team who are on your team to beat the
shit out of the other two to three guys

639
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,760
that were on that team to try to
beat the shit out of your guys.

640
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,820
Like when I was growing up,
when I first started watching the Bruins,

641
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,130
they had John went sick and Stan,
Jonathan and one of our all star players.

642
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,580
The heart of the team was Terry O'Reilly
and he fought just as much as he scored

643
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,400
back then it was,
he was known as a complete player.

644
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,680
He could do whatever you wanted to do.
You want the puck in the net.

645
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,780
I don't know how good he was a defense,

646
00:40:57,781 --> 00:41:01,020
but whatever he gave it his all
you want to drop the gloves?

647
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:03,750
He could fucking do everything.
Wayne Cashman was another guy.

648
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,700
I mean he was like a gold score, that guy
and he, he, I just remember Fred Cusick.

649
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:12,390
Oh, Cashman with the left.
Yeah, this left hook. Um,

650
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,410
and then I caught the tail end of those
guys and then it was Jay Miller Linden

651
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:21,360
buyers
along the way.

652
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:24,990
We'd pick up guys like Willie
Plett and then the islanders.

653
00:41:24,991 --> 00:41:29,100
The island has had all these guys.
Great Hall of fame, tough guys.

654
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:33,490
Chris Nilan, cordic everybody.

655
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:38,260
And then they weren't in
the same fucking team. Okay.

656
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,640
Now, like I don't even know
how many like actual goons,

657
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:46,860
straight up fucking fighters I want.
I'm not going to say goons are, are,

658
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:51,360
are still in the Goddamn league.
Like right now the,

659
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,450
the Bruins have one, Sean Thornton
and he can actually play the game.

660
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,610
I know a lot of you guys going
to say what's the why of what?

661
00:41:57,611 --> 00:42:00,790
About what he did against the
penguins. That's going to happen. Okay.

662
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,840
Especially when you give somebody a
couple of love taps and they actually

663
00:42:04,841 --> 00:42:06,910
somehow get knocked out.
I don't want to be a dick,

664
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:08,680
but I think I could have
taken those punches.

665
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,690
Oh wait, can we eat from
the peg? Would feds. Um,

666
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,680
and I know what they're going to be
saying is they're actually going to say,

667
00:42:20,681 --> 00:42:22,540
well,
why is there fighting?

668
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:28,780
Why is there fighting in hockey? Which
is the dumbest fucking question. Never.

669
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,940
It's like you're going to
address that and say, well,

670
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,190
why is there fighting period.

671
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,420
Yeah.

672
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,130
Why is there fighting and boxing? Why is
there fighting in the UFC? Why is that?

673
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:43,600
Okay? But if every once in a
while it happens in hockey,

674
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,830
it's the most just,
you know,

675
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,480
deplorable fucking thing
that ever happened and now
you've got to make comments

676
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:51,820
on society and the
direction that is going in.

677
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,690
Okay.

678
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,800
Through the Bruins played the fucking
Canadians a couple of weeks ago and I'm

679
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,360
pretty sure there wasn't even
a fight in it. Those things,

680
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,600
by halfway through the first period,
once a year,

681
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:05,840
they'd have that game halfway through
the first period they would be like nine

682
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:08,630
guys in the penalty box and like fucking,

683
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,920
I don't even know if that's
even possible. They, they, they,

684
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,890
they would be standing room
only in the fucking penalty box

685
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,870
and now they'll play each other and
they just play the fucking game.

686
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,200
Okay.

687
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,050
Without having any fights. But the
fights are part of the Goddamn game.

688
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:30,830
And so I understand if you don't
like hockey because of the fighting,

689
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:32,460
but for the love of God,

690
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:36,900
please quit complaining about it
because they're ruining the game because

691
00:43:36,901 --> 00:43:39,900
they're going to take fighting out of
it and you're not going to watch it.

692
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,440
You're not going to watch it. You're
going to watch it the way I watch curling.

693
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:48,060
I watch it once every four years and
I really enjoy it and I think like,

694
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:50,310
wow,
I could actually watch this sport.

695
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,000
Like I'm really going to go out and get
the curling package and start watching

696
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:57,630
it religiously every fucking year.
I'm not going to do it. All right,

697
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,920
so for the love of God, please enjoy
the Olympic hockey and watch it,

698
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,190
but keep you fucking uninformed comments
about the NHL to yourself because it's

699
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:09,300
an unbelievable game.
It's a great league.

700
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:14,301
And one of the reasons why it is so great
is because not as many people watch it

701
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,340
as the other three fucking leaks.
Nope.

702
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,140
I just love that people fucking still
bitch about hockey and like the fucking

703
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:29,141
NBA had a mobbed up ref literally
shoeless Joe Jackson kind of Shit and they

704
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,350
just gloss it over. I mean it was
a story, but it was like, well,

705
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:37,020
we had one bad apple,
one bad apple.

706
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:42,390
The fucking guy prevented the Sacramento
Kings from going to the finals.

707
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,410
The Lakers got another
ring or an opportunity.

708
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:48,480
I'm not taking away the fact
that they won in the finals.

709
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,120
What this fucking guy admitted
that he fixed the God damn series.

710
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,230
So they have,
they have a championship.

711
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,530
Just like when the white sox
through the world series,

712
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:05,550
you have the same thing going on except
it was done by someone on an officiating

713
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:07,110
crew and I,

714
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,680
you hear more shit about the fighting
and hockey than you heard about that.

715
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:13,530
It's unfucking believable.
I actually got a friend of mine

716
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,420
who will remain nameless
and he claims this,

717
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,790
I don't know why he would lie.
He was working for uh Oh,

718
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:26,860
this is tough. I gotta Watch out.
I'm going to get sued. He was warm.

719
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,840
He was working for a basketball team
that I'm not particularly fond of,

720
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,160
that I may or may not have made fun of
on numerous times and may have already

721
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:40,260
made fun of them on this podcast
about championship claims,

722
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:44,460
but I'm not going to say who they are.
They're way uniforms.

723
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:46,530
Remind me of Barney the dinosaur.
All right.

724
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,710
That's for anybody who doesn't
watch sports. You can't
figure it out. All right.

725
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:54,950
They worked at the arena and there was
one game left and this team was playing

726
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,340
another team that was up
north where it rains a lot,

727
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,470
but they didn't lose
their basketball team.

728
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,560
And there was one game left in the series

729
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,180
and the guy who just stepped down told
the people for the Barney the dinosaur

730
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:14,370
team to fucking order all the craft
service or something like that.

731
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:17,700
The fucking get the seats set
up for the media and all that.

732
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,820
But he only said it for the Barney,
the dinosaur team,

733
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,680
not for the rained out fucking team.

734
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,880
And the Barney the dinosaur team for like,
before the game even happened,

735
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,070
he was claiming that
there's no fuck cause he,

736
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:37,790
he knew somebody who was in
the, uh, the fucking, uh,

737
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,770
the other team's front office and they
were not given instructions to get

738
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:44,210
prepared for the next playoff series.

739
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:48,530
So it wasn't like we need to be prepared
just in case he only told one team to

740
00:46:48,531 --> 00:46:51,680
fucking do it. And it ended up being
the team that won the, I know that,

741
00:46:51,681 --> 00:46:55,490
that sounds fucking crazy. I'm not saying
it's true. I'm not saying it's not true,

742
00:46:55,491 --> 00:46:57,590
but all I know is for fucking years.

743
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:01,910
I was saying the NBA is fixed and then
I'm vindicated when they have a fucking

744
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:05,360
mobbed up ref and it's
like a fucking God damn.

745
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:10,310
Like it was maybe a 10 day story.
It was really hard for a couple of days.

746
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:14,360
And then that was it. It just went away.
Oh, he's just had one to one fucking guy.

747
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,860
One mobbed up ref

748
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:21,260
fucking a team out of a championship.
That chance to win a championship.

749
00:47:21,261 --> 00:47:26,100
That's all. But the fighting,
Oh and and the stick work, the,

750
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:29,620
the, the Tom foolery. It just has to stop.

751
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,430
You don't even have to watch hockey
at this point to criticize it.

752
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:37,510
So many people have criticized the fucking
thing. You can just say what they say.

753
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,960
All right, I'm done. I'm
done. I got my fucking,

754
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:44,800
I'll get my panties in a bunch of you. Um,
all right, let's, let's, let's read some,

755
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:48,970
uh, let's read some of the, that
the sh the shit here for the week.

756
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,840
Some of the, uh, the, the uh, what
do you call these things here? See,

757
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,680
this is another thing too.
That's my add.

758
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,930
I can't remember things
because they have add.

759
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:02,650
Why'd you take your Dick out in public
bill? I'm sorry. I got a date day.

760
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,550
Um, all right. Yo, Billy Dee Williams.

761
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:11,890
My chick is a diehard nine of fan
and after five years dating her,

762
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:14,710
I've gotten into my,
I've gotten into football myself.

763
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,460
Others consider me a
conspiracy theorist. Oh, Jesus.

764
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:19,840
Now we're going right
into conspiracy here.

765
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:25,140
Right after nine 11 I called it that
the Patriots would win to symbolize the

766
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:29,860
Phoenix style rebirth of
American patriotism. Sure enough,

767
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:34,300
the Patriots won. All right. I'm
going to go with you on that one,

768
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,840
dude.
I called it all right.

769
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,490
He said this year I made
another prediction that I
was really hoping would be

770
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:46,840
wrong. I had a feeling that
Seattle, the team icon,

771
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,680
which resembles the America's Bald Eagle,

772
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,990
will beat Denver's horse team,

773
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,200
which represents China's
Year of the horse.

774
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,220
This to symbolize the west domination
over the east to further support.

775
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:05,830
My previously stated theory.
They weren't.

776
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,700
There were a ton of pro soldier
and patriotic commercials.

777
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,060
I'm very curious to see what
political events are to come in.

778
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:17,200
2014 thoughts. Yeah, dude, your,

779
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,050
you're way too far down
the fucking rabbit hole.

780
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,450
Okay.

781
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,250
I've never understood that thing.
Like,

782
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,930
like the symbols on TV thing.
That's always,

783
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:32,340
to me it seemed like paranoid thought.
Um, and fuck everybody right now.

784
00:49:32,341 --> 00:49:36,720
Who thinks my NBA shit, his paranoia,
they had a mobbed up ref go fuck yourself.

785
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,300
Um,
it was fixed.

786
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,570
I'm not saying straight across the board,

787
00:49:42,571 --> 00:49:45,930
but it was fixed on a certain
fucking level. This shit here.

788
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,640
Like first of all.

789
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,720
Yeah.

790
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,560
All right. So yeah. Titles team which
resembles and American Bald Eagle.

791
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,600
It doesn't,

792
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,050
yeah,

793
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,180
it doesn't, we'll beat the
horse. I got to tell you,

794
00:49:59,181 --> 00:50:00,740
I didn't know it was
the year of the horse.

795
00:50:00,741 --> 00:50:05,720
And I think I pretty much
represent the average Joe and uh,

796
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,520
uh,
see gold doesn't,

797
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,910
a seagull does not look like
what's on the side of, of, of,

798
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,200
of the Seahawks and a single
fucking sea hawk. I'm an asshole.

799
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,430
I don't even realize, I was saying that
a sea hawk does not look like a fucking,

800
00:50:19,431 --> 00:50:23,750
uh, a bald eagle. It
doesn't a real one doesn't.

801
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:28,980
The one that they showed looks nothing
like the cartoon version that they have

802
00:50:28,981 --> 00:50:33,390
on the side of the fucking
head. And even if it does. Okay.

803
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:34,980
The average Shithead,

804
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,780
the way you have to spell stuff out,

805
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,070
I mean the average shithead is ordering
the Twat from nature there and having a

806
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,670
box of fucking chocolate covered
peanuts delivered to their desk.

807
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,410
They going to stick those in their mouth
and then wonder why they don't have abs.

808
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,140
Do you think they're going to be able to
figure out the American Bald Eagle and

809
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:58,990
the Denvers horse? I'm a
patriots fan. All right.

810
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,490
Like I don't think,

811
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:08,050
I just never made the connection.
I think you're, you're looking,

812
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,320
so you're saying the Illuminati
is also running a football league?

813
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,400
Yeah.

814
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,450
Now what if the Falcons won? What
would that, what does that have meant?

815
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:24,790
Okay,

816
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,130
the Green Bay packers.
What will you know,

817
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,840
do all of them symbolize something like
every year? Somebody who won last year,

818
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:37,460
who the fuck one last year? I don't even
remember. Usually good about that shit.

819
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,050
Two years ago the giants won.
I remember that.

820
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:40,580
Cause they beat my fucking patriots.

821
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,700
What does that mean that giants
are for the Taliban? Yeah, dude, I,

822
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,070
I think that your,
um,

823
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,780
I'm like if the 40 niners when it,

824
00:51:49,781 --> 00:51:51,730
that means like we're
coming back to slave labor,

825
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,030
your load 16 tons and water,

826
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:59,010
you get big John Big jaw,

827
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:03,170
big bad drone. Uh, yeah dude,

828
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,700
I think that, uh, I think you're, you're,

829
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,860
you're kind of going beautiful mind there.

830
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,030
You're reading the daily paper
and you're trying to to see stuff.

831
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:14,670
Okay.

832
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:19,250
That isn't there.
Yeah.

833
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:25,100
To symbolize what the West
domination over the east. I gotta be.

834
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:29,660
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't understand, you know,
as far as I'm concerned,

835
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:34,520
China is west of where I'm at.
So how are they in the east?

836
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,050
Yeah.

837
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,320
I mean, when I fly to China, if I ever
go to China, I'm going to go west.

838
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,350
They're going to fly me up to Alaska,

839
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,150
make a left and then go
right by fucking South Korea.

840
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:48,650
Hopefully you don't get shut down as
we go by Russia and then I'm in China.

841
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:54,380
I'm not going to go east.
How did they decide that?

842
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:56,380
Is that because that's
where we will po populated.

843
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,190
Like if everybody came from Africa
like Nas and all the rappers say,

844
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:04,370
you know, cause they've done
their research in between blunts.

845
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,341
Um,

846
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:14,150
if we actually all came from there then
why doesn't the day start right there?

847
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,601
Cause I know,

848
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:19,070
I understand where you were living
on this fear that the world is round.

849
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,670
Who's to say where the day starts?
Why does it store Japan?

850
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,550
All right, sorry. There you go.

851
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:29,580
It was a nice little fucking minute and
a half to make you feel better about

852
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:34,410
yourself intellectually moving on.
Alright, championships in Seattle.

853
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,210
Billy Boldface,
I'm not sure if you heard about this,

854
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:42,660
but Seattle has a few championships
in women's basketball.

855
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:47,160
I'm obviously no one gives a fuck,
but this is what's great.

856
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,140
I imagine the women who play on the
team give a shit and those 37 people who

857
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:54,510
were related to him in the
crowd, I'm sure they do. Oh fuck.

858
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:57,560
That's too close to a
Joe Bart. Nick joke. Um,

859
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:58,390
yeah,

860
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,760
I imagine they give a
shit. Let's see. Says,

861
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:05,390
there's a great picture going on
around it, around have a headline.

862
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,720
Seattle's first championship from the
Seattle newspaper below the headline is a

863
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:15,170
picture of a player from the Seattle's
women's basketball team as she's looking

864
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:17,960
up at a bunch of banners for
championships that they've won.

865
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,030
Okay,

866
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,370
well don't they mean like the
Seahawks first championship?

867
00:54:22,371 --> 00:54:24,230
Cause even if they aren't sexist,

868
00:54:24,231 --> 00:54:28,370
when they realized that the
supersonics won a championship.

869
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,490
Dude, wait a minute. Do you not do,

870
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,900
do like not count that one now
because the sonics move to uh,

871
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,110
to Oklahoma City and became the thunder.

872
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,220
I don't understand that. Like, you know,

873
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:46,430
it was cool this weekend I saw somebody
in the crowd and a Minneapolis Lakers

874
00:54:46,431 --> 00:54:46,880
tee shirt.

875
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,260
I thought it was great and I was telling
them I go those five championships. I,

876
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:54,050
you know, as far as fans
go, you guys claim those,

877
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,220
the franchise, you know, has
the trophies but the fans,

878
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,840
those are your championships,
right?

879
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,830
Has to be passed to fucking be

880
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:13,720
if, if the Lakers moved to fucking Las
Vegas. So one again next, next year.

881
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,890
What would the, what would Los Angeles
fans do if they started going, yeah,

882
00:55:17,891 --> 00:55:21,970
we got 17 bitch. You'd be
like, well, wait a minute. No.

883
00:55:21,971 --> 00:55:25,180
16 of those one in La and
then Minneapolis fans.

884
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:29,620
We have now five of those
11 championships. One in La,

885
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,550
five, one in Minneapolis. One
of them was in the fucking Ba.

886
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:40,500
Oh Jesus. Bill, let it go, man. I go fuck
yourself. I like, I like being a cunt.

887
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:44,270
Um,
so yeah,

888
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,360
I mean women's championships don't
count as much because of women.

889
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,750
It's their fault.
It's their fault.

890
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,140
Okay.

891
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,970
Because guys don't sit around watching
the WWE NBA. We keep supporting the NBA.

892
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:05,180
What women need to do is say fuck the
NBA and just start watching the WNB ate.

893
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:09,900
And what they should be doing is they
should be selling out those arenas,

894
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,430
cheering on the women there.
That's who needs to do it.

895
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,373
Right.

896
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,670
Then they should all get together with
all their alimony money and they should

897
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:24,190
buy out the men that started the WWE
NBA and should run it themselves.

898
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:25,800
Yeah.

899
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,220
And then no longer do you need the
NFL to be wearing pink in October.

900
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,010
You could fucking be wearing
it all year and your league,

901
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:34,820
Jesus Christ.

902
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,680
I don't know if I just
solved some problems or a
offended everybody from cancer

903
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:44,280
survivors to uh,
people with the village over there.

904
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,000
Um, I don't give a fuck whatever, take,
take, take the podcast. Seriously. That's,

905
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,110
that's been happening lately.

906
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:53,560
The couple of native Americans get sent
me some angry tweets number a few weeks

907
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,190
ago when I was making fun of white
ignorance when I said that, uh,

908
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,210
Hawaii was not part of the United States
because no white people look right out

909
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:03,610
in Hawaii.
But you look fine on the mainland.

910
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,770
Like look leaning up against an oak tree.
I look fine and I'm like,

911
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:08,410
and I'm so sick and native American,
it's so,

912
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:12,630
I'm so sick of arguing with the patches.
I literally said that, that like,

913
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,780
like that wasn't enough. That wasn't
absurd enough for someone to get the joke.

914
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,910
People were, were like doing that,
you know, at Jim Norton Character,

915
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:24,520
a little literal gym. They
would, they were doing that like,

916
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:27,640
well the reason, well you look doable
cause you fucking killed all of us. Like,

917
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:32,360
I don't know that like I'm
somehow for that. I don't know.

918
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:36,380
Anyways, but whatever, continue to
take it seriously. I had actually,

919
00:57:36,381 --> 00:57:38,320
somebody wrote me last week,
I said they,

920
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,680
I said fighting like a pitbull
and somebody wrote this
woman wrote fighting like

921
00:57:42,681 --> 00:57:44,180
a pit bull.
Really?

922
00:57:44,181 --> 00:57:47,720
You fucked her hard and she went
on and on and on and on and on.

923
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:51,170
And I wanted to write back, well
like okay, I rescued a pit bull pit.

924
00:57:51,171 --> 00:57:55,850
Bulls were bred to fight
messiness. Right. Okay.

925
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,500
And lastly,
fuck Todd is a play on retard.

926
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:05,650
So it's okay to make fun of people who
are mentally challenged but not dogs get

927
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:10,430
twisted cunt. But I don't, I don't
write that back cause you know what?

928
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:14,930
They don't want Twitter. They don't
give you enough letters. Oh all right.

929
00:58:14,931 --> 00:58:19,550
The Art of baking dear billion billion.

930
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,170
As of late, I've been baking. I
would never know how to say this.

931
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,640
Scones sconces of the things that are on
the walls and I only reason why I know

932
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:32,630
that was because I had to say that
one time at an audition. Scones.

933
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:35,420
He said, all right, I'll just
say scones. I don't give a fuck.

934
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:39,050
As of lately I've been baking
scones and he, right, right. Oh,

935
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,780
Jay z's are they good?

936
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:46,000
I got the idea from you and your
lovely Pumpkin Pumpkin. Loafs uh,

937
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:49,450
you sound so pumped talking about your
baking and it made me want to try it.

938
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:53,730
It certainly adds another dimension,
uh, to my game with the leg.

939
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,830
Oh, absolutely do. Let me
tell you something. One
thing, one thing about women,

940
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:01,690
all right,

941
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:06,160
other than the fact that they do not
support other women playing basketball,

942
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,870
at least they don't do it enough.

943
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,070
The other thing about women
is they like fucking suites.

944
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,500
Yeah.

945
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,870
Okay.
They love a guy that can cook.

946
00:59:14,871 --> 00:59:18,110
If you can actually fucking
make something sugary,

947
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,570
it's great on two levels.
One,

948
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,630
it makes you seem like you're going
to be a good husband and father,

949
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,590
even if you're not, it just makes it seem
that way and they're more apt to bag.

950
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:32,660
Don't ask me why. I don't pretend to
understand them. Okay. And then secondly,

951
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:37,610
if you actually marry that woman when
she starts getting all fucking crampy,

952
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,390
you know, and getting all bitchy when
she gets the cramp toe still over there,

953
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,340
what you can do is just whip up a little
pumpkin bread, little sugar. Okay, you go,

954
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:49,040
here you go honey. Fuck machine in
her face. And then she, you know,

955
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:54,740
she's not as irritable.
It's an understandable
irritability. Don't get me wrong,

956
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:59,450
but believe me, I know there's a
lot of female comics will say, hey,

957
00:59:59,451 --> 01:00:02,300
if you started bleeding from you dick
once a month, you'd be complaining too.

958
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:06,440
Yeah, and if I did and you didn't,
you'd be bitching about my mood.

959
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,830
So go fuck yourself. All right.
Um, so anyways, he says, uh,

960
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,830
nothing twinkle toes about
baking to impress a girl. Yeah,

961
01:00:15,831 --> 01:00:18,530
it is. It's still very a
feminine baking is a feminine.

962
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,280
I don't care how you look at it.
There's nothing wrong with it.

963
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:25,610
You're getting in touch with your
feminine side. I'm so proud of you.

964
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,640
Here's another thing you can do.
Somebody sent me an email about this too.

965
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,400
You want to,
you want to really start slaying it.

966
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:36,401
If you have no fucking game and you need
to do something to make your franchise

967
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:38,060
look a little more attractive.

968
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:42,140
So maybe you can make one or two
big signings during this off season.

969
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,100
All right, learn how to
bake. And by all means,

970
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,530
take a fun start taking yoga classes.

971
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:52,720
Yoga classes are 98% women.
All right?

972
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:57,200
And I don't know what it is. Most of them
are fucking hot. Now a lot of you have,

973
01:00:57,201 --> 01:01:00,830
granted I've taken yoga classes
in New York City and Los Angeles.

974
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:04,700
So there there's that.
So knock that down by about 30%.

975
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:11,150
Um, and also a lot of them are career
driven. So there's not a lot of moms in,

976
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:15,800
there's a lot of single
women in their very limber,

977
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:19,460
fucked in the head. Women, you know
what? Fuck that. Scratch all that.

978
01:01:19,461 --> 01:01:23,150
Learn how to bake no matter where you are.
But take yoga and like Miami,

979
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,440
Take Yoga classes where there's going
to be a lot of hot women. They golf.

980
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:31,130
There's my stupid advice for
the week. Anyways, let's,
let's continue here. He said,

981
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:35,750
the ladies get turned on by a guy who can
cook slash bake because it exemplifies

982
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:39,980
our capability to follow instructions.
Parenthesis, recipe, and B,

983
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,760
they can tell by the texture that
you're good with your hands needing.

984
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,950
What are you gonna need?
Her titties

985
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:55,550
is fucking grabbing her ass
cheeks, you know, seven Lena.

986
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,080
Um, anyways, he says, thanks for letting
us in on that little secret. Hey Dude,

987
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:04,250
it's all you buddy. You fucking took
it and you ran with it. Um, yeah,

988
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:07,930
that's all that shit I'm telling
you right now. If you fucking,

989
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
if you want to upgrade the level of
ash and your life and you just look at

990
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:14,270
yourself in the mirror and you're like,

991
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:17,600
no matter what I do when I look at myself,
you know, I'm like, I'm like a six,

992
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:21,810
a five. If you, I'm Tony. If
you learn how to fucking big,

993
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:26,090
okay, just shit. You know what you do?

994
01:02:26,091 --> 01:02:28,890
You learn how to make shit that they
like to eat. What's that? What's those?

995
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,460
Looks like Lasagna. It looks like
a pie, but it has eggs in it.

996
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,590
Quiche.
That was a called.

997
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,520
I can never fucking remember the old way.

998
01:02:39,521 --> 01:02:42,330
I remember what that's called is I
remember the actor's Stacy Keach.

999
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,170
So that's the nickname for that shit.
Whenever I see it with Nia,

1000
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:50,190
like we'll come walking in and I'll
look at the breakfast options and then

1001
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:55,020
whenever I see it I just go stay and
she laughs for whatever fucking reason

1002
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,530
cause she gets my sense of humor.
So you've learned how to do that.

1003
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,600
Here's another one. All right. Learn
how to make red velvet pancakes.

1004
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,060
I swear to God,
I'm not saying every woman likes this,

1005
01:03:06,061 --> 01:03:11,061
but you just increased by 2% your chances
of some day banging a model if you

1006
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:15,030
know how to make red velvet pancakes,
okay?

1007
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:18,030
Some tall woman will come into your life.
I'm guaranteeing it right now.

1008
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:21,450
He got a 2% chance more.
She'll come into your life,

1009
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:25,350
she'll eat those red velvet pancakes.
Okay? She will quickly go to the bathroom,

1010
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:25,981
she will puke.

1011
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:30,540
I'm up and then jump on your
Dick and you're not even
going to give a fuck. Okay.

1012
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:33,930
Cause she's hard. Yeah, sorry. Um,

1013
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,700
that was disgusting on so
many levels. Anyways, he says,

1014
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:40,230
I'm looking forward to
seeing you in Ottawa.

1015
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:44,790
Hopefully you get a chance
to escape on the canal. Uh,

1016
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:48,000
Jesus Christ. If that doesn't sound
like the most feminine thing ever,

1017
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:49,290
I'll fucking do that in a second.

1018
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,770
He said you're always welcome to come
play hockey with us after the show.

1019
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:56,340
Get the fuck Outta here.
Where I want to play.

1020
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,210
I got two shows there I think.
Do Fuck that.

1021
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,030
If there's a game after the
show in Ottawa, I want in.

1022
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,950
Don't fuck me cause I'm,
I'm going to check my hockey shit.

1023
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,360
Are you going to be mad at me if I play?

1024
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,360
I have to play pond hockey with all my
hockey gear on because I'm in the middle

1025
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:16,260
of a tour. I can't crack my
skull, my knee or my elbow there.

1026
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,880
Um, to C'mon, let's do it and fight me.

1027
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:27,050
Can I come over your house? I feel
like the kid with no friends. I'll do.

1028
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,590
That'd be a great fucking youtube video.

1029
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:32,130
All you Canadian guys out there
like no hats on street clothes,

1030
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:34,560
skating all around me as I'm
out there looking like Robo Cop.

1031
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:37,920
Let's fucking do it.
Versie not knowing how to skate.

1032
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:41,790
Sitting there with a [inaudible] standing
on a frozen pond. I'm all over it.

1033
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,700
All right, there we
go. Here's one from um,

1034
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,530
about one of my favorite comedians
of all time, Doug Stanhope. He said,

1035
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:53,730
Bill heard you. Gotta you got gotta shout
out on Doug. Stan helps podcasts. Uh,

1036
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,780
what a great guy. I'll tell you
that Doug Stanhope, you know what?

1037
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,760
Biggest Heart in the fucking business.
He's just a great fucking guy.

1038
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,500
You really love about stand up.
He,

1039
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,760
he's one of the best
comics of all fucking time.

1040
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:11,200
Any still a fan of standup,

1041
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:15,000
like actually will sit there and enjoy
watching you. Sets of fucking thrill.

1042
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:19,390
Anytime that guy, he's given me
way too compliments a top shelf.

1043
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:23,080
That's the Johnny blue of
compliments, right? They're
getting that from Stan hope.

1044
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,573
Um,

1045
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:25,950
okay.

1046
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:28,380
He says, anytime I hear people
talk about your podcast,

1047
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,890
they say it's cool that you
do it by yourself and you
can somehow keep it funny.

1048
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:33,630
Love that you don't have guests.

1049
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,840
Except it'd be cool if you have
Stan hope on some time. Yes, I know.

1050
01:05:36,841 --> 01:05:40,620
We have to make that happen. I
promise you that will happen. In fact,

1051
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:45,210
I will text him at the end of this
podcast unless I forget and if I forget,

1052
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:47,330
it's not my fault because I have add.

1053
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:52,690
Oh Man. You know what? I
get to use it on my wife.

1054
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:54,360
That'll be the funniest fucking shit ever.

1055
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:58,670
I'm just going to start using it
as an excuse. And you know what?

1056
01:05:58,671 --> 01:06:01,460
She's going to laugh because
she has a great sense of humor,

1057
01:06:01,461 --> 01:06:06,461
but I'm going to do it until maybe five
days afterwards become already become

1058
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:10,280
annoying just because those last five
days, it'll be fun for me and I'm selfish.

1059
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:14,450
All right, Vermont. This one's
talking about for my bill.

1060
01:06:14,451 --> 01:06:19,010
I see you're coming to Vermont. Fucking
finally. No one ever comes up here.

1061
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,310
Yeah. Well what, why
would you think that is?

1062
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:26,180
How about the fact that you don't have
a comedy club? Unless it's part of a,

1063
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,540
it's like a function. Roman at a hotel.
The only time I ever performed in Vermont,

1064
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,340
I performed in a comedy zone in uh,
Burlington.

1065
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:35,890
Yeah,

1066
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:38,700
a long, long time ago. Like literally,

1067
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,780
was it eight coming up on
like 18 years ago? Like 18.

1068
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:49,220
Holy Fuck am I old?
Um,

1069
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:54,120
I'm getting like scary old. That
was 18 fucking years ago. Holy Shit.

1070
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:59,090
Holy Shit. Yeah. Well you guys don't
have a comedy club with their, what?

1071
01:06:59,091 --> 01:07:03,530
The 41 from me. All you have is that
beautiful land. You Syrup your foliage.

1072
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,680
Um,
it's not like I haven't come to Albany.

1073
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,250
Why don't you get in a car
and come down to civilization?

1074
01:07:10,251 --> 01:07:14,510
I got to go up there to your fucking
moonshine still. And he goes, he goes,

1075
01:07:14,511 --> 01:07:16,340
so how are you going to pass the time?

1076
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:20,750
I don't see you as someone who fantasizes
about shooting a moose. I know you're,

1077
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,540
you're drinking,
but Fremont has what's considered,

1078
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:27,410
I guess you meant not drinking,
but Vermont is considered, uh,

1079
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:31,910
what's considered the best beer in the
world right now? It's called heady topper.

1080
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,670
Holy Shit, Bill. It's good storage.

1081
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:38,540
Get their shipment Tuesday and sell
up by Wednesday. It's fucking awesome.

1082
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:42,950
Here's an article I'll give you guys the
link so they can sell out in the same

1083
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:45,860
day. Uh, also what, what are you x?

1084
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:50,410
What are your experiences
with Vermont? Um, I,

1085
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:53,390
I love Vermont am I, I'm a New
England guy. I grew up out there.

1086
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:57,710
I go to Vermont and I think I
would love to own a house up here.

1087
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:02,270
I'm sorry if I could somehow
survive in this business.

1088
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:06,070
Um,
you know,

1089
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,860
I would live in a p I would
live in a place like that.

1090
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,160
I think I would go a little bit crazy
cause I definitely need a little bit of

1091
01:08:12,161 --> 01:08:17,030
action. I def I liked the city. I mean
I'm a suburb guy. I'm not a country guy.

1092
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:19,700
So,
um,

1093
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:26,780
I dunno dude, that actually sounds great.
If I could get a fucking log cabin,

1094
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:32,640
I know you don't live in log cabins
out there, but uh, I don't, you know,

1095
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,010
it was fucking business.
I, you know, I'm tired man.

1096
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,870
I did a lot of roadwork
and the more road you do,

1097
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:43,030
just the more you,
you need a fucking vacation.

1098
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:45,160
But once you start selling tickets
on the road, you get afraid.

1099
01:08:45,161 --> 01:08:49,850
If I take a fucking week off, they
going to move on to the next guy. Um,

1100
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:55,160
you know, I actually had somebody, uh,

1101
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,960
some email I was reading and they were
complimenting my act and they said,

1102
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:01,811
hey bill,

1103
01:09:01,811 --> 01:09:06,220
do you ever think some young
whippersnappers going to
come along and pass shoe

1104
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:11,620
and replace you? Uh, absolutely.
Absolute fucking lutely.

1105
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:16,240
It always happens if Jordan
can get too old for the NBA.

1106
01:09:16,241 --> 01:09:19,420
I can't get too old for standup,
you know, at some point,

1107
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,380
no matter how much you stay informed,
you know,

1108
01:09:23,381 --> 01:09:26,110
you're going to be doing those
matinee shows with whoever's,

1109
01:09:26,111 --> 01:09:28,360
we'll still alive from
your fucking fan base.

1110
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:35,890
I don't mind it. Um,
it's supposed to happen.

1111
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,920
What I'm supposed to do is pickup the
comedy torch and run with it as far as I

1112
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:45,370
can. And when I collapsed, I
fucking hold it up like the dude,

1113
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:50,200
try not to spill his white Russian.
We've got a beverage here, man. Um,

1114
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,300
and then the next person comes along,

1115
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,540
they grab it and they run with
it and you fucking cheer him on.

1116
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:59,320
Tell him to take it to the next level.
And you know why that is sir?

1117
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:02,920
Because standup does not belong to me.
It's not mine.

1118
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,210
It's an art form. It's a privilege to be
able to do it and make a living at it.

1119
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:11,920
So I try to respect that and I'll do it
as long as I can, but like, you know,

1120
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,030
I mean shit,

1121
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:20,350
it fucking happens to everybody, which
is why I don't have the new cell phone.

1122
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:25,000
It's why I drive a seven year old. The
hybrid. I only have one fucking TV.

1123
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:29,150
You hear Echo Echo in my
fucking house because um,

1124
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:32,290
I all my money goes to pay
in this fucking thing down.

1125
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,610
So, uh, cause I know
that day's going to come.

1126
01:10:36,611 --> 01:10:38,830
That fucking day's going to come
where I'm going to be sitting there.

1127
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:42,880
You don't want me anymore.
But what about the show?

1128
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:46,720
I did 96 in Vermont. Um,
yeah, it happens to everybody.

1129
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:48,460
All right.

1130
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,550
I guess that's why he's supposed to have
kids some day so you can watch them,

1131
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,660
you know, pass it onto them.
That is one of my goals though.

1132
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,540
I never want to become some bitter person.
I always want to be cheering on.

1133
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,070
Okay,

1134
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:06,160
whoever's coming next, you know,
that's the way you should be.

1135
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,400
You shouldn't be a fucking
Dick about it. Um, you know,

1136
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:13,770
and then also knowing that they're
coming, that drives you like,

1137
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,710
let's see how long I can keep these
fucking plates spinning before they,

1138
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:21,060
and eventually my arms are gonna get
tired and we read them. We finished. Ah,

1139
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:23,970
Jesus. That's depressing. Whatever. What
are you gonna do? All right. Swimming.

1140
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,930
Hey Billy White thighs. Ah,
Shit. That one actually hurts.

1141
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,300
It's fucking true fucking
wallpaper piece there. Um,

1142
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,730
do you ever think about installing
a lap pool? Yes, I have.

1143
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,120
Before we bought this house, I looked
at another house and they had it there.

1144
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:42,870
I didn't like the house, but I love
that. I think that that would be great.

1145
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:47,240
Not like a lap pool. You mean like
the thing where you basically,

1146
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,850
it's like long enough for you to lay down,

1147
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:54,630
unless you're a basketball player and
just start swimming and you're swimming

1148
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:57,030
against this current one of those ones.

1149
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,540
What do you mean literally
a pool he says anyways,

1150
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,040
or maybe joining a gym that has a pool.
It's a full body workout.

1151
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:08,040
Anytime I see old dude's swimming,
I imagine they're really healthy.

1152
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,310
I knew stormers in college and
they ate and drank like animals,

1153
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:14,820
but they were always really cut
because they swam miles every day.

1154
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,080
I think the hardest part of getting into
the gym and to a gym pool routine is

1155
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:21,060
having to see other people.
Also,

1156
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:25,650
the first few times when you're
inevitably tired, after half a lap,

1157
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,330
plus there's no sharks in the water.
Um,

1158
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:33,720
I love what you guys even write it in
the Boston accent now be said so we don't

1159
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:36,180
have to hear you cry
about your inner fears.

1160
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:40,380
My interferes is getting old and weak.
So I started swimming and it's great.

1161
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:44,610
Uh, see how we brought that back
around. Very nice. Very nice.

1162
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:50,160
Um, yeah, no, dude, you're
doing yourself a service.

1163
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,320
You really are.
Uh,

1164
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:57,380
I am a firm belief that you
should work out your entire life.

1165
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:00,510
We should always do it.
I mean,

1166
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:05,060
I'm not saying go out and still play
full court basketball. I mean, in your,

1167
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:09,900
even your thirties or 50s, just get Shin
splints. It's fucking up your feet. Uh,

1168
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:14,810
I think that you should do some form
of exercising. I love swimming. I, um,

1169
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,550
I,
I am concerned about,

1170
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:21,960
I guess Olympic swimmers haven't died
of any cancer. So the chlorine I guess,

1171
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:25,680
isn't that bad. But that is one
thing when you jump into a pool,

1172
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:27,360
you're jumping into a bunch of chemicals,

1173
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,580
but I guess that's better
than jumping into a,

1174
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:34,590
you know what the chemicals are killing.
So we'll leave it at that. Yeah.

1175
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,370
You know what?
You don't want to look that up right now.

1176
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,030
Let's look up what one of those
little stationary lap things are.

1177
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:45,660
See what this is for the
person who has everything.

1178
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:49,350
And then I want to do what might the
final advertising for this fucking week.

1179
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:55,020
All right, what do we got
here? Let's see here. Lap Pool.

1180
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:59,900
Let me just look this up. Oh, there it is.

1181
01:14:00,290 --> 01:14:04,010
Cost of lap pools. What? Fuck you

1182
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,800
get the fuck Outta here.
This is 17 foot swim.

1183
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:15,370
Spa is $23,900.

1184
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,110
They call it an endless pool.

1185
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:25,300
Are you fucking kidding
me? Oh, Jesus Christ.

1186
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,970
All this shit just popped up
when I went on this website.

1187
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,910
Now I know I'm going to get
all these fucking spam emails

1188
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:37,720
about endless pool fucking
yeah,

1189
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:38,610
we'll ever see this.

1190
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:43,850
The 17 foot endless pool spa features
a large exercise area that is ideal for

1191
01:14:45,061 --> 01:14:45,894
swimming,

1192
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:50,760
aquatic exercise and fun with easy access,

1193
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:56,160
full depth stairs and up to two jets.
And with over 20 jets,

1194
01:14:56,161 --> 01:14:58,290
you can exercise,

1195
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:02,220
relax and enjoy increased
family time in the Convenia.

1196
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,100
You ever want to Piss with your whole
family? Let's get a lap pool. Um,

1197
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:09,390
improve your health and wellbeing
on an endless pool. Right?

1198
01:15:09,391 --> 01:15:12,960
Here's the dimensions.
17 feet,

1199
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:18,260
bye. Uh, well I guess now they're
doing an interest to 204 inches,

1200
01:15:18,261 --> 01:15:23,261
which comes out to 17 feet by 91 and
a half inches by 54 and a half inches.

1201
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:31,260
I guess that's how deep
it is. Hey, what the fuck?

1202
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:33,690
I don't even want to say in the 54
south, five feet deep, isn't it?

1203
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,630
What does that four feet,
four and a half.

1204
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:42,750
I love this shit here.

1205
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:46,830
This thing is $23,000 and they have a
little button here that says add to the

1206
01:15:46,831 --> 01:15:51,650
cart like this other shit that you're
going to be getting with this. All right.

1207
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:56,380
They have a 10 foot one.
Oh my God.

1208
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,950
Oh Shit. This is, you might as well
just to use that place to take a dump.

1209
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:03,850
How much is this one

1210
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:12,100
add to cart? 15,009 A. Fuck you.

1211
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,870
I'll go jump on a god damn dirty pond.

1212
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:19,310
I guess it is amazing that you,
you're, you're, you're, you.

1213
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,340
You're literally swimming against
the current. That doesn't exist.

1214
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,630
Alright, hit. Now you get
into some cheaper ones here.
Here's, here's the fucking,

1215
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:33,530
the high day version for 10 grand.
Oh,

1216
01:16:33,531 --> 01:16:38,300
that thing's a joke. What
is it? Is that a hot tub?

1217
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:42,380
Oh, go fuck yourself. Well, yeah.
You know, I guess I thought about it.

1218
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,020
I've definitely thought about,
now that I know how much it costs,

1219
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,021
Holy Shit.

1220
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:50,660
I have to take a fucking second mortgage
on my house to get one of those.

1221
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:56,540
They are coolest shit though. Images for
lap pools. Dude, why did you do this?

1222
01:16:56,541 --> 01:16:58,880
Now I'm getting now I'm going to sit here.
Look at that one.

1223
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:03,720
That looks like a real pool.
Oh, that is a real pool.

1224
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,940
Who the fuck lives here? Mark? Spitz

1225
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:16,560
keeping fit with home lap pool.
That's it.

1226
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,430
Now you don't give a fuck about your kids.
If you got one of those,

1227
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,610
you get this skinny pool that nobody
can jump into without breaking their

1228
01:17:23,611 --> 01:17:27,860
goddamn next. And it's for you
and your fucking gray chest hair.

1229
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:30,311
Oh,
whatever you do.

1230
01:17:30,311 --> 01:17:32,590
You guys really want to sit here and
listen to me fucking reading about lap

1231
01:17:32,591 --> 01:17:37,390
pools while those things
are cool as hell though. Um,

1232
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:38,460
yeah,
I,

1233
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,230
I thought about getting one until I saw
how much they were and now that I know

1234
01:17:41,231 --> 01:17:45,460
how much they are, I am not. I am no
longer interested. I need a friend.

1235
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:50,800
I need a rich friend with a
fucking lap pool. Good Lord.

1236
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,890
Just a pool in general.
How fucking cool is that

1237
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:03,830
fucking indoor pool? Indoor
lap pool. Who's his fucking
banker who has this shit?

1238
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:09,300
Indoor lap pool?
You know,

1239
01:18:09,301 --> 01:18:12,300
it's funny with me. I would do.
I would get one of those. Okay.

1240
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:13,350
Let's just say I could afford that.

1241
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:16,260
I get one of those fucking
things and then within

1242
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:22,320
a month I'd be bored and I
would go and do something else.

1243
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,203
I'm the worst.

1244
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:25,570
Okay.

1245
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:28,540
I'd still owe all that money.
Tranquil lap pool.

1246
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,410
Jesus Christ. You know what? I'm
going to look at these fucking things.

1247
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:38,420
Anybody out there sell lap pools?
How many fucking,

1248
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,490
how many of these do you sell a month?

1249
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,400
Jesus Christ.

1250
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:52,280
I'm going to get it on one of those
fucking home makeover shows. All right.

1251
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:57,930
I want to have him Redo the wiring in my
house and fucking put in a lap pool and

1252
01:18:58,681 --> 01:19:01,680
then I'll go there and I'll
fucking act. Oh my God. A lap pool.

1253
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,060
Jump around and hug everybody

1254
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,780

this show is. All right. Who gives a fuck?

1255

All right. Anyways, that's the, uh, that's

learned something. I hope it was funny,

1257
01:19:23,071 --> 01:19:25,560

And if you didn't learn anything,

1258
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:29,640

a d d o media. Ah, that's it.

1259

That's a podcast for this week.

gate and curling and all that shit.

1261
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:42,180
Enjoy the Olympics. You know,
