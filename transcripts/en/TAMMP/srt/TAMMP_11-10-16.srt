1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,920
Hey, what's going on? It's spill. Burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:09,750
Just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast and Ah, I'm checking in on.

3
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:13,050
Yeah, I'm just checking in on you.
I really need to check in on you.

4
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:16,680
At least half of you. A little
less than half old jeans, shoes.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,430
Make sure you guys are right. There's
a lot of crying going on out there.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,560
Jesus fucking Christ.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,740
I've never seen so many fucking
adults crying in my life.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,530
What is with all the fucking crying?
I get it. Your person didn't win,

9
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:41,250
but Jesus Christ,
you're making the left look horrible.

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,290
Going to Canada.

11
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:46,370
I love this shit where people
like threatening like share,

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,710
share goes, if Trump wins, I'm going to
go to Canada. It's like, who gives a fuck?

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,010
You know?
I don't even know you were still here.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,310
Look, I'm not saying I'm happy. I wasn't
happy with either one of these people.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,670
Right?
Um,

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,820
but the level of fucking arrogance of
celebrities during all of this shit was

17
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,270
just, it's such a, a whole other level.

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,410
Do you realize how fucking arrogant
you are that you're making this?

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,790
You basically, you're threatening that
if, if your candidate doesn't get in,

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,140
your going to leave the country
and your ego is so fucking big.

21
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:29,130
You think somebody going like,
well, I want to vote for Trump,

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,160
but if he gets elected,
we lose share.

23
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,470
Okay,

24
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,530
I got you babe.
The Fuck Outta here.

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,870
Heard Barbara Streisand.
Really?

26
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,720
You're going to leave fucking
Malibu to go live in Manitoba.

27
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,330
Railey you fucking

28
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,850
go ahead and do it.
I'll give you 40 bucks for your house.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,540
They don't only get yet that 9,000
fucking acres up there. Go ahead. Go, go,

30
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,420
move up to yellow knife.
The dumbest shit.

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,640
But I literally think like that's the
level of ego that you have to have as like

32
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:14,210
an actor or a comedian or something like
that. Literally too. I mean, I know,

33
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,260
I guess I talk about it,
but you know, I fuck around.

34
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,400
I trashed replied now I told you
guys who to vote for or whatever.

35
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,950
I just trashed them both.
I tried to evenly,

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,960
but that fucking level that people take
it to where they just start. Uh, you know,

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,270
I kinda of was, I was on
Conan last night, which was a,

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,470
it was a really difficult show
to do last night because, uh,

39
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,300
you know, you know, people are like
fucking stunned out here. They can,

40
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:43,040
they can't believe it, um, as, I can't
believe it in San Francisco, Berkeley,

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,580
fucking New York City and
all that type of shit. Um,

42
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,530
so it was kind of weird. I, it was like
going on like right after a funeral.

43
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,540
I felt so. Um, but, uh, I really
think this is just my own opinion.

44
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:01,540
What do you guys, what do you guys
think about celebrities endorsing a,

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,450
uh, a candidate? Because
I think the candidates,

46
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:10,870
they also kind of reach out to
people a little bit. Like I, like, I,

47
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,190
I've never understood that. Like,
why would I be like, you know,

48
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,090
who was some of the people,
you know,

49
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,770
some of the fucking people
that have done it. Like I just,

50
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:21,580
I just don't understand. It's, Oh you
know I was going to vote this way.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,170
But the guy from my three kings told me
to do all the other movie where he tries

52
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,250
to get the sky miles.

53
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,580
The Guy who did the movie about this
guy getting the sky miles is telling me

54
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,850
this should be the person
to lead the free world.

55
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,260
You know I got a lot of
feelings are not gun control,

56
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:41,290
but let me check in with Sean Penn first.
See what he has to say.

57
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,350
The level of fucking arrogance

58
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,010
that you have to have. I don't know. It's
a fine line cause it's like, all right,

59
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:55,490
well it's good that they're involved
politically, but like you know,

60
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:58,640
there's a lot that once you're famous
then they're actually going to put a

61
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:01,190
camera on you, then you're going to start
talking. You know, it's the same thing.

62
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,370
It's when you become a huge
fan of your team. You're,

63
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:08,400
you're a big fan of your
team, right? And you know,

64
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:11,370
you're always sitting up in the nosebleeds
and then all of a sudden you get a

65
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:15,090
part on a Sitcom and then they got you
sitting down there and then your team's

66
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:16,350
doing well.
And next thing you know,

67
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:20,370
this sticking the microphone
in the face of an actor, right?

68
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:22,620
To be or not to be a,

69
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,250
what do you think buffalo has to
do here in the second half? Well,

70
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:29,490
he took like to see you have your
checking down a little bit. It's like,

71
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,170
I don't, I don't understand. I mean it's,
you know what, in defense of celebrities,

72
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:40,490
regular people do the same thing on the
news and they get away with it cause you

73
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:45,350
don't know what their names are. You
see it all the time on these, uh,

74
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,260
you know, when you watched the news, if
he ever watched the news, they always go,

75
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:49,360
yeah,

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,890
we went out on the street to ask people
what they thought about this new target

77
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:58,530
that's going on. I think it's going
to take away jobs. You know what,

78
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,850
just think to downtown area, we don't
need that. There's always that fucker

79
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,310
Parson. Right. So maybe that's what it is.

80
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,000
That's that person is no different than
any of those other people. It's just,

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,370
I don't know.
I think once you get to a certain level,

82
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,190
you kind of need to
gracefully shut the fuck up.

83
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,510
All right.
Having said that,

84
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,900
has anybody explained to me why they're
making such a big deal about the

85
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:28,230
transition of power
here is far as you know,

86
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,640
we hope that it's going to be graceful
and we hope that it's going to be the,

87
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:36,870
when Obama came in, George Bush
was very graceful, gracious.

88
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,130
He was very blood. They all, they all
were my entire life. I've never, you know,

89
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,470
Reagan did knock on the White House
door and Jimmy was just like, Hey,

90
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,390
get the fuck out here.

91
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,930
There's literally camera's on.
That's another thing too.

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,820
There's cameras filming you
as this transition happens.

93
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,650
Everybody, everybody's always, you
know, you're going to be grace gracious.

94
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,080
They know we'll look, you know, they
don't like each other. You know,

95
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,980
this one's going to be particularly
fucking weird, you know,

96
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,981
considering the sizable overtly
racist individuals that,

97
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,313
you know,

98
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,020
I don't know what the fuck they were
here but they gravitated towards Trump.

99
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,050
So considering,
you know,

100
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,130
Brock being the first black
president to now let this guy into,

101
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,210
I dunno, according to
people I hear it. I don't,

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
I mean fucking looked it up
was endorsed by the client.

103
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,440
This is just fucking nuts.
Well that's it.

104
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,280
That was the end.

105
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,910
It's the end and now it's over and
now everybody can fucking move on.

106
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,080
And um, you know, I got, I,

107
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:55,790
I did Conan last night. I think a, I
think it went as well as it could have,

108
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,260
have gone and then of course, you know,
I get people giving me shit. You know,

109
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
I was trying to say, look,
whoever is president,

110
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,710
it's not really going to affect my fucking
day to day. And then of course you,

111
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,890
it's good you fucking white
guy over there. It's like,
yeah, I get it, I get it,

112
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,510
I get it. But your day to day,
your day to day, this is my,

113
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:18,650
and this is supposed to be
uplifting by the way. All right.

114
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,180
Knowing full well that the
world isn't fair. Okay.

115
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,560
And that some people start Waif
closer to the finish line than others.

116
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,750
That's just how it is.
All right.

117
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,560
And there's advantages and
disadvantages to that. You know,

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,060
if you got to run further, you always
think that other guy. Yeah, he's fucking,

119
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,240
he's all he's got to do is just fucking
go fright from there to there. Right?

120
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,220
And you see all these fucking rich kids,

121
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,070
they got drug fucking problems
because they have no worries in life.

122
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,900
That fucking right alerts
and all that type of shit.

123
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,590
Everybody wants to think if you filthy
stinking fucking rich that you just

124
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,450
skipped around and your
life is fucking awesome. Um,

125
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,730
I've done enough corporate gigs to see
that there's not a lot of happiness over

126
00:07:58,731 --> 00:07:59,564
there.

127
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,000
They're fucking week really rich people.
I got to tell you out in Malibu,

128
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,450
you know, Neil always wants to go out
to Malibu. She loves the fucking beach.

129
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:14,100
And we go out there and his fucking, you
know, the seaside restaurants and shit.

130
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,620
You know, what's your cool, it's great.
You're fucking watch people surfing.

131
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,440
It's awesome.
He go,

132
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,620
you have a couple of crab legs and
then you get the fuck out of there.

133
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,360
But there's a mall over there. All right.
The Malibu Mall, whatever the fuck.

134
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:26,670
He go over there and I'm just telling you,
the people over there,

135
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:30,270
I cannot put my finger on it.
They are fucking weird,

136
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,920
really rich people. There's, there's
some sort of fucking disconnect.

137
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,750
I don't know what's going on with them.
They just, I said to me, I go, what?

138
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,680
What is, what the fuck is
with these people? There's
no vibe. There's no laughing,

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,700
what's going on? And she
just, she goes, the board.

140
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,780
Okay.

141
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,200
That's what it is. I Dunno.
I Dunno. I did gigs. Um,

142
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,353
um,

143
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,040
okay.

144
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,860
Way Back in the day,
I did some gigs out on the Hamptons,

145
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,720
another place with like super rich
people and they just fucking weird.

146
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,970
They'd sit there and they
all look at each other.

147
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:06,960
They're looking you up and down.

148
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,090
Like I showed up and immediately
they would just like, all right,

149
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:13,980
this guy's in here for the day is a day
tripper. So look at his fucking sneakers.

150
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,700
Uh, we'll get his fucking orange
Afro. Nobody has red hair.

151
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:21,180
Makes it in this world for them
at Donald Trump on the fuck.

152
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:24,180
Did he go from a Brunette to fucking
look in like me in seventh grade?

153
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,610
I don't understand it.
Um,

154
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,220
okay.

155
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,180
Anyways, but yeah, you, you make your
own fucking opportunity and I think, uh,

156
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,810
it's depressing is that, is it,
I always looked at that like a

157
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,260
okay.

158
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,800
I Dunno. I always try to see
like what the fuck I can do. Um,

159
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,580
I just can't believe the, all the names
that I'm hearing now, if Jesus Christ,

160
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,840
Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani,
these fucking guys are coming back.

161
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,761
Jesus Christ,

162
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:57,480
that's like that Stallone movie where he
took all the fucking action heroes from

163
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:01,470
back in the day Seagal and they all
got to be level one last fucking thing.

164
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,410
Unless it's a head that will
make like three of them.

165
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,290
What was that called though?
Fucking last gladiator action.

166
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,730
Hero to fucking, I dunno, drink
your juice in the hood. I,

167
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:17,940
what the fuck would they expendables.
Yeah. This is like, he's bringing back,

168
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,800
this is like the Republican expendables.

169
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,140
He's bringing all these guys back trying
to think of another classic name he's

170
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:29,550
got to go for from way back in the day.
Somebody didn't die,

171
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,730
I dunno, whatever, but she
knows something. It's over.

172
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,500
Get on with your fucking
lives. And uh, you know,

173
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,710
okay,

174
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,010
there's all these protests at colleges.
I don't know what they're protesting.

175
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:44,200
I don't quite get it.
It's like there was an election.

176
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,650
It was legal and your person lost.
Um,

177
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,640
I guess they're just voicing
their displeasure with the
fact that this guy's in

178
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:52,270
there. I, dude,

179
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,250
I cannot fucking believe that the host
of the apprentice is now president of the

180
00:10:57,251 --> 00:11:00,040
United States and that people
are this excited and hopeful.

181
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,540
Half the country is excited and hopeful.
You know what I mean?

182
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,453
Okay.

183
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,080
You know, the most amazing thing ever,
our broke ass people that are Republicans,

184
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:14,830
that's the most amazing
fucking thing on the planet.

185
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:18,750
So you guys in, guys, he's going
to make it great again for you.

186
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,570
All right? Please keep checking
in on me throughout the years.

187
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:27,190
I want to know how your life into
individually will become great again.

188
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,390
Oh, this country will become great again,
so then your life will be great again.

189
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,380
All those fucking people who
are gallop in sideways. Um,

190
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,313
okay.

191
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,830
I love how he wants to fuck it.
He doesn't want to have healthcare,

192
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,520
but he wants to build a fucking
wall from California or Mexico.

193
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,640
Oh, how much money is that
gonna fucking cost? Who?

194
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,490
The job that's going to create the
fuck Outta here? That's a death.

195
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,040
A government job. Do you know? Bet All of
these fucking, you know something. That's

196
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,030
one thing that they'll never police,
but that fucking bullshit.

197
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,320
Where these contractors,

198
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:03,760
they get these government jobs to build
shit and they charge 10 times the amount

199
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,594
that they should,

200
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,010
and these politicians just throw the
fucking money around and they don't give a

201
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:13,000
fuck, or they have to do it.
Whatever the deal is. You know,

202
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,640
like the math on this whole thing.
Do you realize like $7 billion was spent

203
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,050
okay

204
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,740
to get somebody a job that
pays 500 grand a fucking year?

205
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,150
You know why? Cause I bet it was, I bet
it was a bunch of people that build forms,

206
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,110
you know, foundations and shit. That's
what, you know, they were like, oh man,

207
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:37,130
I gotta get that. I gotta I gotta
build the wall, man. You know,

208
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,950
some go with the fucking rusted.
I'll pick up truck, dude.

209
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:46,610
If I get Jack Fuck a job,
oh I love problems are going to be over.

210
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,630
I'll be building that for
the rest of my life. Um,

211
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,270
what a fucking crazy God damn time.
You know,

212
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,510
everybody wondering how
the fuck this happened.

213
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:03,150
I think you know what it is is people
are still digging out of what happened in

214
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:07,080
2008 and it would have been nice if one
of these fucking pussy politicians would

215
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:12,060
have said something about the
fucking bankers, you know? Um,

216
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,860
I dunno. We will see what
happens, but uh, yeah,

217
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,370
boy. Oh boy. I'll tell you.
You know, it was great though.

218
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:23,010
It was when I went to go to the
electors to vote I fucking head.

219
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,390
I looked through all the fucking, uh,
propositions, everything. I had all my,

220
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,550
filled it all out,
like a fucking old lady.

221
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,500
And I went in there and I was just
like, Bang, Bang, boom, boom, boom. I,

222
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,430
I blew through the whole thing,
knew exactly what I wanted to vote for,

223
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,820
actually felt a mildly informed this time.

224
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,250
Um,
so

225
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,140
he just showed up in his own fucking
plank. This guy's a gangster.

226
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,980
I'm literally,
we shall see.

227
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:56,820
You know what's funny is my
wife had on MSNBC, by the way,

228
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:58,340
you know what I was doing
during the election.

229
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,940
I just kept flipping back and forth to
like, uh, who, if whoever was losing,

230
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,360
I would start watching them. I
would put on like CNN, you know,

231
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,370
I put head on Fox at first
in the beginning and once
they started looking like

232
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:18,690
they were winning and they were surprised,
then I went over to a,

233
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,760
the CNN thing and then I went
down to the comedy store and, uh,

234
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,300
did Doug Stan hopes live podcast and a I,

235
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,870
that was the most amazing election I've
ever fucking seen. That it was like,

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,000
it was riveting for hours.
It never got boring. Um,

237
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,790
and as much as I don't like
Trump, I didn't like Hillary
either. Uh, I have to say,

238
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,150
watching people crying,
um,

239
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,860
uh, white people, I wouldn't
say white people. If I see
somebody of crying, my God,

240
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:55,070
Jesus, this is brutal, but
just somebody white crying,

241
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,140
it's like I'm still white in America.
Um,

242
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,180
there was just something
funny about that to me,

243
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,420
like people hugging and stuff.
Um,

244
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,530
blew my mind, blew my mind. How many
people just still look at Hillary Clinton.

245
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:16,130
Like she's not a complete dishonest piece
of shit and like the best I could get

246
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:20,030
anybody to say, he's like, yeah,
but they're all like death. Um,

247
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,950
all right. Are you guys done? I'm
done enough with this shit. All right,

248
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,550
let's watch the gracious,
the Obamas, they,

249
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:31,820
where they shook hands,
they were very gracious.

250
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:35,090
And this is what makes the United
States, the United States, this,

251
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,890
this peaceful passing of power.
This is what makes the Americas,

252
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:41,570
the United States of America.

253
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,350
I don't know why this is like
such an amazing fucking thing.

254
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:53,351
This is just like just a different head
that's owned by the same what fucking 20

255
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:57,710
corporations out pill with your hacky
conspiracy theory. But isn't it?

256
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,630
Isn't that what it is?
Well, isn't it? Um, anyways,

257
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,250
let's move on everybody.

258
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,920
Let's move on to a little bit
of bread and circus there. Um,

259
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,720
so this, guess what just went on
sale? Everybody, um, as of yesterday,

260
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:18,690
promoted it on, on the Conan
show, uh, Conan O'brien show, um,

261
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,020
the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal comedy
benefit as always at the New York City

262
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:28,970
Center. Uh, tickets are already on
sale. Once we pay for the house.

263
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,090
All the money goes to his, uh, his
mother and his family. And, um,

264
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,600
it's been such a great event
that we do every year. And,

265
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:43,340
um,
and has had an amazing effect on,

266
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,020
uh, on people's lives that he
loved. It's been a great thing. And,

267
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:52,160
um, as I've said year after year,
the reason why we do whatever years,

268
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:56,810
cause I always hate when somebody,
somebody passes and it's just like,

269
00:16:56,811 --> 00:17:00,740
you do like that one fucking benefit.
Like, okay, here's a sack, a loot.

270
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,760
I hope this will last you for
the next 60 fucking years. Um,

271
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,420
we all love poetry so much that we all
decided that we were going to do it every

272
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:11,990
year and um, make sure that, uh,

273
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,320
we continued to take care of the people
that he was taken care of and the people

274
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:19,100
that he loved. So, um, it
is, it is a great cause.

275
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,580
It is 100% honest.
It's something you can get behind.

276
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,320
None of the comedians are going to be
dressed in pink. None of that shit.

277
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,950
You know, it'll be a, it'll
be a great thing. And, um,

278
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,230
I'm also doing a, the comp come
home benefit with Denis Leary,

279
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:41,120
Cam Neely, uh, this
weekend and um, oh Jesus.

280
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,860
Oh Jesus did fucking Billy red faced
by some cigars. Holy fucking shit.

281
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,130
I've never a smoked these before,
but um,

282
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,280
I'm not going to tell you
where I got them. I'll see you.

283
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,720
[inaudible] I took a picture of him here.

284
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,790
I actually left them down in the
fucking humor. Do are there did,

285
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,340
why is this fucking phone
so difficult with me? Um,

286
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,150
a reality TV show star people with an
orange toupee is now going to be the

287
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:10,850
leader of the free world.
That's what you did.

288
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,830
And half of the country feels good
about us. I can't fucking believe it.

289
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,260
Uh, Jesus. You know what it is?

290
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:24,110
It's just none of it is really that funny.
It's just not funny.

291
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:28,880
The whole thing was just how to fuck
a on the right and the left people.

292
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,420
How to fuck did we end up with those two?
How did that happen?

293
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:37,160
I just kept thinking back, but like
all the fucking candidates just stunk.

294
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,400
God, they stunk. That cutie
pie in our camel hair coat.
The fuck is she doing now?

295
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:47,390
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I got an MSNBC here.

296
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,430
Where the hell is the God damn camera
here? All right. There it is. There it is.

297
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,200
Okay. It's Ah, fuck.

298
00:18:55,201 --> 00:19:00,201
It's a blurry goddamn picture or
more old [inaudible] del I fuck,

299
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,510
I can't read it. I took a blurry
picture of it and then he thought if I,

300
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:10,830
if I zoomed in it would
somehow get better. Um,

301
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,810
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

302
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,240
Okay.

303
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,270
Sorry.
Sorry again.

304
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,680
The fuck is it? Oh, there it is. Okay.

305
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,970
[inaudible] de Monterrey Monterri Siri,

306
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,950
La Jolla and apologies to anybody
Latino listened to this 56 ring gauge.

307
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:36,110
It's like a fucking two hours smoke.

308
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,790
I got a fucking box of those God damn
things and bringing it to comics.

309
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,720
Come home and I'm hoping there's
going to be some cigar smokers there.

310
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,090
Um, oh, it's going to be such
a great event. Going to be
a great event. So anyways,

311
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,990
I have not been paying attention to shit,
uh,

312
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,120
been editing my new fucking special and a,

313
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:59,330
I'm probably going to add another fucking
standup date while I'm out here as I'm

314
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,760
waiting for my kitchen to get done,
which still has not done.

315
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:03,710
It was supposed to be done
by now, but then, you know,

316
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,420
we ran into the cloth
wiring, so, uh, you know,

317
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,120
and then the place we were staying
at the haunted fucking house,

318
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,090
the person won't, it came back. So
now we're, we're in a hotel and uh,

319
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,180
it has a little kitchen, right. So
I keep saying the Nia, you know,

320
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,380
it's fucking hilarious. It has this
little kitchen and as pots and pans,

321
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:28,520
but it has no spatula, had nothing
that you could fucking cook with.

322
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:32,650
It's hilarious.
They just had like the pants and um,

323
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,190
so I was like, oh, I see that fucking
game plan. They're going to act like this,

324
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,080
a kitchen and they're not going to
give me any fucking shit. You know,

325
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,340
they're gonna have a couple of props.

326
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:43,430
It's looks like a Goddamn
like sit-com kitchen.

327
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,700
They've got a couple of glasses up front
and then there's like nothing else.

328
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,070
Even the cereal bowls I like so
fucking shallow. It's like a,

329
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,950
it's like a deep plate, you know,
you pour a little bit of milk in.

330
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:55,360
It's already going over the sides.

331
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,870
So I drove back to my house and got all
my fucking tongs and spatulas and all

332
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:04,450
that type of ship. And now
I'm viewing it like, um,

333
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,220
I'm going to try to beat them at their
own game. Right. Because, you know,

334
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:10,510
stay in the hotels. Fucking expensive,
right? So Nia keeps filling an order,

335
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,870
goddamn room service. And I
keep saying to, I was like, Nia,

336
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,320
every time we eat in the kitchen,
all right,

337
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:21,730
the terrorist loose. Okay. This, this is
a victory for us. I fucking, I haven't,

338
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,260
I have not enjoyed food the way I have
when you are in a fucking hotel and you

339
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:30,700
actually buy food, you know, and start
cooking up, made eggs the other day.

340
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,970
Right? Simple Shit.
Just filling myself up.

341
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,140
I still got that fucking elk
that Rogan gave me. You know,

342
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,830
I made a little American shops,
so we with that shit. And um,

343
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,880
now my wife, she's telling me, let's go
downstairs. I'll meet you downstairs.

344
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,850
You know, they just love, like, women
are hilarious. They just love that whole,

345
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:56,140
the whole scene, right? Oh, they
kind like a fountain down there.

346
00:21:56,141 --> 00:22:00,520
And you said [inaudible].
They have like a little tent.

347
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,710
His Nice.
Why don't you want to come to town?

348
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:06,850
We just wear you down.

349
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,630
Okay.

350
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,260
You just like quiz. It's like fucking
nine zillion dollars for fucking eggs.

351
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,440
I know, but it's nice. Fuck. All right,

352
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,080
fine. All right, here we go. The
NHL this without trying to get to,

353
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:28,910
we got the Columbus blue jackets,
all the, uh, the Boston Bruins.

354
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:32,000
Maybe I can finally watch a fucking game.
You know,

355
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,150
maybe at the fucking NHL network here.
Something

356
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,450
I don't fucking know.
I don't even know the folks on our team.

357
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:44,451
All I know is our first line as far
as I remember was Marshawn Burgi and a

358
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,040
pastor knocking. I don't know what
the fuck else is on the thing.

359
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,440
Bruins forwards d more.
No idea. Patrice Bergeron

360
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,380
back as we had last year.
David Cray, g Brad Marshawn.

361
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,680
Boleski sback Nash. I don't know
who the fuck that is. Jimmy,

362
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,780
Jimmy Hayes. Ryan's Buddha. T Shaller.

363
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,760
No idea. Posture. Knuck

364
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:10,780
okay.

365
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,330
Scissor. Nick Zernike. No idea.

366
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,470
Okay.

367
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,320
And I don't know anybody else.
Somebody's got Mila. CIARA McQuaid.

368
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,980
Okay. Both millers to crew, crew, expat,
both millers it back, crooks back.

369
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,420
Mcquade Shara,
I don't know.

370
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,230
Do we never fucking recovered,
man?

371
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,330
Whatever that fucking move was to free
up all the salary cap money. Yeah.

372
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,900
When we just basically imploded the team.
We're two years into this shit.

373
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,090
I don't know. It just
seems like it's, this is,

374
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,890
it's the same as like last
year as far as like the level

375
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,120
that we're at, where we're
going to, I don't know.

376
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,540
Joe Barton [inaudible] said it best.
He goes,

377
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,480
you did the worst fucking
thing you could do is you, you,

378
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,420
you missed the playoffs on the last day,

379
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:59,180
so he lost all the playoff
revenue and then you're going to,

380
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,480
and you're not going to be, you didn't
suck, so you could be like fucking,

381
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,461
you know,

382
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:09,461
Toronto and have a shot at
someone like a Austin Matthews,

383
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:13,270
you know,
whatever the fuck are you going to do.

384
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,870
As long as the Canadians don't win and
I'm happy, I'm a happy, happy fucking guy.

385
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,811
All right.

386
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:23,120
Let's read a little bit advertising
here and then I'm going to give you my

387
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:24,800
predictions for a Trump presidency.

388
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,410
What's going to change how
he's gonna make it great?

389
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,680
He's gonna make it great again.
All right. A legacy box, everybody.

390
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,030
This is,
this is the greatest fucking the world.

391
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,750
The legacy box. No legacy
is like pass down, right?

392
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,260
He's a legacy. All right? What was
the last time you watched home movies?

393
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,310
Your home movies.

394
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,410
If you're like most Americans as a
box in your closet of videotapes,

395
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,360
film reviews and photos that don't
get watched to taken out worse,

396
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,730
they are actually deteriorating.
Introducing legacy box,

397

recorded moments digitally preserved on

Load legacy box with your old tapes,

399

films, pictures and auto audio
recordings and send it back.

400
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,090
You'll get them back in a couple of
weeks on DVD or a convenient thumb drive

401
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:17,670
ready to watch, share and
relive. That's pretty cool.

402
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,570
Just make sure if he did a personal porno,

403
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:24,410
you don't accidentally send that
legacy box takes care of everything and

404
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:26,660

USA Today and the view are
all talking about legacy box.

408

416
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,270
All right. Joe Roberts
company, everybody, uh,

417
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:18,930
on and has a new product is
called a mulcify MCT oil.

418
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,640
Mct Oil is one of the fastest sources of
clean fuel for the body and the brain.

419
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,000
It's one of the best ways to power
up your performance at kickstart.

420
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:29,310
A weight management program.
Uh,

421
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,600
there's lots of MCT oil brands out
there are there, I've never heard of it,

422
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,100
but there's none a mulcify nonetheless,

423
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,950
like a mulcify MCT oil from Onnit

457
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,033
in a row.

458
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,203
MMM.

459
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,240
Breaking news. Trump and Obama
meeting at the White House.

460
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,540
Yeah.

461
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,430
This fucking lady who's just moving her
fucking arms around talking, talking,

462
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:04,700
talking, shut the fuck. I got a lot
of nerve telling people to shut up.

463
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,453
MMM.

464
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,520
This is, you know, something.
This is going to be,

465
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,960
this is why is the right so fucking crazy.

466
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,370
Yeah.

467
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,890
What is wrong with you guys?
Jesus Christ.

468
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,743
Okay.

469
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,900
You pick the reality show TV star.
That's what the fuck you picked.

470
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,270
Then you pick George W. Bush.
[inaudible] can you give me a guy?

471
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,760
You know, this is what kills me
about you. Dumb fucks over there. I,

472
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,960
I lean right a lot. I lean left too.
Sometimes I'm liberal. Sometimes I'm,

473
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,200
but for fuck's

474
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,880
sakes, can you get me a guy
that could give a speech?

475
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,890
You haven't done it since. Herbert
Walker Bush. He gave a great speech.

476
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,530
I liked that guy.
I had no fucking beat with that guy.

477
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,940
Now I'm going to go from it
and cherishing hacker chick,

478
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,460
chick fucking eight years. Right? I
didn't like everything that Obama did,

479
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:04,150
but she got it. You'd have to admit
even you fucking racist comments.

480
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,020
Got To admit that guy was phenomenal
speaker, phenomenal speaker.

481
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:09,280
He is fucking hilarious.

482
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,910
He wasn't an embarrassment to hear the
world talk and now we're going to have

483
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,890
fucking Trump,
Jesus Christ.

484
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,933
Oh,

485
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,590
I got a lot of nerve cause I actually
liked Bernie Sanders watching that guy

486
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:26,230
give his speech. Jesus Christ. It
was like he was at a town meeting,

487
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,820
fucking hands flapping all over the place.
You know what?

488
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,180
I don't know if there was,
there wasn't a right choice in this one.

489
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,160
There really wasn't. All
right, now that the marines,

490
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,160
I know most of the two
best guys in the world.

491
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:46,810
Okay,

492
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,570
how do they think they got to have
now the, how the fuck do they do that?

493
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,170
Where they face each other?
They pause for a second,

494
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,983
right,

495
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,230
and then they put the same time.
They both fucking a, they salute.

496
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,690
Okay.

497
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,523
You know what I mean?

498
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,940
It's like you have a listen to
led Zeppelin and then they did.

499
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,850
They all just fucking, they're
playing, they're playing.

500
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:08,940
And then the song just stops and
then they come back in again.

501
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:11,000
And sometimes it's on time.
Sometimes it isn't.

502
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,040
And it's cause you know somebody just,
yeah,

503
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,910
it's a look that gives
somebody look and then boom,

504
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,960
you look at these fucking marine said
they don't give each other a look.

505
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,110
They still brought their fucking
hand up at the same time.

506
00:31:22,111 --> 00:31:23,820
There's gotta be some sort of,
some sort of marine,

507
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:25,770
a little wiggle with an eyebrow.

508
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,190
Granted we are like 40 yards away with
the camera and then I'm sitting in a

509
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:30,060
fucking hotel room.

510
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,320
Okay.

511
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,600
I wonder what the fuck and
audition was to get that Gig.

512
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,410
Okay.

513
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,460
You know, how many fucking doors did you
have to open? Like perfectly to be there?

514
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,053
You know,

515
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,830
it's gotta be some proud mom out there.
That's my son.

516
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,770
He's going to open the door.

517
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,350
What was the last time a
president with the toupee.

518
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:55,920
Okay.

519
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,760
Was President.
They've all had full heads of hair.

520
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,970
All have full heads of hair.
Hey ladies,

521
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:05,880
who's going to be the next lady
president? I mean, the next,

522
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:08,880
the first one I should say.
Do you think Hillary's done?

523
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,890
Do you think she has enough pants?
Suits for another run? You know,

524
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:15,990
I dunno.

525
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,410
I just hope she goes to a chiropractor
and gets her fucking neck fixed because I

526
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:22,410
dunno. She was like a baby, you
know, I, you fucking, you know,

527
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:27,120
babies can't hold their heads up. She
kind of was fucking flopping all around.

528
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,203
Um,

529
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,800
okay.

530
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,870
I love the pants suit though.
You know what I mean?

531
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:35,780
If I was a fucking chick of a certain age,
you know what I mean?

532
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,100
I had the kids already,
you know, shut down

533
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,450
the park, if you know what I mean.
You know, hot flashes, a rover, right?

534
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,350
Wally world's closed for renovations,
you know?

535
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,480
Then you got to rock
the fucking pants suit.

536
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,050
You got to get the shorter fucking
hair. Like, I don't give a shit anymore.

537
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,150
You know, my husband's old. What's he
going to do? He ain't going anywhere.

538
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,360
And you go out, right? You get
the Ellen degenerates haircut.

539
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,950
He go out and you get a fucking pants
suit walk around and some flatties for

540
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,700
once in your life. You fucking
concerned about your own comfort,

541
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,630
you know? Ah Man. You know
what? If I was Hillary,

542
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:18,950
my next fucking move is what Johnny
Carson had his own line of fucking sport

543
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:23,330
coats. I would have my own line
of fucking pants suits. Right?

544
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,870
But you get people like Rihanna and
people in the prime of their fucking life,

545
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:30,110
they're like walking around half
naked and they somehow, you know,

546
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,640
they somehow turned the pants,
suits.

547
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,520
Who the fuck is is good looking enough
in their twenties to make the fucking

548
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:38,720
pants suit come back.

549
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,693
You know,

550
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I, you know, I don't mind the pants
suit when I was coming up the fucking,

551
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,240
you know, Rhoda had them, Mary Tyler
Moore had a, you know what I mean?

552
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:53,140
And they will fucking young, broad sales
sitting there as a little fucking fire,

553
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:56,890
bald fucking freckled shirk off.
And I would,

554
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:59,680
why would watch all of those
fucking Charlie's angels that they,

555
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,030
we used to wear them for facet,
killed the fuck a pantsuit,

556
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,970
but the pantsuit back then was sorta
like the diversion of the John Travolta

557
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:08,740
suit.
You know what I mean?

558
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,750
It was just a bunch of ray on and
no condoms in the 70s and that's,

559
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,380
that's how we ended up where we're at.

560
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,350
It's why the fucking Rhodes
is so god damn filled up.

561
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,283
MMM.

562
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:25,000
Oh Jesus. To sound down
on em, MSNBC right now,

563
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:26,920
just looking at the
looks on people's faces.

564
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:30,100
I don't know why this shit is so funny
to me because I am not thrilled with this

565
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:34,690
guy being president. But seeing people
disappointed and crying on television,

566
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,930
you know, past, obviously if somebody
they love died or something like that,

567
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,710
I don't laugh at that shit.
But like I told you,

568
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,610
you guys way back in the day
when the biggest loser was on

569
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,680
and those fat people would just start
crying about how they could stop eating

570
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:48,810
hamburgers and shit. It
just fucking always, I mean,

571
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:51,240
I wanted them to lose weight and shit,
but this just something,

572
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,440
this sump did fucking hilarious about.
People cry,

573
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,450
adults crying. I don't know why.
It's probably me being a walled off,

574
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,760
you know, I'm actually, I'm not that
fucking walled up, walled off. Right.

575
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,170
I can get choked up with the best
of them, but if I did it, you know,

576
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,630
I expect people to laugh at me.
Um,

577
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,850
this is when you know you
have too much news coverage.

578
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,680
I'm sitting here watching this marine
opening and closing a door and these

579
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:26,480
fucking nerd guys keep
from the press.

580
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:28,580
Keep walking in and out of the shot.

581
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:30,870
Okay,

582
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,190
look at this.
There's a lady right now,

583
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:36,090
she's backing up to take a
picture with their cell phone of,

584
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:40,560
I dunno what now the marines
opening the door. She walks out.

585
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,833
Yeah.

586
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,631
You really,
you know what?

587
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:45,270
It was actually great that
she was in there just to see.

588
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,863
MMM.

589
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,590
Who the fuck just walked out of the place.

590
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,663
Okay.

591
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,570
What was that like?
His cousins or something.

592
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,520
Okay.

593
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,940
That's such a weird gig.
Does that mean you're a good marine?

594
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,440
But they make you like the fucking
bell hop of the White House. I know.

595
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:11,890
At the end of the day, I mean you went
through all of that fucking trainee.

596
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:13,720
You can snap somebody's neck,
right?

597
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,280
Can fucking shoot somebody from
200 yards away and then yeah. What?

598
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:22,210
What should detail? You can open and
close the back door at the White House

599
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,570
and then what? Nah, that's it. You're
going to be dressed in your formal,

600
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:31,330
so you're going to have your whites on
and you're just going to stand at fucking

601
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:34,180
attention though.
There's no way that anybody can do that.

602
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,200
It's gotta be like two hours shifts.
How long can you just stand there?

603
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,490
That fucking straight. Yeah,
but he's also got to be,

604
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,620
if some lunatic comes
fucking running up this,

605
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:49,570
remember that guy jumped over the fucking
fence and just ran up and he actually

606
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:52,090
got into the fucking White House.
That was unbelievable.

607
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,070
That's when I really realized like how
not important the president was. You know,

608
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,160
once again,
they don't even lock the door.

609
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,403
Yeah.

610
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,110
Do you understand that fucking ass all
who jumped over that gate and ran up to

611
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:13,260
the White House? Do you realize that that
guy got further into the White House?

612
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:16,860
Then he would've gotten into my house.
My door is locked.

613
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,280
Then he ran down the hall.

614
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,450
He gave a head fake and he broke the
ankles is some secret service guy. Right?

615
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,220
Like I ever sent did the Jordan,

616
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:30,460
when he first came into the league
and he wouldn't rent the, he got like

617
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,910
zigged instead of zagged.

618
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:36,730
And that was the only reason why he
didn't just fucking get in there.

619
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:38,680
Okay.

620
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,440
It's really not funny, but you know,
the fact that nothing happened,

621
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:47,000
that's kind of fucking
hilarious. Um, Jeez,

622
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,230
this cab with his pea soup,
green fucking tie,

623
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,350
just pointing and all that type of stuff.
He's fucking

624
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,300
cheese. Everybody thinks they
make it a point, including me.

625
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,200
Why don't I read the last few of these
things here? Um, all right. Wink,

626

drink the fucking wine gives

The clan or the clamp? A
[inaudible] picture. A world what?

707
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:56,820

you do. You make underwear.

715
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:18,680
What would you be doing now? What else
would you be doing? Huh? Make a diary.

716
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,330
I miss my friends at me undies.

717
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,110
These people I've never hung out with
who are somehow my friends send me a few

718
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:28,650
pairs a while back and now I can't
imagine it wearing anything else that is

719
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:32,220
alike. I where I'm not even wearing them
right now. Okay. But what they send me.

720
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:36,630
What comfortable except for the Greg
losing blue gain is cut. All right.

721
00:43:36,631 --> 00:43:41,430
Was riding up on my bulls.
Yeah. Um, it wasn't even that.

722
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:43,860
I just, I just, I could not
wear them in front of my wife.

723
00:43:43,861 --> 00:43:47,580
She was just dying laughing at me
as I was walking by. You're not,

724
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:50,430
I should have done, you know that
fucking crazy things at Olympic swimmers.

725
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:53,730
Do you know where they bend over and
then they just start fucking moving their

726
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,710
arms like propellers.
I want to do that next time.

727
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:59,220
Put It on my fucking my
Greg Louganis one's right.

728
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,820
I'm going to put on my swimming
goggles when my wife was looking,

729
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,900
I'll put on one of her fucking head Reps.
I'm just going to come out and do that.

730
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,370
All right. Sorry. Um, anyways, for price,

That's [inaudible] dot
com slash burr alright,

748
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,360
and that is the, uh, that is the
Thursday afternoon podcast and a,

749
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:22,410
and that is the election. All right? It
is over. This is the guy that we picked.

750
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,990
And just because you know
your person didn't win,

751
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,430
it doesn't mean you got to yell at
other people. All right? You know,

752
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:31,740
it'd be great is everybody, if everybody
just sort of stop yelling at each other,

753
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:36,300
okay. You know, maybe help
each other out. You know,

754
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:40,110
somebody actually said to me, you know,
I'm a obamacare's going to go away.

755
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:43,380
How to fuck am I going to pay for my meds?
And that immediately made me think,

756
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:48,180
wow, you know what? Why not regular
people just pick up the slack, you know,

757
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,090
I dunno how to fuck to do,
it's what sets something up.

758
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,990
Or maybe you just help out one person
where if you're in the prime of your life

759
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,270
or your earning power or whatever,
you know,

760
00:45:57,271 --> 00:46:00,990
and somebody down the street needs meds.
You know what?

761
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:05,070
If you booze a couple less times a fucking
month and you hook them up with some

762
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:08,280
money to get their
meds, you save, you want

763
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,870
and then you won't be as bloated,
you won't be drinking as much booze.

764
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,250
Why don't just regular people help each
other out instead of waiting for these

765
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:20,310
fucking people to do it because they
don't get along with each other.

766
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,070
Like when Obama went into office,

767
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:27,960
evidently all the Republicans on
the first fucking day in the house,

768
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:31,800
the Senate or whatever, just basically
said, we're just going to disagree with,

769
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,510
we're not going to pass
anything that this guy says, um,

770
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:40,410
which is really fucking
treasonous behavior. I think.

771
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,500
Not Saying you got to pass
everything that guy said she'd,

772
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,490
you do have to keep them in check, but
to, before it even comes down the pipe,

773
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,510
you saying, we're not going to fucking
work with this guy. I Dunno. Um,

774
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,380
so, but you can't ever expect
these assholes to ever get along.

775
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,810
They act like a bunch of fucking babies.

776
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:02,850
They really are a bunch of babies
the way that they behave. So, uh,

777
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,020
but that doesn't mean you have to
fucking behave like that. You know,

778
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,100
you could be a, you can be that
person who doesn't scream and yell.

779
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,120
You can be that person that doesn't
talk down to somebody because they don't

780
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:16,080
live near an ocean.

781
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,070
Or You could not judge somebody because
they do live near the ocean for whatever

782
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:22,350
fucking reason.
The blue states are near the ocean.

783
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,590
The other ones that fucking in the middle
and everybody's screaming and yelling

784
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:29,200
at each other. I have gone to
all 50 states and Goddammit,

785
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:34,330
I've met great people out there. I really
have great food, great fun. You know,

786
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,050
quit fucking yelling at everybody
and now you're going to be all right.

787
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,580
Trump's gonna be president.
For a lot of people,

788
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,740
I guess it will be a good
thing for other people.

789
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:47,350
It's not going to be a good thing, but
you know what? You're not going to die.

790
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,180
Okay. Get out in front of
it. Think something positive.

791
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,450
At the end of the day,
if you want to get your business going,

792
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:58,150
you're still going to have to do it.
Even if Obama was still in office,

793
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:01,840
a Hillary got, they're a fucking
newt Gingrich or Rudy Giuliani.

794
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,890
The end of the day,

795
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:07,891
your life facade you in life is not fair
and people don't have the time to give

796
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:12,550
a shit, you know? And that's
how it is. It's unfortunate,

797
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:14,980
but that is how it is.
But the second you fucking address that,

798
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,540
it's kind of empowering. Right? Oh fuck.
I gotta handle this shit. You know,

799
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,390
and this is coming from a
privileged white male, so,

800
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,920
oh, go fuck yourself. All right.
That's the, that's it. Okay. Um,

801
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,510
just trying to say shit positive.
Yes.

802
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,560
Ooh.

803
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:39,440
All right. Well then quit. Quit
moved to fuck Canada was sheriff.

804
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:44,390
See if anybody gives a
fuck. Um, anyways. Uh,

805
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,800
yeah,

806
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,050
yeah. It comes to music I
guess is what happens now.

807
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,840
And then we all get to listen
to some greatest hits before

808
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,550
the orange toupee guy was, he made
possible even running for president.

809
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,130
Who knows? Hey, who do
you think he, you know,

810
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,150
he should pick another reality TV show
star for his fucking vice presidency.

811
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,720
You know, he should get the
guy from survivor, you know,

812
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:12,190
who gets progressively angrier
with every fucking season.

813
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,380
I don't know if you guys have
noticed that. I don't understand.

814
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,140
Like I stopped watching it ears ago
because of it. He just like, you know,

815
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,010
red teeth

816
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:22,280
folly behind.
They got to step it up.

817
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,210
Just started fucking yelling at him.
He used to just be,

818
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,700
they used to be more exciting,
happy.

819
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:31,030
I think he's just sick of being out on
that island, watching people eating bugs.

820
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,430
I don't know what his issue was,

821
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:36,430
but he seems to be taking it out on the
people there in the islands, you know,

822
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,640
once they waste away. All right,
I'm done. Babbling. Alright.

823
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,040
You have a great weekend.
You're constant or does see on Monday,

824
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,790
Hey, what's going on? It's bill

825
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,720
is the Monday morning
podcast to what happened.

826
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:36,740
He yesterday, man, I'll tell you. Uh,

827
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,100
I was in a,
what the hell was I?

828
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,650
Fort Collins,
Colorado.

829
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,360
I was performing at Colorado
State University and I was
going to do the podcasts

830
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:51,200
from there, but every time I went
to call up I couldn't get service.

831
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,640
So that's what happened.

832
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:58,450
And right now I am in Indianapolis Cause
I'm doing Bob and Tom Radio tomorrow

833
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:03,440
morning to hype my Gig in Nashville.
All right,

834
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,210
so I'm on the road this week.
In fact,

835
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:12,020
earlier this week I heard
that I already commercial,

836
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,450
you know that Johnny Cash
song where he's like,

837
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:19,451
I've been to Tupelo stuff rattling off
all these cities happen everywhere man.

838
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,640
And I literally yelled,
I said shut the fuck up Johnny Silva.

839
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,290
So all right,

840
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,780
so have a lot of fucking people and
not to mention the fucking cities he

841
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:34,130
mentioned in that song.

842
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,730
Oh just a bunch of cities you
wouldn't want to go to anyways. Yeah,

843
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:40,850
I haven't been to any
everywhere you fucking redneck,

844
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,510
you should have said I've been to
Paris, London. You know what I'm saying?

845
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:49,280
Rome places people want
to go, not Tupelo, Toledo,

846
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:53,390
Charlestown. Nobody gives a fuck.
And what did you do that Johnny?

847
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,680
Maybe that's why you were so fucking
angry and that's why I'm so fucking angry

848
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,140
cause I had been in
those goddamn cities too,

849
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:02,140
when you know what I like about them.
Let's,

850
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,230
let's turn it around here and make it a
little more positive as I go on the 70

851
00:52:06,231 --> 00:52:10,370
east trying to figure out where the
fuck up. There we go. There we go.

852
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,380
Um, you know, what I like
about them is they're a,

853
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:18,170
they don't have enough money
to Redo that downtown areas.

854
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:21,730
So you get to see what you know.
You know,

855
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,980
America used to look like,
like 50 years ago,

856
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,540
and I'm not trying to
be condescending here.

857
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:30,440
I actually liked architecture was better,
you know,

858
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:31,640
stuff was made out of brick.

859
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,440
Everything wasn't like a fucking
cheesecake factory and an Applebee's.

860
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,740
Anytime that's happened to me in my
life, I've been on the road. Hey,

861
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,143
good on the front desk.

862
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:45,050
Do you have any place where I can
get something healthy to eat? Um,

863
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,190
we have an Applebee's
that's a solution.

864
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:54,200
He wants something. KLC.
Um, what's healthy? Oh,

865
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,700
you know what healthy is healthy is when
they wrap the silverware in the Napkin.

866
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:03,050
That means you're eating healthy and you,
you know where they do that.

867
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:07,610
They do it at an Applebee's.
They do what? It's Shoney's.

868
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,970
Shoney's. I've never, um,

869
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,340
never eaten there and show me this
certain rest fucking restaurant.

870
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:20,120
You just go by those chains.
And for me anyways,

871
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,340
let me not speak for you. I don't want
to be arrogant here, but for me anyway,

872
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:26,220
some certain restaurants,
fast food chains,

873
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,880
I literally just look at the sign and it
gives me a stomach ache and I can never

874
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:36,030
eat there.
And Shoney's is one of them.

875
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:41,480
Steak and shake is another one
of the two of them. I Dunno,

876
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:45,230
maybe I'm combining and they have like
this orange fucking sign that just,

877
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,530
it just reminds me of what I'm going to
feel like after I eat that shit food.

878
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,530
But I'm not always right
cause I gotta tell Ya,

879
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,040
I avoided the waffle house like the
plague for like a decade on the road.

880
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:03,330
How would you see that
yellow sign with those?

881
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:07,590
Just that regular type script.
Waffle house and it just, you know,

882
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,900
you could just drive,
invite.

883
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:12,690
You knew how sticky the fucking
tables we're going to be,

884
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,610
how toothless the waitress was
going to be, how many felonies,

885
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,700
how many convicted felons
we're going to be. It's just,

886
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:22,800
it just wasn't worth it
to get fucking waffle.

887
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,100
Not to mention I have a
great recipe for Waffles,

888
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,271
but then,
you know,

889
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:33,990
when I did the rich bitch tour and
the two guys I was on tour with on the

890
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:38,820
Chappelle show one night to let's go to
the waffle house and I went in there and

891
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:39,990
uh, you know, wasn't that bad,

892
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,890
although I got to admit that it's
been so long since I'd been there.

893
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,010
Whatever they have their home fries
smothered, covered and all that stuff,

894
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:52,160
it's fucking gross. You know, I
don't like it. I don't mind you.

895
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,160
You're punching up the food a little
bit or kicking it up a notch is that,

896
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,100
it's going to say Harold Carmichael.
Why the fuck did his main pop?

897
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,160
What's that guy's name?
Emilio. Emilio Estevez.

898
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,960
What's the name of that
chef when he goes Bam,

899
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,710
he throws the sugar and
everybody goes fucking crazy.

900
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,680
Emilio Elios

901
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:18,510
I think the cell phone is affecting
my fucking memory. What is his name?

902
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:24,310
Jesus Christ. Uh, Emeril. Yeah,

903
00:55:24,311 --> 00:55:29,270
we go Emeril Lagasse fuck the worst.
You know,

904
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,113
I was trying to remember the,

905
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:35,130
the name screech yesterday from saved
by the bell because I was talking about

906
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:39,660
people being able to sell tickets.
I couldn't fucking remember his name.

907
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,410
I was like scratchy, skippy, Sebastian.

908
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:49,050
I knew it began with an s,
some sort of continent afterwards.

909
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,560
Screech.
Okay.

910
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,770
What would you do if you are the
parent of a child star? You know,

911
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,270
besides steal his money before he turned
18 we'll put the fuck would you do?

912
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,880
Especially if,
I mean I'll,

913
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:08,250
I'll give screeches parents a break.
Okay.

914
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,990
But I've got to say from here on out,
if you put your kid into show business,

915
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,380
first of all, you're fucked
in the head. All right?

916
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,860
You wanted to make it on some
level. All right? And secondly,

917
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,160
if the kid books to
show and his characters,

918
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:27,580
his character's name is like
sippy. All right. You know,

919
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:31,500
just something you would name
a fucking ferric. If the,

920
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,780
if that's what his
character's name is or I call,

921
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,350
you just know he's going to be a
fuck up. I, why did I say Urkel?

922
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:41,860
Cause he's not a fuck up. But you
know what I'm saying? That point,

923
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:43,750
you got to stick that
kit and drug counseling.

924
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,380
You know when he's still eight years old.

925
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,660
Oh my God. You know, it tells
me a great fucking show.

926
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,750
You could have a scared
straight for a child stars.

927
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,000
What you do is you have whoever the
next fucking Hannah Montana is, right.

928
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:07,060
That's another one. You fucking
name rhymes. If finished,

929
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,220
she couldn't be on coke on her knees in
the bathroom of the viper room within

930
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:16,000
three years. I'll wait a minute.
But her dad's Billy Ray Cyrus,

931
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:20,680
so he knows he's been there. He's
the, I been there baby. Okay.

932
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:25,180
You understand whether my eyes look
and see the pain that is pain of,

933
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:29,890
of having a mullet and singing
a song called Achy breaky heart.

934
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,980
I swear to God. No, it was not
for five year olds. No it wasn't.

935
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:37,981
It was for adults who was for adults and
they fucking love it and they bought it

936
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,140
and then one day they figured out it's
stuffed and then they all acted lock.

937
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:45,850
They never bought it and no one
ever come to my shows again.

938
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,740
So I cut off my mode and I'm pregnant.
Did your Mama and then we had you.

939
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:56,510
Well now it's your fucking turn to
continue the legacy of horrific fucking

940
00:57:57,101 --> 00:58:00,750
moments in show business.
Um,

941
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,450
oh, so this is the
show. You basically have

942
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,560
former child stars who've done drugs.

943
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:14,370
That dude from the courtship
of Eddie's father. Uh, yeah.

944
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,140
You have the dude Michael
Diamond. No. Michael Diamond.

945
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:22,150
Either the Beastie boys. Dustin diamond.
Yeah. Have him fucking in there.

946
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,360
Yeah. You know, you
have random Brady bunch,

947
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:29,170
but they never really did
anything fucking fags.

948
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:34,440
They never really did anything other
than linger around gaveled a boring cast.

949
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:38,020
The people, um, whatever. You just take
a bunch of child stars who fucked up,

950
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,550
who haven't died yet,

951
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,800
and then you bring them in there and you
haven't just start screaming at whoever

952
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:47,560
the next article is to make
sure he's not on drugs.

953
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,760
And if I could some how smooth
it out, I think I could, uh,

954
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:56,740
I could sell that show at the VH one. All
right. Stick a former rapper in there.

955
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:01,450
Get some hoes and you've got to show.
So you might be asking yourself,

956
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:04,660
Bill, you know, you've been doing
this podcast for quite a while.

957
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,950
You've been driving for quite a, I
don't shift your hotel yet. Uh, no,

958
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:12,820
I'm not because, um, I dunno,

959
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,090
I didn't want to spend the
night in Indianapolis even
though I have to do radio

960
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:18,310
tomorrow at six in the morning.
And I looked up,

961
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,930
I saw that the red wings
and playing the fucking, uh,

962
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,690
Pittsburgh penguins up in Detroit,
the best two teams in the NHL last year.

963
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:29,030
I pick a fucking,
I'll drive up the street.

964
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,860
It can't be more than an hour
and a half to Detroit. Well,

965
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:36,500
turns out it's three hours and hours.
He had a fucking car. So joke's on me.

966
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:40,910
This better be a good fucking
game. Um, but anyways,

967
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,980
I'm driving along here so
I don't have the questions.

968
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,720
I don't know if the question,

969
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:48,050
so all I can do it just run
my fucking mouth this week,

970
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,650
which I have done for nine
minutes and 51 seconds. What?

971
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:54,170
That also includes the intro.

972
00:59:55,510 --> 01:00:00,320
I talk to that fucking machine every week.
Um,

973
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,350
all right, so this is a,
there's a waffle house.

974
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,960
Now I'm driving down the road and
I'm trying to make the decision,

975
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,160
the decision that Americans have
to make every day in this country.

976
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,270
How do I not become a fat fuck? I'm
a tie. It's very difficult out here.

977
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,020
It's very difficult.
Where can I eat at here?

978
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:22,610
There's a place called Joe's as
a throwback. What is this place?

979
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,630
Joe's Joe's crab shack.
Oh yeah.

980
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,520
That's what I do when I go
to the middle of the country.

981
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:32,840
Let me order some seafood show that's
fresh. No fuck is wrong with you.

982
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:38,240
I tell you know what we doing?
Indianapolis. We I sushi. We love it.

983
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,750
What do you have? What kind of
Sushi? What do you have? Trout Sushi.

984
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,420
So sort of Fred.

985
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:52,340
They have catfish Sushi out here. They go,
oh, we've got to go down there. We just,

986
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:53,720
can we just pull it out of the Crick?

987
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,890
Why does every moron in my
act have a southern accent?

988
01:00:57,891 --> 01:01:00,530
I really have to stop that.
I'll tell you why.

989
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,330
Because every time you get
outside of a major city,

990
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:07,190
everybody fucking talks like that.
Everybody's got a little bit of a lazy,

991
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,910
Lazy Way of speaking that was awful.

992
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:14,540
Apartments every fucking
one looking the same,

993
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,160
but it's right near a manmade.

994
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:19,910
Like I got to tell you one of the
most depressing things ever for me.

995
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:24,890
Oh that's nice. We just merged down
to two lanes. Were there signs?

996
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:26,780
Maybe if I wasn't doing the podcast,

997
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:31,460
can you imagine if I actually caused
one of those horrific highway accidents?

998
01:01:31,461 --> 01:01:35,960
You know, like anybody used to watch
that show chips, remember that uh,

999
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,030
Erik Estrada,
Larry Wilcox

1000
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:48,820
that then private down the street and
their motorcycles and once you show they

1001
01:01:48,821 --> 01:01:51,970
would literally have a
20 to 30 car pile up,

1002
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,660
which in all my years of being on
the road, I have never fucking seen.

1003
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,810
And my favorite thing
about those pileups right

1004
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,040
was they would last for like
a good fucking, I dunno,

1005
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,500
one minute on television,

1006
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:10,450
which basically in real life is like a
five minute catastrophe and everything.

1007
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:14,680
When everything was all said and done,
there's like 25 cars upside down,

1008
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:17,320
twist it around,
and it was always like an old oil tanker.

1009
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:22,200
And then it was always that guy.
The last guy would always,

1010
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:27,201
somehow he'd get air off of cars
rather than just plowing into them.

1011
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:28,320
He just defied,

1012
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:33,321
he would defy physics and he would somehow
get air shoot up and over everybody.

1013
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,580
And if you listen to the audio,

1014
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:38,160
for some reason the guy would
still be hitting the gas,

1015
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:43,120
these literacy in the air
and his car's still going, Ra

1016
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,460
like he thinks he's gonna make it over.

1017
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:51,930
I never understood that even
as a little boy watching it.

1018
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:57,510
And I look at my dad and I would say,
dad, why did he do that? And He'd be like,

1019
01:02:57,511 --> 01:03:00,570
shut the fuck up.
Just shut the fuck up.

1020
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,420
And the cat's in the cradle and the seat
of a mood. Silver Spoon. There it is.

1021
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:09,360
I'm telling you, I think the fucking
cell phone is affecting my memory.

1022
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,020
So anyways, let's talk
conspiracy theory. Hey everybody.

1023
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,720
How about that $700 million bail outs?

1024
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:18,720
Is that autumn as an it made
the country a lot better.

1025
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:23,310
He's fucking motherfuckers, you
know? I realized after eight years,

1026
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:27,750
you know the outcast is, it's the
Goddamn bankers, you know what I mean?

1027
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:30,690
Then more fucking terrorists than anybody.
You sons of bitches,

1028
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:31,800
you know what they're
doing with that money.

1029
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:36,870
Have they lowered interest rates
so people can get alone talk? No.

1030
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:41,410
GM is going under. You know what
they're doing with the money for what I,

1031
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,210
I overheard on the radio is there a,

1032
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,720
they're using it to buy
up other failing banks

1033
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,620
just inching us towards
the one World Bank.

1034
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,790
That's what they're using it for and
they have the audacity to raise the

1035
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:01,770
interest rates on credit cards to
help pay for this mortgage mess.

1036
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,400
Then we just give you $700
billion to get you out of it.

1037
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:09,630
I didn't know you were going to keep it
so you could buy more assets and then

1038
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:11,250
further,
fuck me in the ass.

1039
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,450
It's up to 27% on some people's cards.

1040
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,150
Don't they have some sort of usury laws?

1041
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,630
Does anybody who's remotely,

1042
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,030
I want to say majored in economics
because anybody who understands is at what

1043
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:29,610
point,
what percentage is usury?

1044
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:34,080
There are up to 27% I mean,

1045
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,600
back in the day did the mob even do that?

1046
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:41,400
They own everybody.

1047
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:44,310
That's what I realized when I really
looked at the whole economy that broken

1048
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:47,370
everything down and I realized all
the money I've made in this business,

1049
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,980
how much of it I've asked have I
ever held in my hand? You know,

1050
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:55,290
I take out 100 bucks here, a hundred bucks
there. I pay everything with the check.

1051
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,400
I get paid in checks,

1052
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:01,730
just numbers on a piece of paper and I
kind of realized that even if I own shit,

1053
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,680
they can still be seized

1054
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,340
with the Patriot Act that can be arrested,

1055
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:13,720
not charged it fucking waterboarded.
No,

1056
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,600
I realize I'm going to grow a mustache
just in case everything waterboarding,

1057
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,123
you know?

1058
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:21,370
It's like there's still going to slowly
draw me right to hate water going up my

1059
01:05:21,371 --> 01:05:26,290
nose. It's going to grow one of those
big fucking 1970 sex symbols, mustaches.

1060
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,130
You know, Burt Reynolds, you know,

1061
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,540
it's got the best mustache ever. And
of course, I don't know his name.

1062
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:36,910
He's a guy who was in the,
uh,

1063
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,880
he was actually in the big Lebowski. He
was the narrator. Sam Elliott. I mean,

1064
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:45,670
that guy's mustache. It's just,
it's fucking ridiculous. Number one,

1065
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:49,300
a mustache wasn't cool for like 20 years,
but he kept his,

1066
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:53,840
his was so fucking cool. You couldn't
question his mustache. He had,

1067
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:58,890
that's like a man that's like a
fucking panning for gold and the 1840

1068
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,160
[inaudible].

1069
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,890
Then when the gold rush was anybody
listen to this from San Francisco and you

1070
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:10,300
went out there and he sang
those awful fucking songs. Oh,

1071
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:15,280
Mandar when Omen Darlin
Darlin Klamath time,

1072
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:21,120
you got the worst fucking name in the
world. You must be in a good bitch.

1073
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,480
Has there ever been a good
looking woman named Clementine?

1074
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,740
You'll notice that there's like
hot girl names like Natasha.

1075
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,230
I've never seen an ugly
girl named Natasha yet.

1076
01:06:31,231 --> 01:06:33,210
I've never seen a cool girl named Natasha.

1077
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:37,480
I always just see some hot girl who
knows she's fucking hot at eight because

1078
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:42,450
their name is Natasha, which ends
up making a B really, um, uh,

1079
01:06:42,451 --> 01:06:44,370
con to be honest with you.

1080
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,810
Or is it more about me that I never had
the courage to approach a girl named

1081
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:53,820
Natasha, Natasha. Fxe. Brooke.

1082
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,890
That's a good one. Brooke. Natasha,

1083
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,313
uh,

1084
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,710
not Melissa.
Melissa's can kind of be down to earth.

1085
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:09,400
Some sort of offshoot of Melissa and
I always notice was what the fuck?

1086
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:15,190
I don't know Jesus Christ as if depressing
out here it is absolutely overcast.

1087
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,990
I'll tell you, the Midwest Midwestern, the
summertime when all the props, you know,

1088
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,850
waving in the air, you know,
makes you proud to be an American.

1089
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:28,090
But when you're out here,
the beginning of winter,

1090
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,120
you start to understand crystal meth.

1091
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:35,500
I get it now I understand the anger of
slipknot. I never understood those guys.

1092
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:37,030
Like what the fuck are
they so angry about?

1093
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:40,990
And then I was in Iowa in like February,
and I was like, you know what? I get it.

1094
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:44,380
I get it.
It's like a,

1095
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:51,100
I dunno it, it really fucking
affects your mood. This is awful.

1096
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,800
But those guys look like for you
guys in the side of the road,

1097
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,010
then that's why those guys you
see on the side of the road,

1098
01:07:57,011 --> 01:08:01,360
you're not picking up litter. You
know, you're not mowing the grass.

1099
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:05,080
You're not waiting to give somebody a
ticket, but you still got a little shine.

1100
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:09,640
A little fucking siren on top of your car.
The neutral one though.

1101
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:11,590
That orange one.

1102
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:14,580
It's

1103
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:19,080
like the uh, it's like the Jen
Brady of emergency vehicles.

1104
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:24,010
Oh, the dad is super eight
motel with an indoor pool. Huh?

1105
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:29,060
Who says this country and Trump
is in trouble. Why? They really,

1106
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:32,180
they really stepped it up. They finally
living up to that name. Super Right.

1107
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:37,850
Never Super. When I went to it,
there's a steak and shake. Next exit.

1108
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,380
Oh, this is this part of the country.
For those of you who don't travel,

1109
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,580
this is steak and shake.

1110
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,710
Dairy Queen country
heartland resort camping.

1111
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,360
Do you know I had,

1112
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:55,360
I had a chance to go skeet shooting in
DC and I got so fucking drunk with Joe to

1113
01:08:55,671 --> 01:09:00,480
Rosa the night before. I couldn't
do it. Me and Joe to Rosa,

1114
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:03,390
the guy I do uninformed with,
we are not good for each other.

1115
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:06,630
That's what I realized when I
think when we're by ourselves,

1116
01:09:06,631 --> 01:09:10,970
we can make good decisions, but when we
are hanging out together, everyone else,

1117
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,400
you've got a friend like that.
We're after a while, you know,

1118
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:15,870
you just have to kind of tap out.

1119
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,380
I'm not saying I'm not going to be
friends with Joe to Rosie anymore. I just,

1120
01:09:19,381 --> 01:09:21,570
I don't know if I don't think I
can hang out with them anymore.

1121
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:28,100
Why are you driving so fucking slow in
the left lane with your high performance

1122
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:32,700
muffler? High performance
mufflers. A ridiculous,

1123
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,340
didn't somebody sends something
in about those being overrated?

1124
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,830
It's fool little Asian girls and to
thinking that you have a fast car.

1125
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:43,770
Bye.

1126
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:47,160
You think it's an old guy with white
hair or is that a baseball cap?

1127
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:52,390
It's basically a Honda
civic, early nineties. They,

1128
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:57,110
uh, with the hatchback, it looks like
he's got some sort of erector set.

1129
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,150
[inaudible] you remember that shit?

1130
01:10:01,151 --> 01:10:04,890
Nobody erector set us back when they
used to give you toys to try and make you

1131
01:10:04,891 --> 01:10:07,660
smart to give like a chemistry set.

1132
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,950
Can you hear that?
Can you hear his car?

1133
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,470
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

1134
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,260
Don't fucking 65.

1135
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,940
He sounds like a motorcycle off in the
distance and he's literally fucking 30

1136
01:10:20,941 --> 01:10:21,774
yards in front of me.

1137
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:26,400
Some physics major out there doing
the math right now to see if I'm not,

1138
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:31,080
if I'm following too closely behind.
All right, so we're up to 20 minutes.

1139
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:34,410
That's not bad. That's not bad. I, you
know, I, this is how I used to do them.

1140
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:39,960
It was like an old school
throwback talking throwback. Um,

1141
01:10:39,961 --> 01:10:43,360
uh, I'm really going to be hating
this drive when I come back.

1142
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:45,090
Do you realize that I'm such a mean?

1143
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,580
Why doesn't this guy have a side
view mirror? Okay, here we go.

1144
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:51,840
And I'm driving by him and
it is, uh, you know what?

1145
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:55,890
It was a younger kid and he
had one of those, uh, you know,

1146
01:10:55,891 --> 01:10:57,720
the goatee where you
don't have the mustache,

1147
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:03,090
but then you have like the really long
shit hanging off your Chin basically says,

1148
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,730
uh, you know, I'm not wearing a condom.

1149
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,290
Um, I dunno. Anyways, let's, let's
heighten my gigs upcoming this week. Okay.

1150
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:17,430
If you've enjoyed this podcast
and you have a radio, I will be,

1151
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:22,050
uh, on the Bob and Tom
Show tomorrow morning,

1152
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,500
all across this great country of ours,
which is still great.

1153
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:29,520
If we could get rid of these
motherfucking bankers. Um,

1154
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,250
and I'm going to be
hyping my upcoming Gig,

1155
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:37,050
the next gig on the uninformed
tour and uh, xannies and Nashville,

1156
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:41,310
Tennessee. Um, this Thursday,

1157
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,910
Friday and Saturday,
me and Joe to Rosa two man show.

1158
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,720
We're going to be telling
some jokes or whatever.

1159
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,490
And if you came and saw me last year,

1160
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:53,460
I wrote a whole new hour people
in Nashville and listen to this.

1161
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:57,360
I want to go skeet. Shoot. I
blew it in DC. I want to go.

1162
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:02,610
I want to learn how to shoot something
that's my next puck and move as I plan

1163
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:07,170
for the new world order.
Um, so come on man.

1164
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:10,560
I'm going down to Nashville. I know it's
the music city capital of the world,

1165
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,560
but God dammit,
just outside of it.

1166
01:12:13,561 --> 01:12:16,710
I know there's a bunch of people with
guns and he got fields and I want to go up

1167
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:21,610
there and shoot a little plate just so
why don't you hook me up? I got, I got it.

1168
01:12:21,611 --> 01:12:24,690
Here you go.
Anybody who hooks me up takes me out.

1169
01:12:24,691 --> 01:12:28,620
Go skeet shooting gets a free three,
three,

1170
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:31,980
three DVD.
Say That 10 times fast for you.

1171
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:36,060
Your buddy you go hunting with and your
best girlfriend with them. Daisy Dukes,

1172
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:40,560
motherfucker. I'm serious. I
want to, I want to learn. Okay.

1173
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,010
Hey, it's his, his,

1174
01:12:44,011 --> 01:12:47,820
my latest fucking conspiracy that I know
they're going to combine this country

1175
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,920
with fucking Mexico and with Canada.

1176
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:54,720
Aside from the fact that they've got that
creepy commercial about how they have

1177
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:58,680
a new enhanced driver's license that'll
make it easier to travel between the

1178
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:03,000
United States, Canada, and
Mexico. Personally. I didn't
know that was a problem.

1179
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,540
I don't know. There was people around
ego and you know, I love this country,

1180
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:09,810
but I just wish it was easier
to go to Canada. God Damn it.

1181
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:13,950
If I could just go to Mexico a
little bit earlier, I mean easier.

1182
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,670
This is,
this is my big conspiracy.

1183
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:22,050
I've noticed lately I'm traveling in
airports and all of a sudden there's this

1184
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:24,750
new software out there
called a Rosetta stone,

1185
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:29,280
which is a damn it,
I wish I looked it up.

1186
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:32,360
I know the Rosetta stone is some sort of,
I don't even know what the fuck it is.

1187
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:36,390
It's something difficult. Is it to like
the hope diamond? I don't know what it is,

1188
01:13:36,391 --> 01:13:40,950
but basically they took that name and it
is now it's software that teaches you a

1189
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:45,090
bunch of different languages. Okay.
Which I always thought was cool.

1190
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,570
I want to learn another language, but
nobody in America has ever given a fuck.

1191
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,360
Now all of a sudden they're
selling these fucking things.

1192
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:54,540
I was just getting off at the airport.
I can see if you're in New York,

1193
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,470
if you're in loss hung delays.

1194
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:01,080
We could actually speak Spanish
every fucking three feet I get it.

1195
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:04,230
Or maybe French or something like that.
I don't know.

1196
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:09,231
But like I just got off at the airport
here in Indianapolis and this selling the

1197
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:12,850
resent of stone software.
Who the fuck in Indianapolis

1198
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,510
is climber and to learn
a different language,

1199
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,840
you know something's going on,

1200
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:23,190
they're putting it in your head and
I'm telling you if you stick around,

1201
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,630
stick it out in front
of people long enough,

1202
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:28,540
they're going to this like Rubik's
cubes when you really think about it.

1203
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:29,440
Was that thing fun?

1204
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,900
It was kind of like a toy that was fixed
and you spun it three times and then it

1205
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:38,680
was broken and you can never get it fixed
again unless you had an Asian friend

1206
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,830
too for some reason.
Figured out how to do it.

1207
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:46,870
I don't know what it is about those guys.
They just fucking smarter than us.

1208
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:53,290
Is that like reverse racist in a way?
Because I actually said something fucking

1209
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:56,410
you allowed to do that.

1210
01:14:56,411 --> 01:15:00,820
I know you're not allowed to say something
bad straight across about a race of

1211
01:15:00,821 --> 01:15:02,800
people.
Can I say something good?

1212
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,060
The politically correct
police going to come at me.

1213
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:11,380
Now that's just as bad because that's
offensive too. Stupid Asian people,

1214
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:16,830
it's going to make them feel even more
retarded and we don't want that anyways.

1215
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,730
Wow. I am really out here
in the heartland right now.

1216
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:26,290
You know something people always say
that's the movement. Start a farm,

1217
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:30,910
start a farm, save your money and that
type of shit. But as far as I can tell,

1218
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:36,400
these farmers are fucked too,
cause they only grow one crop.

1219
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,330
So what are you going to do? What are you
going to grow? Fucking corn, you know?

1220
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:44,830
All right, you grow corn, then everything
goes down. You can't afford food.

1221
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:49,810
Even if you've got well water on you, on
your fucking property, what do you eat?

1222
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:53,300
Corn every fucking day.
Some point you got,

1223
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:57,640
I guess maybe you can go out and shoot
a pheasant knows. Reminds me of a joke.

1224
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:02,140
I used to wait at the hall of fame.
Any an Indiana basketball hall of fame.

1225
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:06,410
Get the fuck Outta here.
Jesus Christ.

1226
01:16:06,411 --> 01:16:09,430
That's going to be the big
biggest collection of white
basketball players with

1227
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:13,660
booty shorts in the goddamn country.
And you know, Larry Bird, he said Jesus,

1228
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,250
and I can't argue with them,
Larry Bird. Now there is, it was,

1229
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:21,930
it wasn't awful mustache.
He had a,

1230
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:26,020
I have a cleft palate mustache. Ah,
Jesus, that was me. But you know what,

1231
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,240
I actually bought one of
those kids in new smile,

1232
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,010
so I'm able to do that joke.

1233
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,520
Larry Bird had a fucking 14 year old
white trash mustache when he was like 28.

1234
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,530
I don't think it ever
filled in his entire career,

1235
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,200
that awful oval face. God
Damn. And he could play.

1236
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:53,680
He could definitely place look at me
trash and one of the icons of Boston who

1237
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:57,940
would have thought. Um, anyways, I'm going
to end this podcast this week with uh,

1238
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:03,760
with the joke I used to do back in my
college days. It was back in college.

1239
01:17:03,761 --> 01:17:06,400
This is what I do.
All my college gigs,

1240
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:11,240
standup gigs back before I
was doing mainly clubs. I
used to land at the airport.

1241
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:15,110
I get around a car, you
know, grab a couple of cds,

1242
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:20,000
possibly cassette tapes, depending on what
point in my career. And I drive across,

1243
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,930
you know,
the farm lands out here in

1244
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:28,900
the Midwest and I ended up getting a
joke out of it and this was the joke that

1245
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:32,390
was like, you know, every time
you see farmers on the news,

1246
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:36,100
you always see in pitching about how
difficult farming is. You know what?

1247
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:40,970
I must've driven by 10,000 farms during
my standup career. And you know what?

1248
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,780
I've never seen anybody doing shifts.

1249
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:44,800
Okay?

1250
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,560
Tractors always parked.
Cows are standing around,

1251
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:50,620
there's absolutely no
fucking activity whatsoever.

1252
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,990
And there's always a big satellite.

1253
01:17:52,991 --> 01:17:55,050
This there were in there
watching fucking ESPN.

1254
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,720
And then when the media comes by and he
just smear a bunch of dirt on their face

1255
01:17:58,721 --> 01:18:03,430
and they're like, oh my God, it was good.
Try Food, jump on something like that.

1256
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:05,380
And you know what?
Today is no different.

1257
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,790
I just drove by 45 I have
not seen one fucking person.

1258
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:12,400
The lights aren't even on there.
And then that happened.

1259
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:18,130
Oh, I don't know what they do this time
of year. All the crops had cut down.

1260
01:18:18,131 --> 01:18:21,490
Who the fuck knows? But anyways, here's
something off all the people on my space.

1261
01:18:21,491 --> 01:18:23,860
I would really appreciate it if you would,
uh,

1262
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:28,780
go on to my website [inaudible] dot com
and sign up for my mailing list because,

1263
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:32,710
uh, I'm sort of inching my way over to
that one more so than the mindspace.

1264
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:35,000
I'll still put shit up
on my space, but, uh,

1265
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:38,920
I plan to start blogging and all that
crap once I get done with this uninformed

1266
01:18:38,921 --> 01:18:42,790
tour. A lot of, uh, putting some
extras on there because, you know,

1267
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:47,410
I haven't joined Facebook yet and I just
really don't feel like going over to

1268
01:18:47,411 --> 01:18:51,490
Facebook and have to add the same 30,000
fucking people that I already have.

1269
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:55,510
So if you go out on my website, then, you
know what I mean? And I won't spam you.

1270
01:18:55,630 --> 01:19:00,280
And plus you're also able to control
what sort of,

1271
01:19:00,281 --> 01:19:04,300
uh, emails you get from me. Like
when I said I was going to Nashville,

1272
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:06,670
I just emailed people on
my Nashville list. Okay.

1273
01:19:06,671 --> 01:19:10,390
So you're not going to get a fucking
updates from me every week is I have some

1274
01:19:10,391 --> 01:19:13,840
sort of Zany picture
trying to utilize the web.

1275
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,160
This is my one once a week thing that I
do, which I think is a good thing. Okay?

1276
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:23,260
I usually do it on Mondays. I fuck around.
I give you a fucking free audio show.

1277
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,600
All right? It's a lot more than, uh,

1278
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:30,100
some of these other cons out there
doing right? All right, that's it.

1279
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:34,690
That's the Monday morning podcast
on a Tuesday. I apologize.

1280
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:38,290
I didn't get any cell phone
service. So, uh, God bless all ya.

1281
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:42,670
God bless the United States of America.
Fuck the bankers.

1282
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:46,390
Please go on the Internet and
start reading about banking.

1283
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:50,000
Please read about it and just read
what the fuck over it is. And uh,

1284
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:55,001
educate yourself with conspiracy
theory that is based in Wikipedia

1285
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:02,140
and youtube videos. I just know
it's not all bad, everybody.

1286
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,350
I don't like this. I'm telling you, man,
I don't like Internet gets a bad rap.

1287
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,790
They only call the everything
on the Internet's a lie.

1288
01:20:09,791 --> 01:20:13,230
But TV's telling you the truth. Think
about the insanity of that. Man.

1289
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:17,000
That's fucking ridiculous. It both full
of Shit and it's all mine throwing.

1291
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:24,580

please come down, come out and see me. Um,

1292
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:29,280
