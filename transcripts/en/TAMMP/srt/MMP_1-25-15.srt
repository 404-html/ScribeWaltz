1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,690
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn.

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:08,490
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday, uh,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,180
January 25th, 2060. What's going on out?

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,410
How are Ya? Ah, you know how I'm
doing when I'm not doing good?

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,990
Uh, everybody in Denver settling in
with a big fucking smile on your face,

6
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,340
aren't ya?
Ah,

7
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:31,200
you fucking pot smoking
[inaudible] with the goddamn him.

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,830
Ponchos um,
congratulations to the Broncos.

9
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:37,590
They deserved it right out of the
gate. You know, we took the ball,

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,030
they stopped us. And I remember when they
scored in the first drive, I was like,

11
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,390
that was disturbingly easy.
Um,

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,250
and uh, you know, they just, we have,

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,400
they just von Fucking
Miller. I mean, if the,

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,430
if he was in the backfield
any quicker during the game,

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,710
he be taken the fucking
snap. I mean, it was brutal.

16
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:03,160
We just didn't have any answers
on the outfit, the blood. And, uh,

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:03,841
that's what did it,

18
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,930
not the fucking field goal and not
us going forward on fourth down.

19
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:09,840
I can only imagine what they're saying.
I'm, I'm doing this Sunday night.

20
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,650
I can imagine the sports talk radio that
they're second guessing bill Belichick.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,340
Yeah. Second guessing. Yes. Second guess
him. It's just bill Bellacheck. Oh,

22
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:21,070
what do you, yeah, you're the other
fucking, you've never coached on any

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,190
can level three work? No water. You
to kick the field goal during winter

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,040
toward show Perry.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,550
I love all people think like,

26
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,890
like something earlier in the game.
If they just did this, that, that,

27
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,140
that doesn't change everything after that.

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,550
I mean how many fucking
back to the futures do they
have to make that you see if

29
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:49,270
you change one thing that it
changes everything else self.

30
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:53,990
If the Patriots did kick the fucking thing
and we got to within five and when we

31
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:54,950
got the ball back,

32
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:59,210
the fact that a touchdown would put us
ahead rather than us being down by eight,

33
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:02,930
they would have had a completely
different fucking defense. Okay.

34
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,630
Before they fucking do all
of that second guessing shit,

35
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,640
you know fucking Versie was, was going
through that too. I said, I was saying,

36
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:12,350
I was saying when they did it was dumb.

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,380
Oh did you non coach Versie Aminah
listen to you as opposed to to to fucking

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,190
Bella check. Um, when they did
it, I was like, I love the,

39
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,750
I love the call going forward.

40
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,670
We weren't able to move the fucking ball
at all on offense the entire fucking

41
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:29,750
game.
We will,

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,170
the only reason why we had a touchdown
was because they had that fucking lateral.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,580
And even then, then we missed a fucking
extra point. It just, it wasn't our day.

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,050
Even when we had got a gift,

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,130
we fucked it up and then we gave it right
back with a pick and then they score

46
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:44,720
it. But um, yeah,

47
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,810
we weren't able to move the fucking
ball be Tom Brady went back,

48
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:50,660
there was somebody in his face,
you know,

49
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:54,260
chomping at the fucking is his legs as
he was trying to throw the fucking thing.

50
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,490
You're that close. I, I, I agreed with
going forward. It didn't work out,

51
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:03,450
but you know how life is sometimes. So,
um, but it was a great season and, um,

52
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,220
for what they accomplished with all
the injuries and all that type of shit,

53
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,060
it was amazing. And I got
to tell you, I am, um,

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,610
I'm definitely rooting
for a Peyton manning.

55
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:17,660
I'd like to see him go out like John
Elway would be pretty cool for another guy

56
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:21,560
in the Broncos does that. But uh, then he
also, he got to love Cam Newton. You know,

57
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,870
Jesus Christ,
you don't think I don't like about Cam.

58
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,230
Newton is one more person tells me
there's nobody having more fun than him.

59
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,300
It's like a kid on Christmas Day.
He's like a,

60
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,550
he's like a kid when his second
birthday, it's like, I get it.

61
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,501
He's having fun.

62
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:47,520
He's also totally fucking hamming it up
and making sure his next sneaker deal

63
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:51,930
would be, it will be even 10 times what
the fuck he has right now. Let's not just,

64
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,860
let's start,

65
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,150
be totally naive here or just act like
everything he's doing is just because he

66
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:58,090
loves playing the game.

67
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:03,091
But he wasn't this fucking animated
what he was at a a fucking Auburn.

68
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,400
I used to watch shows, games, root
against, hi. I used to word against him,

69
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:12,480
so I would watch and I was, he, he wasn't
doing all that shit. But then again,

70
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:15,600
he couldn't get paid or at least legally
he couldn't get paid back then. So,

71
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,050
you know, what was the point? A
dance it every time you fuck it.

72
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,950
I love when that one guy fucking a,
they,

73
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:23,400
they through the screen pass and he ran
all the way to the other side of the

74
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,570
field.
By the time he gets there,

75
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,780
Cam Newton runs in with them and
kind of fucking jumps in on that guy.

76
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,450
Superbowl Superbowl,
his touchdown salivate celebration.

77
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,890
And then the camera man is just following
Cam Newton for the rest of the time.

78
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,793
And um,

79
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,220
in my, uh, in my business, that's a,

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,220
that's called a [inaudible], not stealing
is seen. It's called uh, AH, Jesus Christ.

81
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:53,300
I don't do enough acting to,
even though steel,

82
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,920
the xen is when you're better than
the other person. Upstaging somebody.

83
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,320
He was upstaging him. So, um,

84
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,980
I just don't need anybody else telling
me how much fun Cam Newton's having.

85
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:04,360
I get it.
He's having a good time,

86
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:07,900
but he's also completely hamming
it up because when he does,

87
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,850
he makes a zillion dollars. However, as
crushing as the Patriots lost was like,

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,100
I literally had to,

89
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,930
I had to go for a walk after they
lost. Um, and I gotta tell you,

90
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,700
I felt like we were
going to lose that game.

91
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,930
Yeah.

92
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,850
You know, sometime in the second quarter,
I was just like, this, I can feel it.

93
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:30,010
This just isn't our day. It
just wasn't Brady never, I mean,

94
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:33,370
they were all over him. He
never got comfortable and, uh,

95
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:36,100
it wasn't screaming and yelling and
getting people going. I thought,

96
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,110
but I fucking defense played great.
Um, but I, Gee, I don't know.

97
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:43,600
I just sometimes you can just feel,
it's just not your fucking day.

98
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:47,620
So I literally had to go for a walk,
went to the bank,

99
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,450
I mailed something, I got the
car washed. It was like nobody,

100
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,670
there was like a ghost town.
It was just like, you know,

101
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,820
some fucking nerds or whatever who
don't give a shit about and some poor

102
00:05:57,821 --> 00:06:02,050
bastards who had to work. And, um, yeah,

103
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:05,270
I went to the car wash and
then I went to this, uh, uh,

104
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,240
Mediterranean, Middle East, and whenever
the fuck it has got one of those raps,

105
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,270
the Shawarma wraps, whatever the fuck
you call it. And it actually worked out.

106
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:16,720
Perfect. Guy Walked a few blocks
over. I got the rap, I ate it,

107
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:19,990
I watched some of the Carolina Arizona
game. And then when I came back,

108
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:23,530
right as I came back, the
guy was finishing my car
and he put his hand up like,

109
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:27,770
Oh, whose car resists? It was
fucking perfect, perfect timing. Um,

110
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,650
that was about the only a good thing
that happened during those three hours of

111
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:35,680
watching the fucking game.
But um,

112
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:36,990
okay.

113
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,760
Anyways, I got to tell
you is as bad as, um,

114
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,750
as bad as the, the feeling I
had when the Patriots lost. Um,

115
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,620
the one thing that cheered
me up was watching that
Carolina fans fall out of the

116
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,490
fucking stance.

117
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,970
That was one of the funniest fucking
things I've seen in a long time.

118
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,960
He just completely, he missed time when
the player was coming down. I think he,

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,650
I think he just ran down and he just,

120
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:08,651
Mitch Ms Judge with the rail was and he
just slammed into it and just went right

121
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,050
up and over, straight up
and over. I mean if you,

122
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,970
if you put a coat rack on wheels, it would
have landed lighter than this guy did.

123
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,230
There was just nothing athletic,
a bottom. It was just all fucking,

124
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,860
it was at a nourisher of set the
proper physics. Jeremy just read that.

125
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,790
I just wish I could have heard his
thoughts when he was at the tipping point

126
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,360
when his legs were right up.

127
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,370
But pointing at the 12 and his head was
at six o'clock right as it started to

128
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,990
come around till about 1145
you know,

129
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,630
he was lying to himself hanging onto the
rail. Like, I got this, I got this. Ah,

130
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,520
fuck,
Oh,

131
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:49,521
this is stupid dad jeans just shooting
up in the air right from the gap.

132
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,600
It just fucking lands on the ground.
I liked when he got up to,

133
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:56,600
and then he tried to like climb back up
in the stands and that dude was there.

134
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,150
Like I know, buddy. What, why
don't you just walk around?

135
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,330
We don't need your fallen down again.
Um,

136
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,790
okay.

137
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,860
I'll tell you what the funny thing is
is you know there's going to be some

138
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,870
lawyer scare in the fuck out
of the owner of that team.

139
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,550
Then emotionless maniac that they kept
cutting too when he would just be sitting

140
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:18,140
there like he was listening to the
verdict of his own murder trial. Um,

141
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,600
the fuck is what that guy is. He
just focused on the super bowl.

142
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,730
Everybody in his luxury box is going nuts.

143
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,690
He's got his fucking furred up a wife.

144
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,720
That's when you know you got money when
your wife has a fur coat and hasn't been

145
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,790
spray painted. You know,
that's when you know that it's,

146
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,800
you guys are living a level of wealth
that you don't even run into commoners to

147
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,210
you.
You know,

148
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,840
there's always some contents got to come
along and fucking spray paint somebody

149
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,460
fur coat,
which I've never understood.

150
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,510
It's like the animal died and now
he's just going to throw out a tidy,

151
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,030
at least there was a jacket.
You know what I mean?

152
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,580
Like if somebody came and killed me,
it made a jacket out of me.

153
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,930
I wouldn't want you to spray paint it,
you know,

154
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,730
and then they're just going to throw it
out. Then I'm just like a fucking jacket,

155
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,700
you know, in a landfill.
Right. Floating in the ocean.

156
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,610
Let the bitch walk around with it.

157
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,560
Um, anyways. Jesus fucking
Christ. Oh diary. Right now.

158
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,530
Nobody's having more fun in
the national football league.

159
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,930
Oh God. I was watching the
game with a buddy of mine.

160
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:29,410
We were just throwing out the cliches
all day. He gets, he gets here.

161
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,950
He's the first one here. When
he's the last one to leave.
I'll tell you right now,

162
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:36,990
you can be 22 guys like dad. I
could coach. His date goes to both.

163
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,110
Okay

164
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,470
Day. Right now you have to know
where you are on the field.

165
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,240
Why would you run a five yard route when
you need six yards for a first down?

166
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,340
I mean,
that just doesn't make any sense.

167
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,340
I'll tell you out there. They are
just, they're just having fun up there.

168
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,770
They're just having fun. That's what this
game's all about. The owner out there,

169
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:03,170
they are loose. He's just
out there slinging it. Um,

170
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,370
anyways, and just like that. My
fucking football season is over.

171
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:12,700
So who do you like in the Superbowl?
I'll tell you what I don't like.

172
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:15,940
Have you seen that fucking
advertisement for Super Bowl 50,

173
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:20,140
the 50s and gold and for whatever
reason, this woman standing? Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,110
Looking like the hot chick that walks
in and some gum shoe movie from the

175
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,870
fucking 1940s.
She stayed in there on a rank,

176
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:30,120
Colton high heels with
like a golden umbrella

177
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,730
telling you it's,
it's over.

178
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,950
It's fucking over. The bills hired a, uh,

179
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,550
I don't know what they are.
They had a woman for some job or,

180
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:46,010
but it's fucking over
it. It's done. It's done.

181
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,540
Those three hours where you
could get away as a married guy,

182
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,220
you could just get away for three
hours. It's, it's, it's over. It's, I,

183
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,890
it's going to sound like
the Westminster dog show

184
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,040
about seven years. You
know, we had a great run,

185
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,140
we had a great run and
now it's over, you know,

186
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,000
but it's our own damn fault. It's our
own damn fault. You know what it was,

187
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:19,340
we just couldn't hide the joy we were
having watching football without them.

188
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,750
We couldn't hide the joy. And there's
nothing that a noise of fucking woman,

189
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,640
like a bunch of guys going and having a
good time without them. So they're red.

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,650
That dressing in pink for a fucking month,
it's, it's fucking, it's fucking over.

191
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,773
Uh,

192
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,690
I wish I just knew. I just knew, I wish
I knew that it was going to come to this.

193
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:43,840
I would have tried to enjoy,
you know,

194
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,490
my first 37, 38 years of
football, they just flew by.

195
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,760
I would have tried to enjoy them a
little bit more and now it's over.

196
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:55,980
Okay,

197
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,190
we should make a trade. We says what we
should do, we should just trade them.

198
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:00,800
The wn VA just go like,
well,

199
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:04,230
what if we just give you
a league that we started?

200
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,260
It'd be almost like a divorce where you
just get it even though you didn't do

201
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:07,680
anything.

202
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,710
Or maybe you'd like emotionally supported
the guy or some shit or whatever the

203
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:14,310
fuck you say at the court. Right?
You just give them the w NBA.

204
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,480
You can be the commissioners,
all the owners, the commentators,

205
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:19,440
the RAF's you can be,

206
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:24,030
everybody in the stands will give you
your section of Buffalo wild wings.

207
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,850
You know, just, just don't take
NFL football from his kidney,

208
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,360
kidney. Just not just can you give
us, can you just leave us with that?

209
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:38,250
Can we just have that?
Ah,

210
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,760
God,
maybe I'm just too old to understand it.

211
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,360
Coach, can you tell us what
happened there in the first half?

212
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,330
Well,
we weren't getting it done.

213
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,820
I just don't know if I'm ready for that,

214
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,070
you know?
I Dunno

215
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,650
that just yet. I don't, I don't
know where, where do you go now?

216
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,380
Yeah.

217
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,390
I guess it gets you only
place left is you, you,

218
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,960
you become one of those weird old guys
that plays chess and the [inaudible]

219
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,843
park

220
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,570
is about chess.

221
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,220
It's boring and quiet enough that they
don't notice that you're over there

222
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,450
without them enjoying yourself.
You know?

223
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,280
That's the genius. You ever see a guy
who's been married for like 50 years?

224
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:33,930
Like the genius of him, I swear to God,
the genius of them is they fucking,

225
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,740
they know how to have a good time
without their wife notices it.

226
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,140
So it doesn't Pique our interest.
Right. She's fucking over in the choir.

227
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:46,310
She didn't give a shit. Right.
But young guys were idiots.

228
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,780
We come home with a big grin on her face
talking about how awesome it was, blah,

229
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:51,410
blah.

230
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,410
And all they hear is this motherfucker
had the nerve to go out for three hours

231
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:02,380
and not miss me and not think about me.
Well,

232
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:03,880
we'll see about that,
won't we?

233
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,213
Okay.
Um,

234
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,570
it's fucking over.

235
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,560
Ah, it's over. Just like the
Patriots season. So who do
you guys like in the, um,

236
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,800
who do you guys like in the,
uh,

237
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,183
yeah,

238
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,080
I'm trying to think of an
activity that women do.

239
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,200
We're fucking group that they have
that I would like to infiltrate. And I,

240
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:30,170
for the life of me, I can't
think of it. You know,

241
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,410
what are they got off
the f the forage club.

242
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,150
Okay.

243
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,080
Girl Scouting.

244
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,913
MMM.

245
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,510
Any those feminists groups,
there'd be a funny thing to join.

246
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,290
Join one of those fucking groups
and act like you're a feminist.

247
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,710
He just go down there and you
say like the most ignorant,

248
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,880
but like yet it's still pro women shit
come down there with a fucking bud tall.

249
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,710
Yeah. I just wanted to say, you know, I
came down here to support your broads.

250
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,520
You know, I think it's a, I think it's
fucked up the way that God treats you.

251
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,040
You know,

252
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,500
just cause you run around with a skirt
and it takes you long to get ready.

253
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:12,240
Doesn't mean you can't run the company.
Right. My right ladies. Come on bill.

254
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,490
We really appreciate you coming down here.

255
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:19,320
We think what you're saying is positive.
We just see some buzzwords here that we,

256
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:23,100
uh, put into a spreadsheet,
a little pamphlet thing that
we'd like you to look at.

257
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,060
Maybe you could not say them the next
meeting. Maybe take a couple of weeks off.

258
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,040
Oh no damn.
Showed up every week.

259
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:30,850
Yeah.

260
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,730
Wait for him to kick me out.
Then I sue him for being sexist.

261
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,710
Um, I'm just a grumpy old
man. That's all it is.

262
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,200
I am a grumpy old man who
wants things to stay the same.

263
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,840
Okay.

264
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,110
You know, do I make any money off the
NFL? I don't. I do have the mute button.

265
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,580
You gotta you gotta love the mute button.

266
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,760
Anytime they cut to the chick on the
sideline. I just fucking, I hit mute,

267
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,140
you know, just trying to,
to keep it going, you know,

268
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,990
just for another couple more weeks.
How come we can't blah,

269
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:05,380
blah blah and the, okay. All right. Jesus
Christ. I think it really comes up, huh?

270
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,580
What are you going to do? It's
a, you know, it's fucking over.

271
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,800
It's our own goddamn faults. We just
had too much fucking fun without them.

272
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,530
So, you know, the next thing
we start, just, you come home,

273
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:27,580
you get, you get the tone it
down. Fucking tone it down.

274
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,260
Anyways, let's just plow ahead
here. So I still live in, even said,

275
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,820
what is it, the, uh, super bowl. Who
Do you like? Panthers of Broncos?

276
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,870
You know, I was impressed
at the panthers. Fucking,

277
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,200
we're kicking the shit out of Arizona
and they didn't take the foot off the gas

278
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:49,290
pedal this week. Um, I don't know,

279
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:53,610
but the Broncos have that fucking defense.
But our offensive line stakes,

280
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,020
it doesn't stink. We just banged up. So I
don't know. I don't know how good the, uh,

281
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,370
I dunno. I know. You know what?
I don't even fucking know.

282
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:08,540
I'm still so fucking annoyed
by the Goddamn the finality.

283
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,120
I'm not even that we'd lost cause I
felt Denver was a better fucking team.

284
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,040
God Damn mother fucker. All right.
That's it. Plowing ahead. Oh,

285
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:20,390
by the way, did I mention I saw a, the
hateful late. Did anybody see that?

286
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,520
Did anybody see the hateful eight?
I can't remember if I talked about it.

287
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:29,980
I saw it in 70 millimeter at
the arclight here and, uh,

288
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
in Los Angeles,
um,

289
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,150
it had an intermission and it
had an overture in the beginning.

290
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:40,880
There were no coming attractions
cause who the fuck's gonna shoot that?

291
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,080
The 70 millimeter.
Right.

292
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,740
And I absolutely fucking love
that movie from start to finish.

293
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:52,230
I love the pacing of it. I
loved the whole, I just loved,

294
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,450
I loved it. I just, the whole fun.

295
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,490
It was just an experience.
Like Tarantino was like,

296
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:02,110
I don't give a fuck about your
cell phone. How you, your,

297
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,090
your fucking brain is all scrambled now
cause you're looking at an iPad screen.

298
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,290
All God Damn Day Long.

299
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,340
I don't give a fuck the movies this long.

300
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:15,240
This is the movie I wanted to make.
And you can settle the fucking or leave.

301
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,580
Is it just an experience? I absolutely
fucking love that movie. Um, Oh,

302
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,310
speaking of with speaking of iPads,
so you see when the Patriots I pads went,

303
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,540
oh no, stranger to the Broncos
go out. But that weird,

304
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,980
that's just one of those strange things.

305
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:32,490
Just one of those fluke things that
happen to happen and die. It's all good.

306
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,810
It's all good because it happened to the
Patriots now had it happened the other

307
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,530
way around and it was in our stadium.
Oh Jesus.

308
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:43,560
How many months would ESPN
talk about that? You know,

309
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:45,600
versus he called me today
instead of former quarterback,

310
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,760
I think it was for the giants. Don't
even know it was saying like, yeah,

311
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,650
we just take air out of the
ball all the fucking time.

312
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,140
Everybody did it and everybody does it.

313
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,390
Okay.

314
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,940
Once again, and I know you
guys are like, oh Jesus, Bill,

315
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,210
how long are you going to harp on this
while they talked about it for fucking

316
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:02,870
eight months. You know,
I think since, you know,

317
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:05,990
the judge threw it out of court, I mean
it hasn't been eight months since then,

318
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:10,370
has it? September, October,
November, December, January.

319
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:14,720
You got another three months of this shit.
Um,

320
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,740
anyways, enough of that shit. I, uh,
all by the way, I started that, that um,

321
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,090
that series top boy,

322
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,590
top boy on a Netflix and
a fucking great show,

323
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,370
two episodes in enjoying it,
but Jesus Christ,

324
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:35,580
you got to put on the fucking subtitles.
Good Lord.

325
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,380
Mumbling fast as fuck.
It's almost as bad as peaky blinders,

326
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:41,161
but peaky blinders.

327
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,770
You can understand the shit was supposed
to happen like a hundred years ago.

328
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,960
This shit here,
as far as I can tell,

329
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,170
supposed to be going on right now
and I still can't understand them.

330
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,980
I don't think they say in it enough.
Um, stamps.com everybody here,

00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:01,080
Go to the post office,
takes up so much time.

334
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,820
A leasing a postage meter
is way too expensive. Turns
out there is a better way.

00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:24,731
The post office plus stamps.com is
more powerful than a postage at just a

341
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:25,820
fraction of the cost.

but you need to know how to cook it right?

367

If you want to start nailing the

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,460
which is fucking hilarious. I got to
sit in inbetween guys at that level. Uh,

429
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:49,210
I played that song off of, uh, the
presence album for your love and uh,

430
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,870
I'm sorry for your love
for your life and uh,

431
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,820
I want to thank everyone in the Moby
Dick's for helping walk me through that

432
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:02,590
song. Um, uh, you know,
you know what it was,

433
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:04,240
I fucked up a lot during the song,

434
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,570
but I nailed the arrangement
as far as like all the changes.

435
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,380
I was on it for that.
And I find that if you do that,

436
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,560
that people in the crowd don't notice
that you're fucking up the fills.

437
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,380
There was like one big Phil and I
fucking ripped out on the thing.

438
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,820
I was so fucking pissed. Um, what
are you gonna do it? But it was, uh,

439
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,300
it was just a fucking amazing night and
four hours fucking long watching these

440
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:29,800
guys.
And they had this bond,

441
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,690
them fucking vista lights set the
exact same style kit that he had.

442
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,500
Um, if you watch the song and the
song remains the same and this,

443
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,520
the fucking kicked Rome was wide open.
They had nothing in there.

444
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:44,710
They didn't even have felt
strip going across it.

445
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,930
It was one of the sickest sounds I've
ever heard in my life. Big 26 inch kit.

446
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:55,180
They had the two tympanies to the left
of the high hat and then the fucking

447
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:58,720
Gong. And it's, I'm so pissed at the end
of the song, I didn't hit the fucking Gog,

448
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,580
how many fucking opportunities to get
to do that and I blew it. But, um,

449
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,660
I just said I just had the
best time doing it. And, uh,

450
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,580
then of course I'm driving home. It was
down in Anaheim and I'm driving home.

451
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,030
And the best thing about driving home at
night in La is just finally no traffic.

452
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,220
And I'm fucking cruising. And, uh,

453
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,270
all of a sudden the fucking five just
comes to a grinding halt in three,

454
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:25,444
four lanes,

455
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,800
merge down to one and then are
forced off of the highway into like a

456
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:31,840
neighborhood.
Uh,

457
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,380
because the only time they obviously that
they can fix the highways is at night.

458
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:39,670
So I have empathy for these
state workers out here,

459
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:43,460
but um, sucked for me
and I just, I completely,

460
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,890
I had like a fucking meltdown for about
five minutes and I was texting everyone

461
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:51,880
that I got a number from that was on
the show telling them not to get on the

462
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:56,650
five and a fuck Bruton.
And once again,

463
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:58,990
I just don't understand why
people buy fast cars out here.

464
00:27:58,991 --> 00:28:02,320
Unless you have a pickup truck with
a trailer and you can drive that car,

465
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,000
you can tow the car to a race track.
I just don't understand. You know,

466
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:08,800
these fucking cars you see out here,

467
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:11,890
they can go like 180 hundred
60 tour to miles an hour.

468
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,180
Some of these fucking cars. It's
like, where are you doing that?

469
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,883
I Dunno.

470
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,540
It's fucking ridiculous. I beeped at this
lady today. That was probably a dick.

471
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,020
I just really, I can't fucking
stand people when they sit
at a Goddamn red light.

472
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:27,450
You're right behind them.
And then when the light turns green,

473
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:30,180
they put on their fucking left
turn signal and then you beat bad.

474
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:32,580
And they're like, what the fuck?
It's like, give me a heads up.

475
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,700
Give me a heads up so I could have
backed off and gone around you,

476
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:38,580
your fucking Dick. Now the 20
people behind me are going to go by.

477
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:43,250
I'm going to miss the fucking light. Now
I'm on your schedule. You know, like that.

478
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:46,250
That's never happened to you. You'd
never been the person behind that person.

479
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:49,550
You don't fucking remember. Now your
first align, you just say fuck it.

480
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,920
Sorry. Most of this shit, everything
that I'm saying, women in the NFL,

481
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:57,140
all of this shit,
most of the shit has nothing to do with.

482
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,390
It has to do with the fact
that my team lost, you know,

483
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:03,770
so now I'm just fucking
grumpy. Um, anyways,

484
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,863
today.

485
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,963
Okay.

486
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,580
Kipper um, all right. Oh, hey,

487
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:23,540
I'm going to be playing out live again. If
you guys, uh, Andrew would stand up. Oh,

488
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:27,530
Dean del Rey.
Dean del Rey's a 50th birthday.

489
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,490
You got to come down to this at the
El Rey theater, Delray at the El Rey.

490
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:32,710
Uh,

491
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,710
it's going to be an unbelievable fucking
lineup of comedians and musicians to

492
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:42,460
celebrate. Dean Del Rey's
50th. And of course,

493
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:47,080
my fucking Internet cuts out. I finally
had the fucking thing finally had it.

494
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:51,100
I had it all fucking lined up.
I was ready to read off the whole thing.

495
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,250
And what happens?
It just fucking disappears.

496
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:58,930
You fucking cunt. All right,
well this is what I know.

497
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,443

All right. Let's, uh, let's continue on
here with, with the, uh, with the podcast.

516
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:15,960
What else did I want to talk about?
Is there anything, anything at all?

517
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,660
It's like if I,
as I settle into the fact

518
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,690
that might fucking football season
is over, um, oh, Jesus Christ,

519
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:29,100
the Patrice O'Neal benefit. How the
fuck did I almost forget that? Uh,

520
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,180
late great. Patrice O'neil, the, I
think this is the fourth one we've done.

521
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,613
MMM.

522
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,970
Yeah. 13, 14, 15, 16. Yeah, this is
the fourth one. So I already flying by.

523
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:46,370
Um, it's sold out. There will be
a few tickets released at the,

524
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,204
um,

525
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,260
right before the show starts is always
a few people that requested tickets and

526
00:31:51,261 --> 00:31:52,100
then they don't show up.

527
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:55,700
So there's a chance if you walk
up there might be a sub tickets.

528
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:58,190
It's going to be an amazing
lineup and as always, uh,

529
00:31:58,191 --> 00:32:02,840
other than the money that we use
to a pay to rent out the theater,

530
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:04,160
all monies goes to a,

531
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:09,161
Patrice has loved ones and it's really
made an unbelievably positive effect on

532
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:12,970
their lives.
You know,

533
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:16,450
his mom has been able to get a condo and
his stepdaughters is going to private

534
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,770
school since the benefit.
And um,

535
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:25,300
just the quality of their lives
basically stayed the same, you know,

536
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:29,020
Patrice was taken care of
them. So, um, it's really,

537
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:32,320
it's the greatest thing that I'm involved
in during the course of the year and

538
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:37,321
I'm so happy that you guys step
it up every year and buy tickets.

539
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:40,610
So I want to thank everybody who
bought it means the world to me.

540
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:44,420
And everybody involved and all the comics
that take time out of their schedule

541
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:48,560
to come down there and um,
and perform.

542
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,640
And it's just a,

543
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:52,370
it's just an awesome thing and we're just
going to keep doing it as long as you

544
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:57,230
guys keep showing up. All right. So thank
you. Thank you for that. And with that,

545
00:32:57,231 --> 00:33:01,880
let's get into some of the reeds here
for their, uh, for this week. All right.

546
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,710
What are we up to here at 33 minutes?
All, all right. All right. Hacky hate.

547
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,690
Hey Bill. How I, yeah, he
says, I am not a patriots fan.

548
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,050
I am a die hard bears fan.
After the Patriots lost,

549
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:20,051
all I sell on Facebook was people
trashing Brady and bringing up Trump and

550
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:24,260
deflate gate.
I get it there on most.

551
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,910
They're on top most of the time and
people love to trash him or whoever's

552
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,840
winning at life.

553
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,340
Now let's stop giving excuses to these
pansy ass fucking sports fan who spent

554
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:38,570
sports fans spend 90% of their
fucking time talking about gossip.

555
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,020
It all gets classified under gossip.
Every hack who was,

556
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,580
who was the static that the
pastry is loss is an asshole.

557
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,470
Especially the ones who will declare they
could care less about sports. Congrats.

558
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:53,930
You're about as cool as the
guy who paints his face.

559
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:59,120
The only time I'd talk shit about the
Patriots is to remind them of 1985 even.

560
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:03,790
That's pretty weak. Go bears. Um,
yeah, but you know, if you're on top,

561
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,310
you got to expect that people
are going to give you shit. Um,

562
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,410
the only thing I didn't like was, was when
the, the Broncos' defense, you know, oh,

563
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:15,880
we're getting sugar here. What
about Tom Brady? It's like,

564
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:20,840
well then when a fucking Superbowl win
four of them and they'll talk about you.

565
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,480
The Patriots never talked
shit about the Broncos.

566
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,660
They never said that they
were better than the Broncos.

567
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,690
And I also love to where it's just so
like, you know, they were favorites,

568
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,740
they were fit, but like the Patriots
made themselves favorites that, you know,

569
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,240
what's really overrated is,

570
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:40,270
is being a favorite or being an underdog
has nothing to do with your team.

571
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,480
It has to do with the fucking dope.

572
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,010
In the buffalo wild wings who's
betting on games? All right.

573
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,360
What Vegas tries to do is they try to
get money on both sides of the ball,

574
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:55,910
so they try to pick a number.
All right,

575
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,240
that's going to entice people to go 50 50.

576
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:02,030
That's why the line changes
during the course of the week.

577
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,330
Did one team get better or another
team get get worse? I mean,

578
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,940
if there's an injury, yes, but
generally speaking, no, what happens is,

579
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,280
is this too much money going to one side?

580
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:14,690
So they need to entice people to
come back the other side. Because if,

581
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,320
if you know that you can't have like 90%
of the money on one side of the ball,

582
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:23,060
that could completely fuck
over the gambling ring or the,

583
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:26,260
uh, they don't like those
odds and because ties lose,

584
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,840
that's enough to tip it in their fucking
favor. That's basically what goes on,

585
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,810
which is why,
you know,

586
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:37,010
if you look back in oh seven when the
Patriots beat the giants the last game of

587
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,130
the year and the giants put up like
fucking 33 or 34 points and we only won by

588
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:42,270
like three or something.

589
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,340
That's why like a month later we
were still 14 point favorites.

590
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,180
It hasn't, all the Patriots are
overhyped. They weren't over hyped.

591
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:56,181
What happened was the Superbowl brings
out people who don't know shit about

592
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:57,804
football.

593
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,010
Okay?

594
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,410
All right. It brings out the fucking
ladies. It brings out all, you know,

595
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,740
there's nothing worse than a super bowl
party if you give a shit about football,

596
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:07,760
if you really like the super belief,
really like football.

597
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:08,650
If you're really a football fan,

598
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:12,760
you watch it alone or you watch it with
like two or three other people that keep

599
00:36:12,761 --> 00:36:16,250
their fucking mouth shut, right? Um,

600
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,360
but what happens is during the Superbowl
that brings out all the fucking,

601
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,190
the novice fans that people don't even
watch and all they see is 18 and all the

602
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:26,800
fucking door. Or they know
Brady. Like they know,

603
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,980
they know Tom Brady the way I
know Darth Vader. All right.

604
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:34,210
I can't tell you a fucking thing
about the last,

605
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,850
like I don't even know how many,
there's Ben since the original three.

606
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,750
I know Veda is fucking Luke's
father and that fucking uh,

607
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,280
okay.

608
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,280
Luke in layer are brother and sister and
that they kind of had like this sexual

609
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,990
tension in wanting to fuck
each other in the beginning,

610
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:55,440
which I think is a really weird thing
to put into a kid's movie, don't you?

611
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,343
Um,

612
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,120
okay.

613
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,970
Maybe he didn't know that
when he initially wrote it
and then he just needed a

614
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:04,880
good left turn when he was writing the
second one. I have no fucking idea,

615
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,330
but I think the way he tried to make it
up was with those journals and the third

616
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:13,250
one, you know, what are the
fuck they did, you know,

617
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,180
I know what the fuck they did. So
anyways, so that's as much as I can.

618
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,250
As much as I know about star wars,
these people know about football.

619
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:23,180
So then they come in and they go to Vegas
and everybody goes in and thinks that

620
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:27,320
they're fucking Sean Connery and James
Bond. Right. They were, you know,

621
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:30,680
they fucking go down there and
they got some Almond Vegas suit on.

622
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,990
Their wife's wearing some fucking,
you know,

623
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:36,020
sparkly number and everybody's out there,
you know,

624
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:38,630
stepping outside of themselves in and say,
I want to gamble.

625
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,140
I want to get in the action.
Who's playing? I don't know
who that other team is.

626
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,400
I know Tom Brady is, let me, yeah, let
me put a hundred bucks on his stone.

627
00:37:46,401 --> 00:37:47,840
The clef of his fucking Chin.

628
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:52,580
And that's how the line goes from
what it should be about three,

629
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:56,360
four points to all the way up to 14.
That's what the fuck happens. All right.

630
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,760
And that was for everybody who doesn't
fucking gamble. Okay. All right,

631
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:05,600
cool enough already. We get it.
Your team lost and you're fucking,

632
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:09,800
you're in a country mood. Um, thank
God that guy fell out of his stance.

633
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,600
He didn't even look that drunk.

634
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,620
I just loved his fucking gap jeans
just fucking straight up in the air.

635
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,130
All right. Next question
here. Um, oh, by the way,

636
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:23,230
if you'd like to donate to this podcast,
um,

637
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,550
all you gotta do is just go to
a next time you go to Amazon.

638
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,900
If the next time I'm going
to buy something on that,
uh, just go to my website,

639
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,950
billboard.com, click on the podcast page
and then you just click on the Amazon.

640
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,090
It just takes you there. It doesn't cost
you any extra money. You might, you know,

641
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,120
later on in life, if your index finger
wears out, you might think like,

642
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:46,720
you know what, if I didn't do those
extra two clicks with my index finger,

643
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:51,400
maybe I would have had another 10 minutes
of joy and no fucking constant pain

644
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,420
and my index finger. Other than that,
there's really nothing I even do it.

645
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,260
I even go when I go to Amazon. Well, why
wouldn't I guess I get the money right?

646
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,830
You don't. I did. I went on there
and I fixed my fucking cool.

647
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,560
I Dunno what the fuck happened to my
cooler this year that the rose bowl,

648
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,470
it's been to every Rosebowl that I've
been to and I've been to eight of them at

649
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:16,270
this point and I never had
a fucking problem. And at
some point, like my cooler,

650
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,030
basically it opens up to a point,
you know,

651
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:22,390
the hinges stop it from opening and
then there's this strap to keep it from

652
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:26,500
going any further. And I
don't know what happened. Um,

653
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,720
cause I fucking passed out like at
like 10 o'clock in the morning, so,

654
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,020
okay.

655
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,860
And I didn't even notice
that my cooler was fucked up.

656
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:38,270
But at the end of the night when
I got my cooler back, the, uh,

657
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,140
it had basically been decapitated.

658
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,270
The strap was busted and the hinges were
busted. And I was like, what the fuck?

659
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,740
What happened? You know, it's like the
hulk opened the thing up or something.

660
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,070
She just like, just open a little, it's
fine. But then I was thinking of Warren,

661
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:56,940
I fell down was I was drunk that I
land on the cooler and it's like, no,

662
00:39:56,941 --> 00:40:01,140
I w I wouldn't noticed that. I landed flat
on my, I landed like that fucking guy.

663
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,340
What? He fell out of the stands.
It's how I fell. I fell on the grass.

664
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,140
Do you realize I was on a fairway,

665
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,680
a straight fairway golf course and
I lost my balance and fell down.

666
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:15,570
That's how fucking drunk I was. And you
know what? It was fucking great. Um,

667
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,580
so anyways, I went to a, Oh
actually I didn't go to Amazon,

668
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,500
I just looked up Igloo.
Um,

669
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,330
okay.

670
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,970
Cooler repair kit and they got like,

671
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:29,480
there's two different kinds of hinges and
I accidentally ordered two of them and

672
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:30,530
I only need one of them.

673
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,600
So I have an extra repair kit and I
know you know the odds and they send you

674
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:39,590
like three sets of hinges. You
know, if you have like the,

675
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,420
the giant one,
you know,

676
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:44,250
the person who kills his wife and
doesn't want anybody to know and just say

677
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:45,860
she's on vacation and he cuts her up.

678
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:49,790
Like they have that size hinge for that
cooler. And then they just got, you know,

679
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:52,760
the happy drunks that falls down
on New Year's Day, you know,

680
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,600
so they come with three
sets of hinges for each.

681
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,750
So I have an entire extra one.
So anybody out there who has like a,

682
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,880
a cooler that needs to be replaced,
they had, comes with everything.

683
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:09,470
Even like the drain little drain hole,
fucking spout thing, it's got that, um,

684
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,290
the strap does come separately.
I don't have an extra strap,

685
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:15,140
but I have an extra or a repair kits.
So if anybody wants it,

686
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,680
send us an email with an address and
I'll send it out to you because what else

687
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:22,460
am I gonna do with it? I'm not going to
throw it out. And some day if I ever move,

688
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:28,030
um, you know, I've got to pack up
something that I don't even fucking neat.

689
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:32,760
So there you go. Oh, by the way, uh, yeah,

690
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:39,110
I'm still in the running here to maybe
get this drum room made slash podcast

691
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:43,610
room in the back of my garage.
Um, as always, there's major,

692
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:47,480
major fucking structural issues. But, um,

693
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,620
I don't know. It's just I got up, I
got to shore up that part of the house.

694
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:53,550
But there's,
there's all these,

695
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:57,810
these all these fucking issues that I
can't even talk about because, you know,

696
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,810
I'm getting a permit. I'm doing all of
that fucking shit. I know somebody like,

697
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:02,730
well, you don't need a
full can permit. It is flu.

698
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,800
If you're building within the structure,

699
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,860
if you know what Eric and the square
footage you, blah, blah, blah, blah.

700
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,730
But I know all that shit.
But like, I just, you know,

701
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,670
anytime you start hammering you and
your fucking garage enablers here at the

702
00:42:14,671 --> 00:42:17,020
fucking rat you out,
I just don't need the fucking headache.

703
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:22,021
So I am doing my due diligence
and it's taking a long time.

704
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:25,500
But, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make this,

705
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:30,480
I'm going to make this fucking happen
and I have a 71 Ludwig green sparkled all

706
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,050
bottom size drums and I'm going to make
sure that they fucking fit in there.

707
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,630
And I'm going to fucking, I don't
give a shit. What do I care? Right?

708
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,950
You know,
the oceans are all fished out.

709
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,750
The government takes all your fucking
money. You know, I don't give a fuck.

710
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:50,670
I'm going all out with
distinct this thing.

711
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,860
I'm literally going to be able to pull,
I'm going to tell this guy,

712
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,880
if I'm able to do this and I'm not going
to have a fucking problem legally and I

713
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:58,560
could build the fucking
thing I want to build.

714
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,610
I'm literally going to be able to play
at two o'clock in the fucking morning and

715
00:43:02,611 --> 00:43:03,900
no one's even going to hear it.
They might,

716
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:06,620
it might sound like a
stereos on really low. Um,

717
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,100
but I'd never be a Douche enough
to play then, um, at least sober.

718
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,790
That'd be great. Then write,
anytime I'm bugging my wife,

719
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,360
I can just walk out the back door,
go into my garage,

720
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,010
sit down and put on a Zeppelin album,
guns and roses.

721
00:43:23,011 --> 00:43:27,270
Fucking uh, all my fucking Shit I
listened to when I was growing up.

722
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,673
Yeah.

723
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,870
Queens of the Stone Age,
you know?

724
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:32,930
Okay.

725
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,380
At what, what else do you fucking need
though? You know what else I need?

726
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:39,350
I need a bar up there.
Right. Flatscreen TV.

727
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,020
He was funny about a man cave.

728
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:45,140
When somebody really goes throws
down and they're fucking man cave.

729
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:50,170
All I hear is I am not happily married
and we should doing is you're building a

730
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:54,980
mini version of what your life would
look like if you weren't what your house

731
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:56,450
would look like if you weren't married.

732
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,410
Like after you show them the house
with all the throw pillows and all the

733
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:02,240
fucking popery and all that shit,

734
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,730
you bring your buddy out to the
garage and you just like, yeah,

735
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:07,850
if I wasn't married,
like this is what it would look like.

736
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,680
But you know what's funny about that?

737
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,880
I'm old enough to know that if
your house did look like that,

738
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,210
the ice,

739
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,780
I see the loneliness in it because
the bottom line is a man cave.

740
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:28,570
What it is is like, what's your
building is what you wish you had,

741
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:31,560
you wish you could afford when
you were fucking 22 years old.

742
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,700
That's basically it. And the problem
is, is if you do it, honestly,

743
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,080
if you're actually work your balls off,
you know,

744
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,080
and you don't steal from anybody
or anything, that fucking shit,

745
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,030
it's going to take it to you about 50,

746
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,570
unless you one of these fucking nerds
in silicone valley that comes up with an

747
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:52,700
APP or some shit, you know,
you really don't get paid.

748
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,010
So you get close to 50. That's
just how it is. You know?

749
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,520
It's just how it is. Except for Cam
Newton. He's getting paid around, right?

750
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,190
Oh my God. No. He's having
more fun than that guy.

751
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,500
If you look up fun in the dictionary,
um,

752
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,270
anyways, I, um, yeah,

753
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,330
I'm going to fucking make a
little podcast thing. I mean,

754
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:18,170
I don't have a lot of
room, but, uh, I'm gonna,

755
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,570
I'm gonna fucking do it
upright. And, uh, you know,

756
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:25,540
getting back and taking lessons again
through the shit that I'm actually paying

757
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:29,020
attention to now that I never paid
attention to how I hold onto the sticks,

758
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,620
where I'm hitting the snare drum,
my balance,

759
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,890
all of that shit used to be
all about going on youtube,

760
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,980
seeing some guy do one of those
Gospel Chop fucking licks.

761
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:42,430
And then I'm going to go down here and
fucking just do this for fucking nine

762
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:46,540
days in a row and then I'll be able
to do that, you know, pull this,

763
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:50,620
fill off next time I walk
into Guitar Center. And, uh,

764
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:54,490
and then meanwhile all my
other planks shocked. And uh,

765
00:45:54,491 --> 00:45:55,750
I've just had this

766
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:01,300
total epiphany about all
of it. And, uh, it's funny,

767
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,310
I'm not doing nearly as
much as I used to do,

768
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:06,990
but I think I'm playing better
than I ever played in a, I dunno.

769
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,760
It's fucking exciting. It gives me a
reason to get up in the morning, you know?

770
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,780
So anyways,
let's move on to the next question here.

771
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,270
Uh,
oh my God.

772
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:19,650
Did I tell you guys how I butchered that
fucking porkchop meal that I made? Oh,

773
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,690
still sick over that. Oh, I'm like,

774
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,210
I'm eating pork chops again this week
cause I have to redeem myself. All right,

775
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,980
so the hacky hate thing.
Yeah,

776
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:31,820
that just kind of comes with winning
games or whatever. I'm all right.

777
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,800
No Asian diversity at the Oscars.
Bill hello from Canada.

778
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:39,220
Would love to hear what your take is on
why no one's complaining about the lack

779
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:42,970
of agents at the Oscars.
Oh you motherfucker. That's
the bit I was going to do.

780
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,990
That was the bit I was going to do. Yeah,
that's it's as he goes, as an Asian,

781
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,380
I don't care because a,

782
00:46:50,381 --> 00:46:54,820
I suspect we are producing good
enough shit not to not, oh wait,

783
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,560
we're not producing good enough shit.

784
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:01,090
Not because we're Asian be Asians aren't
getting sweet rolls because I'm not

785
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:01,924
profitable.

786
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:06,790
They aren't going to cast an Asian
parentheses or black or female actor that

787
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:11,560
would make more money out
of some white conspiracy.

788
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:12,760
Yeah,

789
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,520
dude, he had like fucking two
sets of parenthesis in there.

790
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,810
Asians aren't getting sweet rolls
because it's not profitable.

791
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,740
They aren't going there.
They aren't going to not cast an Asian

792
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,550
yeah.

793
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:31,250
Or black or female actor that, well,
I see what you're saying. They're not,

794
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,960
they aren't going to not cast an Asian
actor that would make more money out of

795
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:39,170
some white conspiracy. So you're saying
if they, if they would make them money,

796
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,040
then they would see who cares if they
don't like how the Oscars define the best,

797
00:47:45,891 --> 00:47:49,120
whatever.
I don't get why.

798
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,430
And then that's the end of it. I
see what you're saying. Well, yeah,

799
00:47:53,431 --> 00:47:55,620
you're looking at it from a very,
uh,

800
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:02,060
like money. Like I think that's a
lot of times sometimes, you know,

801
00:48:02,061 --> 00:48:05,960
it looks like it's racism. A lot
of times it's just money. But what,

802
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:06,670
yeah,

803
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:07,503
I think

804
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:13,830
American cinema is finally realizing
is that there's a whole bunch of other

805
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:19,771
people in the world that they can actually
get money from if they gave a fuck to

806
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,150
make a movie that would appeal to them.
And the only thing,

807
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,970
reason why I think they're doing that
is because everybody's stole movies and

808
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,040
it's so hard to make
money off of them now.

809
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:34,540
And there's such a big
fucking risk because what
happened to the music business

810
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,470
has happened slash is happening
to the movie business right now,

811
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:43,471
which is why there's really no more
like from like $20 million to like $70

812
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,080
million. They don't make movies in
that budget anymore. They just don't.

813
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:54,880
It's either like some fucking $100 million
star wars action hero movie or it's

814
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:59,380
like fucking below $10 million it seems,
um,

815
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:02,440
all the way down to like a hundred
grand, like indie sort of, you know,

816
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:05,860
micro budget fucking thing.
Um,

817
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:10,770
so yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah. I
mean, yeah, there's no agents area there.

818
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,520
Where's the outcry for
that? Well, people don't,

819
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,110
people give a fuck about themselves.

820
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,740
That's the one thing that I can
say about people in general,

821
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,450
straight across the board,
you know,

822
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,250
which is why I guess white people need,

823
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:28,240
because they're running shit, quote,
running shit. You know what I mean?

824
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:31,270
Like they're all cooperating with one
another because there's white people in

825
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:32,200
those positions.

826
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,580
They need to take the time to actually
give a fuck about other stuff.

827
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:37,480
Cause I gotta be honest with you.

828
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,860
I've thought that kid that played
easy and a straight Outta Compton,

829
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,890
he should've gotten nominated. He was,
he was the fucking Shit and that movie,

830
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,460
I should know that actor's name.
He was, you know what? God dammit.

831
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,540
Why don't I step outside my whiteness?

832
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,510
I'm going to set the example here
right now and I'll tell you right now,

833
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:02,130
there's nobody having more fun
right now going on the Internet.

834
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:05,220
Then this guy, you look up fun on the
Internet. There'll be a picture of me,

835
00:50:05,221 --> 00:50:06,570
easy e actor,

836
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,810
uh,

837
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,220
Eric Lynn, right is here.
Jason Mitchell on playing e.

838
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,790
That fucking guy was that.

839
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:19,190
He should have got something
to even get a golden globe.

840
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:23,770
You get nominated for that.
Um,

841
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,050
that was one of those movies that
I actually didn't even want to see.

842
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,650
There was some line that
what's his face, uh, um,

843
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:37,010
Giamatti said, you know what I mean?
You can't try it out like that 40,

844
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:39,320
yelled, whatever the fuck he
yells. I go, Jesus Christ, this,

845
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:42,890
this looks really heavy handed.
You know what I mean?

846
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:45,800
And then they always have
to have the, uh, you know,

847
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:46,940
they always have to have the white,

848
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,960
white angel and those movies
when they show racism,

849
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:54,470
so then white people will go so they
can lie to themselves and be like, yeah,

850
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,310
if I was there, that's the white guy.
I would be, I'd be the Angel White Guy.

851
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,160
I wouldn't be the, the uh, you
know, the racist sketch. Um,

852
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:08,120
yeah, no, it's a very, it's
a very interesting, the whole
fucking thing is, is really

853
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,900
interesting. I Dunno, I have no idea.
I mean, I think you shouldn't just say,

854
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:18,110
look,
black actors should be nominated.

855
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:21,890
You should fucking then back it up.
You know what I mean?

856
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:23,970
And give shout outs to
people that fucking deserve.

857
00:51:23,971 --> 00:51:27,050
It used to be like Jason Mitchell
playing easy and straight outta Compton.

858
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:30,700
I would have fuck is going to say
he shouldn't have got something. Um,

859
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,490
or maybe they did do that. I
gotta be honest with you. I don't,

860
00:51:32,491 --> 00:51:35,810
I don't really pay attention to award
shows. I fucking can't stand up.

861
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,810
Um, the horrific,
they're fucking horrific.

862
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:46,430
They're boring as hell. There's usually
one moment that's worth fucking watching.

863
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,670
And at that with the Internet,
you're not going to miss it.

864
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:50,630
They're just going to show it to you.

865
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:55,400
So why would you waste four hours
of your life watching the shit?

866
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,210
Like for the Golden Globes, the, the,
the moment of the night was Jim Carrey.

867
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:04,040
Jim Carrey stole that.
He met fucking speech was hilarious.

868
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:07,940
And for what I've heard,
um, from people out here,

869
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:12,530
he just winged that thing. That's
how fucking funny that guy is. Um,

870
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,950
and watching him do that and the brutal
honesty of it really made me wish I

871
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:19,820
could still watch them do stand up
to be honest with you. Um, all right,

872
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:22,010
here we go to your health.
Good serve bill.

873
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,840
I've heard you discussed many topics with,

874
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,900
with yourself on the podcast about
health and longevity of the major topics.

875
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,830
I,
he food and exercise.

876
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:35,240
I would have to suggest considering
another area to focus on breathing.

877
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:40,670
Yeah. Jesus. I got to work
on this to breathing is huge.

878
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,350
How you breathe and the types of breaths
you take during the day to really

879
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:46,760
change your body for the better.

880
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,190
I just literally thought about
breathing and got more relaxed.

881
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,590
This is this yoga shit that I try to slow
my brain down for. Conscious breathing,

882
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:58,490
conscious breathing. Oh, you're going
to plug your book in the middle of this.

883
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,320
You motherfucker. You know what?
You got me. He suckered me in,

884
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,740
but I'm going to read it like deep
thoughts by Jack Handy. Here we go.

885
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,270
Conscious breathing is a book
and a great place to start.

886
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,011
Also,

887
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:18,011
a man by the name of Wim Hoff is doing
amazing things and has been on Joe

888
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,360
Rogan's podcast. You may not
have three hours to listen to it,

889
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,730
but if you run into,
I'm sure he can give you the breakdown.

890
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,310
Thanks for the free laughs.

891
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,693
MMM,

892
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,480
no, I'll listen to anybody that's on
Rogan's podcast. Joe Rogan's podcast,

893
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:39,210
the fastest fucking three hours you're
ever going to spend a very ever lucky

894
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:40,350
enough to be a fucking guest.

895
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:44,000
You can be like at been here like 40
minutes and then all of a sudden you're

896
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,720
like, how the fuck is it like seven
o'clock at night? I missed, uh,

897
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,870
I missed my meal. Um, well I'll, I'll
give it a chance. I'll give it a try.

898
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:56,630
I know I definitely need to
fucking stress less and uh,

899
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,790
that's always like one of my goals.
I haven't been drinking this year though.

900
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,240
The day after the Rose Bowl
was the last time I, I boost.

901
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,913
MMM.

902
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,370
I had one gulp of wine after I made this
really rich dinner and in my stomach I

903
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:13,190
needed to settle it.
So my wife was drinking some wine.

904
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:17,570
I just took a gulp of that.
And then the last three nights in a row,

905
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,290
I'm getting rid of these Rosebowl beers.
I just drink like one light beer.

906
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,340
I just have one and then, then, then I'm
done. And he just kind of makes me sleepy,

907
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,600
but I'm just trying to free up some room
in the fridge because every year at the

908
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:30,434
end of the Rose Bowl,

909
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:35,590
I get stuck with all the extra beers
and like fucking 15 cans of half used

910
00:54:36,261 --> 00:54:38,370
mustard.
Um,

911
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,910
I can't all the condiments and a broken
cooler. All right. Trash in the ocean.

912
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,320
Hey Bill, I know you talk about
this all the time on your podcast,

913
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:51,860
but believe it or not, there are
people who do not believe our trash,

914
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,760
uh,

915
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,630
dumped in the ocean is a problem. Well,
there's always gonna be those people.

916
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:00,570
There's also people who thought
the fucking world was flat. Well,

917
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:02,700
I guess I would have thought the
world is flat. If I lived back then,

918
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:06,870
people didn't think that we were f we
are earning an effect on the climate.

919
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:08,190
Okay.

920
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,920
You know, all the fucking trees
that we've cut down that alone.

921
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,370
You know what I mean? It's
um, all right. Anyways,

922
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,910
he says there was another
scientific study done.

923
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,010
If you believe in that
kind of thing that states,

924
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:24,740
plastics will outweigh
fish in the ocean by 2050.

925
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,593
I saw that.

926
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:29,340
I don't think that that's going to happen
because I have a feeling that mother

927
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:33,780
nature has had enough with us and will,
you know,

928
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:37,140
when they keep predicting by 2090,

929
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:41,910
the population will more than
fucking Quinn. Topal I think that,

930
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,900
you know, we're already long passed the
tipping point. Scientists have said,

931
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:50,450
we're past the point where we can
even fix this fucking thing. So I,

932
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,070
this is like when you can't do your
homework at some point you're like Ma,

933
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,010
and she comes down and helps you out.
I think Mother Nature is going to do that.

934
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,470
And uh, she's an old school mom and
she's going to slap the shit out of us.

935
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,413
Uh,

936
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:10,240
but you don't need to listen to me say
this. Just listen to George Carlin.

937
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,540
He'll tell you all about
it. I'm all right. He said,

938
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:16,980
I guess these assholes assume there'll
be dead by then and don't give a shit.

939
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,340
Long time listening to hear,
just saw you in Indy back in October.

940
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:24,690
I can share you. We aren't all ignorant,
KKK asshole or Jim or say fancy. And I,

941
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:27,480
you know, I just say that just
to fuck with you. Jesus Christ.

942
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:28,890
I grew up outside of Boston.

943
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,580
Half the people in the Klan would go
there and be like, all right, hey,

944
00:56:32,581 --> 00:56:37,080
take it easy. You know, I understand,
but easy. All right, thanks.

945
00:56:37,081 --> 00:56:38,280
And Go fuck yourself.

946
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,170
Okay.

947
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:44,060
And then they sent me the, uh,
the unbelievably depressing link,

948
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:45,770
which I don't,
I don't even go to him anymore.

949
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:48,710
I don't even go to them anymore because
all they do is depress me. All right?

950
00:56:48,711 --> 00:56:52,550
Average amount of waste produced
by humans. Jesus Christ.

951
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,830
We're just staring into this.
Hey Bill,

952
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:59,720
I'm from Columbia and love your
podcast and you stand up comedy. Hey,

953
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,020
that's fucking great.
Oh, you're from Columbia.

954
00:57:03,021 --> 00:57:07,940
I thought you were down there listening.
Uh, brought over. You're from there,

955
00:57:07,941 --> 00:57:10,640
right? You live there. At some point,
you're still listening to the podcast.

956
00:57:10,641 --> 00:57:14,630
It's still cool. Uh, he
goes, um, the are, she goes,

957
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:15,560
I don't know who the fuck wrote this.

958
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:19,880
He goes the other day I was wondering
how much poop is produced by humans on a

959
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:24,590
daily basis. And I did a little research
on the Internet and some calculations,

960
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:28,730
which I would like to share with
you and your audience. Okay?

961
00:57:28,731 --> 00:57:33,230
According to the world fact book,
the world population consists

962
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:34,780
okay,

963
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,370
of 7 billion,
174,611

964
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:41,620
okay,

965
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,750
wait a minute. Why not?
Well, it's 7 billion.

966
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:47,830
174,611,584 people,

967
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,230
and the average human being
weighs around 62 kilograms. Oh,

968
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:56,410
you motherfucker. I want to know what
that is in pounds. I Wagga, I gotta.

969
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:58,540
I gotta switch that over.
I want to see where the fuck I'm at.

970
00:57:59,550 --> 00:57:59,870
Okay.

971
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:04,070
Wait, what did you just say?
62 what do you guys think?

972
00:58:04,071 --> 00:58:07,340
The average person who, I would say the
average person weighs about a hundred.

973
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:13,010
A lot of starving people.
I'll go 162 pounds. What is,

974
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,530
what do you say here? All right. 62

975
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,570
and

976
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,240
L. B S. Right.

977
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,313
Okay.

978
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:27,780
That's equal to 136 pounds.
Holy Shit.

979
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,670
God Damn it. There's a lot of small
or starving people in the world.

980
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,940
All right. Now the average,
that means I am right now,

981
00:58:37,941 --> 00:58:42,170
I'm like 40 pounds over the average and
the average human being. All right. Now,

982
00:58:42,171 --> 00:58:47,171
the daily average for
stool gross is one ounce,

983
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:48,730
okay?

984
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,680
Per 12 pounds of body weight,

985
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:55,660
which means the average
person pope's 11.39 ounces.

986
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,600
Therefore,
each day the planet receives

987
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:06,700
2,295,876 metric tons of shit,

988
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:13,350
but since the average stool is
75% water through, this is gross,

989
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:20,550
it will be safe to say they humans
produce 1,000,007 or 21,000 hundred seven

990
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,800
metric tons of poop every day.
Jesus Christ,

991
00:59:25,801 --> 00:59:30,640
you really taken all the fun out of
this podcast to put this in perspective.

992
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:32,230
I think you put it into perspective,

993
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,360
but he's going to keep going with the
empire state building weighs 350,000 tons,

994
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:44,080
so human beings pupae the equivalent of
five giant turds the size of the empire

995
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:47,570
state building.
If we add farts to the equation,

996
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:49,340
this fucking dude is all in,

997
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:50,900
okay?

998
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,610
The average person fart 17 times a day.
That's it.

999
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,750
Try eating a salad.
Fucking double your numbers.

1000
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:03,590
You Break Dan Marino's
record times 17 times a day,

1001
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:08,450
producing a litter, a leader
of Fart in total, a litter,

1002
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:12,350
l. I. T. T. E. R. That's
a litter of Fart in total,

1003
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:15,800
which gives a new meaning
to a breathing fresh air.

1004
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,350
Okay?

1005
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,200
I've included the links
where I got the information.

1006
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:23,260
Okay?

1007
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,270
At the end of this email,
and when you think about it,

1008
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:30,040
on top of eating our own rollerblades,
we're eating our own shit. By the way,

1009
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:33,400
everything you read or hear
about Columbia is true,

1010
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:39,040
that go have a meaningful experience
with yourself. Does that mean go, oh,

1011
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:42,640
that means go fuck yourself. Ah,
this guy's a clubber son of a bitch.

1012
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:47,560
Um, Jesus Christ. Well,
you know what? Hey,

1013
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,760
how about I am the podcast with
what I promised to do last week,

1014
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,150
which is I was going to start reading
segments from the Bible. The granted,

1015
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,820
I don't own a Bible.
All right,

1016
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:02,110
let's start with John Three
16 because I'm a sports fan.

1017
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:08,460
John three 60 he said it onto you with,

1018
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,750
all right,
John Three 16.

1019
01:01:13,751 --> 01:01:18,220
For God so loved the world that he
gave his only his one and only son,

1020
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,200
that whoever believes in him
shall not perish. I perish,

1021
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,070
but have eternal life. Well, that's
straight forward. He led his kid die.

1022
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:31,810
So as long as you believe that
that happened, you will not die.

1023
01:01:31,811 --> 01:01:34,360
You will have eternal life.
You will live forever.

1024
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:37,780
Think about that forever.

1025
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:45,040
You know you have, it's been at the DMV.
Just imagine that, except it never ends,

1026
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,043
right.

1027
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,370
Okay.

1028
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,050
What the fuck would you do forever?

1029
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:54,250
There's no way that that's fucking true.

1030
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,250
Okay?

1031
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,680
You know,
movies don't go on forever.

1032
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:04,200
Planets don't go on forever or livable.
Planets don't go on forever.

1033
01:02:04,201 --> 01:02:07,880
I'll fuck. This is why I don't
read the Bible and I saw,

1034
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,290
I don't fucking get all right,
let's, let's, let's, uh,

1035
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:14,000
let's just look up Bible
passages. Bib. Ellie,

1036
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,090
it'd be funny if this actually
got me back to going to church.

1037
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:23,090
I still loved going church. You know what
I mean? I still like going, you know,

1038
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:26,660
Katie Ban my dad, JJ, Jay's grise.

1039
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:30,640
There's dive for Ross and his resilience.

1040
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,130
Mm.

1041
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:37,140
From the dead. All right. Encouraging
Bible Verses Hope Bible Verses

1042

Bible verses.

1043
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,380
Let's give hope. Encouraging.
Well, where the fuck is it?

1044
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:49,710
Yeah.

1045
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:53,850
Ah, I just wanted to open it
like the phone book the Bible.

1046
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,460
I'm gonna look up the Bible.
Please read the Bible.

1047
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,240
Okay.

1048
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,680
Www. A Free Bible on your
phone. I don't want it.

1049
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:06,880
I want it on my fucking scream. I
want amber. No. What? Cheeseburger.

1050
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,850
Visual Kim.
James Bible.

1051
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,650
Commit thy way unto the Lord.

1052
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:17,650
Trust also in him and he
shall bring it to pass.

1053
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:18,920
Okay.

1054
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,820
Bring what? Commit Day. Way unto the Lord.

1055
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:27,810
All right, so walk in the general
direction of the Lord. Trust also in him,

1056
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,680
while if I'm walking towards him, aren't,
isn't that trusting him? Winning up,

1057
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:35,580
creeping up on him. Hey Man, just
making sure everything's cool.

1058
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,700
I'm walking your way,
but you know,

1059
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,740
just wave your white flag.

1060
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:42,760
Okay.

1061
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,260
Don't open a trap door
when I get there dude.

1062
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,790
And he shall bring it to pass.
Genesis.

1063
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,200
I remember reading this.

1064
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,360
It like makes sense for like
three fucking sentences.

1065
01:03:56,361 --> 01:03:58,490
And then you just like what?
In the beginning,

1066
01:03:58,491 --> 01:04:03,491
God created the heaven and the earth and
the earth was without form and void and

1067
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:07,940
darkness was upon the
face of the deep period,

1068
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:12,590
the deep what and the spirit of God
moved upon. That's like when they go,

1069
01:04:12,591 --> 01:04:14,010
you know,
they got to eat up some clock.

1070
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:15,620
Okay?

1071
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:20,620
Darkness was upon the face of the deep
and the spirit of God moved upon the face

1072
01:04:21,531 --> 01:04:25,520
of the waters.
I thought there wasn't any

1073
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,140
that there wasn't any water,
there wasn't anything.

1074
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:32,740
How was it water for his
face to be on and God said,

1075
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:36,190
let there be light and there was light.
Let there be sad.

1076
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,300
There was sound. Is this
Bon Scott? God said,

1077
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:43,090
let there be light and there was like,
well, what was he doing before that?

1078
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:46,420
He was just sitting in the
darkness all by himself.

1079
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,040
Just one day he's laying there going,
I'm going to make some shit,

1080
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:58,970
and God saw the light that it was good
and God divided the light from the

1081
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:03,390
darkness. God called the light
day. It's like Cam Newton.

1082
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:07,140
Everything's about the same guy.
I'll tell you right now,

1083
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:09,840
nobody's having more fun
than God making Earth.

1084
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,590
He's like a kid in a candy store that
doesn't exist and kids don't exist cause

1085
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:17,880
he hadn't made it yet.
Ah, fuck this. Genesis.

1086
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:24,110
Let's look at job.
See what old job had to say.

1087
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:29,300
What the fuck is he? Well, let's read
Titus. That's the name of a comic I know.

1088
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:31,160
How about that? All right. Paul,

1089
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:34,730
a servant of God and an
apostle of Jesus Christ

1090
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,430
according to the faith of God's elect
and the acknowledging of the truth,

1091
01:05:40,431 --> 01:05:42,140
which is after godliness.

1092
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,490
I feel like somebody is
trying to sell me a car.

1093
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:49,210
That was all one sentence
in hope of eternal life,

1094
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:52,420
which God that cannot lie
promised before the world began.

1095
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:54,500
Okay

1096
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,520
Dude, this is like the the like
God called everything you know,

1097
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,960
before you even born and all that,

1098
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,860
but half and do times manifested
his words. You know what?

1099
01:06:03,861 --> 01:06:06,110
I thought this would be a funny bit.
This is just fucking annoying,

1100
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:09,950
but half to do times manifested
his word through preaching,

1101
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,270
which was committed unto me according
to the commandment of God, our savior.

1102
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,770
It's just, it just goes in circles to
Titus. My own son, after the common faith,

1103
01:06:18,771 --> 01:06:22,010
he had another kid had
Jesus and he had Titus.

1104
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,420
Okay.

1105
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,520
Grace,
mercy and peace.

1106
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,420
Yeah.

1107
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:31,390
Who are they as grace? Grace.
Was she another virgin?

1108
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,780
How many times is it going to use
this verge and thinks he banged them

1109
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:36,203
right.

1110
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,560
He had Jesus with Mary and then grace
was this fucking side piece and he had

1111
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:41,850
Titus.
All right.

1112
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,250
Okay.

1113
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:48,250
For this cause left ID and Crete that
thou should have set in order the things

1114
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:53,600
that are wanting and orders elders
in every city as I appointed thee,

1115
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,000
if any, be blameless. The husband of
one wife having faithful children,

1116
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:01,070
not accused of riot or unruly.

1117
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,290
It's not a sentence or maybe
it was back then, you know,

1118
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:13,740
if I get judged Sunday, you know, and,
and God stand in that and being like,

1119
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:15,390
I just feel like to, you
know, I tried to get through,

1120
01:07:15,391 --> 01:07:17,370
I tried to get through the book.
I don't know what to tell you.

1121
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:18,880
Okay.

1122
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,680
As far as I can see,
it's a bunch of fragments.

1123
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,730
All right.

1124
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:26,120
They're not complete thoughts.
You know, you can't, right.

1125
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,820
Just because you put a period at the
end of it doesn't make it a sentence.

1126
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:30,903
Right.

1127
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,740
All right. This is a podcast
for this week. Once again,

1128
01:07:33,741 --> 01:07:37,260
congratulations to the Broncos.
Congratulations.

1129
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,860
Still The lady who got a job,
I'm going to end this positive.

1130
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,060
Gradually says to the lady who got
the job there at the buffalo bills.

1131
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:46,950
I'm sure you're going to do a great job.
I'm just a grumpy old fucking matters.

1132
01:07:46,951 --> 01:07:51,440
His team lost. All right.
Congratulations to the panthers. Um,

1133
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,450
I look forward to seeing Cam Newton.

1134
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:54,850
Okay.

1135
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:57,520
You know, play against Peyton
manning. It's going to be great.

1136
01:07:57,521 --> 01:08:01,450
I love that he called them the
sheriff. Um, I thought that was cool.

1137
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:07,000
You know, the best of the old versus the
best of the new. So I'm an old fucker,

1138
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:11,230
so I'm going to have to route.
I got a group for the Denver Broncos,

1139
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,920
they AAFC and Peyton
manning. Um, even though I,

1140
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:18,070
the panthers and I love the way they
fucking playing that defense is to shit.

1141
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:23,260
And um, I dunno. I just hope it's
a good game. I hope the panthers,

1142
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:26,020
if they're going to win or the Broncos,

1143
01:08:26,021 --> 01:08:28,360
I just don't want anybody beating
the fuck out of anybody. Right.

1144
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,800
But I will tell you as always, I
will be watching it by myself. Okay?

1145
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:35,860
I'm not going to, I might go to a
Superbowl party cause my team's out it,

1146
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:36,730
but I don't think so.

1147
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:41,350
I want to see Peyton's last game and
I hope it goes out like La and a,

1148
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:45,640
I'm going to do what I always do. All
right, I'm going to tape the game.

1149
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:50,260
You let it go for a good 90 minutes.
As I mentioned,

1150
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:55,000
you shut your phone off. You get the
grill going, you crack a couple of beers.

1151
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:57,660
You know,
you make yourself a burger to you.

1152
01:08:57,661 --> 01:08:59,680
Invite a couple of friends over
and then he got, all right,

1153
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:03,210
let's sit down and watch it. And you
blow through all the fucking beginning.

1154
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,100
Oh,

1155
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:09,180
brave, right bombed kickoff. There we go.

1156
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,670
Blow through all the fucking commercials.

1157
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:14,760
Fast forward through Beyonce
lip sinking during halftime.

1158
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:18,990
You get caught up halfway through
the third fucking quarter. And, uh,

1159
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:22,800
and if there were any cool commercials
that you missed, you have them recorded,

1160
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:25,040
but someone's going to put
them up online anyways.

1161
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:26,340
You're not going to miss a fucking thing.

1162
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:30,570
And you can watch the Superbowl and about,
I dunno, you can watch in about two,

1163
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:35,040
two hours and 20 minutes, two hours, two
and a half hours. It's fucking tremendous.

1164
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,060
All right. God bless you
guys yet, go fuck yourselves.

1165
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:42,600
And I'll check in on Thursday.
All right.
