1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,720
Hey, what's good? Oh Jesus. Hey,
what's going on at the fuck was that?

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,760
It's bill birth and it's time for the
Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday,

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,320
Monday morning podcast.
And

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,040
just checking in on you.
Just checking in on you.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,200
Sorry, I just woke up. I'm at a frog
in my throat. Oh, Billy. No VOCs.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,360
William without 12 days in here.
No booze,

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,400
no cigars. Although you wouldn't know
what that frog Aj said my throat. No,

8
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:40,450
nothing. Uh, he's been a full Billy angel.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,380
I'm going to open for Chris Angel out
there and a fucking Vegas and I'm going to

10
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:51,010
sit there and just wag my finger
at everybody in the crowd.

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,080
Tell him how they live in a life of vice.

12
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,930
I have to tell you people
when you find Christ, um,

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,880
I got the,
the mornings.

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,630
The mornings are the best when you lived
a vice free life the night before you

15
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:11,710
wake up. It's amazing. The birds
are singing a little louder.

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,340
There's a few more nooks and crannies
in your fucking English muffin.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,680
She'd sit there watching the
melting into it.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,140
Um, yeah, I, I, you know,
if the mornings are great,

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,240
I'm bored out of my fucking mind
at night out of my mind. Bored.

20
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,060
Um, anyways, let's, uh,
let's, but you know,

21
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:40,630
here's one for sobriety. No one of
those fucking poor bastards at AIA.

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,450
Just sit there,
Chow and donuts and smoking cigarettes.

23
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:48,040
They need something they got, they're
trying to get a buzz, nicotine,

24
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,630
sugar, something to break
up the fucking monotony.

25
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,590
Yeah, let me gay. Yeah. Fuck it.

26
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,970
To glazed the fucking Jelly donut.

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,080
Do shoving it down their pie hole.
Um,

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,360
that's the worst thing about opening
Pandora's box because once you fucking do

29
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:11,194
that,

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,550
then you just know how much
fun you could be having,

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,350
you know, is just sitting around
playing Fantana or something like that.

32
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,540
Drinking a Goddamn Arnold Palmer.
You know, I remember one time

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,340
I was hanging out with this guy,
I'm not gonna name the name of the person,

34
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,360
but he was hanging out with
this super fucking legendary,

35
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:38,950
famous fucking rockstar.
The dude had never got married,

36
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:43,480
never had any kids or whatever. And I
remember hanging out with that guy and he,

37
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,150
and like he could not,
it was all these beautiful women around.

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,510
He was barely looking at him.

39
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,520
He could not have been more bored because
he had gone so far down that fucking

40
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:55,480
road.
Like what?

41
00:02:55,481 --> 00:03:00,481
Literally what it took at that point
to even the pilot light going and his

42
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:06,340
fucking eyes. I'm not going
to sit here with this fucking,

43
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,010
hang on a second.
Sorry.

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,030
I had to clear my throat there. I want
to fuck did I hit stop instead of pause.

45
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:17,900
Now I'm going to edit those two
things together. You know what it is.

46
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,360
It's when you're living as clean as I am,

47
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:25,361
the toxins through years of abuse start
to come to the surface and your body is

48
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:30,840
reading them, cleansing them. Um,

49
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,610
anyways, just so this guy,
when he was just like,

50
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,890
there wasn't any woman in there
that could turn his fucking head.

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,530
There wasn't a joke that
could make them smile.

52
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,643
Yeah.

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,930
This guy, he just, he
just, he went too far,

54
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,990
went too far down the hall.

55
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,830
He got pulled out and now he's just
sitting there just fucking bored.

56
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,910
Do you know if, I mean
I had a fuck, you know,

57
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,060
what'd you participate in like an orgy
and you're the only male participant.

58
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,540
I just don't understand like why,
you know,

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,320
what the fuck does that guy do?
Hey,

60
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:13,650
you want to go to Brunch?
You know,

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,060
hey, let's go, uh, let's
go to this. Go to a game.

62
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,480
Okay,

63
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,690
let's go to this arena that you're sold
out and had an orgy and then let's go

64
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,710
watch other people fucking chase a puck.
You want to go do that?

65
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:31,540
There's like nothing you could suggest
to this guy. He'd have to, you know what,

66
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:31,891
that,

67
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:35,740
that guy like his next fucking move to
get his adrenaline going would probably

68
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:40,741
be do that red bull jump where
you just falling from outer space.

69
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,190
Um, anyways, I don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about, but that's, that's,

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,460
that's what you expect.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Okay.

72
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,260
Switch. You expect to this one.
I expect out of this podcast

73
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,200
and that's what's wrong with America.

74
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,350
Americans podcasting with absolutely
no expectations on how well the show's

75
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,490
going to go. All right, let's
talk. Let's Talk Yankees,

76
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,560
red sox all it's heating up again.

77
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,830
The Red Sox rape the keys.
14 to one on Monday.

78
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,140
Was it Monday? I'm sorry.
Tuesday. All right.

79
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,580
Remember what I remember when I was a kid,
they'd be like,

80
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:27,090
they should save these runs for tomorrow.
Like you can save runs.

81
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,130
Okay.

82
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,000
And then yesterday, our stat and
pitch a pricey got fart or something.

83
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:37,160
So our pitching was shit yesterday
and the achy set it up winning, uh,

84
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,150
which is fine. Um, there's
like 9 million games left,

85
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:46,650
but I think it was really stupid of the
red sox to get into a fight with them.

86
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,500
That fight was, was good for the Yankees
because they're not as good at team.

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,280
They got bats, but they don't
have pitching. And pitching
is always going to win.

88
00:05:56,281 --> 00:06:00,370
Come October. You don't need to
get involved in that stupid shit.

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,900
And um,
and we did.

90
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,100
So now they have, now they're
all fucking blow, go, go, go.

91
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,460
They're all fucking excited.

92
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,160
You don't do that. You know, the guy
wants to slide like that. I mean,

93
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:21,310
up until last year, that
was legal. Who gives a shit?

94
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,330
Who gives a shit to strike the guy out,

95
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,110
have him sit down with this
big fucking stupid face.

96
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,820
I hate baseball players in this stupid
fighting where everybody comes out and

97
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:37,720
piles on each other and uh,
nobody does the A,

98
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:40,900
you're lucky you're holding me back
better than fucking baseball players.

99
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,030
Maybe basketball players.
I Dunno. That's stupid.

100
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,330
After the fight and there's like two
guys holding you back and then you still

101
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:53,410
have to do that stupid charge, you
know, you're not going to get there.

102
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,023
It's over

103
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,010
button your shirt and go to the showers.
Um,

104
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,600
but anyway, so we were getting
killed and we still like,

105
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:06,760
it was almost like the Yankees
couldn't score enough runs.

106
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,790
So we have bats and we have pitching.
We're in a great position.

107
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,870
Why would we get involved
in that Tom Foolery? I mean,

108
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,250
this is sober bill talking.
Oh, you know, it's so stupid.

109
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:22,870
It's in the middle of the fight that
you just hit this guy go Yankees red sox

110
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:25,600
fed.
Can we retire that stupid shit already.

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,900
It's like it's, it's like fucking
Manchurian candidate level.

112
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,860
Like the second anything happens.
You've got to start chanting that.

113
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,213
Um,

114
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,790
not that Yankee fans are innocent
with that stupid 1918 forever.

115
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,860
And then when they,
when that champ was over,

116
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:48,310
then they switched it to a Boston saw,

117
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,510
which is the worst chat
ever. Um, I don't know.

118
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,590
There's so much of it that I,

119
00:07:55,591 --> 00:08:00,390
it just makes me want to hit unmute the
sweet Caroline, the Yankees suck chant,

120
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,730
all of that stuff.
It just,

121
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,770
it says to me that people do not think
for themselves and that fucking mob

122
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:12,030
mentality,
I don't like the Yankees,

123
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,810
but we beat them.
The movie is over.

124
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,940
It's over roll credits.
We won the world series.

125
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,970
They are now reduced to go at,

126
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,540
hey remember what we did
last century member that,

127
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,950
I mean that's what
they've been reduced to.

128
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,530
Why would you like make them actually
feel that they hold some sort of

129
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:44,880
positioned by continuing to chant?
Yankees suck.

130
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:45,714
They don't suck.

131
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,560
They're a good fucking team and I love
the way that they've built from their

132
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:54,390
farm team. And then added that big
free agent from Miami or Florida,

133
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,550
her fucking, uh, Tuscaloosa whenever
the fuck they call themselves now.

134
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,793
MMM.

135
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,990
Oh, pit Shelby. The Okeechobee
Marlin's um, I like what they've done.

136
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,651
They don't suck.

137
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:12,630
And I think that Aaron Boone is going
to be a great manager and I look forward

138
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:15,060
to the competition between both teams

139
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,140
and who gives a fuck? Either we win
or they win or somebody else wins.

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,670
Who gives a shit?
Just enjoy the fucking game.

141
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,600
Don't go there and be a fucking
mouth breathing for the love of God.

142
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,030
Where you sit down when they
play that stupid sweet Caroline.

143
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,330
How many fucking times can you do it by

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,530
the fucking Yankee fence at this
cigarette? Fucking why MCA. I,

145
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,410
you know what, I want to, I should,
I shouldn't go this heart. You know,

146
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,430
it's for the kids. It's tradition.
It's what brings people together.

147
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,000
I Dunno. I thought the Yankees did
pretty good before they had this thing,

148
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:59,001
that fucking song during the seventh
and the stupid grounds crew doing the

149
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:03,600
little twirly twirl. Oh my
God, I'm such a continent.

150
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,900
Um,
anyways,

151
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,730
I'm sure Dan Shaughnessy is very excited
that it's heated up again and you can

152
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,810
actually write about the sport that he
knows about and ignore the Bruins playoff

153
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:16,644
run.

154
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,750
Why do I always pick on Dan Shaughnessy?
I don't hate that guy.

155
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,780
I just like picking on up cause I will
never forgive that fucking guy for after

156
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:31,800
2004 when we won and then 2005,
we were in first place in September.

157
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,980
We got a bunch of injuries
which clearly affected the team.

158
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,250
And then the $200 million Yankees I
believe ended up coming in passing us and,

159
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,020
and she's like, is the curse
back? I was like right there.

160
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,360
You're not a red sox fan.
You're just not.

161
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,820
You're a guy making money off of misery.

162
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,600
You're your own little corporation,
you know,

163
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,220
profiting off of war in a sports sense.
Jesus, Bill, you went big there. Yes,

164
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,380
I did.
And I'll do it again.

165
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,750
Yeah.

166
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,111
Anyways,

167
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:05,560
the Bruins playoff run starts tonight
and I have a lot of nerve given Shaun to

168
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:09,280
see shit considering I may
watch four games this year. Um,

169
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:12,180
now that I got the little one and um,

170
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,400
we're playing the Toronto Maple leafs

171
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,730
and those poor bastards are going to have
to fucking ender the highlight reel of

172
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:25,450
what happened the last time we played
them and just know that I was at that

173
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:30,040
fucking game. Um, I
actually know something.

174
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,460
It's funny, I feel like maple
leaf fans hate the Bruins.

175
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,550
Um, and uh, I don't hate the maple
leaf. I actually liked the maple leaf.

176
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,690
I hate the Canadians.

177
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,650
That's it in a couple of knee
breakers on the penguins.

178
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,090
Other than that, and not even at
the penguins have in the breakers.

179
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,010
It's just that they then
turn around and complain,

180
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,050
but somebody gets a little
rough on the other team.

181
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,320
They were attacking Sydney.

182
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,930
They bug me. Um, that's it. Other than
that, I don't have a problem to anybody.

183
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:08,770
I'm looking forward to wonderful.
A seven game series.

184
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,000
We'll see how it goes. But, uh, it
comes on at four o'clock. Here I am.

185
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:18,001
I'm balancing my entire fucking schedules
that it said how he said my entire

186
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:23,440
fucking schedule is, uh, is
going to be based around that.

187
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,740
My daughter takes a
nap from three to five,

188
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,800
so I figure I'll get to watch
the first period and then,

189
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,850
um, and then I'll probably
be fucked. Who's kid? No.

190
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,830
Um,
I'm actually flying to the Rio tomorrow.

191
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:46,180
I'm flying out to shall it
for the rough and rowdy fight.

192
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,610
I'm going to be commentating,

193
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,120
watching regular people's
Americans on Americans fighting.

194
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:57,640
There's going to be over 40 fights and
I'm feeling that this is going to be like

195
00:12:57,641 --> 00:13:01,030
when I did the Joe Rogan Doug Stan Hope,
uh,

196
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,400
end of the universe
podcasts on election night.

197
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:07,090
That's the vibe that I feel
like it is going to be going on.

198
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:08,740
So I'm just going to be,

199
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:12,190
I'm trying to get in as
many jokes as I can't.

200
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,020
It's already entertaining while getting
out of the way of the action. Um,

201
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,470
I've never done any shit like this.
I remember when I was a kid,

202
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,600
my mother thought I should
be a sports commentator.

203
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,130
I don't think she pictured me doing,
starting my career in an event like this.

204
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,430
But I'm looking forward to
it. I really am. And, uh,

205
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,310
it's a $15 pay for you unless
you wait till the day of.

206
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:39,910
So today's the last day we can get a
flight 1599 and after that it goes up to

207
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:44,250
1999. But if you're a college kid,
you know, a couple, two, three,

208
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,840
you've fence throwing like
five and a half bucks each.

209
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,790
Get yourself a Domino's pizza
and whatever else you want to do.

210
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,250
Is Mike goal liquid?
Say An adult beverage and uh,

211
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:00,880
enjoy the fights. Um, anyways,

212
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,990
plowing ahead here.
Uh,

213
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,660
I've started my workout,
my serious,

214
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,520
my theory is workout regimen to somehow
stave off the fact that I'm turning 50

215
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:16,470
in fucking June the big
file, but Papa, Papa,

216
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,850
ah,
you fucking fucking old you fucking balls.

217
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:26,200
Hey Dan to the thought.
Um,

218
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,110
I actually feel fortunate to be,
to have made it this long,

219
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,600
considered a bunch of my friends did not.

220
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,500
And then also the direction
we seem to be going here.

221
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,460
Why are we bombing Syria?
Why are we going to do this?

222
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,520
How much further into this
fucking Middle East Shit,

223
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:45,790
how are we going to go?

224
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,280
I don't understand why France, US, Russia,

225
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,710
all of these fucking people.

226
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:56,730
Why the fuck do we keep
intervening over there?

227
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,353
You know what I mean?

228
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,190
Is people have been fighting with each
other forever and then we're going to

229
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,520
come in a, hey, settle down, settle
down. Give us the oil. Settle down.

230
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,390
You shouldn't do that to what another
give us the oil stopped doing that.

231
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Frances President Emmanuel Macron says
he has proof that the Syrian government

232
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,360
attack the town of Doma
with chemical weapons.

233
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:31,361
Last weekend he said he would decide
in due course whether to respond with

234
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,040
airstrikes. Um, I dunno how these cases,

235
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,200
world leaders do that
shit. It's like, you know,

236
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:41,200
you can respond with airstrikes
and they're not all going
to land on the people

237
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:44,840
that did it. And then you have to go
to bed that night going like, well, I,

238
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,090
I think most of them landed on the
people that were guilty. You know,

239
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:53,250
the others landed in a food court.
I think that's why they age. Um,

240
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,650
although I think Donald Trump is going
to age wonderfully during his presidency

241
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:03,070
because I don't think he
really understands the
ramifications of what the fuck

242
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,570
it is that he's saying or doing.
Um,

243
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,510
who the fuck tweets about when a country's
going to strike another countries and

244
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,770
that's supposed to kind of be a secret
or the way he's trying to do the three

245
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:19,450
card Monte. It could be now. It
could be not at all or maybe later.

246
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,950
You know, it's funny, there's probably
Syrian people actually looking at his

247
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,560
and his tweets,

248
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,660
you know, like, uh,

249
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,380
like looking at it like, like
they found clues. I'm sorry,

250
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:41,600
I just got this fucking email.

251
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,030
These God damn fucking state of Wisconsin
just hit me with this huge God damn

252
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:48,270
tax bill. I just like, Huh, fuck. Do I
owe you guys all that God their money.

253
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,860
Yeah, I know. I know why they hit me
with that shit. I know why. I know why.

254
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,530
Cause it was spending money in this
country in a bunch of other shifts.

255
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,560
Then I come down there and they fucking
pull the pants down. They give, oh,

256
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:05,820
freckles a good spank. And before I
leave the state, that's like a new thing.

257
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:10,200
All of these scams do you
know in Pittsburgh they had
an entertainment tax for

258
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,080
awhile.
If you are an entertainer,

259
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,960
if you spun plates and
you went to Pittsburgh,

260
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:20,850
they taxed you for entertaining people.
Literally doing your job.

261
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,760
When I was in Saint Louis one time I was
in a hotel and I actually took the time

262
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:28,280
to look at the bill and this,

263
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,310
the city of Saint Louis or the
state of Missouri charged me.

264
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,160
Uh,
what the fuck did they call it?

265
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,850
An occupation tax on the room.

266
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,580
They taxed me for occupying the room.
They just shaking like fucking third 20,

267
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:48,030
30 bucks out of your pocket.
We'll take that.

268
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,510
Thank you for coming here.

269
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,940
Did you get a chance to
visit the fucking Ozarks?

270
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,910
Um, I dunno. I'll tell you.

271
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:04,250
It's all the God damn scam.
What am I going to do?

272
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,750
Am I going to take on a whole fucking
state? Michael Moore would do it.

273
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,950
Um, all right. The penguins, Jesus Christ.

274
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,660
What they went 18 and nothing
against the fucking flyers. Um,

275
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,360
I didn't get to watch any
of the hockey last night.

276
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:25,240
I was editing season three
of f is for family. Um,

277
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,670
okay.

278
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,380
I think I'm just gonna tell you right now,

279
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,110
and I can say this with total confidence.
This is without a doubt,

280
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,610
our best season.
It's a,

281
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,710
it's a noticeable jump between
the first and second seasons.

282
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,420
Um, and I can't wait for you guys
to see it, but it's animation.

283
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,580
So I'm be like Donald Trump,

284
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,750
you could be seeing these
episodes soon or maybe later,

285
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,310
possibly not at all.
Or maybe they're on right now.

286
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,050
She get a giant fucking toupee.
Lucky he doesn't have a toupee.

287
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,500
I think he did a comb over and then he
did some hair plugs and they didn't work.

288
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,020
But now the hair plugs up better
than I think maybe they worked.

289
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,510
But then he just has to kind of commit

290
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:08,910
okay.

291
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,370
To the comb over,
you know,

292
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,930
if I actually think he kinda
has nice hair, you know,

293
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:19,710
the way he gets died, all golden
when it goes orange, it's bad.

294
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:23,760
But he has like the golden sort
of fucking a stray cats haircut.

295
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,790
You know. We're going to bomb this town
bomb. It is sad and I think it's a, uh,

296
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,690
I think it's a good look.
I could see him with like an upright bass.

297
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,540
I want to get one of those fucking,

298
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,800
what would you guys do if
somehow I got a fucking, oh,

299
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,430
I actually caved and I got
fucking hair plugs, right?

300
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,010
And I had a giant red stray cats
fucking hairdo outta nowhere.

301
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,730
No, not out of nowhere. You would,

302
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:58,930
you would notice it like
pictures of me after shows going,

303
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,100
what's going on with
the top of bird's head?

304
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,700
And I refuse to like when
someone's slowly transitioning,

305
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,090
does that thing of like, wow,
that's an interesting outfit.

306
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:11,150
And then people started, are you Trent?
And then finally they'd say, yeah,

307
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:13,700
you know what I, yeah, I would,

308
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,940
I would do what Bruce Jenner
did except to my hair.

309
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,200
All right,
but what if I never fucking addressed it?

310
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,510
What if I never went on and talked
to Diane Store Sawyer? You know,

311
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,670
and just sat there going,
I was the story.

312
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,280
Okay,

313
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,300
I was the story.

314
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,810
What if I never did that and refused
to ever address my new quaff of fucking

315
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:43,420
hair and I tried to just, I
just, I erased all my podcast.

316
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:48,421
Any fucking evidence of me ever admitted
that I went bald and I would just say

317
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:50,740
that I was just, well,
she was too, you know,

318
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,220
like Turkey when they refuse to
see. Yeah, that never happened.

319
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,460
If you say it happens,
you're going to jail.

320
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,870
How much would I be getting heckled
if I came out with a fucking ric flair

321
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:10,700
haircut?
Oh fuck.

322
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,500
You know something I was talking
about Moto GP and the, uh,

323
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,500
what was it? The Art Argentina. A
Grand Prix. Is that where it was?

324
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,430
What a fucking race that was.
I don't even, I don't even,

325
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,490
I haven't watched racing enough to
even understand what the fuck happened.

326
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,900
And I was dealing with my kids and all
of a sudden the race starts and there was

327
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:32,520
like one person in the front row,

328
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,160
nobody in like 30 rows back
or something like that.

329
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:39,060
And then a bunch of people in the back,
mark mark has installed this bike. So,

330
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:43,140
according to the rules, he had to
leave and go restart it or something.

331
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:46,980
And he was driving around in circles,
refusing to fucking leave.

332
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,000
Um, so then he ended up, those race starts

333
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,010
okay.

334
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,810
And he gets penalized or
penalized depending on what
part of the country you're

335
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:57,021
from.

336
00:21:57,021 --> 00:22:02,021
He got penal lies and he goes to the back
of the race and this fucking guy just

337
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,190
okay.

338
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,750
Raw. He was like, I swear to God,

339
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:10,080
he was like 40 seconds ahead of everybody
who's going to win the race going away.

340
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,190
It was one of those tracks
where, and it was, um,

341
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,180
it was still wet or whatever and he was
just riding way faster than everybody

342
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:23,070
else. I don't know how, and uh,
they say, buddy, buddy, you,

343
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:25,980
uh, you've, you've got to go to
the back of the, this is so stupid.

344
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:27,600
I didn't want to talk about,
you got to go to the back of the race.

345
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:30,810
So they sent them all the way to the back,
goes to the pits first,

346
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,080
and then they send them to the back of
the race because he fucking ran over this

347
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:34,914
guy,

348
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,930
you know,
he basically right.

349
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,450
Went to go pass somebody. He's,
he's bumping them out of the way.

350
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:42,600
Like they in cars, except they're run
motorcycles and he would wave like,

351
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,150
sorry about that and continue on.

352
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,680
They're like, hey buddy, you got to go
to the back of the fucking race, right?

353
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,480
The first time.
I think today he bumped into somebody.

354
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:54,560
They made him sit there in the pits.
I don't remember. I think they,

355
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,920
they penalize this guy so many
fucking times. Long story short,

356
00:22:57,921 --> 00:22:59,600
he went from first place
all the way to last.

357
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,310
So now he's blowing by everybody
and he gets up to Valentino Rossi,

358
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,590
who's basically the Wayne Gretzky,

359
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,540
uh,
the Lewis Hamilton,

360
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:15,150
the fucking person you're not supposed
to touch a fuck with and he's trying to

361
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:17,490
get around them. And Valentino
Rossi, he's like, fuck you.

362
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,720
You're not getting around me. And A,
rather than waiting for a straight away,

363
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,280
he tried to pass him on a turn and
he just fucking slammed into him.

364
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,170
And Valentino got it, got pushed to the
outside and he had control the bike.

365
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:35,850
But then he went on the grass and he
wiped out the, uh, fell off his bike.

366
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:39,510
And Mark has turns around waves
like, sorry, pop that right.

367
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,580
Valentino gets up, but he's Italian. He
goes up, my blah blah blah, blah. I right.

368
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:46,730
And then he picks his bike up.
Now he's ride.

369
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,530
Now all the Valentino Rossi fans are like,
what the fuck is with this guy? Mark?

370
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,930
Mark has gets penalized again,
I believe.

371
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,200
And uh,
so at the end of the fucking race,

372
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,990
mark has walks down with somebody
else to Valentino's a pit area,

373
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,540
what they call it, the pageant, I
forget what they call it, the of of p.

374
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,070
And Valentino is like, oh my God,
I am like, so not talking to you.

375
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,630
Some of the mechanics of the chief
fucking steward, stewardess down there,

376
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:21,230
something. He's yelling at Marquez
and Marquez ends up walking away.

377
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,820
And then Valentino Rossi said he wasn't
man enough to come down by himself.

378
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:28,700
He came down with somebody else,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

379
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,150
And I'm sitting there agreeing with
Valentino Rossi and then all of a sudden

380
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:34,910
everybody starts sending all these
fucking highlights from like three years

381
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:38,450
earlier when Rossi,
basically donkey kick to mark.

382
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:42,620
Mark has off his fucking bike or out of
the goddamn race or something like that.

383
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,470
So it's, it just seemed like, um, Lewis
Hamilton behavior where it's like,

384
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:50,150
it's okay if I do it,
but if you do it,

385
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:52,820
you're a fucking asshole and now I'm
going to have a hissy fit about it.

386
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,010
So I think I like Mark Marquez
better. You know, I respect Rossi.

387
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,590
You know the little I know about the
sport being the legend that he is a,

388
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:07,300
but I like Marquez. Fuck it. If he
did that two years earlier, yeah,

389
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:08,134
pass them on to turn,

390
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,240
knock him off his bike and give
them a wave. Who gives a shit?

391
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,250
I'm telling you guys, you're
missing out of this, this,

392
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:18,770
all of this took place in like 25 laps.

393
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,610
You can watch your race in like 40
minutes and you can watch these,

394
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:27,170
these unbelievable,
this unbelievable fucking sport.

395
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:30,870
I can't even tell you how
sold I am on motor GP. Um,

396
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,020
just to let you know,

397
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:37,630
there's moto GP two and three and they're
all going to get recorded and there's

398
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,540
going to be like five recordings of
them and there's a chance your, your,

399
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,590
your recorder's going to shut off,
which is what would have happened to me.

400
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,150
I would have missed the
end of the fucking race.

401
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:50,900
But fortunately I've got to watch it live.
Um,

402
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,010
I don't understand. Trying to take one
of those races is practically impossible,

403
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,980
so I have to make sure I don't,
I don't lose the one here.

404
00:25:57,981 --> 00:26:01,220
The Moto GP of the Americas
is what they call it.

405
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,630
Why don't they say they say Argentina?
You know,

406
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,310
they say they say Italy,
why can't we say USA?

407
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,920
You know, what are we embarrassed the
Americas, whereas it Canada, Mexico,

408
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,650
Falkland Islands, um,
anyways, check it out. If he,

409
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:24,950
if he get a chance. Um, you know,

410
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:28,610
usually this is the time when I actually
do a read or something. And it's just,

411
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,640
I don't have any advertising.
You know what I mean?

412
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,730
I'm like that real housewife on the real
housewives that just trashes too many

413
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:41,120
fucking people and then the,
you know,

414
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:44,390
just doesn't have any friends anymore.
Uh,

415
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,650
that's where the advertising
is slowly going. Okay.

416
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,270
On this podcast and

417
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,640
okay,

418
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,030
I am, now that I've cleaned
up my act as far as my,

419
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,240
you know,
offstage behavior,

420
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,530
I am now going to clean up this
podcast in an effort to try to get my

421
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:05,790
advertising back.

422
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,280
Yeah.

423
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,610
I am not going to have
any sort of opinions.

424
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,630
The just stop right now and just talk
about how amazing and strong women are and

425
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:21,620
how whatever,
look at your,

426
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:26,030
your girlfriend or wife right now and
just look at whatever she's doing and just

427
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:31,031
realize how strong she is and really
just take time in your day to understand

428
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,980
how amazing women are

429
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,670
and how right they are and how
they do nothing wrong whatsoever,

430
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,980
ever.
And if they do something wrong,

431
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,100
just know that it's because
of something that you did.

432
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,960
I want everybody to close their eyes.

433
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,500
Yeah.

434
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,030
It talked to Jesus right now.

435
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,650
Should I go that far? No, I
think that'd be too limiting.

436
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,750
I think if I just say
positive things about women,

437
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,470
I can't do this. I am fucking,
annoys the shit out of me.

438
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,980
A clutch.
Is there any more annoying than a clutch?

439
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,950
It goes to buy my house. I don't have
any pockets. Can you hold all my shit?

440
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,640
Eight. Why don't you bring
money? Your fucking bags?

441
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,770
Why don't you make a bunch of
one of those recycling bags?

442
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:33,420
Why don't you throw that
over your fucking outfit?

443
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,210
Maybe you'll be making some
new fashion statement, right?

444
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:40,740
Like back in the day when women will wear
business suits in, in fucking sneakers,

445
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,000
put on something nice and then have
like a little fucking grocery bag.

446
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,670
You don't even sticks to
call you shit in there.

447
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,450
Okay.

448
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,210
You giant fucking Hell fucking cell phone.

449
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,000
I already have my cell phone in my pocket.
You want to meet him?

450
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,080
Radiate fucking both sides of my scrotum.
I mean,

451
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:05,370
not to mention my taint. Do you have any
sort of consideration for me whatsoever?

452
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,350
I might just a fucking pack mule.

453
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,610
Yeah.

454
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,860
Once you get a smaller phone,
you're going to walk around with a clutch.

455
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:15,310
I say you go back to a flip phone.
That's what I say.

456
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:20,080
That's my big controversial
fucking take on this Thursday,

457
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,500
a playoff hockey tonight.
Everybody playoff hockey.

458
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:27,430
The third game of the Red Sox Yankees,

459
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,740
90 million games that we're
going to play this year.

460
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:34,741
I got 50 bucks on every game with uh,

461
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,380
my booking agent and uh,
Paul Versey.

462
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,000
Okay.

463
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,590
And I called the two of the panic
brothers because that first game they will

464
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:48,790
literally go and like we're done.
Oh my God, wait. So squared, uh,

465
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:53,360
bullpens admit the Yankees
had major problems and they'd
like literally the next

466
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,131
Gabe,
it's just like dough.

467
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:57,570
We'll go to the world series and
then all of a sudden fucking, uh,

468
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,160
Hanley Ramirez had said Grand Slam and
we go down for being like fucking down

469
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,890
eight to two and now it's eight to six.
And that was all of a sudden,

470
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:09,700
it's like if we blow this, the
bullpens, the problem, it's like, dude,

471
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,300
this is 150 games left.

472
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,280
I can't fucking do this.

473
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,140
But it's so funny to watch the Yankee fans
act like how red sox fans used to act.

474
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,220
Um,
they don't have any swag or anymore.

475
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,230
They're a bunch of fucking
nervous nellies. It's tremendous.

476
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,370
Which is why once again, we shouldn't have
gotten to that stupid fight with them.

477
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:37,780
Stupid. Why give them an emotional
point to rally around you.

478
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:41,230
The better God damn team. But it doesn't
mean that the better team is gonna win.

479
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,160
It doesn't mean it. Because when you start
getting involved in that stupid shit,

480
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,430
it's fucking baseball.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

481
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,800
Everybody's going to come running out.

482
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,000
I always wanted to talk to people like
who come running out of the bullpen,

483
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,480
you know? Is that like a knowing
that by the time you get there,

484
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:04,010
like the fights are already been over
for fucking three minutes, you know,

485
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,980
and you could tell the way they come
running out. It's like, what do you,

486
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,740
you're going to just,
you're going to be sitting there.

487
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:13,490
You're not pitching that day.
Right. You're blowing bubbles.

488
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,170
You coming up with fucking game.

489
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:19,070
She can play to get through the fucking
Gab thinking I'm looking at something

490
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:23,270
great. And your buddy's gone
are the green monster. Nope.

491
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,770
Uh, the person's, uh, red
sox, Saint Patty's Day hat.

492
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,940
Right? And all of a sudden
you're like, is that a fight?

493
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,690
Is that a fight in the phone?
Fucking rings. Hey Buddy. Yeah.

494
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:39,840
I don't know if you noticed,
but there's like a 40 on 40 fight about a,

495
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,950
about a football field away. Why
don't you come out? It's good.

496
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,890
It's gonna look good for the team and
a half and he gets up without fucking

497
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:49,970
stretching and you see him jog out there
and they're not going to come running

498
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:54,210
out their full fucking full speed.
They're going to pull a hamstring.

499
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,870
They're going to throw a punch and fuck
up their hand. They can't their pictures,

500
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,140
their pitches. You, you, you're
looking at a Ken doll. It's, it's got,

501
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:07,730
it has no fucking, uh, no
genitalia. It's running out. What?

502
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:12,200
That every once in a while he see somebody
come running out and that's usually

503
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:14,990
the fucking warmup catcher.
That guy will come flying out of there.

504
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:18,880
He's got to do something to keep, make
sure he stays on the God damn team, right?

505
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,530
That guy only catches the knuckle
baller. He's like, oh Jesus,

506
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,020
I get to do something.
Right.

507
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,920
Anyway,
a rough and Rowdy Charlotte,

508
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:35,010
North Carolina in the house
to ric flair built. Um,

509
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,380
I cannot fucking wait and I am actually
going out to buy little habit dash for

510
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:44,180
the fucking, uh, I'm, I'm going
all out for this thing and uh,

511
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,750
it's going to be a great fucking time.
All right.

512
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,670
It's going to be as great as
every woman on the planet is.

513
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,150
They're just great people.
Every single one of them.

514
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,600
None of them needs to do any
sort of self examination.

515
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:00,920
Anything that they're doing,

516
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,290
it's because of the man that's in their
life or maybe a man who isn't even in

517
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,010
their life.

518
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,750
Maybe a man that they've never even met
before is the reason for their behavior.

519
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,420
Um, that's it. Everybody have a
great weekend and go fuck yourself.

520
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:21,470
She comments and I will,
I will talk to you on Monday.

521
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,600
I look forward to high level competition
tonight between the Boston Red Sox and

522
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:29,500
the New York Yankees.

523
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,060
All right.
See Ya.

524
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,663
Yeah,

525
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,363
correct

526
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,630
boss.
Here's the story.

527
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,931
Gotta beat.

528
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:23,260
Marsha got to get closer than a quarter
of an inch rubber that when Greg Brady

529
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,190
striving that fucking caprice classic
or whatever the fuck they had,

530
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,600
whipping it around the parking lot,

531
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,180
get closer than an engineer,

532
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,800
make it fun or how broads can't drive
one of my favorite fucking episodes.

533
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,120
And that's a typical
male chauvinist reaction.

534
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:46,280
You're prejudice against women drivers.
Not as long as they stay off the roads.

535
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,630
It's not prejudice, it's just that men
are naturally superior drivers. Right?

536
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,320
Two favorite episodes was the first half.

537
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,700
Not that Brady Bunch episode when Greg
Brady was bringing the fucking hammer

538
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:03,610
down and was gone. Let me tell you
three fucking stepsister bitches,

539
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,830
something nutty.
You broads know how to drive.

540
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,440
And that includes your mother
who I'm banging by the way,

541
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,560
who I'm banging by the way.
All right.

542
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:16,610
With their weird ass haircut,
whatever the fuck you know.

543
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:22,670
But, um, yeah, I had a date
with him and you know, it was,

544
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,010
I kind of felt like I was,

545
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,190
if you were in school
and I were the teacher,

546
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,260
did anybody ever have that fucking
haircut? Uh, other than her. I mean,

547
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:34,920
that is like,
I dunno what it was.

548
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,460
She took like Mo from the three stooges
haircut and then she put a fucking sort

549
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:44,610
of mullet that she did a little
flipped to on the back. Anyways,

550
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:46,920
let's get back to you broads.
You don't know how to fucking drive.

551
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,290
That goes for you with the
fucking speech impediment.

552
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,310
You don't know how to fucking drive
Jan with your awful fucking Hasidic Jew

553
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:58,230
fucking curls. I don't know what
you're trying to do. You know, and,

554
00:36:58,231 --> 00:36:59,580
and,
and Marcia who,

555
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:03,360
I don't know why I'm not banging you some
reason we skipped over you and started

556
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:07,260
banging your mother, right? None
of you bitches can fucking drive.

557
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,310
And I'm watching this episode going this,
see Greg Brady says, shit, Greg, Bro,

558
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,440
fuck Fonzie. You know, with
his stupid fucking, you know,

559
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:19,600
spinning around a punching a
jukebox. So play Shabaam Shit, boom.

560
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:23,530
I don't give a fuck about that.
I like Greg Brady, you know,

561
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,600
for as much as Fonzie was talking shit,
he was always nice to the ladies.

562
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:30,120
And that's,
that's seventh grade game with a woman.

563
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:35,370
[inaudible]

564
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,540
Greg Brady.
That's it.

565
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,680
That's how Greg ended up fucking their
mom because he didn't give a shit.

566
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,170
You didn't give a fuck Greg. Fuck
you Carol. You're not my mother.

567
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:02,910
You know how to drive either. Oh my God.
Took them in that fucking groovy addict.

568
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:07,360
They had started blowing up.
It's why his hair got all curly.

569
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,060
So anyways,
that episode,

570
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,540
he's telling these fucking broads
that they don't know how to drive.

571
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:19,060
And then in the end of course,
cause they always have to cater to women.

572
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,800
He's Nerdy fucking writers, you know,
and then the, uh, they fucking, you know,

573
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,010
Marsha goes around this stupid fucking
track and they had a cone with a little

574
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:34,480
egg on it. You guys are seeing this and
she fucking, you know, I forget whatever,

575
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,040
Marsha in the beginning,
and then

576
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,860
in the end, just to fuck and even
it out. So everybody's happy.

577
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:42,320
And they could sell tide during the
commercials. They have Greg. Fuck up.

578
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,800
Knock the I golf. That's, that's
what I was trying to get to.

579
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,250
Wasn't that what I was trying to
get to that one on so fucking long.

580
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:54,800
I can't even remember.
All I'm saying is

581
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,790
that the guy you want?
You don't,

582
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:03,150
it doesn't fucking matter
how many yards you throw

583
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,910
in the regular season.
It doesn't

584
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,000
fucking pattern.

585
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,580
Ah,

586
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,730
what's
going on

587
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,810
podcasts for Monday,

588
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,830
April 12th, 2010. And uh,

589
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,940
I'm actually just putting this up here
right now to let you guys know that I'm

590
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:05,020
not doing a podcast this week. I
apologize. I'm calling in sick.

591
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,810
All right. I'm fucking,
you know, everyone, cal,

592
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,610
cal Ripkin voluntarily took himself out
of that game and he ended his streak.

593
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,820
I'm ending my podcast streak.
This is the first week that I, uh,

594
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:23,810
I'll ever willingly not do
a fucking podcast. You know,

595
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,540
it's like an NFL football. The
big question is, can you go,

596
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,760
we tape it up and we freeze it.
Can you go?

597
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,210
And this is the first time I
could tell you no, I can't,

598
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,110
I can't go this week.
Everybody. I apologize.

599
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,890
So we're going to have a substitute this
week. I'm going to pass the mic. No,

600
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:47,530
I'm fucking with you. I really
should have someone stand in. I'm a,

601
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:50,580
I'm spent.
All right,

602
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,310
I'm back to drinking. I'm
disgusted with myself. I,

603
00:40:56,311 --> 00:41:00,250
uh, was in Atlanta this week.
I didn't drink Wednesday. Okay.

604
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,220
And I didn't drink Thursday.
Okay.

605
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,540
And then Friday was coming
along and I was tired.

606
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:12,510
Now my buddy was open and for me,
and I had a couple of drinks.

607
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,210
I had two beers and then
I switched to water,

608
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,930
which is a great thing and it usually
makes me stop. But the thing was,

609
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:23,550
is I left the punchline in
Atlanta. Uh, that's where I was at.

610
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:27,570
I was at the punchline and I walked
across the street to this club to 90

611
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,240
and okay.
I Dunno.

612
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:37,241
Somewhere walking from the punchline
across the parking lot to club,

613
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:42,430
to 90. I then switched back to, uh,

614
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,180
to alcohol. I don't know
what happened. Jesus Christ.

615
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,620
Hear my phone ringing in the background.

616
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:52,130
How many times getting a ring before you
realize either I'm not home or I'm not

617
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:55,700
picking it up.
It was probably some fucking telemarketer.

618
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,840
Oh Jesus. There you go. Person
finally quit. So anyways,

619
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,480
anyways,
I walk over there and people are drinking.

620
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,830
So I add a couple more Budweisers and
then the fucking bartender over there.

621
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,420
If you guys live in the Atlanta area,
and I feel really bad telling you this.

622
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,673
All right.

623
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,330
Cause it's such a cool fucking thing
that I don't want it to get ruined and

624
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:25,950
become anything touristy.
You know?

625
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:27,990
I can't even know what the name of
the thing was. Just go in there.

626
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:32,430
There's a bartender named Tommy and
just ask him if he can spin the wheel.

627
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,290
All right. This guy out of nowhere
says to me, and Paul Versey,

628
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:42,770
who's opening up for me, you
fucking killed all weekend. He,

629
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,840
he just pulls out this drum head and
it's got an Arrow and it has a bunch of

630
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:49,990
shit written all around the rim of the
drum head. And he goes, spin the air on,

631
00:42:49,991 --> 00:42:53,230
you'd spin it. And He, I
didn't even, I was so drunk,
I don't even know what I got.

632
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,240
And Paul spun at first, he got something,
the guy goes, okay, you got this.

633
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,520
Then he has me spinning and he
goes, all right, you got, you know,

634
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:06,730
you got this. And then he walks
over and he picks up this,

635
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:12,570
I dunno what it is. You don't like that
thing like that. They put like a Yeager,

636
00:43:12,571 --> 00:43:15,120
Erin, you know when you do
like they have Yeager on tap,

637
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:16,020
you know all those things.

638
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,300
He basically picked up something like
that that had a door on the front of it

639
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:24,330
and he just puts it on top
of his head and he's just

640
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,410
staring at us

641
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,910
and all of a sudden he opens the door
and he has this dumb cross eyed look on

642
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:34,960
his face and he starts singing
slash rapping. I don't know what,

643
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,390
and it doesn't even sound like English.

644
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,450
And at the end of every sentence it
could kind of fucking rhymes and right as

645
00:43:42,451 --> 00:43:45,270
you start to figure out what he's saying,
he stops,

646
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,050
makes a weird face and slams
the door right in his face.

647
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,630
It's the most fucked up thing. When he
first did it, I was like all defensive,

648
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:58,410
like is this Guy gonna make me look
like a fucking asshole? And then I,

649
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,010
and then right as I caught on that
he was just acting like an idiot.

650
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,380
He slammed the door on himself and it
was the best fucking laugh I've had in

651
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:11,820
like three months. I can't even imitate
what he did. And that was just for Paul.

652
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,750
So now he's standing,
he just slammed the door,

653
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:18,470
this fucking thing on his writing
his own face as little door.

654
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,480
And now he's just standing
there looking at me,

655
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:24,390
but he's not looking at me cause he's
got this fucking thing on him on his head

656
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:27,600
and I know I'm next and all of a
sudden he opens the door again.

657
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:32,460
He's got that same dumb look on his
face and he said, ah, Bill bird up,

658
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,190
but deputize Deborah today.
I can't even fucking do what he was doing.

659
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,790
And me and Paul at this point,
I'm like pounding the bar,

660
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:42,600
fucking dying laughing and
you didn't want it to end.

661
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:44,910
And all of a sudden he just stops with,
is fucked up,

662
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:49,680
look on his face and he slams the
door in his face again, club to 90.

663
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:53,690
The guy's name's Tommy. Just
hang out there. I'm telling you,

664
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,270
I do all the fucking weird Shit I've seen
in bars with people doing tricks with

665
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,170
matchbooks people telling you jokes and
everything was the most unique fucking

666
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:04,380
thing I've ever seen in my life.
And um,

667
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,110
it's called the club to 90, just just
go in there, whatever. That's it.

668
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,110
The next night I was going to bring
actually my video camera and video tape it

669
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,070
and put it up on Youtube,

670
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:18,240
but I didn't want to because youtube
ruins everything because everything then

671
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:20,670
becomes mainstream and it can't be a,

672
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,820
it was just this cool underground thing.

673
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,630
So what I did to keep it underground was
not videotape it and then fucking talk

674
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:31,920
about it on my podcast. What
an asshole. Um, so anyways,

675
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:36,921
so I went hard that night and I stayed
out till like four in the morning and we

676
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,380
ended up driving out of there and uh,
and version is going,

677
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:45,930
come on, hey, is anything open? I want
to get something to eat. I'm like, dude,

678
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:48,390
I'm not eating this fucking late.
Actually it was like three,

679
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,470
I got to sleep by force was a little bit
before three. And he goes, no, no, no.

680
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:54,020
He goes, I think Mcdonald's
opened. I'm like, dude,

681
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:57,480
it's not going to be open this late.
And he's like, all right, come on.

682
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,550
Just drive up there. So I say,
fuck it. I drive up there.

683
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,100
He sees the lights are on and he see,

684
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:06,690
you see that one lonely fucking person
standing in there walking around doing

685
00:46:06,691 --> 00:46:11,400
everything and he's all excited, dude.
Do the drive through throughs open? Yes.

686
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:15,680
It's fucking open, right? So we go, we go
to the drive through and he's like, dude,

687
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:17,850
you got to get some like, no, dude,
I'm not getting any of this shit.

688
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:21,630
I can't eat this fucking laid up too,
too old to beat and it's light, right?

689
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,180
So we go up to the drive through and
the guy goes, hey, welcome Mcdonald's.

690
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,570
Can I take your order? And immediately
my mouth just starts going, yeah,

691
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:31,920
let me get two double cheeseburgers,
a small fry and a coke and verse.

692
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,150
He just starts laughing at me.

693
00:46:33,151 --> 00:46:36,840
Cause two seconds ago I wasn't going
to get anything in the second I just

694
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:39,120
started smelling those
fries. I said, you know what?

695
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:40,530
Actually now that I think of it,

696
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,250
I'm going to order about
1,280 calories of trans fats.

697
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,480
I think that that's what I'm going to do.

698
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,420
So we get our shit fucking
drive back to the hotel,

699
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:55,170
fucking eat it and his Roman.
Then I go to bed. You know,

700
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,440
I wake up the next day at like
1230 and I'm not worth shit.

701
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,640
I'm not worth fucking shit. We
get up, we go to the waffle house.

702
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,830
This is what I did to my body this week.

703
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:08,760
This is why there's no podcast this
week. This is not a podcast. Okay?

704
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,830
So if you guys don't like this podcast,

705
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,020
don't write me and say
that podcasts sucked.

706
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:18,021
Well you need to say is
you're unbelievably long
statement announcing why you

707
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:22,650
weren't going to do a podcast sucked.
All right.

708
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,100
All right. Get it right there. Cunt face.
So, uh, yeah, we go into the waffle.

709
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,130
We're both fucking

710
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,963
hung over.

711
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,630
I had been to the waffle house a bunch
of times because I traveled this fucking

712
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:35,464
country.

713
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:40,090
Paul Versey has never been to the fucking
waffle house because he doesn't work

714
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:43,360
this part of the country much.
Or maybe he just never went to it,

715
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,980
which I would understand because of the
piss yellow sign that they have with the

716
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:52,390
incredibly bland black
font. It is, um, um,

717
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,230
is a question for you guys and
this non podcasts, what do,

718
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,410
when you guys look at like fast food,

719
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,340
don't you know what like some signs of
like appealing and they make you want to

720
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:06,290
eat the food or at the very least try it.
We have an an earthquake.

721
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:12,040
Is that just wind and having a
lot of earthquakes lately? Um,

722
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,430
total is one of those little ones.

723
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,930
Every once in a while I'll get one of
those little ones out here. And, uh,

724
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,410
it just feels like,
you know,

725
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:21,330
if your eyes are closed at
night and you get one of those,

726
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,710
you feel like if you opened your eyes,

727
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:26,600
they'd be some guys standard at the
end of your bed. Just shaking it. Heck,

728
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:31,410
I'm going to fucking kill
you. Um, anyway, so we got,

729
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,290
uh, which, uh, Jesus,
I said I got nothing.

730
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:39,010
This is not a podcast everybody.
I can't even fucking think right now.

731
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,200
I had a Muffin, a bag of
m and m's, a water in,

732
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:46,950
some sort of chicken wrap,
all airport fucking food.

733
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,690
I've destroyed my body.

734
00:48:48,691 --> 00:48:51,570
I think at least two of my
organs of shutdown at this point.

735
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,710
I'm going to go with one kidney and,
uh, let's see the pancreas now that's,

736
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,090
that's the fucking grand central
of the, uh, Oregon's isn't it?

737
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,030
What exactly does the pancreas do?

738
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:07,200
That's for all you geeks out there who
let me know that facetious is not the

739
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:12,201
only word that has all
the vowels in a row.

740
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,300
You hear that geeky

741
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,620
person who sent me that fucking email
that said the intercity league of both.

742
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:21,130
The word facetious is it's the
only word in the English language.

743
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:24,490
We're all the, uh, all the vowels,

744
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:28,630
not only all the vowels in the
English language in the word,

745
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,600
they're actually in order. It's the
only word in the English language.

746
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,980
I'm sorry to tell you sir,
you're actually wrong and a,

747
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,610
I can't remember what the other word is,

748
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:41,110
but at least two other nerds emailed me
to let me know that you are wrong. So,

749
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:44,950
uh, I'm not gonna read the emails
because this is not a podcast this week.

750
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:46,270
I am taking this week off.

751
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:51,540
So what you need to do is you need to
deepen the level of nerd that you fucking

752
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:55,390
hang out with before you make an ass of
yourself like that again on the podcast.

753
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:56,890
Lucky for you.

754
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,790
I'm not trashing you on another podcast
or as you would be embarrassed right now.

755
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:01,900
Fortunately for you,

756
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,950
this got buried on the back page
of this non podcasts this week.

757
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,250
So anyways, what, which
have fast food restaurant.

758
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:13,810
You guys feel like the sign makes the
food look like the least appealing for me?

759
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,820
I would go with the waffle house because
they have like that piss yellow fucking

760
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:21,520
sign and they have the
plaintiff's black font.

761
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:28,220
It's just horrible. Absolutely horrible.
And it makes me sick to my stomach. Arby's

762
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,850
is another one that blood orange color,

763
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:36,440
that fucking hat, and they're
gray roast beef. And by the way,

764
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:39,860
I ate there last night.
It about fucking one in the morning.

765
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,230
Jesus Christ.

766
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,100
You know what I used to hate to was this
the subway back in the day when they

767
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:50,750
had those piss yellow counters in the
newspaper articles all on the walls.

768
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,780
Remember that they literally had
urine colored tables with newspapers.

769
00:50:56,211 --> 00:51:00,560
The only thing was missing was a
homeless guy rolled up in the wallpaper,

770
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,390
pissing on the tables.
That was the,

771
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:06,140
that was basically subconsciously what
they were creating. And not only that,

772
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:10,220
the pictures on the wall on, oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no. The newspapers,

773
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,470
Oh,
I'm fucking this up.

774
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,640
The subway used to have
pictures of Old New York on it.

775
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,820
That's what it had. Wow. I fucked that up.

776
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:23,780
The newspapers were actually the
tabletops of the old Wendy's.

777
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,340
There's a bunch of guys,

778
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:29,420
41 years old and older right now
fucking punch in their dashboard going.

779
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:32,720
That's why I was going to fucking
say that. I remember that Shit.

780
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,240
You go in there and you'd,
you'd order the triple you ever one time.

781
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,780
You don't dice it. You
remember what time? You know,

782
00:51:39,781 --> 00:51:44,750
one time I was standing in line at
Wendy's and I was making my girl crack up,

783
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:48,170
or maybe my girlfriend at the time,
I can't even fucking think this week,

784
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,790
I was making her laugh her ass off
because I was making fun of who the fuck

785
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:57,100
orders a triple, uh, triple cheeseburger,
you know, I don't even know of him,

786
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:57,934
what I was saying,

787
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:03,100
but I had a dying laughing and I was so
site that I was making her laugh because

788
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:04,640
it was making me feel good.

789
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:09,320
I had a cry and laugh and then I had
said triple cheeseburger so many fucking

790
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:13,250
times that when I walked up to the
register, I ended up ordering it.

791
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,060
And then she looked at me like,
what the fuck did you do that for?

792
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,770
And then I felt stupid for ordering it,
but then I asked, it felt, you know,

793
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,540
I didn't want to be like, oh
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

794
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,110
I didn't want to look like an asshole.
And then the glutinous side of me is like,

795
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:30,710
oh great, I get to eat at triple
cheeseburger, you know, like a fat fuck.

796
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,350
So anyways, I would go with Arby's and I
would go with the waffle house signage.

797
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,590
So anyways,
we walked into the waffle house.

798
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:42,420
So for those of you who have
never been to a waffle house, uh,

799
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:46,370
don't ever put your elbows on the table
because you won't be able to get them

800
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:51,350
off without taking off at least
two layers of skin because there's

801
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,610
somebody kill me.
You know,

802
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:57,530
I just had an urge to do him
wearing a thermal right now.

803
00:52:57,531 --> 00:53:00,950
I had the urge to take this thing
off and hang myself by the sleeves.

804
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,680
I got nothing. I got absolutely
nothing this week, this statement.

805
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,080
It's uh,

806
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,200
it's just gonna be a long statement of
someone who ways we walk into the fucking

807
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:22,340
waffle house. And yes, I did
lose some energy in my voice.

808
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,300
I'm running out of batteries here.
Uh, yeah, I'm sweating here. Uh,

809
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,930
we walk into the waffle house and we're
both fucking hung over it and I've been

810
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:34,890
to the waffle house hundreds of times,
so I already know the menu.

811
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,110
Paul on the other hand,
does not know the menu.

812
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,860
So the waitress comes over and she goes,
you guys ready to order?

813
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,070
And I'm like, yeah, yeah,
actually I'm ready to order it.

814
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:49,071
So Versie goes into a fucking panic and
it's a big overwhelming fucking menu.

815
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:52,190
They have like 98
different kinds of, of, uh,

816
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,190
hashbrowns smothered covered fucking
sheet shit on or whatever the fuck you

817
00:53:56,191 --> 00:54:00,600
supposed to say there that he just, you
know, I order what I order and then he,

818
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,340
he didn't know what the fuck did dope.
These, just looking at the pictures,

819
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:09,660
pancakes, toast, eggs. And he
finally just goes, yet you have a,

820
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,480
what are the order?
He ordered eggs benedict

821
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,060
fucking waffle house.
You know

822
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,090
who the fuck? Oh, that's like trying to
order like a ribeye steak at Mcdonald's.

823
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:24,930
They don't have it.

824
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:29,430
Paul over easy or fucking scrambled.

825
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,650
I mean there's like toothless truckers in,

826
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:35,970
they're convicted felons has been rappers.

827
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,560
It's a shit, it's a shit hole. But
their waffles a delicious especial,

828
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,970
especially when you're hung
over their food. So fattening.

829
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:47,700
I actually had a little hiccup
there as I was just describing it.

830
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,200
So anyways, and this is the,
this is, this is the kicker.

831
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,190
Like that night I have three
fucking shows. All right.

832
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,600
But because I'm a professional,

833
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:02,601
I'm able to push all the feelings that I
have of the horror that I've done to my

834
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:08,040
body over the last fucking 24
hours. I go onstage, kill its seven,

835
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:12,780
kill a 10 I do, I go to Duke was
seven nine and 11 the 11 o'clock show.

836
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:15,120
I literally have a
splitting fucking headache.

837
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,150
And all I can think of is Jerry Lewis.

838
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:22,800
And how he never ever sat down in his
Tuxedo pants and he always gave him a

839
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:26,730
fucking show. And I was like, you
know, instead of what would Jesus do,

840
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:30,330
what would Jerry do?
He would give them Michelle Lady.

841
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,740
So I plowed through that one and uh,

842
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,150
then that was the end of my weekend.

843
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,570
So he probably thinking
to yourself right now.

844
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,690
Well then why are you issuing
a statement bill? You fucking,

845
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:49,020
you will finish Saturday. It's fucking
Monday. Did you recuperate yesterday? No,

846
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:49,890
I did not.

847
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:55,370
I went to the masters yesterday and
watch Phil Mickelson when his third green

848
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:58,710
jacket.
And uh,

849
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,120
it was an incredible experience. I
went to the Superbowl golf, everybody.

850
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:08,270
And after having gone there and seen
how fucking beautiful that golf courses,

851
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:12,840
I don't know why they don't call the
Superbowl, the masters of football.

852
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:13,231
You know why?

853
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:16,440
Because nobody fucking watches golf to
the level that they watched football.

854
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:18,270
That's why I knew the
answer to that question.

855
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:23,020
I'm just trying to tell you that
was a beautiful course and, and,

856
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:26,980
and basically you don't get
tickets to the masters. All right.

857
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:30,670
Cause I want to tell you guys, this is
just like Royal Albert Hall that I saw.

858
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,730
This is another thing
that if you're into golf,

859
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:36,220
you have to do at some
point you don't get tickets.

860
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:40,690
What you do is you get a badge and you
have to get a badge from some sort of

861
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:43,180
dude who knows a member
who knows a fucking guy,

862
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:47,680
who knows a guy who fucking
knew a guy who knew a guy.

863
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,120
And when you go to pick up your tickets,
you actually fucking,

864
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,240
at least we did.
We actually drove to somebodies house

865
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,620
and I remember I thought it was gonna be
like, some will call shit and it wasn't.

866
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,320
We were driving through this neighborhood

867
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:10,120
and I'm looking at the addresses and
I'm like, I think it's the next house.

868
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,670
It's a house.
I must be on the wrong street.

869
00:57:12,671 --> 00:57:16,030
And then I look and there's this woman
sitting in a garage waving at us.

870
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,250
And I was like,
all right,

871
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,230
well either this is the place where
we're supposed to be or this is the

872
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,960
friendliest fucking neighborhood
I've ever been to. Well,

873
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:30,370
maybe I looked like one of her neighbors
or maybe she has a rape fantasy and she

874
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:31,370
ordered a redhead

875
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:39,580
because you know how many Red
Juggalos are out there? Everybody

876
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,220
telling you were in demand.
We're, we're dying off. Well,

877
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:48,790
like the white rhinos
of fucking human beings.

878
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:53,620
People are trying to bang us before
we disappear. Let me think about it.

879
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,090
Think about the Dodo bird.

880
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:59,000
Think about if you actually stuck
your dick in a Dodo bird. The, the,

881
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,390
the fuck you Trump every story in a bar.

882
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,750
I fucked something that
doesn't exist anymore.

883
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,770
What do you necrophilia act? No, you
fucking asshole. I fucked the Dodo bird.

884
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,000
Um, anyways, now, right there,

885
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:18,640
I would have complained if
that was on a regular podcast.

886
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:20,440
I would have complained
about that last bit there.

887
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:22,360
But fortunately this is not a podcast.

888
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:26,140
I'm just issuing a statement that I do
not have the energy to fucking do this

889
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,480
this week.
So anyway,

890
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,210
we get these fucking badges and they
actually bring you into the house.

891
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,160
We sit in this library and I'm sitting
there and this woman is debriefing me

892
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,820
about these badges.
Okay.

893
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:45,390
I'm already freaked out about going to
the masters because there's a level of

894
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:49,190
whiteness and a level of education that,
uh,

895
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,700
even intimidates me is white as I am now.
Um,

896
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:58,580
if statically a, e, s, t, h, e, t, I,

897
00:58:58,581 --> 00:59:02,600
C, a, l, l, Y. Aesthetically, I don't
even know if I spelled it right,

898
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:04,850
but I know how to spell it when
I'm not fucking brain dead.

899
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,440
It's one of my spelling words.
Let's get smart America. Um,

900
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,210
statically I'm very white.
Alabaster. If he asked my girlfriend,

901
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:19,050
that's how she describes
me. Um, porcelain ask,

902
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:24,050
that's how wide I am. But, uh, there's,
this is the different kind of white,

903
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,340
this is the most of the whole,

904
00:59:26,341 --> 00:59:31,341
the food kind of white and a ivy
league kind of white Illuminati,

905
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,470
you know,
rubbing elbows with the Kennedys.

906
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:42,110
We summer in the Hamptons,
we have a house on Martha's vineyard.

907
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,140
You know, when Jesus comes back, he's
going to have to be buzzed into our house.

908
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:53,840
After we talked to our lawyer, our lawyer
will be present when Jesus judges me,

909
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,270
like that level of fucking white.

910
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,770
So I went on the Internet
and I actually was like the,

911
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:04,040
I know there's a dress code here and the
last thing I want to do when I go to a

912
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:08,330
place like that is I don't want to
come in there and disrespect the place.

913
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:12,560
I don't give a fuck about the approval of
those people. But you know what I mean?

914
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,850
You go into that place.
It's an unbelievable golf event.

915
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:20,390
I respect the history of it. Arnold
Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan,

916
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:21,260
all that type of stuff.

917
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:26,120
So I want to go there and show it the
respect that it deserves. All right.

918
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,640
And also I don't want to walk in
there looking like a fucking bum.

919
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,550
So I go on the Internet and I check
out the dress code and it's literally

920
01:00:31,551 --> 01:00:35,390
college shirt, no jeans
allowed, all this shit. So I,

921
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,560
for the first time in about,
I think 20 years, I actually,

922
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:44,390
when I had some sort of a suit job,
I actually bought a pair of dockers,

923
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,140
dockers, everybody, I at least I went
with the black ones. I did not buy khaki.

924
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:56,810
I refuse to ever wear khaki.

925
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,400
There's only two people in the world
where a khaki animal experts and date

926
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,160
rapists. All right, I'm not wearing khaki.

927
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:10,060
So I bought a pair of
black doctors and uh,

928
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,280
I had this blue like Nike Golf Shirt
and then I had the tiger woods,

929
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:21,200
um, the tiger woods, Nike Hat,
the black one with the Red v.

930
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:25,940
Why am I acting like I'm walking the
red carpet from my movie date night that

931
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:29,450
came out last weekend, which is
a huge fucking hit. Everybody.

932
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:34,010
I'm so fucking site.
Date night was a huge head.

933
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:38,770
It made a ton of fucking money and
if you went out and saw it, um,

934
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,920
I I want to say thank you because I hope
it's such a huge hit that they make a

935
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:45,210
fucking sequel and uh,

936
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:50,250
maybe I'll be able to repop
reprise my role as detective Walsh.

937
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:55,670
You know, maybe I'll be, if I'll,
I'll turn bad in the second one,

938
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:59,240
like a fucking key Ho
and another 48 hours.

939
01:01:59,241 --> 01:02:02,840
Remember that I'll grow one of those.
A walrus mustaches.

940
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:07,640
I don't give a shit. It's the first movie
I've really booked ever in my career.

941
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,180
I'm averaging one every 18 years.
If I can go on a run with this thing,

942
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:15,860
I'll be psyched. For those
of you who haven't seen it
and, uh, enjoy this podcast.

943
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:19,530
This is not a podcast. This
is just a statement, uh,

944
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,560
but enjoy all the other free podcasts.
He just let me like, you know what,

945
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,210
he never comes and tours in my area
or I don't care to see his act live,

946
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:29,220
but I would like to
somehow pay it forward.

947
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:32,960
You could pay it forward by buying a
ticket to date night. You could even do,

948
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,610
we have bigger favor is if you're gonna,

949
01:02:35,611 --> 01:02:38,310
if you've already seen it or you
don't even want to fucking see it,

950
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:40,320
you'd rather see another movie.
Do me a favor.

951
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,500
Just buy two tickets to date night and
just go into the other movie that you

952
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:46,740
wanted to anyways,
just so it pads the stats,

953
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:52,920
um, date nights starring
Steve Carell and Tina Fey.

954
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,260
Is that a local Cineplex near you?
Please go see it. So anyways, um,

955
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,440
so we get the badges and uh,
this is the deal.

956
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:03,240
You're not allowed to
bring a cell phone in.

957
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,870
You're not allowed to bring a camera
and you're not allowed to bring video

958
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,360
equipment and you're not
allowed to bring shit in.

959
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,440
All you're allowed to bring in is
yourself the close that cover you and some

960
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:17,640
fucking cash, some sunblock. That's it.

961
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:18,901
All right.

962
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:22,260
So you walk in there and you literally
get going through like a metal detector

963
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:27,180
like you going through the airport
and immediately there's this sense of,

964
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:32,040
uh, is the president nearby because
that's what this security feels like.

965
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,500
And uh,

966
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,930
and the big thing with these badges is
it's not like you get the badge at the

967
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:40,350
person's house. So where, however the
fuck you get it and you get to keep it,

968
01:03:40,351 --> 01:03:43,290
you have to return the badge.
And when you have this badge,

969
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:48,590
you have the responsibility to not break
any rules because if they kick you out,

970
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:52,680
they take your badge.
So you'll never come again.

971
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,720
So not only can you never come again,

972
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,850
the person who's badge it was does not
get it back ever again no matter what.

973
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:04,290
Because you are obviously not good enough.
A judge of character,

974
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,710
considering that you gave this badge to
this person that we now have to eject.

975
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:11,040
And when I went there,

976
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:15,390
all I heard was stories of people that
they had seen get a Jackson, some ejected,

977
01:04:15,391 --> 01:04:20,070
some guy actually got a cell phone in
there and it rang at some point during the

978
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:24,720
match. And people just
appear out of nowhere. Okay.

979
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,120
One guy puts you in a fucking show cold,

980
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:32,121
another guy snatches the badge off your
shirt and the badge has to be displayed

981
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:36,540
at all times. And you would think
with all those fucking people there,

982
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,150
if he didn't have it
displayed, you had, you know,

983
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,080
very small chance of someone's
stopping you. I didn't have my,

984
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:46,390
I had mine in my pocket and I
walked like 10 feet with it and Oh,

985
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:49,590
this guy just appeared out
of nowhere with his master's.

986
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:52,510
That green colored shirts or was your
batch, where's your bad sir, sir?

987
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:57,420
Do you have a badge? You
know, fucking gun drawn.

988
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:01,560
He may be reached in my pocket with
two fingers, you know, pull it on kin,

989
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:05,250
whatever. Um, so anyways,

990
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,240
so we walk out onto
that. W we get there. Uh,

991
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,400
first thing we do is we walk into the
pro shop and I already told myself I was

992
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:17,590
going to spend it like 400
bucks and I got dammit if I,

993
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:21,910
if I didn't see exactly what I did,
I got some shot glasses,

994
01:05:21,911 --> 01:05:24,610
I got some golf balls,
I got some hats for people.

995
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,520
They actually sell those masters.
The flags,

996
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:32,050
you know that they have on the pins
all around there just as the masters,

997
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:35,170
2010 for re clean,
very elegant.

998
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:40,350
The Shit bought a bunch of those for
some friends and a couple of golf shirts,

999
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:45,970
you know, the usual bullshit. And
then I bought one of those, uh,

1000
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,730
the best and the best souvenir I
ended up getting is you actually,

1001
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:52,450
cause you don't want to stand up for
fucking 12 hours watching people golf.

1002
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:55,840
What's up Cleo? Are you doing, I
didn't know you were lay in there.

1003
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:58,840
Now you're do when you guys haven't
heard of fucking Moen lately.

1004
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:08,410
Anyways, um, I just do that
for me. Um, so anyways,

1005
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:13,220
uh, they sell these, these chairs there
that you can, uh, sit on. Oh Jesus.

1006
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,970
You see, this is why this isn't a
podcast. And you hear what I just said.

1007
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,520
They sell these chairs
that are you can set on,

1008
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,490
is that what you do with the chair bill?

1009
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,730
And they actually ended up being
one of the most coveted um,

1010
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,380
souvenirs because when you go to
get on the plane the next day,

1011
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:32,050
you see everybody got him,
they got him slung over their shoulders.

1012
01:06:32,051 --> 01:06:32,861
The way they fold up.

1013
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:36,010
It looks like you're carrying like a yoga
mat except that weighs like fucking 20

1014
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:38,080
pounds. So anyways, let's,

1015
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:41,560
let's cut to the chase here cause I
got to finish this statement early. Um,

1016
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:47,730
I went out onto the golf course and
those of you who are big fans of golf and

1017
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,330
you watched the masters every year,

1018
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:54,220
you got to go there because when
you go and you see the club house,

1019
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:54,940
she can't go in it.

1020
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:59,940
But when you see it and you
just start walking the course,

1021
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,540
this is,
this is what I suggest.

1022
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:06,541
Get there at like eight in the morning
and start at 18 and just walk the course

1023
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:09,730
backwards all the way to the front.

1024
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,760
I didn't do that because I had too
much shit that I bought and uh,

1025
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,810
I just walk to different
holes that I really liked,

1026
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:22,660
but that's what this guy told me to do,
walk the whole fucking course.

1027
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:25,040
But we got there a little late because,
uh,

1028
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:29,680
I was in a bar the night before watching
a guy with a box on his head sing songs

1029
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:32,770
that I couldn't really understand.
Um,

1030
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:36,500
but anyways,
you go onto the course and I,

1031
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:40,120
I've never been to anything
like this as far as nature goes.

1032
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:45,380
I've seen it was like seeing famous people
except they were, they were fair ways.

1033
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:50,230
Like I walked
up in around,

1034
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:55,290
so when I came to 18 I was in between
where you tee off and looking down the

1035
01:07:56,981 --> 01:07:57,520
fairway.

1036
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,610
You know when someone's just bringing
it home and is going to win the masters,

1037
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:05,670
there's a roadway where you walk across
and I looked right down that fairway and

1038
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:09,370
I dunno. It's one of those fucking
things we just like, this really exists.

1039
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,850
You know it isn't.
This is real.

1040
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,950
And then you go over the
number 12 [inaudible].

1041
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,120
I ain't got the little pamphlet here.

1042
01:08:17,121 --> 01:08:22,010
They've got all the holes are named the
12th hole. What the fuck do they call it?

1043
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:26,960
They have like the Golden Bell is the
name of this is how white this is.

1044
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:29,030
You guys want to hear
the names of the holes.

1045
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:32,360
Now usually when I talk
about holes on the Pod,

1046
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:39,220
it's a lot more crass than this
whole number one is called t olive.

1047
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:45,110
All right? That's not to whole.

1048
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:47,390
Number two is called Pink Dogwood.

1049
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,990
Tell me there isn't a porno to
be made with some of these names.

1050
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:56,450
Flowering Peach.
It's the third wall.

1051
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:01,250
These are all mildly sexual.
They flowery crab.

1052
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:05,690
Apple. Oh, that's the one where like if
you're into watching guys fuck old women,

1053
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,580
this is really just going to get
disgusting. Fifth hole is Magnolia.

1054
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:13,610
You get the point.
Juniper's is sixth

1055
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:19,580
pompous. I don't what the fuck
at yellow jasmine, but whatever.

1056
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,250
They got all these flowers and
everything's in bloom and it's just,

1057
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:24,280
it's unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.

1058
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,770
Walk around looking at all these famous
holes like I couldn't believe when I was

1059
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:32,771
coming up onto 12 to see that little
bridge there on a whatever the fuck they

1060
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:37,610
call it, the pink Petunia Golden Bell.
It's just unbelievable when you see it.

1061
01:09:37,611 --> 01:09:41,330
It's literally iconic. The same feeling
I got when I saw Big Ben in London.

1062
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:45,530
How fucking awesome is my life
this past month when I saw Big Ben,

1063
01:09:45,531 --> 01:09:47,360
you just stare at it.
You can't believe it.

1064
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,240
It's just something you've seen in your
whole life and now you're standing there

1065
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:52,050
looking at it and I'm telling you

1066
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:56,900
the fucking urge. This is the thing
about it. There was so many things.

1067
01:09:56,901 --> 01:10:00,590
You can't talk to the golfers. Like
if tiger hit something, hit the ball,

1068
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:04,220
hits something. His wife, if
tiger hit the fucking ball,

1069
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,410
you could literally go like, uh, you
know, as he came walking up to Bali back,

1070
01:10:08,411 --> 01:10:12,110
come on tiger. You could say something
like that maybe, but that's it.

1071
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,310
After you hit the ball, he couldn't
be like, you're the big toe. You too.

1072
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,950
I love you. That's it. Someone would
pair out of nowhere. Chloroform,

1073
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:23,390
rag right over your fucking nose. Somebody
yells, yanks off your fucking badge.

1074
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:28,140
And that's it.
They pummel you with Billy clubs that are,

1075
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:29,300
that are the same colors,

1076
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:33,290
the masters green and they just beat the
shit out of you and they toss you over

1077
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:37,680
the fucking fence.
That's how it works. Um,

1078
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,910
but I got to admit with all those rules,
all those rules,

1079
01:10:40,911 --> 01:10:44,540
the urge to just do something
like that and get kicked out,

1080
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:48,050
like I almost had like Tourette's.
Um,

1081
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:52,700
cause what I ended up doing is I settled
on the 15th hole and I sat in the

1082
01:10:52,701 --> 01:10:55,580
bleachers and I don't know
what that one's called,

1083
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,730
wispy pubic hair with the
fuck do they call this one?

1084
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,880
The 15th fucking hole is called
Firethorne and it had this,

1085
01:11:04,131 --> 01:11:05,540
uh,
so this is basically what we did.

1086
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:09,530
We realized that there was so many
fucking people there and we had our chairs

1087
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,740
that we had to lug around and
$40 worth of shit in his bag.

1088
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:17,070
I wasn't gonna walk 18 holes
and just follow tiger around.

1089
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:20,010
I didn't want to do it because there's
too many fucking people and there's

1090
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:25,011
people camped out around where they tee
off and they're camped out around the

1091
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:26,334
green.

1092
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:31,680
So what you can basically do is run
down the fucking fairway if you can get

1093
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:32,250
there,

1094
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:37,250
knowing that all the golfers have a point
a to point B once they once you know,

1095
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,850
just to keep playing,
moving.

1096
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,290
You on the other hand have specific areas
where you can crossover fairways and

1097
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:46,500
that type of shit. And if you don't,
they fucking, they, they, they,

1098
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,820
they destroy you and they take your badge.
So,

1099
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:54,480
um, we just said, fuck it. We're going
to go to 15. We're going to sit there.

1100
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,180
We can watch them hit their second shots,
a power five,

1101
01:11:57,181 --> 01:12:00,590
and we look over our shoulder.
We can't see him tee off on 16,

1102
01:12:00,591 --> 01:12:03,370
but we could see the result of their shot.
And uh,

1103
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:07,500
we sat there in the bleachers and
knowing that we had a good two and a half

1104
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:11,970
hours to wait until they came,
I think it was actually three hours.

1105
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,580
So we just sat there and a,

1106
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:16,740
you would think it would be
boring as hell and it wasn't.

1107
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:19,290
You just shoot the shit with other people,

1108
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:22,560
older people who've gone to the
masters since like the early seventies,

1109
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:27,210
late seventies, one guy from like 1952,
I didn't get a chance to talk to them,

1110
01:12:27,211 --> 01:12:30,950
but they talk about, you
know, Nicholas when in 86 and
all this shit was, you know,

1111
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,090
if you're a sports fan,
it was fucking incredible.

1112
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,980
And meanwhile all we're doing is we're
sitting waiting for the beer trap taps to

1113
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:41,370
be turned on.
And this is how this sounds secretive,

1114
01:12:41,371 --> 01:12:46,371
this fucking places is no one had any
idea when they get turned on somebody up

1115
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:52,020
in the clubhouse, in the inner
fucking catacombs of the clubhouse,

1116
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,040
gives everybody the go ahead
to turn on the beer taps.

1117
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,300
And they can't even tell you when they,
I don't know, maybe 1230, maybe one.

1118
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,620
We're not sure. And they don't have any
advertising, so just says domestic beer,

1119
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:08,940
regular beer. The whole fucking thing
is just like, look, we're in control.

1120
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:12,870
All right, you want an
import? This is important.

1121
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,210
You want to domestic. This is domestic.
What kind is it? I can't disclose that.

1122
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:22,050
I'm not allowed to tell you when,
when are you turning to bear on?

1123
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:26,160
We're not allowed to tell you, sir,
why are you being hostile? You know?

1124
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:30,120
So we're just sitting there and there's
a couple of turtles outside the fucking

1125
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:32,310
pawn there.
We start gambling on the turtles.

1126
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,770
Which one's going to go in
the fucking water first?

1127
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:39,270
Then they turn on the beer and we start
getting shit faced and we're waiting for

1128
01:13:39,271 --> 01:13:43,530
the first fucking golfers
to come. And then it's just
like the Indy 500. You just,

1129
01:13:43,531 --> 01:13:46,290
you just,
you just bet on golfers.

1130
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,620
It's like the most elegant
track you've ever been to.

1131
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:54,540
And you just wait and they come in
through to where time Ernie els, you know,

1132
01:13:56,010 --> 01:14:00,620
Kenny Paris coming through
fucking, uh, Sergio Valenti,

1133
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,650
whatever his fucking name is, eat. And
they just right in front of you, the shit.

1134
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:08,340
And you're just sitting there getting
hammered betting on golfers in fucking

1135
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:11,350
turtles. That's what I did
all day. Sitting in the sun.

1136
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:15,130
Fucking saw two holes in one,
or at least the results of them.

1137
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,150
I heard him hit the green. No, it hits
the Green. And I hear the crowd go crazy.

1138
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:23,380
I look over and I see it roll in the
cup and everybody goes fucking nuts. Um,

1139
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:26,260
I lost 100 bucks in the first one
and one a hundred on the next one.

1140
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,140
So I was even,
and I got to admit to it,

1141
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:31,990
when you sit there and all of a
sudden you look in the end, you know,

1142
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,050
taggers coming next because
you've got like the, uh,

1143
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:37,960
the whole list of golfers
is fucking unreal. And you
see him come over the hill.

1144
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:40,540
All right?
Like a fucking

1145
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,670
one of those deer hunters say
15 horn fucking dare, man.

1146
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,420
20 point are coming over the
hill and I got it. My such man,

1147
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:51,160
I'm going to shoot her
ride the fucking head.

1148
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,050
That was the other word is like target
comes over the Damn Hill he's wearing,

1149
01:14:56,051 --> 01:15:00,340
he sees, see him again, even see
him. He's so far away. You see a guy,

1150
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,300
you see a black guy,

1151
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,470
looks like a black guy who was actually
a mostly fucking Asian or whatever the

1152
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:06,610
hell he is.
I don't know what the hell he is.

1153
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:11,290
You see some Tan Dude beyond the Tan
that a white guy can get coming over the

1154
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:15,220
hill with a red shirt and the
fucking black pants on you.

1155
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:18,520
Like that's fucking tiger woods.
And a hush

1156
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,940
just falls over the entire,

1157
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:26,020
the entire hole is like 3000 people
sitting there and it's dead quiet.

1158
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:32,500
And you just see that ball fucking just
flying. I saw an eagle, the fucking hall.

1159
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:36,670
I saw him, Eagle it. I saw
Kim, the Korean Dude Eagle it.

1160
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,360
Uh,
I think I saw that it was an Ernie els.

1161
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,850
That was another thing that kinda sucked,

1162
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:45,550
was kind of hard to tell if
it was their second or third.

1163
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:48,640
You just knew with guys like
Kim [inaudible], tiger woods,

1164
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:50,680
the way they drove that, it
was his second shot. Anyways,

1165
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:53,800
whatever was fucking awesome.
And uh,

1166
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:57,760
Phil Mickelson came in last cause he
was on the leaderboard and once he went

1167
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:00,130
past us, I ran, I ran off
the bleachers, went down.

1168
01:16:00,131 --> 01:16:01,990
And actually he's the
only guy I watched t off,

1169
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:07,230
watched him tee off on 16 and then we
grabbed our shit and we ran over to 18 and

1170
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,140
tiger. It already finished. But we
stood there halfway down the f three,

1171
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:16,200
three quarters of the way up the 18th
at at Augusta and watched Mickelson tee

1172
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:20,140
off. We watched him hit his
second shot and then we were,

1173
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:24,330
we couldn't see through the crowd
when he sunk the winning Putt, eh,

1174
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,000
but we stood there and I looked between
a bunch of fucking blue bloods heads and

1175
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:31,030
I watched him put the green jacket on and
get choked up when he talked about his

1176
01:16:31,031 --> 01:16:34,930
wife. And it was one of the most
incredible experiences I've ever had.

1177
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:39,610
And uh, it's making me really thankful
for the incredible fucking life I have.

1178
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,320
And A, I hope this isn't building
resentment with you guys. You know,

1179
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,070
you just lay off drinking
for a little bit. You know,

1180
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:52,630
you could get by one of those badges
by his stinking badge and go next year.

1181
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:58,390
Just do one thing. Do One fucking
thing. You know, I don't fucking know.

1182
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,070
I don't know what I'm saying.
This is, these are just,

1183
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:03,010
this is just my statement that
I'm not doing a podcast this week.

1184
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:06,700
I'm not fucking doing it, but I
know you could. You can go there.

1185
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:11,630
It was cost me 600 bucks. I know that's
a of fucking money. I know it is.

1186
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:15,050
But think how much money you blow
each weekend and a bar. All right?

1187
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,220
Figure out what you blow each weekend
and a bar. Here's a good way to do it.

1188
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:21,080
It's a nice healthy way.
And just,

1189
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:24,440
just go on the wagon for a while and then
just take the money that you would've

1190
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:27,140
spent on booze.
He put it into your Augusta Fund.

1191
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:32,540
You know it just fucking drive there.
Do a fucking road trip.

1192
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:36,770
Get yourself a pair of dockers
and a golf shirt. All right,

1193
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,970
have a nice and pressed and clean
drive like a God damn maniac.

1194
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,060
Both you and your buddy. Even if
you live in Seattle, trade off,

1195
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:49,400
drive all the fuck way down there. Go
into somebody's house, get debriefed,

1196
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:50,841
walk in there,

1197
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:55,280
act like a gentleman and get
to see something that most
people never get to see.

1198
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,500
And what's great is
there all the souvenirs.

1199
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:59,330
They don't really sell
anything on the Internet.

1200
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:03,470
So that's why you buy a ton of shit is
because everybody asks you to get him

1201
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:06,050
some stuff. And even
if they don't, you got,

1202
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,240
you got great gifts for
the rest of the year.

1203
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:11,510
You know he can do all your
Christmas shopping right there.

1204
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:14,990
You get somebody a fucking
hat at the masters,

1205
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:17,900
they're going to be site because no one
else is going to have that fucking hat.

1206
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:20,900
And unless they went there.
So there you go.

1207
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:24,350
And that's the end of my
statement for this week. People,

1208
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:28,700
38 minutes statement actually
flew back this morning.

1209
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,580
And uh, I was, I was an idiot. I
got something in me like I was,

1210
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,540
I was a little more buzz than I thought
it was and I was really tired and I got

1211
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:41,150
three hours sleep. I'm fucking
embarrassed. I yelled at a cop

1212
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,000
when I drove out of the master's,
it was like,

1213
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:51,800
it was really late because we stuck
around to the end and it was like,

1214
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,150
it was,

1215
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:57,740
we sat through this fucking traffic
and all I had to do was make a left and

1216
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:01,550
drive like 40 yards down the road and I
could jump on the fucking highway and I

1217
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:04,910
was on my way and I was exhausted
and I wanted to go to sleep.

1218
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:06,050
And what ends up happening,

1219
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:10,250
it's one of those deals with a cop's
decide that everybody's going to go right.

1220
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,810
We're forcing everyone,
right?

1221
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:15,590
And I want to go left so I can go a
cunt hair down the street and get on the

1222
01:19:15,591 --> 01:19:18,910
highway. So I got my window down. I'm
like, I can't go left the guy or not.

1223
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,690
He could keep the, keep going.
So I'm driving and I'm not,

1224
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:24,880
I know what they're doing. So I get to
the third cop and I see a gas station.

1225
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:28,450
I'm just like, I just want
to get some gas. Can I get
some gas guys? Like keep it,

1226
01:19:28,451 --> 01:19:32,520
go and keep him moving. I just
went to one, I can't get some gas,

1227
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,120
just like that.

1228
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:40,330
Fucking screamed at him as I drove by
because he was on foot and cause I was a

1229
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:44,480
little drunk and then I drove
away and all of a sudden I was,

1230
01:19:44,481 --> 01:19:45,800
couldn't feel my legs going like,

1231
01:19:45,801 --> 01:19:50,780
did I just fucking do that as a Yankee
in the middle of fucking Georgia?

1232
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:53,900
Did I just yell at that guy clearly
though, was I just obnoxious?

1233
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,470
And then I was like, I don't give a
shit. And the first left I could make,

1234
01:19:57,471 --> 01:20:00,560
I made a left and then I banked
one of the most illegal fucking,

1235
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:04,100
you turns to hybrid three
point fucking turns.

1236
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:07,660
And there were two cops sitting
right there. And my buddy's like Doo,

1237
01:20:07,661 --> 01:20:11,520
Doo Doo Doo dote, which is
universal for, there's a cop,

1238
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:16,770
Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh. And I was like,
yeah, I don't give a fuck. And he's like,

1239
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:18,090
what's wrong with you?
And I'm Michael [inaudible].

1240
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,100
I'm a little buzzed and
I'm a control freak.

1241
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,940
Don't fucking tell me where I can't go.

1242
01:20:21,941 --> 01:20:24,060
I've been on that Goddamn
golf course every day.

1243
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:28,200
All I wanted to do is run out of the
bleachers on somebody approaching shot on

1244
01:20:28,201 --> 01:20:31,320
15 and do a fucking cannon ball
right into that little mini lake.

1245
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,760
Already had it planned out. It's going to
give my badge to my buddy and tell him,

1246
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:40,050
don't take a walk though. What do you
mean take? Just take a fucking walk.

1247
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:41,700
And he'd see it, my eyes
and be like, all right man.

1248
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,860
And he just grabbed my shit
and he'd just walk away.

1249
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:47,670
And then what I would do is I do a cannon
ball right into the fucking lake. Okay.

1250
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:50,220
And I would immediately
be a fucking legend,

1251
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,940
an absolute fucking legend on the,

1252
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:58,830
on jackass.com if there's something, you
know, I'd be right up there with fan man,

1253
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:03,300
that fucking kid at Yankee stadium who
jumped off into the, into the, the,

1254
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:07,620
the backstop netting.
I Dunno who else.

1255
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:10,620
That dude who ran out and grabbed the
football and got slammed down to the

1256
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:14,940
ground by the linebacker on Monday night
football. I'd be one of those guys.

1257
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:19,960
I'd be put on that fucking, you
know, whacked out sports or whatever.

1258
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,200
I would be on that shit forever.

1259
01:21:24,570 --> 01:21:27,900
And then when they asked me, when
they pulled me out of there, you know,

1260
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:32,730
and they went to grab my badge, I
wouldn't have it. Where's your badge?

1261
01:21:32,731 --> 01:21:36,600
I know it must be at the bottom
of the pond there. Thurston,

1262
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:40,680
why don't you take off your loafers and
roll up your slacks and go in there and

1263
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:43,410
try and find it.
What's the worst you're going to do to me?

1264
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:49,080
Prosecute me to the full
extent of the law. You know,

1265
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:52,110
they know every big judge in the state.
I'd probably still be in fucking prison,

1266
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:55,340
but I got to admit and I dunno.
So anyways,

1267
01:21:55,341 --> 01:21:58,470
so then I just drove the rest of the
fucking way home. I stopped at Arby's,

1268
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,260
went to bed at fucking 12 midnight,

1269
01:22:01,261 --> 01:22:04,860
had to get up at six 30 and had gone
on a fucking plane. I had a Muffin,

1270
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:08,070
I had an m and m's and there
was a baby crying the whole way.

1271
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:11,550
And I don't give a shit. I know I
never care when babies cry on planes,

1272
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,713
I don't give a fuck.

1273
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:16,200
But there was some square had cut in
front of me who kept turning around and

1274
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:18,330
looking at them, you know,
that was like, all right,

1275
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,740
that's the career woman who hates kids.
I see why she's looking at him.

1276
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,350
She didn't want to have kids.
So she's annoyed with their presence.

1277
01:22:25,351 --> 01:22:27,510
And then I see she has a
wedding ring and what's what's,

1278
01:22:27,511 --> 01:22:30,600
there's only one reason to get
married. They have kids. Okay.

1279
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:33,030
So I'm looking at her like she
must be the worst mother ever.

1280
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,130
Cause every time this kid cries,
she turns around,

1281
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:39,600
starts looking for a mother
shooting alert, shooting
her look, shaking our heads,

1282
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:43,990
and just want to be like, you know what?
It's a fucking baby. It's a fucking base.

1283
01:22:43,991 --> 01:22:48,100
She had a baby, man. It's a
fucking baby. It's unbelievable.

1284
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:51,660
When I hate when people do that shit, it's
like, how do you not understand? Like,

1285
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:57,030
you know, we're in a pressurized cabin.
That thing does the Bait, the thing,

1286
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:01,740
the baby does not a clear its ears.
It's a fucking baby. Stupid cunt.

1287
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:04,260
So at one point I fucking,

1288
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:09,261
she looked and I gave her such a dirty
look for fucking given the mother a dirty

1289
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:12,280
look that when her
fucking eyes met my eyes,

1290
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:17,110
she looked at me like surprised at first
and then realized that she was being a

1291
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:20,620
cunt. And then she tried to play it off
with this smile like yeah, isn't it cute?

1292
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:23,800
Isn't that cute? That the baby's crying
too late? I've already judged you.

1293
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:29,520
You're a horrible mother and you're
a horrible person. And that stands.

1294
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,300
This is the conclusion of my statement.

1295
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:34,930
43 minutes said that I am not
doing a podcast this week.

1296
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:39,930
I regret to inform all of you that due
to circumstances beyond your control,

1297
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,980
um,
our hosts this week,

1298
01:23:44,981 --> 01:23:49,981
Bill burr abused his body
to such a fucking level that
he had an inability to do

1299
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:54,080
a podcast this week and only
had an ability to, you know,
I should have done I in,

1300
01:23:54,081 --> 01:23:54,371
in,

1301
01:23:54,371 --> 01:23:58,150
in the spirit of the masters when I should
have done was I should have issued an

1302
01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:02,590
apology just like tiger woods
and droned on for 45 minutes.

1303
01:24:02,591 --> 01:24:06,430
Boring the shit out of you. Oh, wait
a minute. I think I already did that.

1304
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:11,170
I believe I already did that.
All right,

1305
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:14,620
that's the podcast for this week.
Once again,

1306
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,290
I'm so sorry that I couldn't
give you a podcast this week.

1307
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:22,240
I couldn't give you some laughs.
Um, I will become an hour fucking,

1308
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:26,170
I'll give you both barrels next week.
Speaking of which,

1309
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:30,350
I'm going to be at the funny
bone in a Newport, Kentucky, uh,

1310
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:34,900
right across the river from Cincinnati.
And I gotta be honest with you guys.

1311
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:38,620
I got to, I already have a new
killer hour. That's right. I said it,

1312
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:43,630
I said it all right. Maybe
it's not a killer hour.

1313
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:47,530
It's like 40 minutes out of the hour.
I already have 40 new fucking minutes.

1314
01:24:47,531 --> 01:24:52,510
How do you like that shit?
I just taped a special in December.

1315
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:53,651
All right.

1316
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:58,030
We're midway through April and I already
can run my fucking mouth for 40 minutes

1317
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,380
with some new shit provided them on.
If I'm off,

1318
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:04,330
I have eight new minutes.

1319
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,190
That's where my act, his act.
But I'm not going to lie to you.

1320
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:13,420
I talked about Tiger Woods for
like 11 minutes the other night.

1321
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:17,650
All of it's funny, crushing,
destroying. I was so sites,

1322
01:25:17,651 --> 01:25:19,000
but in the back of my head,
I'm like,

1323
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:22,900
you realize that now after
he plays the masters,

1324
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:27,730
uh, that, you know, I can only
tell that story for so long.

1325
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:31,720
It's basically mid May. It's going
to be an old story. It already is.

1326
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,360
I'm still talking about that
lady who got killed at seaworld.

1327
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:37,450
I'm going to give you a little preview
of what we'll be talking about.

1328
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:42,430
The white talking about my trip to
church and when, again, by the way,

1329
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:47,830
uh, what again? On Easter.
I went on Easter Sunday,

1330
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,980
you know, my girlfriend's
mom wanted to go to church.

1331
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:53,230
She didn't want to go by herself. So
I said, all right, I'll go with you.

1332
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:58,900
We all went little happy
family. I went there, sat there,

1333
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:03,040
bored shitless.
It was extra packs took

1334
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:07,560
to eat that piece of
cardboard at the end of it.

1335
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:11,340
And whatever other of offensive
thing you want me to say.

1336
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:14,720
Uh, I dunno, I literally
am like sitting here.

1337
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:19,070
I'm laying here right now and I have, I'm
like, my eyes are squinting. Like, uh,

1338
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:22,220
there's a doctor and he's like, you
know, like by fucked up my elbow.

1339
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:25,580
And he's like, tell me, tell me,
does this hurt? Does this yet? Yeah,

1340
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:26,423
you heard yet right there.

1341
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,970
I'm literally doing that right now as
I'm doing this fucking podcast. Um,

1342
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,480
I got nothing.
All right,

1343
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:38,920
I got nothing for you this week and I'm
the first one to tell it to you. And uh,

1344
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:40,660
oh, did I, you know what
I say actually did this,

1345
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:44,530
started this podcast like six fucking
times. I forget if I said this, but, uh,

1346
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,530
somebody sent me a really
nasty email yelling,

1347
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:51,520
cursing me out because they sent me an
email and I didn't answer their email.

1348
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:53,740
And he said,
because you didn't answer my email.

1349
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:58,280
I didn't go to see any of
your shows in Atlanta. And,

1350
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:02,120
uh, I don't know if I
already talked about this.

1351
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:06,750
I apologize if I didn't. Uh, sir, I
don't give a shit. All right. If you,

1352
01:27:06,751 --> 01:27:11,080
if you haven't learned anything for my
podcast is I really don't give a fuck.

1353
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,750
I don't give a fuck if you
listen to this or you don't.

1354
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:17,560
I don't give a fuck if you go to my
shows, but you don't, I don't give a fuck.

1355
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:22,960
You know, do I, do I not want people
to come to my shows? Of course I do.

1356
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:27,940
Do I not want people listen to my podcast?
Of course I don't. I want, fuck, I don't,

1357
01:27:27,941 --> 01:27:30,730
I ain't got, I got, I got messed
up there in those double negatives.

1358
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:34,300
I want people to come to my shows.
I want people to listen to my podcast,

1359
01:27:34,301 --> 01:27:39,250
but let me tell you some right now. Fuck.
Oh, I don't respond to fucking threats.

1360
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:42,490
Don't fucking threaten me or no fucking,
you know,

1361
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:47,491
try to put some sorta almond is bullshit
on how you want me to fucking behave

1362
01:27:47,591 --> 01:27:50,650
with your fucking email.
I don't give a fuck about email.

1363
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:54,580
I get a fucking hundreds of emails every
God Damn Week and if I don't get to

1364
01:27:54,581 --> 01:27:57,580
yours, I don't fucking get to
yours. So go fuck yourself.

1365
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,790
If you want to pout and not come
to my show, don't go to my show.

1366
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:03,310
I don't give a fuck.
You sound like a cunt anyways.

1367
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,880
You probably go to my show and then
fucking judge it. It'd be like, oh,

1368
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,590
the first eight minutes. We're
good. Did they do it for me?

1369
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:15,510
12 to 17 go fuck yourself.
All right,

1370
01:28:15,511 --> 01:28:18,810
why don't you go stick your head
through your fucking computer monitor.

1371
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:22,380
God knows you probably still
have one of those old ones,

1372
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:27,030
you know shaped like a fucking microwave.
Is that what you got?

1373
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:31,140
Is you work? Look how fast people
drive in this fucking street.

1374
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:34,740
I'm literally getting to that age,
yelling out the window at kids.

1375
01:28:34,741 --> 01:28:37,350
Stop driving like I did.
At your age.

1376
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:41,160
There's another good
character for a sketch,

1377
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:48,080
you know, crabby, honest,
old man, honest, crabby,

1378
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:48,914
old man.

1379
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:57,290
Stop treating me with the same disrespect
I had from my elders when I was at

1380
01:28:57,291 --> 01:29:01,900
your age. Um, or maybe not shit.

1381
01:29:01,901 --> 01:29:02,371
God knows.

1382
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:06,120
SNL could turn that into like it's 15
minutes sketch and then stretch it into an

1383
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:10,830
hour and 40 minute movie.
Um, all right, there we go.

1384
01:29:10,831 --> 01:29:12,840
I burned a bridge.
I burned a bridge there.

1385
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:17,490
Like I was going to get cast on
that at 41. Uh, maybe I could,

1386
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:22,510
it didn't feel harm again on old or what
I perceived to be old when he got on.

1387
01:29:22,561 --> 01:29:26,310
He was probably like 34 at the time, which
was ancient to me. And now at my age,

1388
01:29:26,311 --> 01:29:30,910
I would love to be, I would
love to be fucking 34 again, uh,

1389
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:34,820
to be that age. Um, you know, I remember,

1390
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:37,230
you know what was great about
when I was a fuck when I was 34,

1391
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,130
I could run like a fucking seven,
nine 40,

1392
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:45,450
when I was 30,
when I was 34.

1393
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:49,890
It was a very good year.
I fucking dog.

1394
01:29:49,891 --> 01:29:52,500
Just lick the bottom of my foot.
It's a goddamn freak.

1395
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:58,940
I didn't have a dog that shit on
the floor or needed to go outside.

1396
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,260
I did what I wanted.

1397
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:11,030
I went down water slides
when I was 34 what's up Cleo?

1398
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:16,380
How you doing?
You know site that wants to see you.

1399
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:20,610
You know it's like to see you
cause you were psyched to see me.

1400
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:24,690
You're always psyched to see me, aren't
you? You know my dog actually misses me.

1401
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:29,310
Comes into the bedroom at night and it
fucking looks around for me and then it

1402
01:30:29,311 --> 01:30:33,150
runs into my little office
area looking for me. Right.

1403
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:34,920
If I'm not around who you're
going to wrestle with.

1404
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:37,140
Let me see if I can get you to mode.

1405
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,090
You won't do it.
Will you know what you're,

1406
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:45,720
why you liked that fucking frog and
bugs bunny and beat by peak water back.

1407
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:50,430
Then all of a sudden I bring in somewhere.
Hey Cleo,

1408
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:55,650
let me see if I can get you to
how you want to go outside. Cleo,

1409
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:02,020
this is going to be worth it. People just
listen. Cleo. You want to go outside?

1410
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,000
Huh?
Cleo.

1411
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:14,550
Cleo. Okay. She's getting psyched to Cleo.

1412
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:24,480
Clio. Clio. I wonder to how,

1413
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:26,810

1414
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:30,743
you want to go side

1415
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,570
Cleo, but you fucking do it please. Clia.

1416
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,980
Clia. Ah, you fucking burned
in me right now. Cleo.

1417
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:56,160
Hey. Fuck it. Cleo

1418
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,630
on the west side.
Okay,

1419
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:10,300
Cleo. You know what? Go Fuck
Yourself. Jesus Christ. What
was that? Three minutes.

1420
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:14,470
Yup. Below it. Cleo. Why won't you,

1421
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:15,850
how for these people

1422
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:23,110
and in conclusion, uh, there
is no podcasts this week.
I regret to inform you.

1423
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:27,700
Don't come over now. Don't come
over now. You want some food?

1424
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:34,060
You want to go outside,
Cleo?

1425
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,680
Well, let me one more temp.
Yeah, you want to go outside?

1426
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,810
Hmm. Cleo. Yeah.

1427
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,500
Oh,
Jesus screen or this is like,

1428
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,710
you know what you mean right
now you have these like,

1429
01:32:48,711 --> 01:32:52,570
you know the hot chick that'll never
fuck you and she just keeps giving you a

1430
01:32:52,571 --> 01:32:56,440
glimmer of hope and to keep coming back.
You keep coming back,

1431
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:59,770
whatever. I still love you cleo. You know,

1432
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:03,100
even though he just made me look like
a fucking asshole, you really did.

1433
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:08,680
It was literally the Buler.
Anybody? Anybody. All right.

1434
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,370
That concludes my statement.
That's the statement I'm sticking by.

1435
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:16,420
It's all in the police report is tiger
woods would say, ah, there you go.

1436
01:33:16,421 --> 01:33:17,740
There's another thing you should do.

1437
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,590
Pick one of these fucking things to do
and if one of you guys ends up doing

1438
01:33:20,591 --> 01:33:23,230
something that I told you
to do and you enjoy it,

1439
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:26,020
please send me an email like a year
from now. If you go to the masters,

1440
01:33:26,021 --> 01:33:30,590
Lemmy fucking no. All right. Cause I
think I'm going to go again next year.

1441
01:33:30,591 --> 01:33:32,840
That's how much fucking fun I had.
Or go to England,

1442
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:37,670
do some shit to something for fuck sakes.
Alright, I'll talk to you next time.
