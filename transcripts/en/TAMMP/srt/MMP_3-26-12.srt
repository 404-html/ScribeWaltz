1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,840
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:08,841
It's the Monday morning
fucking podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,010
Monday, uh, March 26th. Um, I just
had the breakfast of champions.

4
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,230
People.
I had a fucking,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,430
I had an egg always g a G.
Hey lady.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,350
What you make Dag, take it easy.
I hate a fucking egg over easy.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,330
I had a week English muffin
sliced in half, so it's only one,

8
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,570
but it counts as two. And then I finished
it off with a slice of cheesecake.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,960
So I got salt and sugar pumping
through my fucking veins.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,821
In other words,

11
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:44,730
I am going to go like a madman for about
eight minutes and then I'm going to

12
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:48,630
crash me in. I don't feel
like doing it anymore, man.

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,120
Um, let's talk about, let's talk about
what else we going to talk about. Bill,

14
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:58,310
let's talk about your fucking life.
I got a Goddamn crow.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,260
This is three weeks in a row
with the fucking animals first.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,100
The squirrels last week. It was a
moth. This week we got it. We got it.

17
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:05,934
I got a CHRO.

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,330
I don't know if that built the fucking
nest far as I know crows don't have ness.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,200
Am I wrong here? As far as my, my, uh,

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,500
observance of birds to
crows or the drifters,

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,700
they just showed us like show up like
Clint Eastwood used to in those cowboy

22
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,070
movies and then all the
other birds fucking scatter.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,820
And then they sit there with that
little fucking hand rolled cigar

24
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,070
bandanna around their fucking burden neck.
Anyways,

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,760
I guess the same way nobody knew that
there was a mafia until Robert Kennedy

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,560
told everybody that there was a mob.
Um,

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,050
I finally discovered the crows actually
have never thought they just floated

28
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:51,090
around having one night
stands with sparrows,

29
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:55,500
but evidently they have a fucking nest
or this crow loves the tree right outside

30
00:01:55,501 --> 00:02:00,501
my window because every morning at
like six 30 now there's fucking crow.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,290
I don't know what it's doing.
I'm sound asleep. Right?
I'm getting my beauty sleep.

32
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,550
I'm a fucking ginger, right? My
face is gonna crack up unless it,

33
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:14,740
unless I make sure I get eight hours
dunk my face and lotion every day.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,660
But I don't do that look like
I was fishing for lobsters. Um,

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,740
so every morning this fucking
crow is outside my window.

36
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:25,614
Just gone.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,340
Like for fuck,
I want to throw,

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,000
I want to get up and it just
fucking throw my iPhone at it.

39
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:43,000
That's what I want to do.
But I'm so fucking tired I can't move.

40
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,030
So I just lay there and um,
I dreamed that I'm doing it,

41
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,050
that I walk up to the
window and I lifted it up.

42
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,330
Am I dream of wearing a wife beater?
You know,

43
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:56,290
cause anytime you're mad and you want
to yell out your window, you have to,

44
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,930
you have to have on a fucking wife beater.
And I just fucking,

45
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:03,931
I know how I stand back from the window
so I can get some velocity and I just

46
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,700
side on that thing right out and
I hit that fucking thing right.

47
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,900
And it's God damn beak,
you know, not a headshot.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,770
It can still walk away from
it every fucking morning.

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,923
Okay.

50
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,230
Of this morning. It didn't, it didn't.

51
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:27,900
But I had a add some company and
they were getting up at fucking, uh,

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,570
four 30 in the fucking morning cause
they had an early flight. And uh,

53
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,780
you know, it's funny. So they
got up and they said goodbye,

54
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,210
so we said goodbye. All right, thanks.
Thanks for visiting. We'll see you later.

55
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:45,020
Right. So they leave and right as they
start to go back asleep again, right,

56
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,170
right around when this fucking crows
going to start doing this. God Damn

57
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,620
like it's,

58
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,640
it's tied to something and it's slowly
being beaten with a fucking rubber hose.

59
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,420
Right.
The fucking bird makes no noise.

60
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,320
So Billy boy is just sleeping
away and what happens?

61
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:05,080
My fucking phone makes
a god goddamn noise.

62
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,340
And it was the people who stayed with us
texting me to let me know that they had

63
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:14,230
missed their flight, you know?
And I'm like, wow, that sucks.

64
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,620
Lax is horrible.
Send trying to go back to sleep.

65
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,040
And then right as I fall asleep again,
they send another text to be like, oh,

66
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,903
we made it.
Yeah.

67
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,510
Yeah.

68
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,500
You know that couldn't have waited til
9:00 AM you couldn't tell me about your

69
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,310
exciting little trip to
the fucking airport though.

70
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:34,970
Texting me every five seconds. Oh my God,
you should see the line down here. Stand.

71
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,290
Then I'm asleep and he goes boom. Right
my fucking ear. What does it do bill?

72
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,780
It goes blue.
I can't do the fucking noise.

73
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,670
What am I Michael Winslow go rent one of
the police academy movies and just say,

74
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,610
just fantasize how he would
have fucking done it. So,

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,770
oh, I know it saved the sugars. Fucking
hit me. The salt. I'm starting to crash.

76
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,310
Having you guys just felt my energy,
my energy started going down.

77
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,270
It's kind of like back in the day when
before iTunes when you actually bought

78
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:05,960
albums and you heard a song on the radio
and you fucking loved it and you were

79
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:09,320
about three tracks in right now and you
realize the song you heard on the radio

80
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:12,410
was the only good one.
That's what this podcast is going to be.

81
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:16,070
This podcast is going to
be like a Cinderella album.

82
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,330
You know? Speaking of that,
I have to download, shake me.

83
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,650
I heard that the other day when
I went to the fucking kings, uh,

84
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,720
Bruins, the kinks, Voca, the sugar is
killing me. The kings fucking Bruins

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,190
and that song came out shake.

86
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,670
Oh yeah.

87
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,730
I think that's all he says
for five minutes. Shake me.

88
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,290
Which I don't even understand what that
meant. I think it's somehow it has to be,

89
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,570
it's some sort of a sexual innuendo,

90
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,410
but I don't know what that means is he
liked her to walk up and rather than

91
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,470
shake his hand, just grab
his Dick. Hello. How are you?

92
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,500
I'll be the woman fucking you this
evening. Um, I dunno, but you know what?

93
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:04,010
I'm going to download it. I've been
downloading a lot of weird shit lately.

94
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,420
I downloaded that Bob Dylan song tangled
up in blue where he sings about every

95
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:15,800
woman he ever banged.
She was working in a fucking diner,

96
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:19,400
an hour dealing with my
hat. She said, son, it is,

97
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:23,510
and as big and I fucking said,
and I went down in the bud and

98
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,230
tangled up in blue. Right. Every
time you'd think it's fucking over.

99
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,110
Then I in a fucking girl named
Susan bound side of the road. Ooh.

100
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:40,380
She bent down to tie my shoes
and a blue fucking alone.

101
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,200
She wiped it off and looked at me.

102
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:46,490
Then why did you fucking do
dad 20 fucking minutes song,

103
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,810
you know, tangled and you sit there
and try to sing along with you guys.

104
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,430
Hey, you know, you just, you just
chime in the end. Every time.

105
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,370
Tangled up in blue begging
it. Bap Bap Purdue. Alright,

106
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm sorry that that last little dead.
He was brought to you by cheesecake.

107
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,400
Cheesecake.
The breakfast of champions.

108
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,500
I swear I'm going for in 2012 man tents.
That's what I want.

109
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,720
That's what the ladies are looking for,
you know,

110
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:17,840
and when I wear my wife beater and yell
at that car when there'll be copping

111
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,950
them ever. So shapely, you know, hey,

112
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:22,880
if you get man tests,

113
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:26,030
do you have a higher chance of
getting breast cancer as a male?

114
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Just started curiosity because I don't
think you can get breast cancer as a male

115
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:34,420
if you don't have man tits. It's like
getting cancer of the air, you know,

116
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,540
they don't exist. They're
not there. Right. Okay.

117
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,880
Who has no medical background.
All right. Moving on.

118
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,380
So I went to the fucking Bruins
game, right man. This, this guy, uh,

119
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,330
you know, uh, got me tickets, right? One
of the guys they play pick up hockey with.

120
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,210
Oh, by the way, pill, when
you play pick up hockey,

121
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,390
do you wear anything to protect your feet?
As a matter of fact,

122
00:07:56,391 --> 00:08:01,391
I know I've been wearing skate fenders
warm for the first time last week and an

123
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:05,670
actual fucking game. I skated around
in a public rink with them, you know,

124
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,860
and uh, as opposed to my
private rank that I have outback

125
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,040
fucking idiot. I'm an idiot.
I'm a fucking area. So, um,

126
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,550
I used them in a game and I took one
off the foot and I didn't even feel it.

127
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,120
And I was able to continue scaling out
there at the mediocre level that I play

128
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:23,960
that wonderful game.

129
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,460
Skate fenders.com everybody go
there and get yourself a pair.

130
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,050
Stop being a fucking pussy.

131
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,660
Stop being the person who doesn't want
to go down to the rank and be the first

132
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:33,770
guy wearing them a right.

133
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,270
I went to the blues kings game and
the Bruins a kings game this week.

134
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,980
And why can't you just say,

135
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:42,590
I went to the king's game when the back
to back where they play the blues and

136
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:46,550
the Bruins. I could have
edited that together a little
better. Don't you think? Um,

137
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,430
and I saw a lot of guys out
there wearing them. You know,

138
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,580
and if it's good enough for them,
why can't you wear,

139
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,770
you don't want to get made fun
of. How old are you? All right,

140
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,760
you're an accountant. You're not
making it into the NHL. Okay?

141
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,410
So go to escape fender.com. Type in
Bill Burr, all one word, all lowercase.

142
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,130
You get $5 off. Protect
your fate. You know,

143
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,630
how are you going to stand up when
you're 80 on your porch and be good,

144
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,820
right? If you've been
taken pucks, see afoot.

145
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,690
No fucking kids are going to take you
seriously if he can't get up off your

146
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:26,070
chair on the porch, all right? To go to
escape fetter.com get yourself a pair.

147
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,580
If you don't even play hockey, just put
them on your loafers, shuffle around,

148
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,500
shuffle around your kitchen,

149
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,440
and then say everything you
always wanted to say to your wife.

150
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,930
And when she goes to stomp on your foot,
you're not going to feel it.

151
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,070
And she's going to get bone
spurs. Okay? So anyway,

152
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:43,830
so I went to the king's Bruins game.
That was a commercial, by the way.

153
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,550
I went to the Bruins kings game and uh,

154
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,820
so one of the guys I play hockey with,

155
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,260
he woke me up with these tickets
and they have like a club.

156
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,150
This is how fucking La la is.
It was a club.

157
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,210
And in between periods,

158
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,740
like you sit down and immediately
everybody who sits down you, you have to,

159
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,371
you walk in,

160
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,790
they take your credit card and your
license just fucking walk with that Shit,

161
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,830
right? Then they got all these, these
uh, almost hot waitresses walking around,

162
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,640
you know what I mean?

163
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,200
You don't want almost hot is that means
your body is slamming and so is your

164
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:23,880
face except into a wall.

165
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,130
It wasn't even that she wasn't
good looking. She just was a cunt.

166
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,630
You know the way all beautiful women,
our account. Why cause it beautiful.

167
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,080
Not all of them, but most of them.
They got that fucking, I'm beautiful.

168
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,820
Everybody wants to bang me. I don't even
have to fucking try attitude. Right.

169
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,980
This fucking won't this Horman she
comes by once in the first period.

170
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,140
Okay. So I walk by, I'm trying
to understand, I'm showing
a little empathy. I said,

171
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:59,970
hey sweetheart, I had to go find her
sweetheart with your midriff showing,

172
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,530
you know, listen, I know you're busy,
but if you get a chance, can you,

173
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,730
can you swing by again? And she gives me
this fucking look like I just asked her,

174
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,210
I dunno to help me move or something.
Hey, can you help me hang this picture?

175
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:16,560
Like I said, that I didn't, I
just said, hey, if you don't mind,

176
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:20,970
could you do your fucking job more
than once in the first peer in the next

177
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,480
period. But was funny. It
was in between periods. Um,

178
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,420
though it turns into like a dance club.

179
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,340
Like they just start playing like all
this fucking techno music. Alright.

180
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,250
And or whatever the fuck that they
play in all that, all that crap. It's,

181
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:36,140
so they basically take every
song and then they put that

182
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,710
beat underneath it and I'm
sitting behind me was um,

183
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,570
what do you call a group of gay
guys? Like I know like a, uh,

184
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,680
like a bunch of cows is a herd and he
gay listeners out there any twinkle toes

185
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,980
can tell me,
what do you call,

186
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:01,981
just a pack of gay guys that look like
a fucking j crew ad just sitting behind

187
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:06,070
us.
And one of them was lance bass lads bass.

188
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:11,071
Was that the game looking younger
than he did when he was in,

189
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,160
in sync?
So this is my question.

190
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,170
When is somebody in
the television, uh, um,

191
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,130
or whatever in the beauty products saying,
you know,

192
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:28,630
they have like now they have like the
UFC workout, they got the fucking, uh,

193
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,840
the grapefruit 45 die there. He always
got some fucking thing. What is,

194
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:36,670
somebody's got to figure out what gay
guys do. So they don't age. You know,

195
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,380
Dick Clark somehow figured it out.

196
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,303
You know

197
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,270
it's guy and you like, cause
I was looking at, I've gone,

198
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:47,540
that's not lance bass personal is
what's going. That's Lance Bass. I go,

199
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,120
no it isn't.
He still looks like he's fucking 22.

200
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:54,200
That kid's got to be like 50 by now. And
he wasn't, he was just you sitting there.

201
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,680
I still don't think it was him.
I thought it was like Wayne Gretzky Sun.

202
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,510
That's what it looked like.
You know you are Jesus Christ.

203
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,790
Wayne Gretzky looks like a straight lance
bass. I never realized that. See that.

204
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:13,110
That's why I do this podcast people.
I do it. So I learned something. Um,

205
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,700
Oh God, what do I got left here?
I just, I, you know something,

206
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,480
I haven't been on stage in
like three fucking weeks and
it's really affecting me.

207
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:24,740
Look at me. I'm running out of, I
don't have any comedy cardio anymore.

208
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,620
I'm 13 minutes, 25 seconds in and
I'm ready for this thing to be done.

209
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,690
It's like I came out and I got fucking
shelled and the first two winnings,

210
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,970
you know, and the managers
walking out of the dugout and I'm,

211
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,180
I'm walking towards him.

212
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:41,880
You know that that's when you know you
suck is you don't even wait until the

213
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:44,130
manager gets there.
You start walking off the mound,

214
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:48,330
you meet him at the first baseline, handed
the ball. Yay. Got It today. All right,

215
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:50,380
I'm going to get my shoulder rub down in,
uh,

216
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,460
I don't know what I'm gonna have to rub
one out cause there's no way I'm getting

217
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:58,110
pussy after that performance. Um,
you guys have the MLB channel.

218
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,281
That's one of the great things.

219
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:04,281
They actually haven't the NC 17 MLB late
night and that way they make up all the

220
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:07,800
players. You get to hear everything. I
actually heard a guy in the twin say what?

221
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:12,240
I just said, I just want to get
busted for a plagiarism. You know,

222
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:13,260
that's one of my ideas.

223
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,290
That's why I can never get a t a TV show
is my ideas never seem to fit into the

224
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:21,180
room. Oh, Bill, you just such a fucking
rebel, aren't you? I think I am.

225
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:23,910
I think I'm pat myself on the back
here now. You know where it is.

226
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:24,990
I have great ideas,

227
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:29,991
but they all are not conducive
to a mass audience and children.

228
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,240
I think that that's what the problem is.
So if anybody can help me with this one,

229
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,500
I have an idea.

230
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,320
Okay.

231
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,460
Uh, for a new level of
watching sports, it's NFL,

232
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,650
NC 17 MLB,
NC 17 NBA,

233
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:53,300
NC 17, and you guessed
it, a worldwide tennis,

234
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,220
no, NHL NC 17. And basically
you just Mike Up. Everybody.

235
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,440
Okay.
It's for adults only.

236
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,490
And rather than hearing the
people commentate the game,
you actually just people,

237
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,330
you just hear him cursing each other
out as we go down the fucking court.

238
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,470
Skate down the ice. You
fucking cock suck out. Right.

239
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,560
That's what I want to hear.
I wanna hear that shit.

240
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,810
Like when a manager goes up
and just be like, you know,

241
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:19,850
do you realize that you're supposed
to be throwing strikes here?

242
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,870
Well this is like the third fucking
start in a row. You tubby shit out,

243
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:28,670
but you do some sit ups. I know
CC's fat, but it works for him.

244
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:33,020
It's not working for you.
Get the fuck Outta here. Ah,

245
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,700
Jesus Christ.
Did we get any more Dominican's left?

246
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,340
These fucking white
guys can't pitch anymore

247
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,150
and that'd be great.

248
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,140
Or like with two players in the same
team really fucking get into it.

249
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,050
That will be great. But you know, it would
suck, would be the, uh, the reporters.

250
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,410
Cause then the reporters would hear all
of it and they'd have even more bullshit

251
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,130
soap opera crap to write about.
You know,

252
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,190
cause I don't want to,
I know,

253
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,740
I just want to listen to him shooting
the shit and trashing each other.

254
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,760
And uh, then afterwards I don't need them
to be like, why did you call Tom Brady?

255
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:12,200
You're fucking adware and dose.
Like, I don't need to know why.

256
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,330
I don't care. I just want to hear it,
you know? I mean, we'll fucking times,

257
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:21,110
cause I listened to these commentators
don't tell you up paying manning I got to

258
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:24,980
be taken. Is that ere going to be
too thin for my big fucking head?

259
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,830
Well, my head move faster
in the thin atmosphere. Um,

260
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,190
speaking of which, is herm Edwards doing
a parody of an ESPN analysts or is it,

261
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:40,340
is he really, you know, are they
putting something in his drink?

262
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't understand that guy. That's a guy
who played the game for over 20 years.

263
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:48,560
He coached it for like fucking 10,
15. It doesn't have anything to say

264
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,850
is,
is he somehow related to flavor?

265
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:55,520
Flave I don't understand what that
guy is doing on their channel.

266
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,250
He starts like really slow and then out
of nowhere he just yells and then looks

267
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:02,084
at the other guy,

268
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,760
a the patriots to play in the cults today.
What do you think Khurram Edwards?

269
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:08,541
Well,
I tell you,

270
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:12,320
you got two guys on either side of the
ball that really know how to throw a

271
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,790
raptor. I'm going to be about Blah
Blah and he fuck it. Looks off.

272
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,050
What the fuck just happened? It's
almost like he's gonna, he's,

273
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:23,000
he's about ready to have some sort of
epileptic fit and he's trying to get his

274
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,990
fucking sentence out before his eyes
rolled back and he falls off that share

275
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:30,350
that, you know, they got at
staples, even if it is ESPN,

276
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,480
those corporate concert
we're always trying to cut.

277
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,420
They're always trying to cut corners,
you know.

278
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,300
All right bill. That went nowhere and it
just came to a fucking screeching halt.

279
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,700
I brought my car over to get it fixed
today cause I was parked at a meter and

280
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:50,400
somebody somehow, I don't know, they
didn't side swipe, they didn't t bone it.

281
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,140
It's almost like they just came in at
a 45 degree angle and said I hate that

282
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,130
front quarter panel.

283
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,490
And they just slammed into it and a right
at the last second when they thought

284
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:02,490
they were going to drive it into my poor
excuse for an engine block on that car.

285
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:06,930
They just cut the wheel. Um, I don't know
if it was a three point turn gone wrong.

286
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,831
I don't know.

287
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:11,700
Somebody should have done a three point
turn and tried to do a one point Youi I

288
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,950
have no idea how the fuck could
have happened, but I brought,

289
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:18,951
I just brought it over there to some guy
named rusty who's fucking breath smell

290
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:23,220
like cigarettes.
He smoked in 1972

291
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,140
and then I walked over to fucking, uh,
the rental car, place one over to ava.

292
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,030
I wore red fucking blazer for hoping
that will get me a discount and

293
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,330
okay.

294
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,850
I come walking out to the parking
lot. They go like, okay, miss you bro.

295
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,930
You chose a mid sized car.
We have a fucking whatever the fuck.

296
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:46,350
It wasn't a long day. I don't know what
cards they were even called anymore.

297
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:49,110
Right with,
would that be to your liking?

298
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:52,220
And I'm looking at this blue
space ship and I'm like, uh,

299
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,280
what else do you got actually sure.
That's all we have in the midst.

300
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,470
Then why did you just say is that to my
liking? You will hope it. I'd be local.

301
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:03,630
Yeah. Yeah it is. And then
you could just continue.

302
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,030
I just called your bluff their
world series at [inaudible].

303
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,340
What else you got while we can I point
here, you'd have to upgrade you an SUV.

304
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,740
So I'm looking at this
fucking car headlights and
brake lights wrap all the way

305
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:20,250
around like those Lance Armstrong glasses,
you know,

306
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,630
it's Blue Cube and uh,

307
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,800
and I'm looking on the back and I'm like,
is it a Honda? Is that what that age is?

308
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,770
It's sort of a fucked up looking at age.
Janetta was a Hyundai.

309
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,260
I'm driving a Hyundai people and which
from a Prius to a Hyundai, you know,

310
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,550
and uh, my balls of completely
pulled up inside my body,

311
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,190
you know, Hyundai really
ripped off Honda's h you know,

312
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,480
they kind of turn it to the side a
little bit to full old guys like me,

313
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,690
you know, I don't fucking know
fucking girls. I get winded,

314
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,700
I can dry heave. Um, let's,

315
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,540
let's, let's, let's go into the, uh,
the letters for this week. People. I,

316
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,780
I really felt like this podcast was going
to be great and I had all this shit to

317
00:20:08,781 --> 00:20:13,010
talk about and now I'm just feeling like
I've run out of things to stay and it's

318
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,220
scaring me. Anti car. Hey Bill,

319
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
what are the drawbacks
of having an antique car?

320
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,400
I've always wanted a a 55 Chevy Bel Air.

321
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,150
And hearing you talk about your truck
has made me realize I should do it while

322
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:29,030
I'm still young. Abso-Fucking-Lutely
I got to tell you right now,

323
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:32,380
there is no drawback to having
an antique car. All right?

324
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,650
If you just mentally except a few things,

325
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,010
a, it's fucking old. B,

326
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,370
you're going to have to do
some things to it and see.

327
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,400
You're going to feel like 1 million bucks
when you drive down the street. Okay?

328
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,040
There's a tradeoff for
everything. All right?

329
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,750
And um,

330
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,530
you definitely want to do it while you
still young because you know you're going

331
00:20:57,531 --> 00:21:00,090
to get married,
you can have kids and you know,

332
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,750
your wife's going to be thinking
about the kids going, is that safe?

333
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,940
I don't think it's safe.
You know that you're going to hear it,

334
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,130
you know, through your mail
ears. All you're going to
hear is, are you having fun?

335
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,060
I don't want you to have fun.
I want your life to be miserable.

336
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,300
And then you've got a call or something
horrific name in front of your fucking

337
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:25,890
kids and then that's going to be it,
you know, and then you'll have your car,

338
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:30,270
you'll be fucking living in
it. Um, look, I, I, there's,

339
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:33,030
you know what the drawback is?
It depends on what you buy.

340
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:35,490
If you buy something really like a,

341
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,020
okay.

342
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,441
I dunno,

343
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:41,610
like rare that a lot of people don't
have the drawback is trying to get parts.

344
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:43,800
If you buy it like a Mustang or Camaro,

345
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,270
there's evidently there's parts
for days on those kinds of cars.

346
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,960
And I also would think a Chevy bel air
that's like, you're buying a classic,

347
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,250
like a classic of the
classics. So, you know,

348
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,210
I mean I even think like a Bel aire is
one of those cars that you can actually,

349
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:04,860
if you have like 300 grand, if they'll
just make you a brand new one. You know?

350
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:08,700
Cause I know you can do that with like
a stick of fucking 68 Camaro somewhere

351
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:11,850
online. I saw that they'll just
build you one, a brand new one.

352
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:16,500
It costs like $170,000 for
some stupid fucking reason.

353
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,230
Um,
it costs all that money.

354
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,740
Okay.

355
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,210
You know,
which I kind of look at that.

356
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:25,440
That's like cds and when they came out
and they was 17 bucks and eventually

357
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:27,880
you're going to come down, they don't, um,

358
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,430
yeah,

359
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,510
to my laptop is fucked. I have to buy a
new one. It's like all it's filled up.

360
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,200
Okay.

361
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,950
Why I'm getting that little pinwheel.
Why is it still doing that enough already?

362
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,393
Okay.

363
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,730
Um,
so no,

364
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:45,880
there is no drawback to have an antique
car unless you just buy a complete hunk

365
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,660
of shit that had a,
uh,

366
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,670
a major accident and the
guy's not honest about it.

367
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,510
And then you got yourself a fucking lemon.
That would be the drawbacks.

368
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:59,511
So what I would do is find a friend
of yours who's a fucking gearhead and

369
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:04,270
they'll help you out. You know,
like I, that's what I did with mine.

370
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,250
And,
um,

371
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,590
once I got the okay from the dude and
he said it was a solid vehicle than a,

372
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,250
I went ahead and I got it. Yeah, no,

373
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,760
I was just thinking the other day I was
actually took it out on the highway man

374
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:23,150
and whoever the fuck had it before me,
really baby Dick. I'm the fourth owner.

375
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:27,140
But the first two owners
had it from 68 to 2009.

376
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:30,620
So I think that was a father son than
somebody else bought it and the recession

377
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:33,110
hit and they had to get rid of it.
But it drives,

378
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:37,400
like they change the oil every 3000 miles,
which is a,

379
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:42,380
a is a huge thing. So, um, I dunno what
the fuck, what is this? The speed channel?

380
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,050
Hey, bill baseball. Are we in for good
baseball season? Uh, I have no idea.

381
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,450
It seems as if somebody says,

382
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:53,450
it seems as if the past few years
have been terrible seasons with the

383
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:56,300
expectation, with the exception
of a few good playoff series,

384
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,310
though I'm sure they wouldn't have been
as exciting without the exaggerated

385
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:06,260
rivalries since when is a cubs
Padres series been monumental?

386
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,670
Maybe it's just me.

387
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,870
I think the last time a cubs pod race
season was Ma us series was monumental.

388
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:16,790
Might have been the early
eighties Tony Gwynn, Leon Durham,

389
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,840
Bill Buck now, um, you know,

390
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,480
somebody said they brought up bill
Buckner to me the other day and they would

391
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:26,300
just say, yeah, yeah, I saw this
whole thing, how we had to move.

392
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,670
He had to leave Boston after that and
just like, I just don't understand that.

393
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:35,370
The shock of that. Yeah.
Yeah. You have to leave. Yeah.

394
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,910
You fucked up a world series
that people at that point,

395
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,940
he'd been waiting 70 something years and
you'll let it roll through your legs.

396
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,010
Gee,
did you have a difficult time?

397
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,270
Okay.

398
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,180
Abdalla yelling at his kids too.
Yeah. Yeah. I would assume that.

399
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,700
I would assume that that was, that's
what would happen. You've been to a game,

400
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,550
you hear the shit that people yell.
You hear the stuff that people say,

401
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,380
what do you think you're special.
I don't fucking, I don't, you know,

402
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:04,340
I'm not saying it's right by just,
I don't understand the shock.

403
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,400
That's like after nine 11 when Arabs
were complaining that they were getting

404
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,560
harassed at the airport.
Yeah. Yeah. That's going to,

405
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,570
I would think that that would happen the
same way as if fucking 20 redheads went

406
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:18,080
out and did some fucked up shit.

407
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:22,010
I would expect to be getting some looks
the next day. I'm not saying it's right,

408
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,360
I don't condone it,

409
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,040
but I wouldn't sit there dumbfounded
going to move to Ireland and get with all

410
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,620
the other fucking redheaded cons.
You know,

411
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:33,020
cause everyone was staring
at me and Connecticut.

412
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,050
I just fucking blows my mind every
time they bring up shit like that.

413
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,210
Like that,
that fucking kid there in Chicago.

414
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,760
I mean a whole sad sack story about that
fucking kid who reached out and touched

415
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:54,020
the ball that was fucking in play
or they had a shot at, you know,

416
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,400
you only thing that confuses me about
that story is why they didn't hunt down

417
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:02,210
the other five fucking cunts around them
who were also reaching up for the ball.

418
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,390
That's the only way I will defend
that guy. But other than that,

419
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,310
you know when you,

420
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:12,311
when you touch a ball that's playable
and one of the athletes points that you

421
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,870
like, what the fuck you got to?
Why would you still sit there?

422
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,590
You immediately,
you've got to get the fuck out of there.

423
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,140
Now I'm not saying that you should go
on the radio and out the guy and say who

424
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:31,340
the fuck he is.
What I'm saying is my ex,

425
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,700
my expectation for human behavior
in a and a crowd is very,

426
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:41,640
very low. You know, I mean, come on.

427
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,240
How many people fucking have kids and
you want to take him to a game and then

428
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:48,210
you think about the last time you went to
a game, you're like, hey, you know what?

429
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,500
I'll wait till the kids a little bit
older alum of let's try to extend his

430
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:55,890
fucking childhood a little bit.
Okay. People are assholes, you know,

431
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,050
that's why like,
I dunno,

432
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,530
I've been all over the map politically,
but it's why like, you know,

433
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,290
certain ways of looking at shit,
like when people talk about guns land,

434
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,080
let's just make them,
well,

435
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,460
let's just make them illegal and
then nobody will have them. You know,

436
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,370
like that's sort of like
thought process is you're,

437
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:22,371
you're acting as though the world is a
utopia and that there's not morons and

438
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,510
that there's not, uh, people who say,
I don't give a fuck what the rules are.

439
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:30,750
You're totally not even taking
into consideration paths,

440
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,820
which is why that new fucking
thing that Obama signed,

441
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:39,510
that whole defense package where now they
can just arrest people without a trial

442
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:42,060
j and put you in jail forever with,

443
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,940
without a trial because they just
think you're a fucking terrorist.

444
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,030
You can't give people that level of power.

445
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,410
I'm a fucking moron. And I know
you can't do that. Historically,

446
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,380
no one has ever handled
that level of power. Well,

447
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,370
anybody here want to go live in China now
we out there practicing your nunchucks

448
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,300
wearing your wooden slippers and all
of a sudden a van pulls up and you

449
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:06,660
disappear and that's it forever. You
want to live there? Of course you don't.

450
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,360
You want to live here where they can't
fucking do it. Well, they can do it now.

451
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,130
You know? They just put in a fucking
order for a bunch of black fans.

452
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,450
That's what I heard. According to Holy
shit.com that's what's going down.

453
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,840
I don't understand why stuff at that
level that affects citizens to that level.

454
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,660
Why we don't get to vote on it.

455
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,470
Do you think it's because we'd
say, Hey, you know what? Fuck that.

456
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,920
Do you want to stand like
that is just a jump off point.

457
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:40,260
Do you think like that's just how it's
going to swell zone terrorist dinner.

458
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,580
You ain't got to fuck bro. You think
it's just going to stop with that.

459
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,130
That's not how you take away freedom.

460
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:49,430
You don't just fucking do it all at
one fail swoop. It's incremental.

461
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,580
It's just like when you're dating some
fucking woman and you're not paying

462
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:55,880
attention and she just gradually, every
day takes another foot of real estate.

463
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,950
Next thing you know you're
in goal line d going,

464
00:28:57,951 --> 00:29:02,630
how the fuck did I end up in
this situation? We started
at the 50 little push,

465
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:05,570
a little poll, right? Everything was
fine. The casino Europe against the Golan,

466
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,180
the you think that they're just going
to keep it with the terrorist thing,

467
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:09,700
you know?

468
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,460
You know they'll wait for a whole nother
generation of babies to be born and

469
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,790
they always grew up with government having
that level of power and then they had

470
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,910
something else to it. Then they
had something else. Then that's it.

471
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,090
You can't have,
okay,

472
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,160
if tiger woods can't handle the
level of free pussy on a golf tour,

473
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:33,610
how the fuck is our government going
to handle a new defense package,

474
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:39,850
which basically gave them a mute button
when you love that,

475
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,350
how would handle that if
you had that power, do you,

476
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,390
how long before you just
started abusing that?

477
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:51,060
If you could just hit mute on anybody
who ever disagreed with you and it just,

478
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,960
and you could have them whisked away.

479
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,550
I mean that is just sociopath's wet dream.

480
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,940
That's what that is. That is a
fucking mute button, Mr Style.

481
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:10,510
And don't you think that's it? He hit
mute. You're done. You're gone. See Ya.

482
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,840
I think,
I think it's fucking insane and I'm,

483
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,180
the only thing that I get out of it is
that I feel like I was proven correct

484
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,090
that I don't think it
matters at that level.

485
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:29,620
Whether you vote Democrat or Republican
Obama, the first black president ever,

486
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,540
you would think this
would be the most liberal

487
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,100
a politician in the
history of this country

488
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,910
because of his background. You would
think that he signed off on that shit.

489
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,360
Yeah.

490
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,550
All right. I'm telling you, I don't know
what happens when you become president,

491
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:51,551
but I think they let you peek just
enough behind the curtain and there was a

492
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:54,860
fucking agenda that we are moving towards.
Cause it does.

493
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,470
I don't think it fucking matters.
I really don't,

494
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,800
which is why I always
vote for the Ralph Nader.

495
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,910
The fucking Ron Paul, all those guys that
all those fucking idiots go, oh gosh,

496
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:12,890
you did that. You've ruined
the election. Really? Did I?

497
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,320
Okay.

498
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,020
I feel like those guys wouldn't
have signed shit like that.

499
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:23,040
I feel like their track record shows that
they would not sign shit like that. I,

500
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,850
I dunno,
I have no,

501
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,430
I imagine I'm going to get
a ton of fucking emails I'm
on with somebody who was

502
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:32,930
yelling at me one time saying that
because I voted for Ralph Nader in 2000.

503
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:34,550
That's why George W.
Bush won.

504
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,840
And they were just going on and on
and on about it. And I was like, dude,

505
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:43,670
I live in New York. Al
Gore won my state. Okay,

506
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,260
get a stand that, so your whole fucking
theory right now is out the window.

507
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,730
I voted for Ralph Nader in New York
and Al Gore still won the state.

508
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,140
So go fuck yourself. What
I'm trying to do, uh,

509
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,990
Mister fucking red and blue tie here,

510
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,130
I'm trying to fucking encourage
more people like that to vote.

511
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:07,640
So mission accomplished. That's what I'm
trying to fuck. You have to vote to run.

512
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,863
You know

513
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,490
uncorruptible how far can you get if
you're uncorruptible I would say that you

514
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,200
can get to the uh,

515
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,593
okay.

516
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,810
Whatever level politics is when you
decide whether or not they should put a

517
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:29,770
gazebo in the center of town. I think
beat. Once you get beyond that, you got,

518
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,110
you gotta be a little dirty.
Right.

519
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,300
I love talking about this shit cause
it just stirs people up, you know?

520
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,591
Oh you know,

521
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:41,590
maybe you should all read a little
before the next time you fucking own.

522
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:47,270
Really. What are you reading? What
do you written? What they give you?

523
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,830
Is that what you read and fuck head.

524
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,010
Why you acting like you have clearance
to the bottom floors are the fucking

525
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,070
Pentagon. You're guessing?
Just like I am. All right,

526
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,740
Mr informed I read the pamphlet.
I know.

527
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:01,190
Buy a fucking word of it.

528
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,660
You know you can use coca cola
to take rust off of metal.

529
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,290
You can use it for that.
You know,

530
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,130
you understand that yet they're
still able to sell it to us.

531
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:16,090
Like it's refreshing.

532
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,900
I don't know what that point meant either.
I thought I had a point there.

533
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,570
Fuck you. I'm full of sugar and
salt. Them crashing right now.

534
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,090
Crashing and burning. All right, let's
get him on to some more shit here. Uh Oh,

535
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:34,280
I have bill. We had for a good baseball
season. I don't, I have no idea.

536
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,860
All I know is I am not what the, come
on man. Don't fucking do this to me.

537
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:44,780
You fucking cunt. I can't scroll down
because I'm getting the pinwheel.

538
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,050
Oh Krista, it's time for a
commercial. Everybody. amazon.com.

539
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,520
Do you like this podcast? No. Well
then fucking listen to another one

540
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,700
who's left. All right. You guys
liked this podcast. Well, thank you.

541
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,170
I appreciate it. Um, if you would like to
donate to this podcast, it's very easy.

542
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:11,120
All you gotta do is next time you think
about buying something on amazon.com

543
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,520
rather than going directly to amazon.com,

544
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:17,810
go to [inaudible] dot com click on the
podcast page and on the right hand side

545
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,700
you're going to see the Amazon banner,
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, right, Amazon.

546
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,450
There was the whalers goal
song, the Amazon, a banner.

547
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,530
You Click on that and then just
go buy something. All right?

548
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:34,010
It doesn't change the price. You don't
have to put in any passwords, nothing.

549
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:37,970
Just go to amazon.com through
my website on the podcast page.

550
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:39,560
You Click on the banner,
you buy something,

551
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,280
they'll kick me back a percentage and
10% of that will go to the wounded

552
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:47,900
warriors project. So with you going
out and buying yourself a new Flowbee,

553
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,270
maybe a pen and pencil set,

554
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,600
maybe you get yourself a mountain bike
because you decided you're finally going

555
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:57,260
to get yourself in shape, right? And
rather than just going for a walk,

556
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,160
you feel you need to punish
your body cause you grew up
in the era of Ken Patera,

557
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,940
right? Whatever you're going to do
just now, when you buy that thing,

558
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:08,120
a little bit of money goes to the Monday
morning podcast and 10% of that money

559
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,710
goes to help the troops. All right?
Killed two birds with one stone.

560
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,640
And you could walk down the street and
say, you know what? I am a good person.

561
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,020
So there you go. All right, let's
try and find where these fucking

562
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,440
come on. Where the hell of the
questions here. And so my question, um,

563
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,280
all right. Oh, this is a
question about Dave Grohl. Bill,

564
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,680
I love the podcast. I wanted to see if
you would go on a rant on my behalf. Um,

565
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:42,060
first I would like to start up by saying
that I'm a recording engineer and you

566
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:46,350
being a drummer should be
upset by this to, okay.

567
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,370
He's already dragging me.
And uh,

568
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,840
during Dave Grohl Grammy
Acceptance Speech,

569
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:56,870
he said that their new album was special
because they recorded it in his garage

570
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:59,770
with a couple of microphones.
Uh,

571
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,430
most people would hear that
and think that's pretty cool.

572
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,320
But this really pisses me off.

573
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,940
At what point does a four point $5
million recording studio stop being,

574
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,030
uh, being a garage? I mean,

575
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,850
it may say it's a garage
on the blueprints,

576
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,230
but it's not like their drummer is getting
his sticks caught in a fishnet. Also,

577
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:22,500
I attached a photo of the drum set
that they use during the recording.

578
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:25,680
I counted 13 microphones.
That's a lot more than a couple.

579
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,270
If it pisses you off at all.

580
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:30,840
I would love to hear your thoughts
about it on the podcast. Well look,

581
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,250
I think what he was really doing
was he was going off on auto tune.

582
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,870
So in a roundabout way he,
he's helping you out, isn't he?

583
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,040
Cause he did do it on a student
in a, in a, in a studio.

584
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,750
I think it was more ethnic.
It was making fun of a auto too,

585
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,650
wasn't he? And I'm really
trying to give you an example.

586
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,220
One of those umbrella
Ella Ella a that shit.

587
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,660
Right? Wasn't he just kind of making
fun of that? He did do it in his garage,

588
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:06,810
surf. At the end of the day,
if they took those drums out,

589
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:11,670
he could put one of his 47 cars in there.
So technically it is still a garage.

590
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,930
He should not have said a couple of
microphones if you want to get conti.

591
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:19,920
All right. But you know what? I bet
he had an engineer in there, you know,

592
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:24,360
I bet somebody's got some work out
of that. I think he's on your team.

593
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,680
You know,
I'm sorry

594
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,060
you went to the wrong guy in this one.
Being a drummer,

595
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,560
Dave Grohl would basically have to be
sacrificing babies before I ever gave them

596
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:38,030
any shit because uh,

597
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,660
I have a fan boy crush on him so I can't
really trash them because in my twisted

598
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,870
fucking narcissistic world,

599
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:52,070
I think I actually have a chance of
meeting him and maybe playing drums on one

600
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:56,660
track on his next album. That's,
that's the lofty area my ego lives in.

601
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,600
You know what I should
do one of these weeks,

602
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:03,200
I should actually play drums for you
guys or maybe guitar and you can hear a

603
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:06,440
fucking awful I am and then he can trash
me and feel better about yourselves.

604
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,843
Isn't that fun?

605
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,750
Does that make you feel good to watch
somebody attempt something and then

606
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:14,750
completely fail and then
you get that, that, that,

607
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,640
that warm feeling in
your chest we you like,

608
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:18,320
see that's what happens when you try.

609
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,110
That's what happens when
you go after your dreams.

610
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,710
I knew I was right by choosing this job
that was safe rather than fulfilling.

611
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,590
Isn't that what you do
fucking cunts? First of all,

612
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,700
Mr Engineer,

613
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,070
you are in a situation now where you could
build your own fucking can't you with

614
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,570
like a laptop and a Frisbee.

615
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,130
Why don't you start recording all these
up and coming bands gets your foot in

616
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:45,990
the fucking door and
then as as they rise up,

617
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,130
doe maybe they'll take you with them.

618
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,190
I think there's an unbelievable fucking
opportunity here right now for artists

619
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,560
to take control of their fucking careers
and not have to have these cons taken

620
00:38:57,561 --> 00:39:02,160
all your money, all that fucking behind
the music, shit, all these things.

621
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:04,140
You work hard,
you recorded a special,

622
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,720
you get in business with
somebody and then you know,

623
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,280
okay,

624
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,920
I'm fucking,
I'm waiting for money right now.

625
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,900
People buy DVDs and I had some
out. Doesn't get to me. Oh, we had,

626
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,680
we had a hundred grand in
whiteout expenses. Sorry Bill.

627
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,910
Sorry. No money for you. We're
keeping it all ourselves.

628
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,300
Then eventually we go out of
business and you're chasing a ghost.

629
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,840
We all take a bonus out of the money
that we owed you and a bunch of other

630
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:34,260
fucking comedians we take off and
then you're suing the corporation,

631
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:37,770
which is not a person and nobody works
here anymore. So well good luck to you.

632
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,370
I understand what you're
saying sir. I understand. Okay,

633
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:43,260
let me give day grove a
little bit of shit he made.

634
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,880
Really did make it sound like,
hey man,

635
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:48,800
we just go like a bag of weed and cleared
out the rakes in the fucking wheel

636
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:49,110
barrow.

637
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:53,970
We made like an album man. And like
that's all you really need to do man.

638
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:58,350
Because like it's all about the music
and like if you really believe in it,

639
00:39:58,351 --> 00:40:01,990
people can like feel it man. You
know what I'm saying? I know he

640
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,570
did do that.
It did do that.

641
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:08,080
But at the end of the day he did
record it at his house. You know,

642
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,900
he should've said, I recorded
it in what used to be my garage,

643
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,710
but what is now the equivalent
to recording at capital,

644
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,361
and I'll tell you,

645
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:26,920
all you got to be is a monster rock star
who's been selling millions of albums

646
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:29,200
for 20 years.
And you could do it too.

647
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,320
So you don't need autotune boys and
girls despite the fact that it puts you

648
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,360
right. You know, I read
about some fucking,

649
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,570
this little spazzy look a nerd and rolling
stone who makes some sort of fucking

650
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:46,720
music with, with a Macintosh. Um,

651
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,080
which to me, I don't give
a fuck is not, it is music,

652
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,390
but it isn't.
You know what I mean?

653
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,110
Okay.

654
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:01,010
This just, I, it's more like you
are, it's like you're an editor.

655
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,310
I would say it's, it's more
like that. Like, I don't,

656
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:08,690
I don't think that what you're doing, it's
like you are making music, but you're,

657
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:12,500
you're taking sounds in all this
shit that you don't have the,

658
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:17,450
have the ability to make, I guess that
one guy that fat Gail made all those,

659
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,620
those loops for Justin Timberlake and uh,

660
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:27,170
and Jay Z, who's that guy who have
it be pay, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay,

661
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,710
pay, Yoda. It's hard
to death that that guy,

662
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,830
I guess that, yeah. Guy Is,

663
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,880
I saw him. He can actually
play instruments and shit.
Oh, well, you know what I'm,

664
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:42,540
I'm painting with a broad brush
here. People, I'm just saying I own,

665
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,940
I was saying halfway through
that I fucking got lost in,

666
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:48,700
in the sugar of cheesecake at
eight in the fucking morning. Um,

667
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,380
okay.

668
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,350
Was there a point? Oh yeah. I was
reading about this fucking nerd,

669
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,920
which by the way, people can, can,

670
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,310
can nerds go back to being beaten
for no fucking reason at all.

671
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,110
You know, I, I really can't
wait for the backlash on nerds.

672
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,550
I've had it with them.

673
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,930
I've had it with them and bracing
the fact that they're awkward to,

674
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,360
to the point of pretending to
be awkward even when you're not,

675
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:18,670
and just coming up to you and be and
am awkward and then believing all the

676
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:23,350
pressure of the conversation
on you. You know, fucking 30,

677
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:28,210
35 years old walking around acting like
some 14 year old on his first date.

678
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,173
Yeah.

679
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,140
You know what? Somebody has that this
week. Where the hell is it? The overrated,

680
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:34,630
underrated for the weeks,
uh,

681
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,620
overrated dorks they're taking over and
they haven't even done anything cool to

682
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:43,700
earn it. Fuck the office, Dude.
I gotta be honest with you.

683
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:48,020
I've been saying that for fucking years.
My girl loves that show the office.

684
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,490
All right. And I can't
fucking watch it. All right.

685
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,420
It's like,
can somebody on that show be like,

686
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,860
be aware of what they're saying when
they're saying it instead of like

687
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,700
afterwards, immediately
afterwards, you know.

688
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:06,720
Okay.

689
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,520
I,
I did like their cartoons.

690
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,423
Okay.

691
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,850
Fucking every goddamn one
of those fucking shows.

692
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,000
I can't,
I can't get into the shit.

693
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,450
I can't get into the ship because I'm
gonna start trashing shit and then you can

694
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:25,930
think straight across the board that I
fucking like anybody in the alt scene.

695
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:28,110
That's not fucking true.
But

696
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:29,260
okay.

697
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,093
I think,

698
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:35,220
I think the alternative comedy scene is
like the hair metal scene in late 1989

699
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:37,631
all right.

700
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:41,680
We're about a year away before never
mind is going to come out and they're all

701
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:43,170
going to be scurried.
And I'm going to,

702
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,490
I can't fucking wait because
I'm just an old country redhead.

703
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,610
No, I reside, I actually
on, I do resent the,

704
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:55,240
the alternative scene
full for one reason only.

705
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,440
And that's because that scene created
a situation that it basically distilled

706
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,690
all of the horror out of
attempting to be a comedian.

707
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,750
That's what I don't like about it.
Okay.

708
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,070
Okay.

709
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:19,870
No haggling, no drugs,
no obnoxious behavior,

710
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,990
no aggressiveness from every fucking
reason that it takes balls to be a

711
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:28,150
comedian. Every fucking reason why
people who wanted to be a comic,

712
00:44:28,151 --> 00:44:32,070
but it never fucking did it. You've
removed from that situation and you've

713
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,870
just created like this
fucking comedy womb, you know,

714
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,880
and, and on top of that, it's like
you're performing to just this,

715
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:45,630
this, it's like a radio station.
It's not even a crowd. It's like,

716
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:47,130
what did I go to fucking radio station?

717
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:52,131
I only perform to hipsters ages 18 to 24
who were skinny fucking loose jeans and

718
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:55,410
have black frame glasses.
It's like,

719
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,290
and then if they have to go
down to a fucking comedy club,

720
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,830
when they're jokes don't go
over, they, they act like the,

721
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,030
the crowd is dumb rather than, no, you,

722
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,260
you're like a specialist.

723
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:10,650
You like that guy who plays
on the football team and
only goes out is you like

724
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:12,780
the long snapper.
You know what I mean?

725
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,400
You can only could play one fucking
position and you turn around and you're

726
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:21,690
blaming the fucking crowd.
I Dunno dude.

727
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,840
I just, it's, it's, and
then on top of that,

728
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,630
the amount of shots that
over the fucking years

729
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,660
they've taken a club comics, like we're
all a bunch of hacks over there, you know,

730
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,613
talking about

731
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,980
plain food. Like they're above
us. And then every fucking to,

732
00:45:35,981 --> 00:45:40,110
I got to talk to Bob and talked to Bobby
Kelly about this shit on his podcast.

733
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,250
Hopefully this week, cause we were
talking about some of this shit.

734
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,720
And anytime then what happens is right
then you go to do some benefit or you

735
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:53,010
going to do some sort of fucking comedy
festival and then they put club comics

736
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:56,400
and all comics together. And
what happens? All those fucking,

737
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:59,760
all comics go on early.
You know,

738
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,730
one in particular is
always fucking trading up.

739
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:07,731
He can't go on early enough despite the
fact his face is all over the fucking

740
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:13,020
posters. And then who's got a mop up in
the end, two hours into the fucking show,

741
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,170
a club comic, you know, uh,

742
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:19,260
those fucking all comics and they're
all fucking nice to you on those shows.

743
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:23,970
He raises his real Dick van. You clicking
really? Are you? Are you, they're nervous.

744
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,500
Go on second, go on third and then fucking
run out with your book bag. You can't,

745
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,890
ah, the flood gates have opened. I've
had it. I've had it with fucking nervous.

746
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:39,020
I've, I've, I've, I've fuck it.
I get it. I get it. All right,

747
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:42,590
you're into comic con. I get it.
And if you're not into comic con,

748
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,200
then you're fucking stupid.
Is that basically what it is?

749
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,250
Cheesecake baby.
It's the cheesecake.

750
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,970
Just for the record. The old scene was
started by club comics. All those guys,

751
00:46:56,971 --> 00:47:01,860
David Cross, Bob Odenkirk, Dana
Gould, Mark Marin, beast, all of them,

752
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,810
all of them, they could
perform in fucking, uh,

753
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,660
an offtrack betting and
they could have a great set.

754
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,083
Okay.

755
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,470
But inadvertently I think,
you know what they did,

756
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,760
they're almost like rich people who
have kids, you know, and they, they,

757
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,010
they struggled up through all this shit,
right?

758
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:25,370
And then they just have these kids in
their first car is like a Maserati and

759
00:47:25,371 --> 00:47:28,550
they wrap it around a pole and there's
like no ramification. That's that.

760
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:33,551
That is my overall generalization of my
problem that I have with the AllSeen is,

761
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,920
um, it's, it's like, uh,

762
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,450
it's like standup comedy while wearing
like the training wheels and he never

763
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:47,060
take them off. Okay, bill, we got it.
You've, you've made, you've, you've,

764
00:47:47,061 --> 00:47:51,030
you've made your, your fucking one sided
argument. Um, all right, there we go.

765
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,870
That out against some fucking
emails that aren't into it.

766
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,070
I'm trying to be controversial
this week and other overrated,

767
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:59,850
chasing your dreams.
Stay home. Jesus Christ.

768
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,740
How many hugs did you not get, sir? Um,
although that's funny. Uh, underrated, uh,

769
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:09,210
watching a whole series on Netflix
in three weeks. Is there anything,

770
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,990
is there anything better than being
able to skip commercials and weeks of

771
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:17,280
waiting for Shit to happen? Who cares
about spoilers? From what I understand,

772
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:21,030
die hard. Fans of loss. Can't
even explain the last episode.

773
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:27,590
No spoilers there Jr is dead and
I'll never go back and watch Dallas.

774
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:31,280
Um,
I think it's good.

775
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,980
It's good and bad because
when, when you, uh,

776
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,850
the anticipation of it coming out,
you know,

777
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,060
like when people had to wait
for the next Beatles album,

778
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,910
what are they going to do?
How they're going to top the next one.

779
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:45,871
And then you'd go out,

780
00:48:45,871 --> 00:48:48,030
you fucking stand in line to get
it and you sit down and wait.

781
00:48:48,031 --> 00:48:50,280
It becomes like an event.
Um,

782
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,220
it's like having a slice of cake rather
than eating the whole fucking cake.

783
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,170
You know what I mean? So, but I do,
I do know what you're saying. Um,

784
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:01,530
and the whole fast forwarding through
commercials and that type of thing,

785
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:05,760
I actually, I do enjoy doing
that. I do enjoy doing that.

786
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:08,610
Even though I have commercials on my,
I'm such a fucking hypocrite.

787
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,210
It's ridiculous. And speaking to that,
how about another commercial right now,

788
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,230
what are we going to go with people? What
are we going to go with? What happens?

789
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,690
You're heard me say stamps.com
everybody. Hey this, this,

790
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,890
this is something that we've all
been going to our entire lives.

791
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:23,850
Something called the post office.
Okay.

792
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:25,760
And we go down there
with those crabby people.

793
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,250
You know who they can't get fired unless
the union boss says it's okay. Right.

794
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:34,320
And that down, they're leaning on shovels.
You asking for stamps am on break.

795
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,250
And they sit there with their fucking
chewing tobacco spitting into a spittoon.

796
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,360
Right.

797
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,440
Would it be great if you could just
have your own little post office in your

798
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:48,441
apartment in the garage like Dave Grohl
right next to your drum set with the 52

799
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:52,080
microphones on? It. Would it be
great if you could just totally,

800
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,830
you know, it'd be like if he
could somehow have the DMV

801
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:56,230
okay

802
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,620
in your apartment and just take your
own picture and make your own, damn, I

803
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:00,910
wouldn't that be great.

804
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,020
They're not going to let you do it because
it's all part of the new world order

805
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:09,190
man. But you can have the
post office in your house.

806
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,840
Wouldn't that be fantastic?

807
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,240
Would it be great to just
be able to print out stamps?

808
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:16,150
Said you could put on an envelope using
your computer and a little piece of

809
00:50:16,151 --> 00:50:16,984
paper.

810
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,990
Wouldn't it be phenomenal to have your
own damn scale where you could weigh

811
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:22,480
things? It'd be that's how much
it weighs and here's the zip code.

812
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,710
How much does that cost?

813
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,320
Would it be wonderful to be able to
do that completely naked at two in the

814
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:29,900
morning while eating a pop tart?
Well, with stamps.com you can do it.

You can buy and print us postage official
US postage as opposed to that bootleg

816
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:39,340
stuff that's been out
there. All right. Um,

817
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,820
what's going on with my computer? I
got to get a new one. This one's full.

818
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,253
Um,

819
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,730

820
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:52,550
stand, stop. Chrom we'll
give you a digital scale.

821
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,130
Just plug it into you computer way.
Your letter or a package.

822
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,520
The exact amount of the postage will
automatically appear on the screen.

823
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:01,100
And I got to tell you, they're not
lying there because I've done it.

824
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,360
I had shipped DVDs to the four
core as it is country and I am,

825
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:10,070
he had to say, ask not what
your scale could do for you. Uh,

826
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:15,071
endorsement stamps.com is like having a
postal expert right at my desk expert.

827
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:19,430
I don't know about that. It's like
having a postal guy right at your desk,

828
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,790
except he doesn't have an attitude. How
about that? There's never any guesswork.

829
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,790
Um, and you never have
to go to the post office.

830
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,450
I haven't been there since
other than to drop off. Uh,

831
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,760
the stamps that I put it off cause I
live in a city and they won't pick up the

832
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:33,710
mail.
But if you live in the middle of nowhere,

833
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,180
you know when you've got a deer in the
front lawn, you know, taking a dump,

834
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:41,480
it's going to poison your food
somehow. You can, you know you can.

835
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:44,240
If you live out there and Mayberry,
you print out your stamps,

836
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:47,270
you stick in the box, she bring you
a little red flag up as if to say,

837
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:52,110
I have mail in here that
needs to be delivered. Um,

838

like a cancer that you discovered early.

855
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,870
How do you link that?
Huh?

856
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,770
I think I'm gonna eat cheesecake
before I read the next one. Um, anyway,

857
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,460
and it just totally took me off track.
What the hell was I talking about?

858
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,500
What are we 53 minutes in,

859
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,400
53 minutes into this podcast and I'm going
to try to upload and I'm not going to

860
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,530
be able to cause my,
my stupid thing is full,

861
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,360
despite the fact that I've removed all
pictures and put them onto an external

862
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:26,070
hard drive. All right, where

863
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,720
are we? Male dance. Let's read this bill.
Bit of a bit of a dilemma here for you.

864
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,531
Oh,
before I do this,

865
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:33,930
why don't I give you guys emails cause
a lot of you guys are like, Bill,

866
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:36,750
I have things that I would
like to be read in a bad way,

867
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:38,640
in a second grade manner on the podcast.

868
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,490
Where do I email you
decide you can email me,

869
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:45,360
you can email me@billatthemmpodcast.com.

870
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:50,390
Don't forget that the all right bill at
the [inaudible] podcast.com and MMP is

871
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:52,350
all capitalized.
All right,

872
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,560
bill@themmpodcast.com and you
can tell me to go fuck myself.

873
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,460
You can ask me questions, you can ask
advice, she can do whatever you want.

874
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,530
Um, and that is, it built bit
of a dilemma here for Ya. Uh,

875
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,830
I'm an 18 year old male who's
about to graduate from high school.

876
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,320
Congratulations.
Um,

877
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,120
over the past few years I've been
told I'm a really good dancer. Uh,

878
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,840
not ballet or artsy stuff,
but just good dance floor dancing.

879
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,580
Oh my God, I'm going to take over the
dance floor. Hey Angie, who watched me?

880
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,670
You're John Travolta. This is
great. Do you go out to the, uh,

881
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,810
Staten Island Bridge and do headstands
with your, with your buddy Bobby?

882
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,940
You know, if he didn't have an Afro, he
never would have fell off that bridge.

883
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,900
If you had it high and tight. Like
all these Armenians out here, all,

884
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:46,590
every Armenian looks like they
know, uh, they, they know, um, um,

885
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,360
MMA moose,

886
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:52,140
last time you saw an our Armenian
dude in his twenties or thirties,

887
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,440
and he did not look like he could put
you in an arm bar within two seconds if

888
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:58,620
you want it to.
If I were,

889
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:03,650
if I was a Dana white and I was running
the UFC at one point at this point,

890
00:55:04,921 --> 00:55:09,660
what they're up to like what?
Like UFC 2006,

891
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,500
you know, they're like, run it, they've
run out of adjectives this time.

892
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:16,180
It's really, really personal,
right? Not Saying I'm not a fan,

893
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:19,140
I'm a huge fucking fan.
I'm just saying, you know,

894
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,940
the way they have those things, like every
other week, there's only so many, like,

895
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,990
you know, redemption. I mean,
you've running out of words. Um,

896
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,810
I'm such a fucking idiot.

897
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,530
This is what I would do if I was dating
white at some point I would have,

898
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,570
you know, you know what I would,
this is what I would branch off.

899
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:39,960
And when they had those
tough man competitions and
they would have just people

900
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,490
coming in,
throwing haymakers,

901
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,520
which is some of the best boxing ever
is when you watch people who just aren't

902
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:46,980
trained whatsoever and they just start,
you know,

903
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:49,080
cause somebody's going to connect,
right?

904
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,430
I think that they should have one week
they should have the Armenians verse the

905
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:57,270
Russians tough man competition,
because I really think that that needs,

906
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,920
it needs to be decided who is
the tougher of the two, uh,

907
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,410
cause up more now when it
comes to white people. That's,

908
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,760
that's who I got my money
on. All right. That, those,

909
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:13,620
those are the crips and the bloods of
white people is the army and the Russians,

910
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,390
all of them, they just have that vibe.
Does something you just like. Yeah.

911
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:22,500
I'm not fucking with that guy. Just
really, I'm really not doing it anyways.

912
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,040
Uh,
not

913
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,540
a ballet or artsy stuff,

914
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:30,130
but just ballroom dance in a
full contention over here. Uh,

915
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:34,600
I kind of think of think dancing is
gay from an outside point of view.

916
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:40,150
Um, I, I, it isn't, it really isn't,

917
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:41,830
that's just how white people look at it.

918
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,490
It's considered gay cause it involves
like letting yourself go and actually

919
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:50,150
admitting that you have emotions as a
man, as a white male. Yeah. It's constant.

920
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,170
Yeah, it is. It's considered gay. Um,

921
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,510
as his crying,

922
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:00,810
as is showing any sort of emotion as is
not dying for no good God damn reason

923
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:05,140
before you 56, um, oh,
not dying. I should say.

924
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,860
If you live to be 60, I believe amongst
white men, that's also considered gay.

925
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,710
Cause that means at some point you cried
something out of your chest and you

926
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:15,190
didn't have a heart attack.
Um, anyways, he says,

927
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,100
I think a dancing is gay from
an outside point of view,

928
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:22,570
but I'll be the first one to admit that
I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I

929
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:25,630
didn't think so, I wouldn't be out
there doing it. Yeah. But Dude,

930
00:57:25,631 --> 00:57:30,610
you gotta be getting some, I'll
fucking women love a guy who can dance,

931
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:34,570
dude. If you can dance and you were in
like a silk scarf, it's fucking over.

932
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:37,570
It's going to be rain in Pussy.
As far as my outside view,

933
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,040
my freckled view from over in the bar
trying to stand out from underneath those

934
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,830
hot lights so I don't
get burned. Uh, you know,

935
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:48,550
red heads were the closest
thing to vampires. You know,

936
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:53,770
we have,
we have none of the powers of vampires,

937
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,900
but the sun affects us the same way.

938
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:59,203
Okay.

939
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:03,510
A friend of mine who was a female dancer
keeps telling me I could make money

940
00:58:03,511 --> 00:58:06,330
doing it on commercials or music videos.

941
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,100
Parentheses close on.
Or You could go to fucking Broadway.

942
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:16,050
It'd be like one of the five straight
men who dances on Broadway and just tag

943
00:58:16,051 --> 00:58:20,370
every fucking lonely chick out
there who's all stretched out.

944
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,690
Just make sure you keep those shoes on.
Dancers' feet are always fucked up. Uh,

945
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,020
here's where it gets complicated.
I plan on becoming a policeman.

946
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:29,700
Okay?

947
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,130
Oh Dude, this is, this is a no
brainer. You need to dance it.

948
00:58:32,131 --> 00:58:36,060
Bachelorette parties dressed
as a cop. All you need, dude,

949
00:58:36,061 --> 00:58:40,380
is that a fake uniform on a boombox and
you're on your way to making money? Dude,

950
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:44,520
you should fucking do that in a second.
And then you write a book about it.

951
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:49,800
I was a gyrate and cop for Bachelorette
parties and you write a tell all book

952
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:53,700
about how many fucking broads, who bought
ready got married? You get married,

953
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:56,460
sucked your Dick. You really
need help on this one. I mean,

954
00:58:56,461 --> 00:58:57,420
I'm going to read the rest of it,

955
00:58:57,421 --> 00:58:59,880
but I think I've already
come with a solution anyways.

956
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:02,460
How is anyone supposed to take
me seriously on the force?

957
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:04,650
If there's a video going with me,

958
00:59:04,651 --> 00:59:08,340
pop and locking next to little
Wayne at the same time, I'll, dude,

959
00:59:08,341 --> 00:59:09,930
you should fucking pull people over.

960
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:11,570
Yeah,

961
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:13,240
you should pull people
over and fucking moon.

962
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,320
Walk up to their car
and just freak them out.

963
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,570
Even if they were reaching
for a gun, they'd be laughing
too hard and they, they,

964
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:20,960
they wouldn't shoot you. Then you
could rest them and then you move.

965
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,880
Next thing you know you're a
commissioner, right? Nothing. Anyways,

966
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:28,880
at the same time, I'm getting laid a
lot because of it. Of course you are.

967
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,160
I'm a seven on a scale of 10. I like
this guy. He's honest and um, uh,

968
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,440
and like having a jump shot.

969
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:40,910
It's put me up to an eight
five I'm bang and tense.

970
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,400
I've always wanted to be
a cop at the parks here.

971
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:47,180
Seen better if I was able to make money
doing it. Other than the dancing thing,

972
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:52,570
I wouldn't just be getting Hummerus
for letting gross moms off on speeding

973
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:57,290
tickets. I could be bagging J
lo. She's into dancers. Right?

974
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,480
Thanks. Yeah, Dude. Apps
a Fuckin lutely dude.

975
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:05,600
You're basically saying,
what should I do here?

976
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,060
Okay.

977
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:12,060
Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the
club and make all this fucking money or

978
01:00:12,761 --> 01:00:16,570
should I take a job where I'm going
to get shot at and not be appreciated?

979
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:18,240
Okay.

980
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,180
You know, I'll tell you every cop
out there with dance, if they could,

981
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,120
as opposed to being a cop, I don't care
if they had like seven generations.

982
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:25,660
Yeah.

983
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:30,520
Dude, this is what I think of as
far as like dancing. I think if I,

984
01:00:30,521 --> 01:00:31,354
if I,

985
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:32,570
yeah,

986
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,970
like compare it to being a comedian.
Oh,

987
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:39,320
the open mics would be getting a piece
of cardboard and being on a subway

988
01:00:39,321 --> 01:00:42,350
platform, making money that way. And then

989
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:43,700
yeah,

990
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,940
when you move up to hosting a show that
would be addressed as a cop and you

991
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:50,510
fucking dance at Bachelorette parties.
That's what you do on the side.

992
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:55,400
That's like you fucking day
job. That bullshit. And then
during the day, I, yeah,

993
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,960
I would try out for those. Fuck, I don't,

994
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:01,370
do they make music videos
anymore or fucking, uh,

995
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:06,230
I dunno. I believe it or not, I don't
know how to climb the ladder as a dancer.

996
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,420
But dude,

997
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:12,440
apps a Fuckin lutely if you
can make money doing that shit.

998
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:18,180
And then what the great thing is, is
once you get to a certain level to, to,

999
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,240
uh, make more money, you don't want,
you got some credibility. You can know,

1000
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:26,550
you always have the fall back where
you can teach a class, they get,

1001
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,600
you can be like I danced for nine years
and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and fucking

1002
01:01:30,601 --> 01:01:33,750
banged every fucking broad on there.
And then you, if you'd like to not have,

1003
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,480
fuck the women in your cast
while still not losing your job,

1004
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,050
come on down to Frankie's
swapping, Dade Studio, whatever.

1005
01:01:40,051 --> 01:01:45,030
Just you'll figure it out as
you go in there. And um, yeah,

1006
01:01:45,031 --> 01:01:49,890
absolutely. Absolute fucking Luli. I
would definitely do it. You want to do it?

1007
01:01:49,891 --> 01:01:54,510
He wouldn't taken the
time, um, to write in.

1008
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,050
So your big fears, she'll be whatever.
But everybody's big fear is like,

1009
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:01,650
what if I fucking go after this dream
and I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a Fuckin

1010
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,290
futon and it hasn't happened yet.
Well I've got to tell you something sir.

1011
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,750
I've been there.
I was there at fucking 34.

1012
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:10,410
I was still sleeping on a
Futon in a fucking studio
apartment that they called a

1013
01:02:10,411 --> 01:02:13,920
one bedroom cause they slammed a fucking
wall in there and put a door on it.

1014
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,520
And then one day I was trying to bang
the girl upstairs who had the fucking

1015
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:18,720
apartment right above me,

1016
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,800
and it was exact same unit
and hers was a studio,

1017
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:25,260
but she had been there longer so
they never slammed a wall in there.

1018
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,680
And I realized, Hey, wait a minute,
I'm getting fucked. You know,

1019
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:31,170
I should go down there and try to
get some money taken off of this.

1020
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:34,800
I should go down to the,
uh, they're fucking me over
rental board. But I didn't,

1021
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,990
I said, fucking just keep writing
jokes, right. So whatever,

1022
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,670
oh, you gotta do, you just got
to commit to this shit and uh,

1023
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:47,260
and then realize that, you know,
sleep on the Futon when you're 30 is,

1024
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,060
is not the worst thing. It
isn't. You don't see, you know,

1025
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:52,260
it's worse than sleeping on futons at 30,

1026
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,040
sleeping in a king bed next to a fuck
a woman you're not really love with,

1027
01:02:56,041 --> 01:03:00,030
but for some reason married and he got
a couple of kids and you've got a job

1028
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:01,560
that you fucking hate.
Okay?

1029
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:05,690
You'll be laying there fantasizing about
fucking sleeping on a, on a, on a, uh,

1030
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,490
on a futon there.

1031
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:13,170
There's no risk when you go after a dream,
it's all fucking reward.

1032
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,450
It's all going to lead to something good.
It always does.

1033
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:20,780
There's a tremendous amount of
risk to playing it safe and uh,

1034
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:26,040
that leads to unbelievable
levels of regret,

1035
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,360
which is something else.

1036
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:32,130
I've also experienced it because I'm
an old mother fucker. Um, so that's it.

1037
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,070
That's the podcast for this
week. Okay. If you want to dance,

1038
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:37,530
if you want to get stamps,
I think I fucking covered everything.

1039
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,320
If you want to know what somebody sounds
like after having eggs and then a big

1040
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:45,120
slice of cheesecake, uh, that's
what I gave you this week. Um,

1041
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:49,560
okay. So this week my little
vacation has ended. Alright.

1042
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,330
And I am now on my way to,
uh, doing some more gigs here.

1043
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,170
Oh wait, I felt, I forgot. Gamefly
I've got to hide. Gamefly this,

1044
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:01,710

be the only one who doesn't

1045
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:04,650
get on game fly. And I know
what you're thinking. But bill,

1046
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:08,630
I don't like video games. You know what
I'm thinking? You're a fucking communists.

Pinko bastard. All right, lovely.

1048
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:17,460
Nia just walks in on you. Pinko bastard,
look at you when you have pajamas.

1049
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,590
Nia bought the cutest pair of pajamas.
They're absolutely adorable.

1050
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:26,700
They make it look like a little kid who
needs somebody to make her breakfast yet

1051
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:27,930
she wears them every day.

1052
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:32,760

to get self another couple of pairs.

New York on March 31st
with New Jersey's own.

1096
01:06:55,961 --> 01:07:00,820
Paul Versey loves the jets and the giants.
Whoever's doing better,

1097
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:04,480
he will root for them.
And then the music hall in Tarrytown,

1098
01:07:04,481 --> 01:07:07,810
New York on April 1st. This is
not an April fool's joke. People.

1099
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,390
I'm really going to be there.
Are you going to be there?

1100
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:14,200
And I will also be there once again
with the wonderfully talented,

1101
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:18,760
the freshly bearded Paul Versey.
You know, Paul Versey took my, uh,

1102
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:23,210
personal trainer beard that I stole from
Bob on the biggest loser Paul verse.

1103
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:27,250
He took it. He took it from me. You know,
as long as he doesn't steal my material.

1104
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:30,550
I don't mind if he takes my facial hair.
Oh,

1105
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:33,010
you're going to go to your little workout
class. All right. I'm almost done here.

1106
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,930
All right. I'll be done in a second
if you just let me do it. Um,

1107
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,220
um, oh, here's one for you.

1108
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:45,400
You know something I was telling you what
really bothered me was when Davy Jones

1109
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:49,120
died, just really fucking bothered
me. Just really made me feel old.

1110
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,690
I'd love the monkeys. I thought they
were hilarious. And I love their music.

1111
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,120
And you know what's funny is
I was reading all this shit,

1112
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:57,460
the amount of crap that they
got because they were a prefab.

1113
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:02,590
They called him the prefab for because
it was just a TV show and they were

1114
01:08:02,591 --> 01:08:06,550
basically, it was basically the
Beatles meets, meets the, uh,

1115
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:09,070
the Marx brothers and all this
shit that they went through.

1116
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,720
But I always find it funny when you
go on Youtube and every music thing,

1117
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,070
you know, if you, if
you go, when you look up

1118
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,200
something and some sort of
music that people respect it.

1119
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:22,810
Like what happened to music and people
always trashing Justin Bieber going,

1120
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:26,960
what happened to music? I wish I was
born back in the fucking day. Well,

1121
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,860
here's something that I read. Do you
know what the height of the monkeys fame?

1122
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:34,850
They sold more albums than the Beatles
and the rolling stones combined.

1123
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,610
All right.
So it's always been that way.

1124
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,480
There's always been some
fucking hottie going, oops.

1125
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:45,350
At dd to again at played with your part,
right?

1126
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:46,810
Yeah.

1127
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:48,970
Shaking her fucking hips.
It's always going to be that,

1128
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:50,290
okay,

1129
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:54,340
Barry Manilow that song, Mandy, you blah,

1130
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:59,050
and you bleed and you blue blue,
and I wanna fuck you.

1131
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,940
Now,
Mandy,

1132
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:05,500
right when Zeppelin was doing
what the fuck they were doing,

1133
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:10,120
when a, when fucking black Sabbath
was at the height of their powers,

1134
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,200
when they brought the devil
to their fucking knees, right?

1135
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:20,620
Or to his knees or whatever the fuck it
is that there was people making fucking,

1136
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:24,820
I'm Henry the eighth die Yam. It's,
it's always been like that. So please,

1137
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:28,060
if you go on Youtube, can you please
stop writing what happened to music?

1138
01:09:28,061 --> 01:09:30,370
Nothing has happened to it.
All right? What's the matter?

1139
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:34,990
Does it take work to find the good music?
You lazy costs. Go out and go find it.

1140
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,750
All right, that's the podcast for
this week. Go fuck yourselves.

1141
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:42,430
Don't take any shit. I'll talk to you
next week. And, uh, please keep up.

1142
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,850
Please keep emailing the, uh,
the podcast because I can't,

1143
01:09:45,851 --> 01:09:50,020
I can't do this thing with
just me and cheesecake alone.

1144
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,480
All right?
And I think that that's one to grow on.
