Hey, what's going on? It's
bill bird. Just checking in

Thursday. How you been everybody?

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,620
How you been? Huh? How you been?
How was your Tuesday and Wednesday?

4
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,840
Was it everything you thought
it was going to be? Huh?

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,870
You feeling good today? Have they
given you your little checky pool yet?

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,440
When did they give it to ya?
When you walked through the door?

7
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:34,970
They make it gets fucking sit down,
work a little bit,

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,160
get through the morning breaks and then
sometime around lunchtime it comes your

9
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,190
boss, that fucking jerk off, right?

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,440
Coming down the fucking hall with these
Beer Gut slacks you can make out as

11
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,790
giant package, you know? Oh,

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,040
he's those big fucking book tooth glass.

13
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:57,970
People always had some big fucking unit
just swaying back and forth inside this

14
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,940
slacks.
You tried not to look at it,

15
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,840
but every time they sat down
you're just like, Jesus Christ,

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,300
this guy's a fucking animal. I know. I
work for this guy. You know what I mean?

17
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,630
Um,
I used to work for a guy like that.

18
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:18,631
He had glasses and he had this fucking
slacks like mc hammer pants and he had to

19
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:22,890
have him because he had this giant
fucking unit that everybody knew you had a

20
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:26,670
giant and the guy couldn't hide it.
He just had this fucking, you know,

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,590
I don't know why I'm
thinking a Mars moon unit.

22
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,070
I Dunno what I'm thinking of.
Anyways, this is the Thursday,

23
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:38,610
a Monday morning podcast where you know,
I just pop in.

24
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,760
She how your weeks go in
case you're having a bad one.

25
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,130
I give you a couple of
chuckles for 30 minutes.

26
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,360
And then at the end of this
we got uh, some of the, uh,

27
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,080
some of the highlights over the year.

28
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:54,210
Some Monday morning podcast selects that
we uh, that we pull out. I don't know.

29
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,100
We're going to have this week.
I have no idea. Um, but anyways,

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,670
what's been going on with
me the last couple of days,
this is getting weird guys.

31
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:03,990
If you can listen to two of these a week,

32
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,600
like it's really getting to
the point that, uh, you know,

33
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,920
you've got to start paying rent here.

34
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,370
I'm letting you into my house
twice a fucking week. Oh,

35
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:16,920
my wife was fucking pissed at me last
night. Oh, Jesus Christ when she met.

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,530
Um, I've been really tired lately and
when I'm really tired or if I'm drunk,

37
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,780
I fucking snore. That's the
only time I snore. And, um,

38
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,890
I had a couple of whiskeys and I was
really tired and I told the last time I

39
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,080
snore and go,
just wake me up up,

40
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,140
fucking go upstairs and I'll sleep on
the couch asleep in the bedroom upstairs.

41
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:39,600
Right? And she's like a, she's like, okay,

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,990
so I'm fucking snooze.
And

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,290
all of a sudden she fucking hits me. She
goes, Bill, go upstairs. You snoring.

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,300
So I'm laying there going
like, oh yeah, this is bad.

45
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,010
This is not fair to my wife
going to get up. I'm getting,

46
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,330
getting up like a minute.
Let me just lay here.

47
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,980
And I'm just laying there and I'm
awake, but my eyes are closed. And uh,

48
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,770
I don't know what happened. All of a
sudden you started boom, boom, boom, boom.

49
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:13,950
And I look up and I saw my wife walking
out of the room and she went upstairs.

50
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,500
And, um, so you know the
deal, you're like, all right,

51
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:21,870
well I guess tomorrow morning
is going to suck. Right.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,440
You know, here we go. She's
fucking Matt. You know,

53
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,300
they're always mad.
They're always mad about something.

54
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:34,070
Something's going to happen, doesn't
make a difference. So she was actually,

55
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:35,360
surprisingly not mad at me,

56
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:37,790
but what I was smart enough to
do was I woke up in the morning,

57
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:42,540
paddle by Dow Pope and I walked out the
door and I went to the gym and got on

58
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:46,200
the treadmill. Um, I fucking, uh,

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,080
yeah, I just left in the morning
and, uh, I got a bunch of shit done,

60
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,780
you know, picked up dry cleaning
and dental is fucking shit.

61
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,780
And then I also said I went to the grocery
store as to what she wanted and blah,

62
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,590
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and
miraculously be kind of smoothed over.

63
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:07,660
And she's still a little pissed at me,
but not a, not in a big way, but, uh,

64
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,800
but I'm back.
Billy freckles is back in the gym.

65
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,090
Hey old Billy's back again
again, again, again, again.

66
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,790
Why Buy Dewalt Bop, Bop, beep beep.

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,080
Um, old people understood that joke. Oh,

68
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:31,840
people watch that fucking
cartoon. Remember that? Oh,
Billy is back. Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,750
Again, again, again, again. And then
the dude would just start with him.

70
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,813
Yeah,

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,600
I got no fucking, I've got no water
in my mouth, man. And fucking okay.

72
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,650
Hydrated for being on the treadmill.
Of course, you go to the gym,

73
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:48,750
you walk in the men's locker room.
What are you going to see?

74
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,650
You're going to see the naked guy.
You know?

75
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,000
Here's the thing you got to expect.
If you go into a men's locker room,

76
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:59,730
somebody's going to be naked. All
right? It's not that you're naked.

77
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,540
It's the level of comfortable
that you're naked. Right.

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,400
I went to nam changing. I'm going to
fucking leave and as I go to leave,

79
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,720
I look over at, you know, just walking
over to the sink to wash my fucking hands.

80
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,150
And there's this guy standing there,

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,620
okay.

82
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,260
He's got the towel covering the
front of him. He sort of holding it,

83
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:21,990
but he's just standing there
with his fucking ass out.

84
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,630
Like the level of comfortable that he was.

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,040
Okay.

86
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,600
He was like a hey on. Just to remind
you, I've got that meeting today.

87
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:33,450
It's six southern.
There'd be home a little late,

88
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,940
like he was that level comfortable naked.

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,810
That's what he should have been yelling
out. Just fucking stand in there.

90
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,660
Why does it bug me? I don't know
why it does. You know what I mean?

91
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm usually fucking cool about stuff
like this. Like I'm only as people,

92
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:51,200
I walk into a men's room, you know, and
it smells like shit. It's like, yeah,

93
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,650
it's supposed to people
shit in here better.

94
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,660
They did it in here then in the
restaurant. I've never understood that.

95
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,220
The soundbite walking in a men's locker.
It's just like,

96
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:02,440
just can you just make a fucking effort?

97
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,780
Okay.

98
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,950
I Dunno.
Is that weird?

99
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:10,030
That guys are so uncomfortable with
other naked around other naked guys.

100
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,430
Women don't give a shit.
Right?

101
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:14,230
You sit around and talking
about each other's tits. I mean,

102
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:17,230
maybe we should do that.
Hey look, you balls.

103
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,950
Oh, Jay, Jay's these only six minute,

104
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,840
and he's talking about balls in a locker,
rum balls in a locker room,

105
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:35,220
the new fucking standup DVD by Bill Barr.
Um,

106
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,690
so I hit the gym all fucking
week for the most part. And, uh,

107
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,740
I just about perfectly,
I did all these hours of cardio,

108
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:48,741
but two fucking days in a row when I
went to Atlanta for my last time ever

109
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:53,790
working at the punchline.
And, uh, when I went to, um,

110
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,530
the next day I did one day at South by
southwest to hype the all things comedy

111
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:03,390
network with Al Madrigal did a
little panel thing with him and, uh,

112
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,380
Doug Benson, which was a
fucking great time. Uh,

113
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,440
Doug Benson is hilarious.
I'm gonna tell you something right now.

114
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,360
If you're thinking about not seeing
fast and furious parts seven,

115
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,250
just listen to Doug loves
movies or ask him about it.

116
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,890
He had me laughing so hard talking
about that movie. Like, he,

117
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,670
he knows what the movie is,
what I love about him.

118
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:30,510
He knows what the movie is and it
goes in with those expectations.

119
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,980
You know what I mean? You know
what he said to me? He said like,

120
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:38,790
there's like five times in a move in
the movie where somebody looks over at

121
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,050
somebody and goes, hang on. And then the
car drives off a cliff and nobody dies.

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,280
And he was just laughing. But he
thoroughly enjoyed it and I was just like,

123
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,640
you know, what am I going to see that
movie? I'm going to get an a stupid mood.

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,490
Go see that fast and furious parts seven,
driving from building to building.

125
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,340
Hang on one [inaudible] you know,

126
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,800
fast and furious really ought to be able
to uh, they should really kick uh, the,

127
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,610
the um,

128
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,050
the creators of chips some money every
time they make one of those movies.

129
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:12,180
Cause whenever I see the
fucking pile ups in that movie,

130
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:15,540
I mean I think that goes back to chips.
They did that every fucking week.

131
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,291
Every fucking week.

132
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:20,280
There was like a 200 car pile up back in
the day when you could wreck all those

133
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:24,700
cars and that was your job. What do you
do? I'm a stunt man. I go out now, Rick,

134
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,710
them I'll work on chips or work on the
fall guy and I work on Simon is Simon and

135
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,134
every week.

136
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,490
Okay,

137
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,990
well I'm not slamming jumping or
rolling it over. I ain't living.

138
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,200
Why is he southern? Why can't a
stunt man be intelligent, Bill?

139
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,930
Why is the southern accents
synonymous with stupid?

140
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,730
Why would you do that a month before
you're on the road again, but ab PPD,

141
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,720
Papa booboo. Um, I don't
know why I would do that.

142
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,200
All I know is I got my tickets to
the Kentucky Derby coming up all Gj.

143
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,520
We're going to have such a fucking
great time on that, that tour. And um,

144
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,490
I'm actually worried that I'm
going to out every fucking, uh,

145
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,370
all the good shit I'm
doing in the gym right now.

146
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:12,890
I'm going to lose those two weeks on
the fucking bus. I got to figure it out.

147
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:14,350
I'm already mentally in my head.

148
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,600
[inaudible] I'm starting the day
with great nuts and a banana, right?

149
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,440
This is one for y'all. You
fatties out there. You got
to have a fucking game plan.

150
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,710
You don't just show up on a bus.
Next thing you know,

151
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,760
you're gonna be sitting there with a
bunch of yodels and those fucking one of

152
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,450
those pink marshmallow things you
fucking guys eat. What do you do?

153
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:36,330
You killing yourself. Fucking killing
yourself. You know what I mean?

154
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,440
He just standing there out of breath. You
sound like you just ran a 40 yard dash.

155
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,560
She can't do that to
yourself. All right? So, uh,

156
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:46,650
I'm going great nuts with
bananas and then, uh,

157
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,080
okay.

158
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,440
I Dunno. I'll have a sandwich
for lunch somewhere in the house.

159
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:54,140
Phone and orange and an apple.
And then I figure at night,

160
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,480
that's when I'm going to go to a whatever
local place that somebody from down

161
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:02,360
south suggests. Um, Jesus Christ.

162
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:05,150
Look at those fucking cheerleaders
with their thick thighs.

163
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,470
Fucking Texas southern. There you
go. The talent is off the court.

164
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,450
They're fucking down by 25.
Dude,

165
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:19,480
Arizona, who? I don't know that
number five is on an Arizona,

166
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:24,000
but he's like Ben Wallace meets fucking
Lebron James. He had a dunk in the phone.

167
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,290
First half surprise. My flat screen
didn't fall off the fucking wall.

168
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,820
Don't you hate the first round
of March madness number one.

169
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:37,440
I'm watching number two against 15 the
fucking up by like, I can't do the math.

170
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:39,720
What do we got here? 26, 27 points.

171
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,220
Okay.

172
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,870
15 minutes to fucking go,
you know,

173
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,160
number six days. Never been a one bud.
You know, it's bound to happen sometime.

174
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,090
I can't fucking take that. Cool. Um,

175
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,620
but what's great about the first two
rounds, it's just fucking, you know,

176
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,640
you know fucking right there Fred,

177
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,190
go from 64 all the way down to what?
60 fucking white guy.

178
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,110
How do you miss that donkey? A God damn
asshole. Jesus. Don't you know what?

179
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:17,780
All being judged by that.
You're fucking unbelievable too.

180
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:22,050
Where did fucking dunk?
The guy's like six fucking 11.

181
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,860
Uh, I mean he got fouled, but how do
you miss her too? In his fucking dunk.

182
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,080
Look at that guy. Fucking eastern
Europeans. Ah, there you go.

183
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:35,660
Click it off the back of the room.
And why are you giving the guide?

184
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,740
I hate that in basketball when the guy
misses the fucking foul shots and he's

185
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,620
still go over and they fucking slap
him five. You know what I mean?

186
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,560
Like when you watch the family
feud in some moron name, uh,

187
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,340
a color of a car.
Ah Jeez.

188
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,500
Mahogany.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,300
And then the whole family's like that
to stripe or they'll go a good answer.

190
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,930
Good answer. Fucked him.
You say Brown, you asshole.

191
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,000
Look Far Mahogany

192
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,530
Wilson family with the change the steel.
We're going to say blue.

193
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:18,130
Richard.
Stop Kissing my wife.

194
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,750
Oh my God, I got it. You think
I didn't fucking hear it?

195
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,990
If I didn't answer it fucking
three seconds later it's
going to go and then I'm

196
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:30,140
going to pick it up. I swear to God, I
got to go back to a flip phone. I got it.

197
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,670
You know I want a walkie talkie. I'm going
to go super old school. I'm gonna out.

198
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:37,550
Hipster a fucking hipster.
You know east bound Dan.

199
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,680
Load it up and trucking and any
truckers listening to this week?

200
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,200
Hell you get you years old. Big Daddy. Oh,

201
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:48,670
you sitting on an inner tube cause you
got fucking, what do you got? Hemorrhoids.

202
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,310
How the fuck do you guys,
how do you guys lose weight?

203
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,120
You know, driving that truck. That's got
to be a bitch. What are you doing? Huh?

204
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,340
Jason does some, he, she
and a fucking rest area.

205
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,110
He's got a dick.

206
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,360
Oh Shit. That'd be a tough
one, man. That's what you do.

207
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:18,590
You guys sit there eating Brussels
sprouts all day long, driving that truck.

208
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,930
Let me ask you a truck as a question,
how, how your fantasy has to be,

209
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,880
you know, like when people in cars
just cut in front of you, you know,

210
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,210
and then slam on the brakes
with no respect for the
amount of weight you have in

211
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,490
the back of your truck and how you,

212
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,560
you have a fucking heart attack trying
to not have the thing jack knife you have

213
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,410
it. Just, just think, you know,

214
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:43,670
one of these days I'm just not going to
fucking put my foot on the brake and I'm

215
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,600
just going to fucking plow.

216
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,800
I'm gonna drive right up and
over like one of them monster.

217
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,540
She must've nother fucking dunk.

218
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:49,690
Okay.

219
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,430
Why is he out in the court?

220
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,363
Okay.

221
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,750
And he got the ball stolen from him.
Can we get this guy off the court?

222
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:03,220
I know they were up by 30 but
Jesus Christ is making us look bad.

223
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,850
Why are you fucking going to the
rack? You're, you're fucking white.

224
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,370
Do some Larry Bird Shit. Just shoot
the eyes out of the fucking hoops.

225
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,800
I've tried to, he goes his foul
shot. Oh, Jesus. He hadn't won.

226
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,730
Okay.

227
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,390
I'm sorry. I'm reverse racist when it
comes to fucking watching basketball.

228
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,400
I get like annoyed
when my team puts a white guy out there.

229
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,140
It's just like, oh well,
okay, we're down by eight.

230
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:31,910
What are you going to
be down by 16 is that,

231
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:35,260
was that what we're trying to do
here? What'd you guys bet? Did you do,

232
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,470
did you bet the over? Huh? Did you
bet the other fucking team? Well,

233
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:42,160
what are we doing here? Um, I don't
know. Shit about hoop. All right,

234
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,560
so all you fucking people looking to
get pissed at me a little bit to what?

235
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,190
Both fucking Jim or Jim or
something or other at Byu.

236
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,120
Let GM or could fucking man,
I'll tell you

237
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,771
right now.

238
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:56,500
He used to go out there and
all the frustration he got
from not getting his Dick

239
00:14:56,501 --> 00:15:00,030
sucked out there and Utah.
He fucking beat just focus.

240
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,040
I said Shit on taking jumpers
on the side of a barn.

241
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,350
80 to anybody. Watch a, I
hate Christian. Laettner

242
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,900
yeah,

243
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,770
I'm so pissed.

244
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:13,220
I miss that guy's whole career because
that was right about when I was starting.

245
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,003
MMM.

246
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,820
I was starting to be a comedian.

247
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:21,620
Well I started in 92 did he go 88 to
92 or [inaudible] 89 to 93 I don't know

248
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,280
what, but I was a failing
miserably in college. I just,

249
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,570
I completely missed that guy's
career and I have to tell you,

250
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:33,830
that guy is one of the greatest
villains I've ever seen in my life.

251
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,660
The look on his face and the way he would,

252
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,840
he would look at opposing fans and how
we just completely didn't give a shit

253
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:42,260
what people thought of them.

254
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:47,150
It was like watching a comedian going
on stage and the crowd turns on them and

255
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:49,940
they just stay with their
fucking material. Um,

256
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,890
was one of the most
enjoyable 30 for 30 PSI. Uh,

257
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,030
I watched and I thought that the people,
uh,

258
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,400
okay,

259
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,790
that hated them came off. I mean it
might've been the way that they edit it,

260
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,740
but they just came off as kind of a,

261
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,700
yeah,

262
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,720
I don't think they came off like
they were the jerks. I mean the,

263
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,110
the interview two people, right? One
Guy wrote a book called Duke Sucks,

264
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,103
you know,

265
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,880
I mean right there it's
like, well obviously they
don't, if they did suck this,

266
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,100
we could just look at the stats. You
know, we could look at the standings,

267
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:27,080
but the fact that you gotta write Duke
Sucks. That means obviously the mean,

268
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:29,380
you know that right away they're winning.
Right?

269
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,580
Like how everybody hates man United. I
don't know shit about the premier league.

270
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,210
I obviously know that they got a lot of
money and they've had a lot of success

271
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:40,300
with the level of fucking hatred.
The combination of that.

272
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:43,260
And then the combination of someone
like myself who knows nothing about,

273
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,580
uh,

274
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,740
soccer, football, whatever the
fuck I'm supposed to call it.

275
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,020
And I still know who man United is.

276
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,730
I know that they play in Liverpool and um,

277
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,220
what else do I know about them?
Um,

278
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,510
they got blue and white uniforms and um,

279
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,450
they're fond to having
ginger's on their team and uh,

280
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,000
just trying to piss off
as many English people.

281
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,260
If fucking Manchester shut the fuck up.
All right,

282
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,490
let me know when they pick the ball up.
Um,

283
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,560
I actually really enjoy it.
I like premiere the Premiere
League. If you go there,

284
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:25,820
it's fucking great. Most people
singing songs. Next thing you know,

285
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:30,540
you're eating fish and chips and fucking
slamming beers, right? Z Pack Ian,

286
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,161
even tighter,

287
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:35,690
Nexia nail you fucking ear lobe the
ear lobe with some fucking Neo Nazi.

288
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,080
Right?
But isn't that the experience?

289
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,800
Somebody starts choking you
with your little colorful scarf.

290
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,700
I have no fucking idea what
I'm talking about. Um, anyways,

291
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,090
am I out of Shit to talk

292
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,280
about? How about those fucking
Bruins man? Goddamn it,

293
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:55,130
they were playing great and then
a game we really needed to win.

294
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,490
We needed to beat the fucking capitols.
And what happens?

295
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:02,660
We fucking lose two to
nothing. But, um, I dunno.

296
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,480
I like the way that they're playing.
And even though this year,

297
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:07,100
obviously I don't think
we're going to win anything,

298
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:12,101
but I do see a solid team being built
for the future around some young guys.

299
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,300
Um,
Boston not can fucking Spooner.

300
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,370
And, uh, that other guy that begins with
an s and somebody else, I don't know.

301
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,330
I've been fucking busy. Um, anyways, so
listen, the movie, I have Zam beaver.

302
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,680
That's right. A movie about beavers
that turn into zombies. Okay.

303
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,390
There's hot women in it.

304
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,810
People get killed and all freckles makes
an appearance in the beginning with, uh,

305
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,610
someone who's way more
known than I am right there.

306
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,060
You got to go see the fucking movie. You
got to support this movie. You have to,

307
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,370
you don't have to,
but I would appreciate it if he did.

308
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:49,650
It's been out for like two days.
It'd be nice to see if it could, uh,

309
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,050
compete with transformers.
What'd you think? Um, anyways,

310
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,820
I got a crazy week coming up.
Uh,

311
00:18:55,821 --> 00:19:00,821
I'm in town and then I go to New York
next week and I'm doing a couple of

312
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:05,780
benefits.
One at Madison Square Garden.

313
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,340
And then like the other one I'm doing,
um,

314
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,520
at the theater at Madison Square Garden,
not with a Nixon Rangers play. Uh,

315
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,690
and then I'm doing,
um,

316
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,670
another benefit for actually Paul
versus unfortunately Paul brother in

317
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:23,870
brother-in-law passed away a while ago,
about a year and a half ago.

318
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,980
And um,
so they have a benefit for him at levity,

319
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:30,830
live levity live.

320
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,240
I never deliberately lever the law lived.

321
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,030
Um, that's going down a week
from today, Thursday. Um,

322
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,230
it's a great cause,
you know,

323
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,600
I dunno, I dunno what to say. It's a
fucking really sad story or whatever.

324
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:52,850
So I'm out there. I'm doing that,
doing a couple of benefits, you know,

325
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,500
trying to fucking balance out my Karma
here by doing some fucking good things

326
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:59,960
with all this selfish shit
I've done in my life. Um,

327
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,400
did anybody watch the end of the genx?
Anybody at all?

328
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,660
Jesus Christ.
Well that wasn't good.

329
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,450
Nah, they got your card now. Just
talking to himself in the bathroom,

330
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:15,770
doesn't realize he's miked up.

331
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,150
What happened? What do you
think happened? I killed him.

332
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,020
Jesus fucking Christ.
Jesus Christ.

333
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,370
That was fucking UN,

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,720
one of the most amazing
documentary series.

335
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:38,390
Even if you know what the fuck happens,
you've got to see the fucking thing.

336
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,380
Hey, it's Bob calling. Um,

337
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,750
I'd like to sit down and talk
some more while, you know,

338
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:50,640
California is a big state.

339
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,960
I don't know. Those are
block letters. I mean,

340
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,590
okay.

341
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,570
I guess when you look at them, Beverly
is spelled the wrong way. Both times

342
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,520
I wrote that one. I did not
write the other one. I just,

343
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,260
I'm driving my wife crazy.

344
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,650
Okay.

345
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,910
Imitate anal. Tell I'm, if I'm trying
to drive new guy's fucking nuts. Um,

346
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,370
there's a new documentary
that guitar guitar made,

347
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,000
um, on slash dad is a, I don't know,

348
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,440
I got through the second
hour and a half long.

349
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:31,680
I saw the first half of it and
it's just fucking awesome. And um,

350
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,890
Alice Cooper says the funniest shit.

351
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,840
He was just talking about the changes
in music and he was talking about grunge

352
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:43,580
music and he was talking about at
the peak of grunge music. He goes,

353
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:48,110
there was a time when I wanted
to go to Seattle and roundup,

354
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,280
all of the bands put them on a
bus and take them to Disneyland.

355
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,820
And he wasn't being a dick.

356
00:21:55,821 --> 00:22:00,821
He was saying it from like a place of
concern because everything was so fucking

357
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:04,700
miserable. All the music,
you know, everybody,

358
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,260
it just was such a turn in the music. You
went from people dressing up like women

359
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,570
to like fucking everybody like re

360
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,940
I hate my fear of um,

361
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,540
whoa

362
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,690
PE.

363
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,950
Wow baby, boom. Um,

364
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,110
what the fuck does it take?
Who started that style of singing?

365
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:35,900
Was it Lane Stan Stanley there?
[inaudible] you know, just,

366
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,270
I dunno,

367
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,450
it's like she's singing in the back of
your throat and on either side of your

368
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:44,250
tongue. Um, I dunno, actually,

369
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,790
I shouldn't say that.
I think that that, uh,

370
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,890
lead singer Alice in chains and when
the most original ways of seeing him,

371
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:52,830
Perry Farrell from that era,
him, Perry Farrell and axl rose,

372
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:56,140
I thought he had the most unique phrasing
when it came to a white guy sing.

373
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:01,141
And there were there any black singers
in that era that I can think of or was

374
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:06,750
it, and you know, well, they all
wrap it. My world is very different.

375
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:10,880
I was in a suburb back then
buried in my whiteness.

376
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,350
Let's see what black artists did. I know
back then, C and c music factory. Factory,

377
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:19,250
right? Wayne, Wayne,
Wayne, Wayne. Well, Wayne,

378
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,350
you know I'm thinking of that song cause
I'm going to the gym and they just play

379
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:30,530
the worst fucking music at the gym.
I don't know what it is.

380
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,560
I was fuck yesterday, yesterday,
couple days after Sam,

381
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:37,394
hey,

382
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,820
I fucking go to the gym
and I'm changing right in,

383
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,330
in the time I'm checking.
Like I took my headphones off.

384
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,220
I'd gotten off fucking country

385
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,160
as the lip, elliptical,
right? A lip, the elliptical,

386
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,110
and that's the new improved one. Um,
I got off the elliptical and I took,

387
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,340
I took my headphones off
when it got into the, uh,

388
00:23:56,341 --> 00:24:00,890
the locker room and I heard the,
the end of greases,

389
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:05,870
the word. And then the next song
they went into was a Banana Rama.

390
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:09,960
I heard a rumor. I Dunno
what it is. Like they can't,

391
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:14,961
they always have to be like 25 to 30
years behind and it has to be the most

392
00:24:14,971 --> 00:24:19,690
poppy fucking horseshit. I'm trying
to think if I've ever been at it,

393
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,200
Jim, that plays good music. The only
time I ever heard worst music was a,

394
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:28,520
I did a cruise ship Gig. I
did it one time. He had to,

395
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:32,870
we needed the money. Oh. And uh, you know,

396
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,050
they have me staying in the bottom of
the ship. I was so far down on the ship,

397
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:39,860
like I walked by cargo and the,
then the window to my room was round,

398
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,580
you know what I mean?
And, um, they fucking, uh,

399
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,640
that was the only time I just
remember really bad music,

400
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:54,641
really fat people and Jello with whip
cream and like these nuts on top of it,

401
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:58,550
which was fucking gross.
And I just hated the fact.

402
00:24:59,540 --> 00:24:59,950
Okay.

403
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,650
I just hated the fact that I
couldn't eat when I want it to,

404
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,230
you know what I mean? The one that I was
done, I was on some shit fucking cruise.

405
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,480
I then I need to think
that was called those.

406
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,990
I was on shit liner and we went to a

407
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,030
yeah,

408
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,950
Cozumel somewhere in Florida,
in New Orleans.

409
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,010
And uh,
I remember I worked with a juggler.

410
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,240
Juggler opened up for me and um,

411
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,320
I remember him complaining that his joints
ached from all the years of juggling

412
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:38,270
and he was buying all this
real estate in uh, Florida.

413
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,950
And I just remember thinking like,

414
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,450
I could not be any further away from show
business than sitting here talking to

415
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:49,310
this juggler about real estate in Florida
on a fucking boat in the middle of the

416
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:53,840
Gulf of Mexico. This is back when
you eat no cell phone service.

417
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,730
This is like 12 years ago. No cell
phone service, no Internet connection,

418
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:03,020
no nothing. I'm just on this
fucking thing. And they lied to me.

419
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,320
They told me that it was going to
be though, this is the cool one.

420
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:08,720
This is one that the young kids
going, cause I said, I said, dude,

421
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:11,630
I don't think my ex going to work
well on a fucking cruise ship. And uh,

422
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,170
Lo and behold, I show up. I think I
told this story before I show it up.

423
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:17,720
And the first thing I see
is this Vietnamese woman,

424
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,290
I think she was Vietnamese because she
had that hat on that whenever you watch a

425
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,900
movie about platoon of Vietnam,

426
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:26,750
you know those hats that they wear when
they're out there in the fields and shit.

427
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,460
She had one of those on and she was,

428
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,240
she looked like she was like
110 and she was already asleep.

429
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:35,060
Like the cruise was starting
and she's already asleep.

430
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:39,680
Like not excited whatsoever. Like,
this woman is clearly dying and she's,

431
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,470
her mouth is open and uh,
you know,

432
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,060
she was missing all the teeth,
like from,

433
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,160
from six to 11 numbers, the canine,
and you're right, number six,

434
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:58,080
that's number six, seven, eight, nine
down front, 10 and Lt. Other Kayla Canine,

435
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:01,350
that's 11 if you ever want to know
how dentists number their teeth,

436
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,520
it starts on your upper right jaw,
the wisdom tooth.

437
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:09,360
That's number one as the first
round draft pick. All right?

438
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:10,770
Okay.

439
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,180
And you got two,
three.

440
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,540
Those are your other molas that you're
going to keep unless you're a fucking

441
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,330
caveman. You got two sets of
fucking wisdom teeth and I don't,

442
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:24,500
I don't know how to number of
those. So that's three, four.

443
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,710
Then you've got those other two ones.
I forget what those are called, right?

444
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,720
All right. One, two, three, four, five.
And then you have the k nine to six,

445
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,020
seven, eight, nine a down front, right?

446
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,190
Vip Seating,

447
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,110
10 and then 11 you can do the rest.
And then the weird thing is,

448
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,400
is when you go down below, you don't
start back on the right side of the Dji.

449
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:48,570
You go straight down.

450
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,340
So you count from the upper right wisdom
tooth all the way over to the upper

451
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:55,920
left wisdom tooth.
And then you drop straight down,

452
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,490
lower collective settling
with power down to a,

453
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,630
what is it? Uh, that would
be 33, I guess, right?

454
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,130
Not 33. You got 32 fucking teeth.
33 I can't fucking remember.

455
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:16,020
It's a long time ago. Composite and
all of that shit. Pouring up models

456
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,520
I've had,
I've lived a lot of lives.

457
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,500
I could have said I could assist
on a fucking dental procedure.

458
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:27,240
I still know how to take x rays. I
could pour up a fucking model, you know,

459
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,710
sold newspaper subscriptions.
I had a paper route and unloaded trucks.

460
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,210
I can drive a forklift.
Well, I'll tell you,

461
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,100
I'm sorry. Anyways. All right,
we're winding down here.

462
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:47,300
So there's your little half hour. Isn't
this nice? You got a fucking paycheck.

463
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,510
What are you gonna do with that money
by the way? Oh, you're dumb. Fuck.

464
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,740
Are you going to blow it?

465
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,610
Are you going to use it to get yourself
in even more debt or are you going to

466
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:58,090
use it to free yourself?
That's the one thing you got to learn.

467
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,660
You have to learn about money.

468
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,943
Okay?

469
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,700
It's a bunch of people bitching about
rich people and who's kidding who their

470
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:09,220
cons. All right, they got their foot
on your throat, the back of your neck,

471
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:12,100
whatever you want to fucking say. But
that doesn't mean it's got to stay there.

472
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,230
You can wiggle out, you can wiggle out
and they'll let you go because it's like,

473
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,161
I dunno,

474
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:22,670
it's like just imagine grabbing a whole
pile of gold in the center of a table

475
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:25,520
and as he polling it towards you,
some of them fall off.

476
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,560
You don't give a fuck as long
as you get the line share.

477
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,190
So those are like people that they
want to just keep underneath them self,

478
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,190
a few fall off, they don't give
a fuck. So your goal in life,

479
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,030
if you're poor and middle class is to
be one of those coins that rolls off the

480
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:39,290
fucking table to freedom.

481
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,190
And how you got to do that is got to
make your money work for yourself.

482
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,760
All right?
That's what you have to do.

483
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,950
All these fucking jerk offs going
out lease and BMWs and buying stupid

484
00:29:51,951 --> 00:29:56,510
sunglasses and that type of shit. And
they don't get a pot to piss in morons.

485
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,210
Okay.

486
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,940
I guess I understand it on some
level you're trying to attack,

487
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,010
attract a better look and woman,
right?

488
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:06,610
Cause what kind of woman who's room
even remotely good looking is going to

489
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:08,980
settle for some broke asshole.
Why would you,

490
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,043
you know,

491
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,580
they have dreams,
they have dreams of spending your money.

492
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,940
Um,
but uh,

493
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,340
okay.

494
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,750
Oh look at that car. Jesus
Christ. I fucking love cars,
man. The old school ones,

495
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,650
I'm still searching for the one that
I know the model and I'm getting,

496
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,140
I'm not going to tell you what year,
but you know,

497
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:34,180
I'm a Ford Guy and I also like sedans.

498
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,100
I'm going for a mid 60 Ford sedan that's
going to look like the year of it on

499
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:44,490
top and underneath is going to be
fucking 2015 right down to the chassis.

500
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,233
MMM.

501
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,770
It's going to be a five speed and the
biggest fucking engine I can stick under

502
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:53,710
that fucking hood and
that's going to be a,

503
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,690
that's going to be my car. I'll have
my old truck, I'll have my car and,

504
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,020
and what the fuck else do you need?
Right?

505
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,400
At least fucking morons going out and
buying it. And I don't know. What do you,

506
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:10,930
what are you doing? Huh? With your
selfie stick? You dumb cunt. Oh God.

507
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:11,311
You know what I'm saying?

508
00:31:11,311 --> 00:31:14,980
Fucking kills me that I didn't come up
with a selfie stick that was just right

509
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:19,150
there waiting to be invented,
waiting to be invented. Right?

510
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,140
And then you take it to those shark
tank, fucking constant. A gun.

511
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:25,180
It's a great idea. Tell you
what, we're going to own it.

512
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,920
And I will take the patent and then the
money will go to us and I will tell you

513
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,530
what we made.
That's how business works.

514
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,110
It's legalized stealing.

515
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,960
It's why you got to get out from
underneath that soul if you are

516
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:39,700
okay,

517
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,520
if you are in debt, you got to get
yourself out of it. You know what I mean?

518
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,070
Just fucking baby step you
fucking way out of it. Um,

519
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:50,751
and then the great thing,

520
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:54,050
then you start saving up money
and then you have freedom.

521
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,153
You know,

522
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,780
God forbid if you lose your fucking job,
you know,

523
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:00,610
you got some fucking money or whatever.
I don't know.

524
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,840
I don't even know what I'm saying.

525
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,540
Even know how to intelligently say
what I'm saying and I'm actually right.

526
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,400
How fucking pathetic is that?
All right,

527
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:09,460
well there's your little half
hour fucking riffing, you know,

528
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,600
just to brighten your day. Add a little
more sunshine to your payday, right?

529
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,030
Do me a favor. Don't
blow all of it. Alright.

530
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,270
Take some of that money and knocked
down the principal on something.

531
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,170
Pay a little extra on your
car. Do something. All right.

532
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,480
Do something to get yourself out
of that fucking, that prison, man.

533
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:32,290
You can't fucking do that to you.
Suffer, right? You only got one life.

534
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,990
He should be living it
in a happy way with,

535
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:38,260
it's not some fucking asshole with his
foot in the back of your fucking neck,

536
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,990
which is how the thing is set up.

537
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,770
All right? So they go, I don't
know if that was motivational.

538
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,640
I Dunno what? Oh yes. Like party to t two
days is fucking week. So I only ended up,

539
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:50,750

00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,300
guy did all I did. I lost
one God damn pound. I'm 179.

541
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:59,710
I told you I'm going to be down
to one 62 by my birthday in June.

542
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,070
I have to somehow do that and uh,

543
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,550

fucking five out of seven days only makes

544
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:12,210

drank like an asshole on two of,

545
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:13,830
I can't fucking believe it.
You know what it was?

546
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:16,530
I got a Burrito and I shouldn't
have got the case of deer,

547
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,300
but I was drunk and I got that too.

548
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,220
And I'm just shoveling it in my fucking
pie hole. Just guy, you know, I'm only,

just be bad. The only today. Yeah, no,

550
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,590
it doesn't work that way. I swear to God,
my stomach. I, you know what I look like?

551
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,880
I look like I could do that shot.
Demi Moore did. Dimi let me,

552
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,730
she did that shot when she got pregnant,

553
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,230
she covered a fucking titty and then was
holding where the baby was instead of a

554
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:47,430
baby. It's a fucking Burrito
and some Miller high life. Um,

555
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,980
all right. That's the, um, this is
just me checking in. That's all.

556
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:55,020
I'm just checking in on you.
I don't know what this is the Thursday,

557
00:33:55,021 --> 00:34:00,000
Monday morning podcast d uh oh,
Billy's back again again,

558
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,820
again, again. Podcasts. I don't know what
the fuck to call it. I don't give a shit.

559
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,320
All right. Um, what else?
That's what this is. And uh,

560
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:10,560
that's what this was and that's it.
All right.

561
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,560
You enjoy your fucking weekend.
Hi.

562
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:14,760
Okay.

563
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,760
You go out there and you talk to some
broads. You get down to buy you a drink.

564
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,440
You turn the fucking tables. Uh, all
right. That's it. Go fuck yourselves.

565
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:27,820
I'll talk to you on Monday.
All right.

566
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:29,920
I don't know why I just
fucking ended the podcast.

567
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:32,890
I ended up the live part of it, not
the live, then the new part of it.

568
00:34:32,891 --> 00:34:37,360
Now we're going to go into some classic
clips from a bygone era in podcasting

569
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,730
when I was only one of 43,000
comedians that had a podcast, uh,

570
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:47,350
as opposed to now where there's 7 million,
859,000 podcasts.

571
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,790
All right. And Joy, these
classic clips. And, um,

572
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,660
and that is all I'll
talk to you on Monday.

573
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,423
Oh,

574
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,810
tell you a fantastic fucking
story last night. All right.

575
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:10,170
So I'm working on the road with
Joe to Rosa Young Joe de Rosa,

576
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:14,100
the fucking teen idol from the opiate
Anthony Show who was actually going to be

577
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:18,870
on the cover of teen beat this,
uh, this month. And it's actually,

578
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:20,430
I saw a little bit of the photo shoot.

579
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:24,780
He's doing a tribute to
Annette Funicello and, uh,

580
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,530
that other fucking guy was it Tony Curtis
who the fuck she used to make those

581
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:31,410
beach movies with or whatever.
Joe's going to be there shirtless,

582
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:35,720
holding a surfboard, and now I tell you
he needs, he's never looks sexier. Um,

583
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,540
so, uh, the fuck am I
talking about? I Christ,

584
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,090
I don't even know anymore. Um, yeah.
So we go out last night, right?

585
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,260
We're doing the show is these two big
titted horse sitting in the front fucking

586
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:54,630
row. All right? So we're like,
Oh wow, look at these girls.

587
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,900
These girls would probably be fun,
right? And I'm going to relationship,

588
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:02,230
but you know, I like being the wing man.
You know, I love being the wing man.

589
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,520
I'd love it. I love talking shit.
The girls, I love hitting on girls.

590
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:09,210
I fucking do it all the time and then
I try to pawn them off to wherever the

591
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:13,680
fuck I am. And uh, you know, so I
don't have any goddamn guilt, you know?

592
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,620
So anyways,
so long story short,

593
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,500
we're talking to these broads and it's
clear that there's some sort of strippers.

594
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:25,950
I Dunno what the fucking deal is. Okay.
So we meet everybody from whatever,

595
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:30,060
I'm going to stop naming names here.
Okay. So a huge group of us from the show,

596
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,510
from the crowd and everything. We go
and we head out to this bar, right?

597
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,820
So
one of the strippers is cool,

598
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,560
the other one has a voice that could
literally crack a flat screen TV.

599
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,540
All right,
so the cool one shows up.

600
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,720
First she sits down, I'm like,
hey, how you doing? You know,

601
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:55,500
I like at the end of the week I hang out,
buy a round for some people, you know,

602
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:00,140
I'm in a great mood. I had a good
time, I'm on my way home, you know,

603
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,470
up by some people, some drinks. So I say
to her, hey, what would you like to drink?

604
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,330
She's like, I'll have a fact and gag at
Google, one of those fucking chick drinks.

605
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:12,690
So you know, so I get her a drink, I buy
young Joe to Rosa fucking drink, right?

606
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,550
Everybody's having a good time.

607
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:20,360
And then this other person shows up who
I knew and she was a real nice person.

608
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,190
I said, hey, what do you want
for a drink? And she was like,

609
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,810
I'll get a vodka red bull,
right?

610
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,490
I got my $20 bill out and then this
trip is like, yeah, make it too right.

611
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,900
And I was like, wait, what?

612
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:33,360
What do you mean make it to you
haven't even finished your first make.

613
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:37,230
Don't be ordering off my money. You've
finished your first one there, young lady.

614
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,610
All right. Stand the fuck down. You're
not working right now. Not some dip shit.

615
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:43,380
Getting a fucking lap dance.
All right.

616
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,390
Finish your fucking milk and
cookies first. So needless to say,

617
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,610
the conversation cooled
between the two of us.

618
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,680
But I didn't give a fuck man. I was
having a good time, but whatever.

619
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:59,760
It was still kind of, you know,
whatever, just talking shit.

620
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:02,850
We were talking sports. The bartender
was cool, you know, we, everything,

621
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:03,960
everything was going great.

622
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:08,600
So which Shell and out and all
of a sudden this fucking, uh,

623
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:14,370
the other fucking stripper girl
shows up out and was so fucking,

624
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,030
it was just such classic female shit.
She's got a tits hanging out.

625
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,350
She's got the fuck me pumps on
and she comes up, she goes, hey.

626
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,400
And she sees a friend with the drink and
she knows God damn well she didn't pay

627
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:30,090
for it. So she looks over at
me as less. It's like, well,
that must've been the SAP.

628
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:33,990
Who fucking bought it. Right? So she
looks at me, she goes, hey, Belle.

629
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:38,900
And she's like, she's like,
what are you drinking? Right?

630
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:40,550
And I know what she's doing.
I'm like,

631
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:45,460
I'm drinking one of those Sam
Adams October fest that is,

632
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:48,250
leave it like that.
Nice and awkward. Right?

633
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,860
Cause I know what she's trying
to get a drink out of me. Right?

634
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,580
So she doesn't know what to
do. She's like, ah, is it good?

635
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,670
I'm like, why? Yes. Yes
it is. At this point,

636
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,880
Derosa knows what's going on. I don't
know that he knows what's going on.

637
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,900
So she looks at me like, okay, well
evidently he's not buying any more drinks.

638
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:11,200
And then she looks at Jo,
she's like, uh, hey Joe,

639
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,690
what are you tracking? And Joe gets
his shitty and grin on his face.

640
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:21,520
He goes, why? I'm drinking a bud light.
Why would you like to buy me one?

641
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,100
And she didn't know what the fuck to
do. She's like, ah, I, yeah, I guess.

642
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,120
He goes,
you know what?

643
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,780
I think you should buy me a bud light and
then you should by my good friend bill

644
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,960
burr here, another October 1st.
What do you think about that?

645
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,790
And at that point I'm fucking
dying laughing. The other
stripper girl next to me,

646
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,100
she's laughing her ass off
cause she knows what happened.

647
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,980
And then the fucking girl with this
screechy voice is sitting there.

648
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:48,430
She doesn't know what the fuck to do.
We fucking nailed it.

649
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,920
And then wait and then like she's going,
she didn't know what to do.

650
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,360
And Joe's just going,
yes,

651
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,420
why don't you pay it forward for all the
drinks that guys have boughten you and

652
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:01,090
that you've drank. And then immediately
turned around and fucking walked away.

653
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:05,710
Why don't you for once by a Goddamn by
a couple of drinks for a couple of guys

654
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,610
and she's, I said, you put it
that way. Fine, I will. I will.

655
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,300
I'll buy you a fucking drink. And
Joe's like, how bout some shots too?

656
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,190
And she just was, I don't know what
her fucking ego was that she goes fine,

657
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:19,330
I'll fucking do that too.

658
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,780
So we actually got to strip it up
by his two beers and two shots.

659
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,830
So we're filling like the kings of the
world and then all of a sudden we found

660
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:30,550
out from this waitress that on the slide
she tried to put it on a boyfriends

661
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:33,070
fucking credit card.
What a scumbag. Right?

662
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:38,260
So we bust her and we all week and when
there's big commotion breaks out right

663
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:39,740
before the fucking bar,

664
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,550
chances are about ready to
swipe the boyfriend's credit
card. We were like, Joe,

665
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:47,140
chill, Joe Ed. I just like
an officer and a gentleman.

666
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,110
I got nowhere else to go.
Right?

667
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,400
We get them to stop and they take out her
ATM and she had the fucking pay for it

668
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,430
and it was a done deal.
We had two drinks,

669
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,720
two shots from that fucking person who
you know has never paid for a drink since

670
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:05,020
she got her fucking tits. Right.
And this was the best part.

671
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,510
The second we got our drinks,
we set thanks a lot.

672
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,490
And we both got up and we walked away.

673
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,250
Oh, it's tremendous. Tremendous.
It was the best night ever.

674
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,850
And I'm just standing there drinking my
drink like 20 minutes later I'm milking

675
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:21,900
it for all it's worth.

676
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,450
This free fucking beer that has
stripper bought me was awesome.

677
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:28,850
Brian and Joe was talking to some
girl across the way. He looked at it.

678
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,760
All of a sudden I just yelled over. I go,
Joe, and he looks over at me and I did.

679
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,640
I did the Robert De Niro line from
when he was eating the Joe Pesci,

680
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:41,060
his mom right before they hacked up. Billy
Batts, right. He looks up and he's like,

681
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:44,210
what's up? And I just pointed at the beer
the stripper had bought and I just went

682
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:48,050
delicious. Delicious.
And that was my evening.

683
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,640
Yeah, it was fucking
raining out. This one,

684
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,650
one thing I've learned that when you go
to a football game and you're dealing

685
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,710
with the elements,

686
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,880
this is the more of a douchebag you
look like the warmer you're going to be.

687
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,220
All right. I saw the rain
and I said, fuck this,

688
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:17,180
and we went right to Dick's sporting goods
and I'm like, I'm buying that fucking,

689
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:21,110
I'm going to buy a raincoat with
the matching rank. Coach slacks,

690
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:22,310
I don't give a fuck.

691
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:27,230
I bought a pair of a wool
socks and I was good to go.

692
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:33,050
So I'm with Versie and you know they only
had like two rank coats left and they

693
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,550
were the exact same color.

694
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,080
This fucking great slush puppy purple.

695
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,040
So we both have matching
extra large fucking,

696
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,850
we got the jacket and the pants like we're
working at a fucking airport and what

697
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:53,390
Quinn we're bringing in the fucking soul
plane, right? That was a purple airplane,

698
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:56,960
right. That's what we look like.
So we show up to the game, right?

699
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,640
Neither one of us has comfortable because
neither one of us is a jets or a bills

700
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:06,080
fan. So we're in enemy territory and
a, it's fucking drizzling and out.

701
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:10,730
It's fucking cold. So I proceed to put
on this Barney the dinosaur outfit,

702
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,910
right? And right off the
bat, Versie starts Punkin out
gone, man. I'm just going to,

703
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,060
I'm just going to wear that.
I'm just going to wear the top.

704
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,440
I'm just going to weigh the top.

705
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:21,830
Trying to act like it's not raining
out that bad. The reality is,

706
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,880
is he didn't want to go through the
hazing that he would have to if the two of

707
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:30,410
us walked in with our purple on
Purple Fucking Rain Coats Times too.

708
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,670
We would have got a ton of shit and
I was prepared to take it. I had an,

709
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:37,570
I had a whole fucking silly walk
I was going to be doing. I had,

710
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:41,570
I don't give a fuck. So
he punked out. So, uh,

711
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:43,880
we ended up walking in and
put my head's cold, right?

712
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:47,600
All I have is a baseball cap on. So
I'm like, fuck, I got to buy a hat.

713
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:49,880
Can I buy a bills? Who gives a
fuck? They were in last place,

714
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:53,180
mangled by a bill's hat, and then I saw
this, this one with a Patriot logo on it.

715
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,410
I said, fuck it. I'll get that. Once
I put that one on, I'm nice and warm.

716
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,440
We go to, we'll call,
we pick up our tickets.

717
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,850
We go into that high school football
stadium that they have out there that I

718
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:08,240
actually love,
looks like an old school football stadium.

719
00:44:08,241 --> 00:44:09,980
You know what I like about
that football stadium?

720
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:14,300
That's about the size of a football
stadium that holds real fans.

721
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,890
You know what I mean?
All these,

722
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:18,440
these new ones that hold
like a 100,000 fucking pants,

723
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:19,790
all the bandwagon shitheads.

724
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,450
You know when you're all in for the
real fucking fans show up or oh in three

725
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:28,400
right? So he walked into the Goddamn
stadium. We love in life, right?

726
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,530
I'm already laughing at Versie cause
I know damn well what's going happen.

727
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,790
He's going to walk out there.

728
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:36,540
There's going to be some shitty little
plastic seat that's going to be covered

729
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,770
in fucking water and the only way he's
going to be able to absorb it is through

730
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:45,300
his God damn jeans and his fucking bbds
and he's going to be sitting there with

731
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:50,160
a wrinkled up nuts sack that's going
to be getting a hyperthermia by second

732
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:52,890
quarter. Why do I know this?
Because I've been there.

733
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,740
So we'd get a couple of bears.

734
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:59,190
We get this fucking beef on a stick
or whatever the fuck they call it.

735
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,460
We're good to go. We
go in there, sit down.

736
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,410
He sits basically down in
a fucking puddle. He tried
to stick a newspaper down,

737
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:11,210
which is very absorbent. And uh, I dunno,

738
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,940
we sat there and I had hoped for about
eight seconds in that game and the jets

739
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:19,020
came down and just fucking Jew.
They just kicked the shit out of him.

740
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,090
Christ.
They kicked ass shit out of 'em and uh,

741
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,170
and it was just over them.
So we'd, so immediately,

742
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,190
our solution is just to start drinking
the way we drank at the masters.

743
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:34,500
We're like, fuck it, let's, let's,
let's get going here. Right?

744
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:39,210
So we'll make a trip after trip and all
of a sudden I gotta take a Piss, right?

745
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,070
So I go and I'm standing in
line and all of a sudden this,

746
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:49,071
this fucking six foot five
goofy looking jackass,

747
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,310
one of those guys who's like six foot
five, but you still think he can take him,

748
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:56,160
cause he's just covered in baby fat.
You know,

749
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:00,540
he's got a couple of whiskers on his
chin and his cheeks a rosier than saint

750
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:05,100
nick. Right? And he's got this
Jersey on and this big stupid,

751
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,240
I'm a buffalo bills fan with the
horns on it and stuff. You know,

752
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:13,890
he's the wacky guy so I'm not
even thinking shit. Right.

753
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,330
This is bill's jets. I don't have a dog
in this fight. I'm not talking any shit.

754
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,230
I'm fine.

755
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:23,850
I forgot I was wearing my patriots
hat and all of a sudden this big goofy

756
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:28,770
jackass starts going [inaudible]
patriots fan. He liked the rats.

757
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,020
We got to ran away the rats. He likes
to fucking read this shit, right?

758
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,770
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, no,
whatever. He starts giving me Shit,

759
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:42,230
I start giving him shit back then the
weirdest fucking thing happened. I,

760
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,320
by the time I get in to
the actual men's room,

761
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:47,851
I've talked,

762
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:52,560
I've given these people so much fucking
shit that actually there's bills and

763
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:56,520
jets fans at a bills and jets game.
They're playing each other.

764
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:01,790
They stopped giving each other shit
and they teamed up together and started

765
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:06,150
giving me shit. Right. And then I just
said, I don't know what I was thinking.

766
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,860
I felt like I was on stage cause it was
like a crowd. I wasn't thinking like, Hey,

767
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:11,640
you know what,
Bill,

768
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,480
you really haven't had a fight outside
of your family since maybe playing

769
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,650
fucking street hockey in the sixth grade.
I didn't give a fuck.

770
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:23,850
I'm in a goddamn bathroom waiting to take
a piss in a goddamn trough, by the way.

771
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,380
And uh,
and then they just started giving a fuck.

772
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,050
And this one dude on top where he sucks
Dick, he shucks dig and he's like,

773
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:36,040
miming it like ridiculously wealth.
So I'm like, yeah, you're nobody.

774
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,090
You do that real wealth. Because I learned
it by watching Tom Brady. I'm like,

775
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:44,140
oh yeah, do you rent that porno? You
fucking fag gets a little uglier,

776
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,110
gets a little uglier than this other dude.

777
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:50,320
What the fuck did I came up with the
hell he was saying to me and I just said,

778
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:54,640
look, I'm sorry you guys have
never won a super bowl. You know?

779
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,800
Then the jets fan pipes in.
I go,

780
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,930
do you realize the last time
you guys won a Superbowl,

781
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,170
Charlie Chaplin was still alive?
Do you understand that?

782
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,970
Do you know what cars look like the
last time you won? You fucking morons.

783
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:11,050
And then, uh, then this other guy got
up until we've won three super bowls.

784
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:14,550
I'm sorry. Right. And then the guy goes,
well, you didn't play in the games. I go,

785
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,760
neither did you. Then he's just standing
there with this dumb look on his face.

786
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:23,530
Like, oh, that's where I keep staring
forward. You got nothing for getting that.

787
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,670
I don't know how to fight.
So all of a sudden it's my turn to pes.

788
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,130
I take my dick out,
I'm ready to Piss.

789
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,080
And one of these fucking pussies pushed
me in the back hoping that I was pissing

790
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:38,140
at the time. Fortunately I
wasn't. So I turn around,

791
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,700
I put my dick away cause I'm
a gentleman. I said, I go,

792
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:44,710
is that how you guys do
it out here? Really? I go,

793
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:47,890
which one you guys push me like I'm
gonna fuck, I'm fucking Jackie Chan.

794
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,460
And for some reason none
of them said anything.

795
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,070
I don't know if it was my purple on
purple rain coat or the look of fire in my

796
00:48:57,071 --> 00:49:01,600
eye, but I'm a fucking 42 year old,
balding redhead talking shit in there.

797
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,270
And none of them said anything.
So now it's kind of funny to me.

798
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,710
I felt like I was in like the world
series of poker and I went all in and I,

799
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,460
and I didn't have a hand whatsoever,
so I don't know who the fuck pushed me,

800
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:16,750
but that's what I mean. Come on.
Bitchy is moving the fucking week.

801
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:19,180
How do you do that? How do
you do that? How do you,

802
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:22,590
how do you push another man when he's got
his Goddamn Dick out trying to piss it

803
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:26,020
to a fucking trough? How do you get lower
than that? Do you guys have any ideas?

804
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,920
How do you get lower than that? So then
after none of them sending anything,

805
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,310
I go back and I started taking a piss
and then that other dude who was miming

806
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:39,150
somebody's sucking a dick unbelievably
well right next to me were one of those

807
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,520
stupid hats that has the toggles on this
side and he's still trying to give me

808
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:47,260
shit and I'm going to haggle,
go fuck yourself.

809
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:49,510
And then he just starts
screaming over and over again.

810
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,280
Are you looking at my deck?

811
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:55,180
Are you looking at my
dick like maniacally,

812
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,710
like five times.

813
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:02,350
I just sort of stared at him like why
do you keep going this, this gay angle?

814
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,500
Like why is there always a,
I dunno.

815
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,450
I think he was one of those guys.
He was kind of in the closet and then uh,

816
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:15,340
so he just goes to football games and
he gets really drunk trying to just kill

817
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:18,190
it. The families, I think he
liked me. It's what I'm saying.

818
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,080
So if he's listening to
this, I'm sorry. Uh, I'm,

819
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:26,081
I'm spoken for you fucking pants and
you fucking believe that first of all,

820
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,950
what's wrong with me? I really
replay it, all of that in my head.

821
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:35,320
Cause once I got out of there I was like,
I really started thinking like, what,

822
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,010
what did you think you
were going to do in there?

823
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,660
They're not Clint Eastwood yet saying
things. Clint Eastwood would say, what?

824
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:43,270
What the fuck is wrong with you dude?

825
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,620
Like I don't know if I've
said this before in a podcast,

826
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,330
a public bathroom is the worst fucking
place to ever get into a fight.

827
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:53,600
There is nothing soft.
This,

828
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,980
everything is porcelain pipes,

829
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,320
that concrete floor and then
it has a mist of piss and shit.

830
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:03,650
It's just the fucking, it's the
worst. It's the worst place ever,

831
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,680
you know, not to mention it usually
starts evidently when one person as begun,

832
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:10,730
the pissing process.

833
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,613
Okay.

834
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:19,800
So, uh, you know, older, little bit wiser.

835
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:23,790
So then I'm standing in line to go get
some more alcohol cause God knows that's

836
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,590
what you need after an incident like that.

837
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,720
And I was just kind of just sitting
there thinking like, all right,

838
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,670
now how should I have played that?

839
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,640
It w it should have ended when the
dude with the water buffalo hat started

840
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:43,250
giving me shit. What I should've
done was rolled with it. I should,

841
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,450
you liked the patriots. I
shouldn't be like, hey, you know,

842
00:51:45,451 --> 00:51:48,690
you guys scored 30 on his last week,
man. You guys look great man. I,

843
00:51:48,691 --> 00:51:51,900
I bet the jets, I mean,
I bet against the jets.

844
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:56,720
I hope you guys should have just ended
it with that and did it. I, I should,

845
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:59,580
uh,
I should have extended an olive branch.

846
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,230
That's what I should've
done in the future.

847
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:04,800
That's what the fuck I'm
going to do because, uh,

848
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:09,960
that was a, a, that was a potentially
ugly situation. But fortunately,

849
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,700
um, I think the people who
are doing it, you know,

850
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,800
had jobs and no one wanted to get sued
and no one was willing to take it to that

851
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:23,490
level. Uh, and when I say fortunately,

852
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:25,200
I mean for me and my face,

853
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:30,860
okay,

854
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,281
oh,

855
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:35,150
do you know how bad that would have been
to get stomped in that fucking purple

856
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:40,151
on purple rain coat laying there
with my dirty fucking patriots hat

857
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:46,580
and my team wasn't even playing.
I would have lost the lawsuit.

858
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:50,220
They would have been like, let me get
this straight. You're a patriots fan.

859
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,960
You are a patriots hat to a bill's jets
game and you somehow managed to get the

860
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:57,620
shit kicked out of you. What
the fuck did you say? You know,

861
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,920
that's one of the great things about
being a guy is you actually have to take

862
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:04,070
responsibility for your, for your
actions. See, a woman would be like,

863
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,940
there's no excuse. There's no
reason. I don't care what happened.

864
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,380
You don't hit a girl, which is
true. You don't hit a fucking girl,

865
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:16,700
but there's no learning in that.
There's no lesson. You know?

866
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,230
Even my best friends would have been like,
yeah, those guys are fucking assholes.

867
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,540
And the button, you know, that would've
been an awkward pause and it to be like,

868
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:26,060
dude,
what the fuck he talking shit by

869
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,560
yourself at a gay when your team isn't
even fucking play. What's wrong with you?

870
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:32,990
You're 42 years old,
get your shit to you.

871
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,630
And they would have been right.
