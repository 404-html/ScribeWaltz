00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,560
Hey, what's going on is bill burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:07,090
just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast. And I,

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,853
okay,

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,030

How are you? How's your week going? Oh,

5
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:18,960
that's wonderful.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,520
Now I know a lot of you guys last Monday
were very upset with me when I was

7
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:27,570
speaking in code and you just couldn't,
you know, about my European tour.

8
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:28,650
You were like, well, wait a minute.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,960
It rhymes with bundling mingle and well,
where the hell would that be?

10
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm not some sort of sleuth.
I can't figure that stuff out.

11
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:41,430
I got to start breaking down code.
This isn't what I signed up for.

12
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:46,000
I signed up to listen to a angry
half a Leprechaun, you know,

13
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:48,840

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,590

announce all of them.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,780
I don't know what the
big fucking secret is.

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,460
It's not like I'm going to go over
there to start spying on you. Uh,

51
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,630
I don't pretend to know these things.
Um,

52
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:23,800
those will also go on sale on
May 27th at 10:00 AM. All right.

53
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,440
And I got some dates.
I got three dates in Ireland too,

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,870
and I got a something in Amsterdam.
I think that'll be it.

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,880
Nice little 10 day fucking run there.
Go over there. You know, stare at you.

56
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:40,750
Pasty constancy. Where my freckles
came from. That's what I'm doing. Oh,

57
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:43,510
I can't wait.
I cannot fucking wait.

58
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,830
You know we are knee deep neck
deep into writing this season.

59
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,950
We've got the table read here and
a couple hours for episode five,

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,630
episode five, um, and we do six, seven,

61
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,150
eight in June and then
nine and 10 in July.

62
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:03,151
And then we fucking edit
them for the next 10 months,

63
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,570
not even 10 months,
whatever.

64
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,120
For the next six months we'll be adding
in all this fucking shit and we'll

65
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,350
basically have them and then they'll come
out may of next year and you guys will

66
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,070
sit down with a six pack of beer and
you'll burn through them in about three

67
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:19,120
hours and a like where the to
the next one. And you know what,

68
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,100
we'll make you some more cause
we're having a great time,

69
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,990
but I'm not going to lie to you.
Um,

70
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,610
it has become my life and I don't
know what the fuck's going on at all.

71
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,920
I know that Donald Trump
was here yesterday, um,

72
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,580
having a rally down in fucking Anaheim,
um,

73
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,280
which I thought was pretty perfect for
him to be head down towards Orange County

74
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,990
with whatever the fuck it is on his
head to talk to a bunch of people that,

75
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:51,790
you know, whatever the fuck they
did to their face. You know,

76
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,060
I swear to God, Hollywood gets such
good, so much shit for like, you know,

77
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,970
like everybody out here has plastic
surgery. I'm not saying they don't,

78
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,000
but at least it's decent.
Jesus Christ,

79
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:06,001
you go down a fucking orange county with
all those real housewives and those Wa

80
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,140
Bruce Jenner looking dudes.
You know what I mean?

81
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,790
Remember Bruce was still Bruce Bevan
when Caitlin was still Bruce and uh,

82
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,910
the dude had his eyes done, you know, and
the nose and all that. They all had like,

83
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:18,160
those fucking, I think at did
bit about that. My Act, I got,

84
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:22,810
we'll have the Bruce Jenner eyes and I
used to, I thought it was bullshit. I was,

85
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,010
you know,
you know,

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,980
my wife would watch the real housewives
of a housewives of Orange County.

87
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,710
I'd be like, all right. They picked
the six biggest psycho couples.

88
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,340
They could find people down here.
Don't look like this.

89
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,530
And then I went down to Irvine.

90
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,180
I was playing the Improv and I walked
around the mall and I was like,

91
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:44,040
wait a minute, wait a minute.
These fucking people at the,

92
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,340
I don't know what they're doing out here.

93
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,530
I think when you get into warmer client
climates and people have to wear less

94
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:54,670
clothes, they really start
doing the plastic surgery
shit. You know what I mean?

95
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,900
All you guys in those winter climates, you
can hide in your puffy coats, you know,

96
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,560
sport coat, buttoned down
shirt. I'll never forget that.

97
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:06,560
When I used to work in a warehouse when
I was a young lad, full head of hair,

98
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,450
fucking abs, the whole thing.
Half as many freckles, you know,

99
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,810
sunny outlook on life. Oh,
it was a long time ago.

100
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,400
I remember once a year we'd have the
company picnic and all these fucking suits

101
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:22,640
who look like they were in at least
halfway decent shape. They'd showed up.

102
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,960
They show up at t shirts and Holy Shit,
Jesus Christ,

103
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:30,530
the fucking rolls just
fucking spilling up,

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,350
pushing out the fuck tee shirts.
It was horrific.

105
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,520
I just remember looking
at these people going,

106
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,500
this guy's wearing the company this
time I'm taking orders from this tub of

107
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:43,310
shit. And they could feel it
too. It could feel it. Um,

108
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,770
it felt the eyes looking at him.
Shame. You can shame people. Good fat,

109
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:52,840
shame people back in 88, 89. Not
Anymore. Not Anymore. Now I'm,

110
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,740
now I'm the problem. Right. It's not their
fucking 8,000 calories a day. You know,

111
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,020
it's what happened to
them when they were six.

112
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,580
That's why they're written fucking ice
cream with candy bars in it. I'm sorry.

113
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,760
Anyways, let's plow ahead here. Yes.

114
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,720
So I have absolutely no idea what
the fuck is going on at anywhere,

115
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,000
at anytime.
Anything.

116
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:19,001
All I know is I'm in a fucking writers
from now evidently meet me in St Louis.

117
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,130
Louis meet me at the fair.

118
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:26,900
Evidently my Saint Louis Blues loss
last night, you know, they came back,

119
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:30,290
they tied it up for games.
There's two games to two.

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,480
And that's the last game I saw.

121
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:35,480
Cause I've been stuck in this fucking
room and I forgot to tape the last couple

122
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:40,370
of times. Um, you know, cause we, you
know, we had one every once in a while,

123
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,460
you just have a fucking a story
and you're trying to do it.

124
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:47,870
Everybody's got 15,000 notes. You know,
this isn't tracking. It's not on the page.

125
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,530
I don't think we earned this.
What's the motivation?

126
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:55,970
You've got to raise the stakes.
And for those of you not in the business,

127
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:59,540
that means you're not going to see
anybody you love for the next 48 hours.

128
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,330
So I missed everything. Evidently,
according to people on Twitter,

129
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,210
the sharks gave the blues,
the old right there, Fred,

130
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,830
and gained five and six sit
down and shut the fuck up.

131
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,810
My condolences to blues fans.
Um, I know you wanted more,

132
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:20,420
but a great season. You know,
you're beat the fucking blues.

133
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,670
You beat the fucking stars and then you
lost it. The fucking sharks. All right.

134
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,540
And I believe it was meatloaf
who said to add a three. Sorry.

135
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,380
Um, yeah, it's, that's
fucking brutal, man.

136
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,130
Especially when you get that deep into
the playoffs and then it's just fucking

137
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,510
over and then you just
sit in there and like,

138
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:41,240
now what do I do while you live in
Saint Louis? This is what you do.

139
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:45,230
You go to a cardinals game
and you'll watch the rams
pack up and leave your city,

140
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,950
and this is what you should do.

141
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:52,370
Rather than crying in your
fucking Peyton Manning,

142
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,830
partially owned beer.
Um,

143
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,620
what you should do is,
uh,

144
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,890
you guys ought to fucking talk to the
Arizona cardinals. Tell him to come back,

145
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,290
you know? I mean, that's what I would
do. Oh, what's your bill? No, I wouldn't,

146
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,400
I wouldn't even know how to begin.

147
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,560
I wouldn't know how to begin to go
about doing something like that.

148
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,660
Okay.

149
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,890
Yeah. I mean, I would have no idea how to,
I have no idea how to go about anything.

150
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,660
I'm one of those fucking guys,
you know what you should do.

151
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:21,180
You should fucking do this. So yeah, how
do you, how do you do that? And I'm like,

152
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,310
I'm like,
I'm like Donald Trump,

153
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:28,311
except I'm not running for president and
I'll build a fucking wall between here

154
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:32,610
and Mexico. I'm going to make
Mexico pay for it. Oh yeah.

155
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:37,390
How are you gonna do that,
Donald? Ah, the fucking guy.

156
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,840
Can you fucking believe that?
That, I mean, it's fun. It's, it's

157
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,950
Ben and Hillary Clinton.

158
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,620
I cannot believe people are going to
fucking vote for either one of them.

159
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:50,700
I just cannot fucking believe it.
Unfucking believable.

160
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,890
They'll vote for Hillary Clinton.

161
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:56,070
They'll put her in fucking office
and then bitch, that nothing changed.

162
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,340
How many fucking yeah, times. Remember
that Shit. We're going to fuck it.

163
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:04,420
We got a new guy. We got hope. It's
going to end the war. Close down.

164
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:08,950
Guantanamo Bay. It's a nothing
fucking chair. Nothing changed.

165
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,230
It's exact fucking shape. Dig.
And he got this fucking jerk off.

166
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,420
Who's just, Oh, he just says this. No
matter what. You bring up a Donald.

167
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:23,800
What's up with your shirt? This is the
best shirt. I have the best shirts.

168
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,280
I'll have the best shirts
of any president ever.

169
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,050
And this a fucking zillion people
losing their fucking minds going,

170
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:36,460
this guy, this guy's going
to turn it around. I guess.

171
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,970
He said the other day, you took a
physical, he's 69 years old. And he said,

172
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:43,990
the doctor said he had the, I have these
set, I had the, I have the best body,

173
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,240
the best body of any 69 year old he's
ever seen. Like how do you not see like,

174
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,680
you know what he's like, remember
that guy who wrote the twist Karma.

175
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,790
Let's do the twist, right? And
the next summary comes out, hey,

176
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:02,200
write another hit song.
Uh, twist again, luck.

177
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:04,630
We're dead last summer.
It's the same fucking song.

178
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,960
The guy actually breff
reference back. Like, you know,

179
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:12,340
do you remember when
I wrote the same song?

180
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,560
It was a year ago. Um, the
fuck was that guy's name.

181
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,100
I know it wasn't Charlie
Pride Chubby checker.

182
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,910
You know what's worse about anytime
you bring up Chubby Checker,

183
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:28,270
then somebody always has to tell you
the story of how he got his name. Well,

184
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:32,980
you know, there was fats, Domino's.
They said fats. Gebbie domino checker.

185
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes.
Everybody's heard that story.

186
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,760
We all saw Dick Clark tell that story
and then everybody told it in the fucking

187
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:44,740
bars. You can't. Um, anyways, so. Oh,

188
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,770
I haven't given you guys
the update on my side.

189
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,570
I had a uh, oh, sorry.

190
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,460
Um,
I think I found the cure for it.

191
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,473
Okay.

192
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,170
I have not sat down for more than fucking,
I dunno,

193
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,740
six seconds for the last like 48 hours
and it seems to be doing wonders for me.

194
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,990
That's the hardest thing
about having Sattik.

195
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,190
Although one I drive to the
fucking office and come back. Um,

196
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,110
I basically stand up in the writer's
room and when I'm sick of standing,

197
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:25,310
I just laid down on the floor like one
of those fucking animals at the airport.

198
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,490
Some of the pictures you guys are
sending me to a fucking hilarious.

199
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:31,400
This guy sent me one with
this guy was like, you know,

200
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,880
they have the row of chairs.
He was sleeping underneath them,

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,810
like perpendicular to them.
So he had his legs,

202
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,700
his ass in his lower back were
underneath the chair laying on his front.

203
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,590
And then he was like holding onto like
his hooded sweatshirt that he was using

204
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:52,550
as a pillow. He had that all wrapped
with his head on the side. Like a,

205
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,490
like a little kid sleeping
with the stuffed animals.

206
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,443
MMM.

207
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,410
I mean like how long is your
flight been delayed that you,

208
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:02,760
you just lost that much?

209
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,203
I Dunno.

210
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,260
Respect for yourself that you're going to
fucking late. I mean, it was kitten who,

211
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:11,890
I mean, I get on a plane every once in
a while. It's a long fucking flight.

212
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,800
You know,
you might kick your shoes off,

213
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:17,530
you got your socks on and you keep
your socks on top of your shoe.

214
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,330
She might do something
like that for a minute.

215
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:24,010
Provided your feet don't fucking stink.
Provided you took a shower that day.

216
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,090
You got on some fucking fairly new
socks and a fairly new pair of sneakers.

217
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,860
It's not the wrong with that,

218
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:33,160
but Jesus Christ and he started walking
around the fucking plane going into the

219
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:37,560
bathroom animals. So anyways,
anyways, let me, let me, uh,

220
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,010
let me get back to the sports here.
So the blues are knocked out,

221
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,210
the sharks have made their first final,
um,

222
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,270
the calves kicked the fuck out of the,
the,

223
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:54,340
the raptors as far as I know. And
I've only, you know, like I said,

224
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:55,930
I just watch highlights of this shit.

225
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,230
Dumb ass fucking move was the raptors
to start doing the a wagging the finger.

226
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:06,490
Why would you do that? You know, hey,
we're finally starting to win here.

227
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:10,090
Why don't we a piss off the calves
and get them more motivated?

228
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:14,260
They only have Lebron
fucking James, you know, um,

229
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:18,460
and Okc is in the process of raping the,
uh,

230
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,323
yeah,

231
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,270
the fuck are they? The California seals
who they play in Golden State Warriors.

232
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,563
MMM.

233
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,350
Jesus Christ.
And I've missed all of it.

234
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:33,500
And I don't know anybody on any fucking
team. I mean other than the stars,

235
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:35,480
I know those guys. So I'm going
to shut up about it, but I am,

236
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:38,840
tonight I'm going to tape game
seven of the pens lightening.

237
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,240
And I'm also gonna take the,
uh,

238
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,420
the OKC game cause I want to see if
they're going to close out the warriors.

239
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,063
MMM.

240
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,340
And then, you know, you know, it's funny,

241
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,020
all you need to do is just
watch highlights and you could,

242
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,650
you could still host a show.
You know,

243
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,190
I got to tell you right now, formal on
whoever makes the finals in the east,

244
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,170
let's say Cleveland wins.

245
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,100
I'll tell you a form of
Cleveland Cavaliers or you
got to be concerned with do

246
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,980
to durable Oklahoma Sturdy,
considering they beat the Spurs,

247
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,830
they beat the warriors, it'll to
perennial favorites taught the worst.

248
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,563
Um,

249
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,520
that's amazing.
The shit that they're doing out there.

250
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,320
I wish I was watching it and I didn't,

251
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:18,630
so I'm going to shut up
about it all right before it,

252
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,620
it's any more excruciating to
all you cons out there. Um, yeah.

253
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,250
So we're sitting there out right in
the fucking show and there's all these

254
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,040
Goddamn fucking

255
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,680
like storm troopers driving up and
down the street. If you see those,

256
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,160
those fucking lunatics,
cops like this,

257
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,930
the riot gear, once you know that
you, you'd think you'd only see them,

258
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,220
you'd think you'd only see them in
like countries where they have like a

259
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:47,660
dictator,
you know,

260
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:51,320
with a truck is driving down the street
and they're standing on the outside of

261
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:55,510
it, holding onto it like just, just way,

262
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:59,380
way over the top.
Like what the fuck?

263
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,090
I've thought I lived in a democracy.
What the fuck is that? Uh,

264
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,150
they were driving over to like Jimmy
Kimmel because Trump was going to go over

265
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:11,080
there and say that he was the
greatest panel guests ever. Um,

266
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,290
yeah,

267
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,050
and they're fucking driving
over there like lunatics.

268
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,000
One of the biggest bullshit things ever
is that in this country you're allowed

269
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,750
to protest. It's such bullshit.
You're not, you show up to protest,

270
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,860
you standing there with your sign and
then the cops come down and they beat the

271
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,320
shit out of you.
That's basically what happens.

272
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:35,530
Or you file for a permit and they tell
you where you can protest and it's down

273
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:37,580
the street and an up over a fucking hill.

274
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,740
And if we even remotely raise your voice,
you get a Billy club to the face.

275
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,210
And that's pretty much every single
fucking country out there that considers

276
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:50,630
itself a democracy. Now, the ones
that have a fucking dictator,

277
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,720
you're not even allowed to do it.
They just come out and they shoot you.

278
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,280
So I guess, you know,
compared to getting shot,

279
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,370
it's fucking unbuilt. I just
don't fucking get it. Why,

280
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,520
what is wrong with a bunch of
people chanting with signs?

281
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,100
I'm not talking about the people
start jumping on cop cars,

282
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:10,650
cause those are the guys that they always
show. But even if you don't do that,

283
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,120
they just come down and they
beat the fuck out of you. Um,

284
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,450
I'd hate to have that job as a cop.

285
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,100
It's gotta be so weird driving down
there going like, wait a minute.

286
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:25,590
These are fellow Americans.
They're protesting.

287
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,940
This is the sign of a healthy democracy.
And then you got your guy,

288
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:34,800
what are tear you
to slam a club on their fucking head.

289
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,060
You know, you're going
to ask me. Ha Ha. Um,

290
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,370
but they had like all these
fucking trucks and she,

291
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,330
they were just flying up and down
the fucking street, you know,

292
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,430
and then they'll put it on the news and
there'll eight people that were flipping

293
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,080
the fuck out and that's
all they're going to show.

294
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,660
And then the other thousand that's
showed up and were just short a standing

295
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,020
there and they're all going to get
defined by them. You know, it works well.

296
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:59,610
I guess I'm doing that to the cops.
Right.

297
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,860
Defining them by all the ones
that beat the fuck out of him.

298
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,410
That's what I like to do.
People,

299
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,890
I'd like to make a point and then I
like to just completely fucking destroy

300
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:11,880
everything that I said. You know what,
this, this podcast just be, just,

301
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,920
just be called the, I have
no answers. I have arguments,

302
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,180
but I have no answers. Hey, if you guys
visited the all things comedy website,

And,

306
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,880
I'd appreciate if you'd swing by and
check it out every once in a while if you

307
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,480
could, if you getting sick of this podcast
is plenty of the podcast to listen to.

308
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,000
Um, let me do a little bit of fucking
reads here really quickly before I fucking

309
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,410
okay.

310
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,040
What do I got here? 1618 fucking minutes
already. I got to get moving here.

311
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,780
All right, here we go. Zip Recruiter. Oh,
by the way, I did, I got to tell you this,

312
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,390
I fucking, I couldn't
sleep last night, right?

313
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,850
So like four 50 in the morning. I'm
just, I'm on, I'm on Twitter and up,

314
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,960
whatever reason,
I'm just fucking looking at shit.

315
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,800
And I put my phone on silence and I
turned all the volume down cause knee is

316
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,810
sleeping next to me.

317
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,260
And then there was a video and I clicked
on it and I thought because everything

318
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:18,220
was off that I could just fucking
watch it with the sound down.

319
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,880
You know, I was watching
all those things for people.

320
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,710
Somebody falls down and they
put it to a song, you know,

321
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,650
and there was somebody doing
like those fucking, you know,

322
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,170
a burnout spinning around and shit
and fucking slammed into this guy. Uh,

323
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,740
so I wanted to hear what song they
put it to. I didn't want to see that.

324
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:40,960
I just wanted to screen to be
bigger so I can fucking see it.

325
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:44,950
And I press play and it came on full blast

326
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,390
and my wife just goes, Jesus Christ, what
the fuck? I flipped out and I was like,

327
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,470
sorry, sorry, sorry.

328
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,890
And then she immediately went back to
sleep and then for another half hour,

329
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,940
you know, I'm still on the phone cause I
can't sleep. And then I hit another one,

330
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:02,340
like an ass hole,
wasn't thinking,

331
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,620
I just wanted to see what
happened to this person.

332
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,570
And she fucking sat up and she
literally did the Ralph Kramden,

333
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,730
she just goes out

334
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,800
the fucking door
and I wanted to start laughing,

335
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,830
but I knew she was going to get mad at
me and then she just went back to sleep

336
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:23,521
and I didn't leave.

337
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:27,300
But I'm waiting for her to wake up
so I can tell her that she did that.

338
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,390
Depending on how tired she is, you
know, cause she might be pissed at me,

339
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,750
might still be pissed at me.
You know what? That's one
of those later in the day,

340
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:37,570
once at the end of the day when she can
go to sleep, I'll fucking bring it up.

341
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,040

He looks,

365
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,010
what is it about buying a mattress
that leaves you feeling violated?

366
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,220
Why would you bring up
mattress and violated?

367
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,750
Why would you say that in the
same sentence? Jesus Christ.

368
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,170
What is it about it?
I don't know.

369
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:33,560
You were loose jeans and bent over
to see how much the mattress costs.

370
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,160
I have no idea. Let's read more copied.

Now this person's being pushy. Uh,

372
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:48,290
the fake presidents' Day sale
or the fact that you, you know,

373

you'll regret what you bought
as you do the walk of shame.

374
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,350
Out of the mattress store.
Walk of shame.

375
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,300
Like if you fucking bank somebody
right now, you're wondering why, uh,

376
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,061
those days are over.

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,290
We'll show up. We're not
asking any questions, we don't
want to know what happens.

393
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,491
And then what do they do?

394
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:59,420
Do they recycle it in a third
world like an old cell phone? Um,

395
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:03,560
if you do love your helux mattress,
keep it and your dignity.

396
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,480
That's why everyone from Gq magazine to
Forbes are all talking about helix sleep.

397
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,530
Go to hell. He sleep.com/birth
and get $50 off your order.

398
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,330
That's helix sleep.com/bar.
Hey, heloc sleep.com/bird.

399
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,690
That's h. E. L. I. X. All right.

400
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,690
How many more of these fucking
things I got here? All right, um,

401
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,130
the next one. Score big. All right.

402
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,130
You're paying too much for tickets
between all the markups and last minute

403
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:34,970
convenient charges, even print and
home fees. Are you fucking kidding me?

404
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:38,990
Over here you end up paying court
side prices for nosebleed seats.

405
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,820
Scorebig is here to change that.

406
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,510
Did you know that 40% of all
live event tickets go on sold.

407
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,140
And did you know there's a place
to get these seats at huge savings?

408
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:51,680
It's called ScoreBig.
Well then you bought them.

409
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,630
How did you get him?
The fucking team just gave them to you.

410
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,310
I really don't understand what that means.

411
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,480
Score bid works directly with your
favorite teams. Ah, that's how it works.

412
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:07,310
And artists to get their unsold seats
at unpublished prices only with score.

413
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,920
So that's when you know you're
fucking nuts selling any tickets.

414
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,340
When score big goes, hey, you want me
to take half the arena off your hands?

415
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,030
You [inaudible] I'm only with score big.

416
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:20,270
Can you name a ticket price and
be guaranteed to pay below, uh,

417
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:24,830
below box office up to 60% off.
Here's what you do.

418
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,270
Well,
what do you do to you?

419
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:31,070
Did you buy up all the tickets
Ashley Simpson didn't sell?

420
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,940
I mean, is this going to be shit?
People want to see one go to score big.

421
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,720
Don't think Bruce Springsteen,
STU ScoreBig once go to one.

422
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,270
Go to score big.com or

up 40% of the tickets, go on salt.

427
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,780
There's no way that happens at Bruce
Springsteen, Beyonce, all those huge acts.

428
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,600
So do you not sell those? Who
Do you sell it for? The uh,

Can't all be, what's that other one?

443
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,360
Everybody always goes to stub hub,
right?

444
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,330
It's good that there'll be another person
out there. Scalping tickets, right?

445
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,220

451
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,540
to make our,

452
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:35,541
all of our own wine are $13 bottles
would normally retail for 20 bucks plus a

453
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,690
more than $20, I think is what
they are trying to say there. A,

454
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,590
you choose the type and quantity of
the bottles with no membership fee or

cancellation fee. 100%

456

We partner with local artists to develop
wine labels that are unique works of

457
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:56,910
art right now. It club, Debbie,

458
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,710
is offering listening listeners $20 off
your first order when you go to club.

459
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:05,580
Debbie, I wouldn't build a
wall.com/burr and it gets even better.

460
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,840
I know you all hate paying for shipping.
So club Debbie a, he used to go to Yale,

461
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,830
will actually pay for your shipping
on orders of four bottles of more.

462
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:16,740
So take something off your to do list.
Just go to club.

463
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:21,690
Debbie had never went to class.com/berg
to get $20 off your first order.

464
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:25,730
Now that's club Debbie and weapons of
mass destruction. Dotcom. Slash. Burn.

465
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,050
All right, that's it. And
we're out. We're out. Um,

466
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,820
anyways,
what the fuck can I finish on?

467
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,880
I really don't have anything
to finish on other than, um,

468
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,470
I'm excited that we're doing the table.

469
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:41,700
Read for a number five next
week we write all week.

470
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,960
We don't have a table read and then
three weeks in a row we do episode six,

471
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:49,560
seven, eight week off just
writing, no table read.

472
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,510
And then nine 10 and then I'm fucking
done in the writer's room and maybe my

473
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:59,511
fucking ass over here can fucking stop
sending an electric jolts down my fucking

474
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:03,540
leg
laying down to the room.

475
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,260
Now I feel like fucking like some
Howard Hughes without the money.

476
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,300
This fucking wolf man nails.
You know,

477
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:14,850
I saw somebody the other day when I was
in the airport and they were playing

478
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:19,650
classical guitar, you know what
I mean? And it sounded beautiful.

479
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:22,100
But the only thing that sucks
about playing classical guitars,

480
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:24,630
you got to grow your nails
like a fucking wolf man.

481
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,030
You know one on one of your hands and
it's all good when you sit and down

482
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:34,950
playing guitar. But the second you put
your guitar down, you know, you just,

483
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,900
it looks fucking gross.
And I had on my mind

484
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,710
and I guess that's no reason
to stop because a instruments,

485
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:45,700
you always have to pay the price for like
trumpet trumpets, one of them, you know?

486
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,560
Okay,

487
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,330
start playing the trumpet. You get
that fucking Callus on your, on your,

488
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,840
on your lip. You know, it's one
of my favorite instruments ever.

489
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:55,980
I love the fucking trumpet,
but I would never play it,

490
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,910
play it because I wasn't
willing to pay the price.

491
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,170
And plus I knew I would only be okay
at it. Who wants to be okay with it.

492
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:06,980
Fucking trumpet, callous.
Um, not this guy.

493
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,830
I'll tell you that right now.
All right, now here we go.

494
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,320
I'm going to give you my
predictions for all the games,

495
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:14,990
sixes and sevens out there.
And a,

496
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:18,860
you can take all of these predictions
to the bank and they won't give you shit

497
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:22,220
for him cause I haven't watched
any of these series. Um,

498
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,960
the goal of the Golden
State Warriors will,

499
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,103
okay.

500
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,370
When the next Guy Willie, I dunno,

501
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,310
I didn't see the game. All I know is
everybody said the exact same thing.

502
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:39,090
I'll tell you,

503
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,410
this team is a lot longer and a lot
more towel to the near used to seeing.

504
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:44,880
Everybody did a version of that.

505
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,290
I guess they're long and
they're talented and uh,

506
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,860
the warriors haven't seen anything like
this even though they played Oklahoma

507
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:55,620
during the regular season, but I
don't think they were looking at them.

508
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,070
All right.
The uh,

509
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,330
Tampa Bay lightning will
win game seven tonight.

510
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,010
All right, so I feel like I'm o for two
are ready. And what else did we got?

511
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:15,090
The calves. Oh, the calves are one and
the next one, that fucking series is over.

512
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,650
You don't fucking wag your finger and
fucking Lebron James face or any of his

513
00:31:19,651 --> 00:31:21,300
teammates are. Yeah. To your fucking mind,

514
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,080
you know all these fucking
actors running around bulking up,

515
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:28,080
putting on their fucking underoos,
playing these superheroes, right.

516
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:32,610
And all these fucking nerds
going down to fucking checkout.

517
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,990
Who could fucking be when the Hawk or
captain America. And what about Thor?

518
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,230
Well he's calling, he's stupid. He
just says a hat and a hammer, you know,

519
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:45,000
if you cut his hair is
fucking hammer breaks all this
fucking bullshit, you know?

520
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,720
And then you get these fucking comic
con [inaudible] who actually dress like

521
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:51,840
superheroes for real and walk
around and try and stop crime.

522
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,700
You know what I mean? Cause they just
so want the superheroes to be real.

523
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,470
Well just go to a cavs game.
You stupid cunt and watch Lebron James.

524
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,560
Okay. Lebron James could grab Batman
and Robin in one fucking hand.

525
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,880
Throw him through a plate glass window
and he'd still get the end one if someone

526
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:14,640
was hanging off his other fucking arm.
Okay.

527
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,710
Just go buy a ticket and sit down like
a fucking gentleman stopped standing in

528
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:24,711
line with fucking 50 people dress like
Chewbacca and an an aqua man down in San

529
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,120
Diego. Whatever the fuck you go. Cause he
can sit down and talk to the cast of a,

530
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,560
I don't fucking and one of those God damn
shows. What does, what does, what does,

531
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,180
uh,
what does a car,

532
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,250
I guess mine's a comic con show hot
now that I think about it. Jesus.

533
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,730
I hope they don't play that audio. If
we ever do that show, well maybe they,

534
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,283
what are they going to do?

535
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,690
Throw some of their rough action
figures still in the box at me.

536
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,790
You know why it's worth more if it's
still in the box. Ah, I can't say why.

537
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,780
I can't say ah,
you know why it was fucking Weirdos.

538
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,420
Cause you know it hasn't been anywhere
disgusting. Um, happy red nose day.

539
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,150
What is this here? A people send me
this. Twitter is for kids. You red nose.

540
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,780
Fucko so he just told me what the
red nose thing is for. He goes, it's,

541
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:23,760
it's for kids. Oh. Is that what it's
for? It's for kids. All that explains it.

542
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,500
I Dunno why I'm such a Douche,
but I fucking cannot stand.

543
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,950
I can't fucking stand when a bunch of
celebrities get behind a fucking cause and

544
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,630
there's a fucking ribbon or
a God damn nose and they,

545
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,210
I don't know why. I just, it drives,

546
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:47,570
I know it's a good cause behind the cause,

547
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,280
but I fucking hate it.

548
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,910
And then everybody's going to find
their own unique way to have the nose on

549
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:56,780
their face. How they're going
to fucking hold it. It's just,

550
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,880
it just drives me up the fucking wall.

551
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,760
That and famous people
telling me who to vote for.

552
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,610
Yeah.

553
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,560
Oh, you know what? I didn't know who
to vote for. And then you told me.

554
00:34:07,561 --> 00:34:10,200
I mean, I guess I bitch about it, but
I'm not telling you who to vote for.

555
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:13,470
I don't fucking know, like,
make a fucking 20 minute video.

556
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:16,230
Here's why you should
vote for fucking Freddy.

557
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:20,760
Fuckface you know,
we're running out of water.

558
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,220
Ah, shut up. Um,

559
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,760
you know what's funny
about what I just said?

560
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:29,610
I could literally just stare in
the mirror and say that to myself.

561
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:32,220
And a lot of ways, right. I
never tell you who to vote for.

562
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:34,950
I just make fun of the people you
do vote forth. That's what I do.

563
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,750
You want some comb over orange haired
cont why don't you just vote for me

564
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,340
instead of Donald Trump?
The fuck is wrong with you.

565
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,520
I have the greatest podcast ever.

566
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,160
Okay.

567
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,290
Nobody tells a shit joke like me.

568
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:52,720
Okay.

569
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,350
This club owner told me after it,
40 years of running a club,

570
00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:00,460
he's never seen shit jokes
like my shit jokes. Um,

571
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,280
speaking of which,
I'm actually doing a of both.

572
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,260
Where the fuck you want to vote for?
I don't give a fuck.

573
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,370
It's not going to change anything.

574
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:09,160
We're a bunch of animals and we're doomed
to destroy each other. So, you know,

575
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:14,020
get yourself a dog and a hobby,
you know, find somebody you like,

576
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,960
treat them nice. Said a, that'd be great.

577
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:18,940
They'll stay with you and when
the whole thing goes down,

578
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:19,810
you'll have someone to hug.

579
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,010
Yeah.

580
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,300
Jason. Um, anyways, I did that.

581
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,750
Made me lose my complete train of
thought. Oh, tonight, tonight, tonight,

582
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,280
tonight. Hello. Um,

583
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,970
what was Phil Collins Thinking in the 80s?
Jesus Christ.

584
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:39,810
He's such a great musician of
the worst fucking songs. After,

585
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:43,240
after raw [inaudible],
um,

586
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,820
then all of a sudden he was doing,
you can't hurry love after.

587
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:49,740
You can't hurry love.
Then you did that song

588
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,430
easy lover was decent and then it
just went off the fucking rails.

589
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,810
It's a studio.

590
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,720
Yeah.

591
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,730
And that one where he was yelling at you,
you know,

592
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,230
telling us to think twice because it's
another day for you. A mean paradise.

593
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:12,940
You know, when you see a homeless person,
it's like, hey, fuck head. You know,

594
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,040
the way I'm living compared
to the way you're living.

595
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,830
You don't need to look at a homeless
guy. Just look at me. She felt lucky.

596
00:36:17,831 --> 00:36:20,130
When you look at me, you don't have to go
all the way down to that level. Do you?

597
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,670
You're fucking castle.
Um,

598
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,850
tonight I'm going to be down
at the comedy still, uh, uh,

599
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:32,500
doing a benefit for kids.
That's another one,

600
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,190
but I won't be wearing a red nose.
Uh,

601
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,930
but I will be jumping around
like a fucking clown. This
is for, uh, you know what?

602
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:44,020
I don't know what it's for. It's for
sick kids in hospitals. I have no idea.

603
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,520
All I know is whoever put it
together. Uh, I don't know.

604
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:51,910
I trust them. Steve Simone. I trust
the guy. So I figured, you know,

605
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,170
I figure it's on the up and
up. Who knows? I don't fucking,

606
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:59,920
I don't pretend to know things. Um, hey,

607
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:01,690
is anybody out there who listens to this?

608
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,020
Are you one of those fucking riot police
guys that rides on the outside of the

609
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:09,130
truck? And when you do it as much
as your adrenaline is going up,

610
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,830
do you ever just think of
how fucking ridiculous it is?

611
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,370
Okay.

612
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,810
You know, like what are we doing here?
We got to get over to Jimmy Kimmel.

613
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,730
Donald Trump is there, um,
what's going to happen?

614
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,830
Uh, all right. And I think, I, I think I
pissed off enough people with this one.

615
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,820
All right, go. Um, I have a great weekend
you cunts and I will talk to you on that

616
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:35,530
Monday. And like I said, you can take
all of those predictions to the bank,

617
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,140
but I don't think

618
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
[inaudible]

619
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,260
hey, what's going on? It's bill burr.

620
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,600
Yeah. Isn't that exciting? It's the,

621
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,550
it's the Monday morning podcast.
How are you?

622
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,820
Thanks for coming to my page and thank
you for listening and thank to it's

623
00:39:22,551 --> 00:39:24,680
Memorial Day. So here
we go. Something Nice.

624
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:27,770
Thank you to all the men and women who
are serving this country right now.

625
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,420
Sweating our asses off over there in Iraq.
Uh,

626
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,560
I don't know what you're supposed to say
today. Do you say Happy Memorial Day?

627
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:39,080
I don't think you do. It
doesn't seem, uh, fitting.

628
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,940
I Dunno what I'm trying to see if there's
a memorial day parade out here in La

629
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,950
and it's the, if so, where would
it be? You know what I mean?

630
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,820
And you, well, Memorial
Day parade is a very, uh,

631
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,800
serious thing.

632
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:59,890
So I can't picture the parade going
down sunset honoring the fallen men and

633
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:05,441
women who've served this country is the
parade goes by the fucking saddle ranch,

634
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,360
you know, is two whores and watching
some shithead write a fake horse.

635
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,030
You know what I mean? I just don't
know where they will have it out here.

636
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:18,050
I'm really not up on the parades out
here in la since I moved out here.

637
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:22,490
I know they had the gay pride parade
and all that's an Halloween. Um,

638
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,360
that one's always hilarious and confusing.

639
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,790
I've never understood the
gay pride parade. You know,

640
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:33,791
they spend fucking 51 weeks out
of the year trying to be like,

641
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:38,120
look, we're normal. We're
just born this way. Okay.

642
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,620
For the love of God. Stop tying as
defense posts in Wyoming. All right,

643
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,840
we're not against God. We just wired
this way. You know? And then they,

644
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,380
they had the gay pride parade and you'd
think they'd come down the street,

645
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,910
you know, try and look a little
bit respectable. What happens?

646
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,850
Everybody's coming down the street with
a Dick and the hand, they got fucking,

647
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,400
I just don't get it. You know,
it's just a Goddamn free for all

648
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,150
the fucking spectacle. I
definitely recommend seeing
if you ever want to just, uh,

649
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,040
if you ever wanted to see
what 300 would look like, if

650
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,331
that's what it looks like.

651
00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:25,331
It looks like that movie 300 with
dildos cause everybody's shredded.

652
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,111
I don't know what gate.

653
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:32,060
Why is it a gay guy put out like a fucking
exercise video? You know what I mean?

654
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,560
It's always these,
these uh,

655
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:40,220
he's half of fat guys who
actually heterosexual and
that we standing on a beach,

656
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,690
nobody is more shredded that then those,
those gay dudes,

657
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,170
I don't know what it is.
There are,

658
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:50,690
there are weights in those
deldot's is that what it is? Dhea,

659
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:54,650
Dhea fucking bloom to the wall and
you do pull ups for something. Oh,

660
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:58,890
speaking of that shit, I know a few
weeks ago I was talking about, you know,

661
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,990
wanting to get in shape
and uh, I actually, I, I,

662
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:06,380
you know some about that [inaudible] x
system and a couple of people said it was

663
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:09,850
bullshit ever. The people said that they'd
liked it. All I know is like, you know,

664
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,140
200 bucks in like 58 DVDs.

665
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,970
I was like a time life series, you
know, on how to get abs or something.

666
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:19,790
And it was just a, it was
too overwhelming. And I
go on the road too much.

667
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:23,000
So I found the solution. I, uh,

668
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,360
went online and I bought some,
uh,

669
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,340
I bought rings, you know, those
rings with a gymnast. Shoes.

670
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,800
I'm going to put up a chin up bar today
and I swear to God by the end of the

671
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,490
year I'm going to learn how to
do a fucking iron cross. And, uh,

672
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,140
I just watched that gymnastic
shit and I'd missed,

673
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:47,750
nobody is more shredded than those dudes.

674
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,260
And there's something I like about
being able to lift your own body weight.

675
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,850
You know what I mean? That, you know, if
you can like climb up a fucking building,

676
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:58,850
I think that's way better than
being able to bench press a car.

677
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,360
Maybe it depends on the situation
that you're in. You know,

678
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:06,230
some fat fucks sitting on your chest
going, what are you going to do? Well,

679
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:09,020
what are you gonna do? But
we do, we're gonna do like,

680
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:13,010
I guess then if you could bench 400
pounds, that would be like a good thing.

681
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,270
But, uh, I dunno. House fire,

682
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,300
you being chased by somebody. If you go
up the fucking building like Spiderman.

683
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,490
I think that, I think that that's
uh, I have to think that, that,

684
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:28,130
that's always better. That'd
be a cool thing. Jesus Christ.

685
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:31,220
They can't get it out bill. I'm
like, I think, I think I did it.

686
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:35,630
They did that they thought
you said, I thought you said
you wanted one spider. Um,

687
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:40,340
yeah. So we'll see if I can get you
the website. Here is what this is.

688
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,440
This is what this podcast is becoming.

689
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:46,730
It's becoming me informing you on the
fucking whacked out shit that I do.

690
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,500
All right. This is the training
rings is where I went to and uh,

691
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,610
www.training rings.com and check it out,

692
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:01,220
man. I want to be able to do one
of those muscle ups. You know what?

693
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:06,221
I'm gonna start wearing really tight tee
shirts on a on stage and then I'll be

694
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:10,340
ready for the gay pride parade.
I brought it full circle.

695
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,720
All right,
before I get into the podcast,

696
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:17,460
those of you who are on our
new to my podcast, I basically,

697
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:21,410
I do one of these every week
and, uh, people send me advice.

698
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,760
Sometimes people ask me advice, people
send me questions. I try to ask for them,

699
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,440
answer them. I mean, the
best of my ability. Um,

700
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,290
I dunno, and you know, I don't read,

701
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,950
I just sorta start talking.
So don't really listen to me.

702
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,660
Just I hope I make you laugh or some
shit and I hype upcoming shit that I have

703
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:47,190
like this week. Um, May 24th,

704
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,860
I have a real busy week

707
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:01,710

708

710
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,180
Uh, I'm going to be a Caroline's
comedy club this week,

711
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:14,430
but it's going to be weird.
I'm going to be there Thursday,

712
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,790
not on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

713
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,380
Why aren't you going to be
there on, on Friday bill? Um,

714
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,460
because I have to fly back to la because
I'm doing standup on an award show.

715
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,800
Oh my God.

716
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:33,060
Are you going to be doing
standup at the Oscars now?

717
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,900
I'm going to be doing stand up
at the Spike TV awards show.

718
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,530
I don't know. I never heard of it either.
But, uh, I'm actually Kinda, I dunno,

719
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,450
like psyched. I never got
to do an award show, so, uh,

720
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,030
I'll let you guys know when and when,
uh,

721
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,590
when that's going to be and a usual
that that part of the podcast sucks.

722
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,770
Whenever I hype what I have coming up,
I don't know.

723
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,550
The whole thing starts to grind to a halt.
I Dunno.

724
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,170
And then I never have half the fucking
information. It's ridiculous. So, uh,

725
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,010
all right, before I get into my, my
rent for the week, uh, I actually,

726
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,550
because it is memorial day and I actually
got a really cool email from somebody

727
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:17,160
who's over there. I don't know if
they're in the army or the marines.

728
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,650
I'm assuming it's one of those
two branches because they're uh,

729
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,560
the appear to be on the ground over there.
It says,

730
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,240
I hope to get back to the states
and come to see you sometime.

731
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,830
A quick story and it was on a mission
the other day and I picked up the radio

732
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:36,240
and called to my lead truck and said,
is that Pesto in your egg?

733
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,690
The other tactical
commander said it's fair.

734
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,010
I guess it was a little bit of humor for
us. Good stuff. Talk to you later bill.

735
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,690
How fucking cool is that? Huh?
Somebody is talking over them. Falucia

736
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:54,950
sweeping out the houses or whatever
the hell you do. You know to what?

737
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,050
A couple of my jokes. That was one of
the coolest emails. I have a god and a,

738
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,930
actually you have the name of the
guy who sent me that. So when you,

739
00:47:02,931 --> 00:47:05,370
when you get back safe,
I'm going to hook you up at a show.

740
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,250
All the rest of you
constant listening to this.

741
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:11,490
Don't start sending me emails pretending
that you're over there just so I can

742
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:15,150
give you a couple of free tickets next
time I placed slap ease and fucking Omaha,

743
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:19,830
Nebraska. I right. That's bad
Karma. That's bad fucking Karma.

744
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,050
All right.
All right.

745
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:24,960
Here's my fucking rant for the week or
eight people and I'm going to try to

746
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,980
remain calm throughout this without
losing my shit cause I think it's a very

747
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:33,010
important thing that a lot
of people are dealing with.

748
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:38,680
And I'd much rather try
to get the information out
and they may in a nice calm

749
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:39,514
way.

750
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,170
That way my message will be heard and
I won't and I won't seem like a psycho.

751
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:45,703
All right.

752
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,760
Forget about the fact that I talked to
myself for half an hour if you become

753
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:50,650
these fucking things.
Okay.

754
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,740
So last week I was flying to
New York to do the HBO show,

755
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,670
a down and dirty with Jim Norton.
I was very excited to do it.

756
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,040
Anytime he gets to do HBO is a
comedian is a big thing, a big,

757
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,010
big thing. You know, I
was psyched to see Jim.

758
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:14,410
Jim's the first guy from my graduating
class of Comedians to get a high profile

759
00:48:14,411 --> 00:48:17,260
standup Gig like that. So it
was really cool. You know,

760
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:22,180
I was anticipating seeing him in the show,
Yada Yada,

761
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:24,220
Yada. All that stuff. Okay.

762
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,210
I get a first class round trip ticket

763
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:33,820
from fucking lax. Nope, don't swear.
Don't swear bill. Keep it nice.

764
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:39,310
I get a first round FirstClass
roundtrip ticket. Okay.

765
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,050
Counting to 10 here from lax to new work.
Okay.

766
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,960
I don't know if you guys
are flown first class.

767
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,410
I do it every once in a while
when I get get a fucking TV show.

768
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,430
I don't do it on a regular basis because
I did that for one month and I got an

769
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,190
$8,000 credit card bill and I said,
you know what?

770
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,840
I don't think coaches that that.

771
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,510
So now I got a free round trip,
first class ticket.

772
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,050
Did I make that point yet? I think
I did. So before I get on the plane,

773
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,960
I haven't eaten,
but I'm thinking that doesn't matter.

774
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,620
I have a first class round,
fifth ticket.

775
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,780
I am going to be wined and dined
from lax all the way to Newark,

776
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:24,630
New Jersey.
I'm going to have fucking whine and dine.

777
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,610
That's what I'm going to have.
Probably get a foot massage, you know,

778
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,930
little hot towel. Maybe a quick
little, how you doing, you know,

779
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,333
first class.

780
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,290
And we sit there and look down on the
people as they're getting into the back of

781
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:42,340
the plane. I can like, I'm running
some big successful business,

782
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:47,530
you know, so I get on the plane,
I'm starving. Oh boy. Oh boy.

783
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:52,480
I'm going to get something to eat.
Get on. They hand me the menu.

784
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,400
Okay. And one is I got two choices. I
can either get an omelet with potatoes,

785
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,743
some fruit,

786
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,360
I think a muffin and some
orange juice or cereal.

787
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,010
And I'm like, wow, that's
sort of a limited menu.

788
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,690
Who the fuck would get cereal?
I'm going with the Omelet.

789
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:18,600
Who the fuck wouldn't get
a Vegan?

790
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,430
All right, you got me. But most,
you know, generally speaking,

791
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,050
everybody's going to get the x.

792
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,860
So I go and I read the final
line of the menu and in it says,

793
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:32,330
please accept our apologies if
your selection is not available.

794
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,160
And I was like,

795
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:40,030
what the fuck is about to happen here?

796
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,610
What do you mean please
accept our apologies if your
selection is not available.

797
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,950
This is first fucking class. All
right. That shit happens back in coach.

798
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,630
When you sit in row 38 F,
you know,

799
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,970
then they run out of eggs.

800
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
They run out of the eggs in the back
where they got people's fucking stacked up

801
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:08,520
like cordwood. You know, is
that even a word? A quarter.

802
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:11,960
Quarter Wood?
Isn't it an amount of wood?

803
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,410
I don't fucking know. That's a
question for you guys. What does it,

804
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,820
is that a quarter would I cleared land
one day and I heard that expression and I

805
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:21,390
just used it and I know
what the fuck it is.

806
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,320
They got people jam packed in
the back of the Goddamn airplane.

807
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,650
That's where you run on x. You don't run
out of fucking eggs and first class. See,

808
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:31,850
I'm flipping out. Take it down bill.
Make sure your message is heard. Okay.

809
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:37,160
So I'm sitting there, I started the front
of first class, there's like five rows,

810
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:41,540
I'm in row four. I'm doing the math and
they're going through and you know what?

811
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:43,640
Nobody's picking the Siri of course,
the nok.

812
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:48,260
Why would you pick cereal when
you can get an Omelet? All right.

813
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:54,350
Needless to say, they get to my route and
they say, what would you like Mr. Byrd?

814
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:59,480
And I said, I would like the
Omelet, sir. And they say, Ooh,

815
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:04,970
I'm sorry. Um, we're
out the eggs. And I go,

816
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,190
what do you mean you're out of eggs?
And yeah,

817
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:13,700
everybody ordered eggs in the
gay were added eggs. And I go,

818
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:18,460
what do you have left knowing full well
what they had left. And he goes, uh,

819
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,260
we have cereal and a Bagel.

820
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,040
And I looked at the guy and I said,
dude,

821
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,830
I paid for a first class ticket, which I
didn't. Of course I didn't got for free,

822
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:33,110
but I don't give a fuck or I
don't want to make a point here.

823
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:36,260
I got to go for big air. I said,
I paid for first class ticket,

824
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:40,770
I'm not eating cereal. And the
guy was like, I know, I know. Um,

825
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:46,100
I know you're right. We don't think it's
right, but this is just how they do it.

826
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,700
And I'm like, what do you mean
this is how you do it? I go,

827
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,180
there's like 12 people here at first
class. How do you run out of eggs?

828
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:57,430
This is first class. I'm not eating
cereal. And the guy goes well on,

829
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:58,730
on odd flights.

830
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:03,950
We start at the front of first class
and unevens we started the back row of

831
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:07,940
first class and it's like,
dude, it's fucking first class.

832
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:13,950
It shouldn't be a problem. I want
fucking eggs. And he's like, wait,

833
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,350
I didn't say fuck. And I go, I
want eggs. And he's like, well,

834
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:21,290
all we have is cereal. I'm sorry
sir. And I just said, you know what?

835
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,910
I don't want anything.
Right. Just started pounding.

836
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,220
I'm sitting there fuming stomach is
growling. I got a six hour flight,

837
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,060
I'm starving to death and the widest
Goddamn airplane seat I've ever sat in my

838
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:38,040
life. So like two minutes goes by and I
swear to God the fucking flight attendant

839
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:42,600
comes back and he goes, um,
I just talked to the pilot,

840
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:47,630
the captain of the airplane and he said
he already ate so you can have his eggs.

841
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,130
And I was like, why? He goes to the pilot
said you can have is eggs. I'm like,

842
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,110
I don't want his fucking eggs.
I don't want this fucking eggs.

843
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:01,500
I want my ex. This is first class. It
should be enough fucking eggs for me.

844
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:05,820
Alright. And the God, the peace
of pilot, he should get eggs,

845
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,660
fucking pancakes and waffles. Whatever
the fuck he wants. I don't want that.

846
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:14,320
I don't want my pilot upfront
fucking stop, you know,

847
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,170
passing out all light headed and shit

848
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,660
cause he didn't get any fucking eggs.
It was ridiculous man.

849
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:27,200
I mean how much fucking money do you
have to mix? This is American Airlines,

850
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:31,250
by the way. This is American Airlines.
This is how fucking tight they are.

851
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:35,300
And they're trying to blame it on these
fucking fuel prices. Oh by the way,

852
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:38,000
I ended up taking the eggs cause
that was so god damn hungry.

853
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,100
And then I felt bad.

854
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:43,610
I'm sitting there eating and feeling
guilty like I meet the pilot's eggs and

855
00:54:43,611 --> 00:54:46,280
then the other side I'm feeling like a
sell out cause I'm thinking like maybe

856
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:48,620
they're thinking they're going to give
me these eggs and I'm not going to

857
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:52,550
fucking fire off a damn letter
on their website, which I did.

858
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,490
It's fucking unreal.

859
00:54:56,491 --> 00:55:01,491
American Airlines are the biggest fucking
cunt of an airplane in an airline.

860
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:08,450
Do you remember what I remixed their
song a few weeks ago. Remember that

861
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,580
for those of you who didn't,
that was my new thing.

862
00:55:12,581 --> 00:55:15,760
Cause I'm sick of these God damn
corporations and they're fucking,

863
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:20,140
they're happy jingles as this
screwing you over every single day.

864
00:55:20,141 --> 00:55:23,740
So I remix this song. They didn't
win a little something like that

865
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:30,170
kid, Eh, fuck it. Yes.

866
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,170
I did that as a joke

867
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,840
two weeks ago and I swear to God,
I've never been more right in my life.

868
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,480
Or the next day I get off
the Goddamn plane bitch.

869
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,740
Then I find out they're going to
charge $15 for your first carry on.

870
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,370
Now you first started the first bag that
you've check and they keep blaming it

871
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,870
on fuel prices.
How the price fuel keeps going up.

872
00:55:55,871 --> 00:55:59,890
And I'm telling you right now as a
passenger, if you believe that shit,

873
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:05,330
I don't know what to tell you. They
make money off of misery. Okay?

874
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,030
Nine 11 they made money.
Okay?

875
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:12,380
I'm sure is their expenses go
up 20% whatever. But you know,

876
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:15,920
they don't just raise a 20 they raise a
25 and that's the same thing with this

877
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:20,500
fucking fueled.
This is my question.

878
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:26,020
All right, who's going to start it? Okay.

879
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,740
I'm not starting it, but I swear to
God, if anybody out there starts at,

880
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,570
I'm going to follow.
Okay.

881
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:36,571
There has to be some sort of fucking push
back because I don't know what's going

882
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:40,090
on with these fucking, these got
the incorporations they used to be,

883
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:43,610
the customer's always right and somehow
in my lifetime it's going to, you know,

884
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,800
fuck you and your mother customer.
That's the vibe.

885
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:52,570
You know when I went to fly back my round
trip, first class ticket, I show up,

886
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:54,160
my fucking flight is canceled.

887
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,880
And rather than flying first
class nonstop from Newark to lax,

888
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:05,370
I was now flying coach to Dallas and
then FirstClass from Dallas to lax and,

889
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,350
and there was no voucher. They're like,
yeah, we're not offering anything.

890
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:16,240
It's like six months ago I would've got
a blow job if you fucked me this bed.

891
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,660
And she's just like, Nah, Nah.
Then they're not offering anything.

892
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,960
You got to call the one 800 number
and then I call the one 800 number.

893
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:26,110
They're like, no, you have to talk
to the person that's dead. I'm like,

894
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:29,680
can't I just talked to the person at
the desk, the hung up cause I said,

895
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,390
so then I had to call back and in the
end of it all they gave me was 150 bucks,

896
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,430
which buy like one third of a
coach ticket. But once again,

897
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:40,750
I won't get any fucking eggs.

898
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:46,900
So all I'm asking is who's going to start
it? Who's going to start the fucking,

899
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,790
you know, what we need? We
need like a fucking, uh,

900
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,790
what's Charles Bronson's name and
those death wish movies, Paul Kurzy.

901
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,200
We need a fucking the
airline version of that.

902
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,480
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

903
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,870
who the fuck wants to pay $15 for
their first bag that they check?

904
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,960
Everybody knows that's bullshit.
Nobody wants to do it,

905
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,050
but we're all going to do it because we're
all just by ourselves twisting in the

906
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:15,600
wind, okay? But if we all showed
up the first day, June 15th,

907
00:58:15,601 --> 00:58:16,361
or that promotion,

908
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:19,570
whenever the fuck it is and you show
up at the airport with angry faces and

909
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:20,404
tortures,

910
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:24,340
like we're going to go try
and get Frankenstein guarantee
and none of us has to

911
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:27,400
pay 15 bucks. Okay? I'm not
trying to incite a riot here.

912
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,520
I'm just saying somebody start
passing out the two by fours.

913
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,050
I'm down with it,
all right?

914
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:39,490
I'm not going to lead it
because I procrastinate and
everybody knows, you know,

915
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,490
they always chop off the
heads of the body falls. Okay?

916
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:46,270
If I learned anything from the
1960s black, white male seem,

917
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,350
if you fuck with the deal,
you have a comfortable ride
in your future. All right?

918
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,080
But some good things do happen. So fuck,

919
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,890
I'm so pissed right now.
If fucking believe that the pilots eggs,

920
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,640
actually the pilot,
can you fucking believe that

921
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,140
30 years ago. But God damn
stewardesses, they didn't. It was,

922
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,580
first of all, they were all
hot. That's the one thing. Okay.

923
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:15,280
It was a goddamn glamorous job.
All right?

924
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,630
You had a one in 10 chance of hooking
up with one of the hottest stewardesses.

925
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:22,190
That's why people used to wear suits.
You wanted to look through.

926
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:25,070
It was like a nightclub. Everyone
was oozing. People were smoking.

927
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,430
You were having a Goddamn party in the
fucking sky. Here's the one for you.

928
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,980
You know what?
First class used to be,

929
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,220
this is the greatest story I ever
heard as far as the first class.

930
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:37,430
This is what it used to be as
compared to my fucking out of eggs.

931
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:42,440
First Class experience. Pan Am
Airlines. I'm dating myself here.

932
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,060
All right.
Pan Am when used to fly to uh,

933
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,680
I think it was John F. Kennedy airport.
I read about this shit on the Internet,

934
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:54,260
right? So it's gotta be
true. Um, first of all,

935
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:57,860
the metlife building that's right above
grand central station used to be the Pan

936
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:02,420
Am building. So when you use the
fly first class to JFK airport,

937
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,160
you got off first class and you,

938
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:09,890
you didn't go to a fucking town car and
sit and God damn traffic on the lie or

939
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:13,910
wherever the fuck you go
through the midtown tunnel
and take an hour and a half,

940
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,620
which ruins the first class experience.

941
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,460
You got off the fucking
plane at JFK airport.

942
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,000
They put you on a helicopter,
swear to God.

943
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:27,230
They put you on a helicopter and they flew
you to the top of the Pan Am building.

944
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,120
You got off drinks.

945
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:33,380
We're waiting probably more broad with
those scarves tied around their necks

946
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:37,140
like fucking Dick Cavett
you get another blow job.

947
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,180
Then you took the fucking
elevator down to the first floor,

948
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:45,290
jumped in a cab,
you went to your hotel pre herpes.

949
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,740
Pre-Aids here's some penicillin.
Have a good fucking time. All right.

950
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,810
That was first class back then. Then, uh,
something happened where the, the wind,

951
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:56,090
something happened with a wind,

952
01:00:56,091 --> 01:00:59,270
tipped over a helicopter and the blades
went flying down to the street and shot

953
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:01,370
somebody in half. Okay. But
that's beside the point.

954
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,570
I really did happen by the way.
I forget who had shopped and half,

955
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:09,800
but he was a son of somebody.
Somebody's obscurely famous, you know,

956
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,680
like the guy who invented
the bookmark or something.

957
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:18,580
All Jesus Christ. Some fucking
winded after that story. Um,

958
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:23,530
which brings me to my, uh,
president of advice that
somebody gave me this week. Um,

959
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:28,430
know, taking naps can really help me out
when I get too negative and agitated.

960
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,730
But this can be hard for
you since you fly so much.

961
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:35,570
Running and lifting weights
also helps me out too. Well,

962
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:39,600
thank you for that
advice. Uh, I don't know.

963
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:44,090
I think the running and lifting weights
would help me out as you can tell with

964
01:01:44,091 --> 01:01:48,770
my rage issues. But, uh, taking naps,
I can't do it. Like, uh, I dunno.

965
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,890
My brain wakes me up.
I don't know how to shut it off.

966
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,160
So if anybody out there knows how
I can shut this fucking thing off.

967
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,570
All right, I'm really worked up here.
All right, here's a, here's some advice.

968
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,561
Somebody,
this is how,

969
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:06,140
this is a question I get like every week
people will always give me this from

970
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:10,800
they 50 people say I'm funny.
How do I become a comedian? Um,

971
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,840
I must get asked this like 10
times a week. This is what you do.

972
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,960
Fight five minutes of Shit
that you think is funny.

973
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:23,130
Sign up for an open mic when
they call your name. Go up there.

974
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,630
Hang on for dear life.

975
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:29,550
Spit out as much of it as you can remember
tape you said go home, listen to it.

976
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,100
Keep the jokes that work.

977
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:36,390
Got To get rid of the ones that didn't
and then write some more jokes to take

978
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:37,224
place.

979
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,050
Take the place of the ones that didn't
work and then you sign up for another

980
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:43,500
open mic. You repeat the process
and you just keep doing that.

981
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:45,570
And then eventually you build,
enact. And next thing you know,

982
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:50,880
you're a comedian flying first class to
a dream TV gig without any fucking eggs.

983
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:53,010
I don't know you get x, but we're
going to give you the guilt trip.

984
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,540
You can have the pilots egg. He'll just
sit up there and be hungry. What the fuck?

985
01:02:59,290 --> 01:02:59,930
Okay,

986
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:02,020
it's podcasts I'm sensing is
getting a little long here.

987
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,810
Let me get onto the questions and I'll
get out of here and you guys can get on

988
01:03:04,811 --> 01:03:09,640
with your memorial days.
Okay. Question number one.

989
01:03:09,641 --> 01:03:11,570
You've always seen dimension
sports in your rack.

990
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:15,160
That was wondering if you were involved
in any fantasy sports leagues. No,

991
01:03:15,161 --> 01:03:19,660
I am not fantasy sports leagues
have for Geeks. I fucking,

992
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:23,890
I can't stand them. They have ruined
sports. Talk in a bar. People aren't,

993
01:03:23,891 --> 01:03:28,180
aren't like affiliated with fucking
teams anymore. You Bring, oh my God.

994
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:32,260
You see liking salon.
Really?

995
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,010
Really? What else do you have on
your fantasy team? Huh? A girlfriend.

996
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:41,530
Somebody who satisfies you sexually.
What else do you have a dream job?

997
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:45,370
We not fucking walled in by a cubicle.
No,

998
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,130
I don't play fantasy sports leaks.
Uh, actually, you know what?

999
01:03:48,131 --> 01:03:51,230
I don't really know much about them.
I find that sports takes, they take,

1000
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:55,360
it takes up too much of my time anyways,
so I don't watch pregame.

1001
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:58,660
I'm not in fantasy sports leagues.
I don't watch post games.

1002
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,960
I don't listen to any of those fucking
ranting raving lunatics that ESPN has

1003
01:04:04,661 --> 01:04:09,130
now. Anybody on ESPN for some
reason listens to these things.

1004
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:12,250
Why is every show become two
people screaming at each other?

1005
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:18,270
And why do you guys hype things up to
such a ridiculous fucking level that it

1006
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:21,740
never, you know what I mean? Like
patriots was six and out. They're like,

1007
01:04:21,741 --> 01:04:23,480
it just the greatest team ever.

1008
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:25,903
Okay.

1009
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I
guess they are. I mean,

1010
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,430
let's completely ignore the fact
that the cults were 13 and eight.

1011
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:34,760
Oh two years earlier. Let's,
let's declare them the Glitz.

1012
01:04:34,761 --> 01:04:38,600
Ask if they're the greatest team ever
when there's still fucking 20 games left

1013
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:43,310
in the season. You dumb cunts.
All right. Um, number two, uh,

1014
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:43,940
Bill,

1015
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:48,940
which end of your comedy crowds spectrum
do you prefer to put up with the Douche

1016
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,950
bag frat guys who drank so much?

1017
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:56,780
They decided to try and heckle you after
your show while you're signing cds?

1018
01:04:56,870 --> 01:05:01,760
Oh yeah. I know who this is. That
happened me in Chicago. Okay. Um,

1019
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:06,020
or the older men who came to the show
with their wives that are afraid to laugh

1020
01:05:06,021 --> 01:05:09,410
at your jokes because they want
to get laid that night. Um,

1021
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,150
okay.

1022
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,480
I definitely prefer the,
the,

1023
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:16,100
the older guys who don't laugh cause
they want to get laid by their wife that

1024
01:05:16,101 --> 01:05:20,970
night. Um, because if I pick up
on it, it usually ends up being a,

1025
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,710
a much funny situation cause I can see,

1026
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:28,600
I can make the woman's somehow feel guilty
for doing what she's doing. I guess.

1027
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:30,220
I Dunno, riff on it. That's more fun.

1028
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:33,430
But as far and the heckling
you after the show,

1029
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:35,320
cause he didn't have the balls
to do it during the show.

1030
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:39,250
It's just sad and it always makes me feel
like that person actually wanted to be

1031
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:41,470
a comedian.
They just never had the balls to do it.

1032
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,910
And I'm watching the death of a dream.
Um Wow.

1033
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:47,040
That was dark.
Okay.

1034
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:52,170
Question number three is a
he slash she a bad comedian.

1035
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,240
If they try to talk to the audience.

1036
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,480
I have noticed in the last
few years the worst comics,

1037
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:01,720
so the ones that base
their comedy comedy on, hi,

1038
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:06,520
where are you from so they
can goof on the audience. Uh,

1039
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,010
wait a minute.
Fucking seem ws so they can goof on.

1040
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:12,910
The audience are the worst comic
smelt. That wasn't me. That was him.

1041
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:14,080
He wrote a bad sentence there.

1042
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,100
Even the last time I saw you in
southern California, the Improv,

1043
01:06:18,101 --> 01:06:21,670
the two people before you kept trying to
find ways to make fun of the people in

1044
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:24,250
the audience as a comic.

1045
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:27,070
Do you think that this is a
sign that they are a bad comic?

1046
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:31,090
I would think it would turn everyone else
off because they are too worried about

1047
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:31,811
being talked to.

1048
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:36,811
Next one time I was watching a taping of
Frazier in La and 90% of the people got

1049
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:42,330
up because the comic in the stands
with us kept ripping on everyone.

1050
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,400
Right? First of all,
let's fucking hilarious.

1051
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:51,700
The guy doing the audience warmup was in
between takes of Frazier was just going,

1052
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:52,451
what are you guys,

1053
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:56,980
a bunch of fucking Douche bags
and 90% of the crowd left.

1054
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,400
Um, I don't want to be
a country here, but uh,

1055
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:04,600
I dunno about 90% been like,
just like 30%.

1056
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:08,860
I would think if 90% of the studio
audience walked out at some point somebody

1057
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:12,070
with a clipboard and a headset would
have walked over to the comic and when

1058
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,370
would have been like, hey dude, why don't
you fucking tone it down a little bit?

1059
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:16,263
Okay.

1060
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:21,280
Kelsey Grammer's getting a little pissed
because 90% of the crowd has left.

1061
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:24,940
Can you stop calling calling them cunts?
You know,

1062
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,170
I know what you're saying though.

1063
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:31,030
What do I think as far as
people working with the,

1064
01:07:31,031 --> 01:07:32,980
on the audience?
I definitely know what you mean.

1065
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,730
There's definitely guys who don't have
enough jokes. So then they go, hey,

1066
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:40,220
where are you from? What do you
do? What would that job sucks. Um,

1067
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,480
but then there's other guys I see fuck
with the crowd and they're brilliant at

1068
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:45,700
it.
I would just basically say,

1069
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:51,030
if you don't have any material and
you suck at playing to the crowd,

1070
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:55,570
then yeah, you suck at it, then
you suck as a comic. Absolutely.

1071
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,270
But if you're good at it
and that's your thing,

1072
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,810
I don't think there's anything
wrong with it. Jesus Christ.

1073
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,410
I answered that like Hillary Clinton.
Well,

1074
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,820
I think it could be a good
thing and a bad thing now,

1075
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,040
whenever it just fucking elect me.
All right.

1076
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,790
Has she given up yet? Jesus Christ,
she's like one of the fucking,

1077
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:18,920
she just won't tap out.
She's like one of the Gracies.

1078
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:22,100
They've got like a fucking arm bend, Ben
Dolly back. I still think I'm doing good.

1079
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,240
I think I'm going to win.
I'll take some.

1080
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,980
That's the one thing I've
learned about this election.

1081
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:32,900
I have learned that I completely
do not give a shit about race.

1082
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:37,730
I really don't. Black, white,
Puerto Rican. I don't give
a fuck. If you make sense,

1083
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:43,130
I will vote for you. Right.
So my hatred of women,

1084
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,810
whooo.
It's fucking unreal.

1085
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,610
I don't hate women.
It's just that fucking voice.

1086
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,350
Good Lord. And you know, they,
they got to bring it down.

1087
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,510
The problem is,
is women,

1088
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,070
they raise their voice up because
they try to do what the guys do. Guys,

1089
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:07,820
when they raised their voice, it
has a commanding sound to it. Women,

1090
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,330
when they raise their voice up,
they sound like a fucking Segal.

1091
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:16,460
So she needs to do is deliver
her speeches and a middle range,

1092
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:20,510
maybe even drop it down to a whisper
a little bit. And I swear to God,

1093
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:25,040
that's where the female voice has power,
medium voice to a whisper.

1094
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,730
It can make your dick hard. You
know, you fix hard. I Dunno.

1095
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,850
You're not thinking clearly you're going
to fucking vote for, but when you're,

1096
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:36,230
when you're fucking way up there,
people are not going to hear your message.

1097
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,800
I talk more shit on this fucking thing.
All right, the last question. Here we go,

1098
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:47,610
then I'm gonna be Outta here. Question
number four. Bill, you spoke about us, uh,

1099
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,260
going home with you. You
know, hearing you, what all,
this is last week's podcast.

1100
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:54,020
When I parked my car in the
garage and all that. Yeah,

1101
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:58,400
we heard you walk up the steps, close
the garage door, which made me think,

1102
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:03,140
uh, what's your take on stockers,
celebrity stockers, if you will?

1103
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:09,230
Uh, she like insulting me, their
celebrity starkers if you will,

1104
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:11,180
celebrity in quotes.
It's God knows,

1105
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:14,570
I love the ATS doesn't count as being a
celebrity, which it doesn't. You're right.

1106
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:19,100
Okay. Um, celebrity stalkers if you
will. Have you ever had one? If you did,

1107
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:23,510
would you be flattered or
freak the fuck out? Uh,

1108
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,080
okay. Um, uh, no. Yeah,

1109
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:31,340
obviously who the fuck wants
to be stopped? You know
what I mean? I don't really,

1110
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:35,180
I mean, I wouldn't want to be stalked
by the hottest chick on the planet.

1111
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:39,610
That's how frightening stockers are.
Because no matter how good looking the a,

1112
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:44,510
they have that crazed, um, yeah,
I always think of that, that,

1113
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:47,740
that fatal attraction then I'm
not going to be ignored. Michael,

1114
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,610
whatever his fucking character's name was

1115
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:52,940
right then you know what he should done.
Whenever,

1116
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,400
whenever I see that movie
fatal attraction, she's like,

1117
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:58,700
I'm not going to be ignored. And she
sort of leans her head down a little bit.

1118
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,430
I always wanted him to just
hit her with like a fucking,

1119
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,790
just a right cross from a
fucked up angle. Like, uh,

1120
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:08,480
like Roy Jones member used to throw
the punches from those weird angles.

1121
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:12,290
Maybe do like that little rooster
hop and just fucking crack.

1122
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,430
You know, there, there's your
attention. Oh, look at me.

1123
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:21,880
I'm like dice clay the end of this
fucking thing. Why am I gonna get this?

1124
01:11:21,881 --> 01:11:25,500
This is just brutal. Why? Why am I lashing
out of women here in the end of this?

1125
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:28,740
This is, this is dumb. Okay. Uh,

1126
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,950
just cause I'm not going to vote for
Hillary Clinton doesn't mean I hate all

1127
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:32,784
women.

1128
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,440
I just hate the sound of the
female voice in the high register.

1129
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:40,000
I think that that's what it is.
Anyways,

1130
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:44,430
let me finish answering this question and
then I'll get the fuck outta here. Um,

1131
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:49,120
yeah, that is, but that is my thing. Yet
stockers freaked me the fuck out. Um,

1132
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:53,160
I don't mind people who are really,
you know, come out to a show.

1133
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:55,770
I've had a couple people come onto to
show it may tee shirts and that kind of

1134
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:59,400
thing. And they act a little zany.
That doesn't bug me, but you know,

1135
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,140
later on that night I don't,
you know,

1136
01:12:01,141 --> 01:12:04,710
rolled over in bed and all of a sudden
they're hovering outside my hotel window.

1137
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,210
Yeah, that would obviously
freak me out. Um, yeah,

1138
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:11,190
I don't think anybody finds
that flattering can. Okay.

1139
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:13,920
I'm taking a very serious tone now all
of a sudden and I'm starting to get

1140
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:16,710
scared. Okay. You happy? That's
what your question did to me.

1141
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:22,680
I'm going to go put on my chin up
bar. Okay. That's what I'm doing.

1142
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,060
And I'm actually going to buy a piece
of rope down at the hardware store.

1143
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,760
Then I'm going to hang from
the fucking thing and a,

1144
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:34,250
I'm going to be able to fucking climb
up that son of a bitch and I will you

1145
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,720
think and we'll bill if the fucking,
I mean, what are you gonna get?

1146
01:12:36,721 --> 01:12:41,070
Like six feet of rope? No, this is what
you do. You do get that amount of rope,

1147
01:12:41,071 --> 01:12:43,350
but you're fuck actually you get more
cause you want to be able to tie it up,

1148
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,810
but you sit on the floor.
Okay.

1149
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,800
Would you legs straight out l shape and
then you pull yourself up just with the

1150
01:12:49,801 --> 01:12:52,020
arms. And I'm telling you
if you can fucking do that.

1151
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:58,200
My goal is by November two fucking glue
10 likes stance and put them on top of

1152
01:12:58,201 --> 01:13:02,430
each other. And that's how I'm going to
end my shows. I need a hook people. Okay,

1153
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,910
I'm going to climb right up the
fucking thing right out the roof.

1154
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:11,390
Get on a helicopter by one of those old
Pan Am ones and fly the fuck out of the

1155
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:13,380
Gig. And that's how I'm going
to end it every fucking time.

1156
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,010
I'm do a big dramatic way, right as I
go to the ceiling of the funny bone.

1157
