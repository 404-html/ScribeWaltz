1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,653
Yeah.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,430
Hey, how are you? Um, it's the, uh,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,760
Thursday afternoon,

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,300
Monday morning podcast just before
Friday and just checking in.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,590
Okay.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,360
How's your week going? [inaudible]
you know, you know something.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,190
I got this dumb ass show on TV in the
background with some chick fucking who's

8
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:28,990
using way too much moose in her hair
and she's got like nine zillion fucking

9
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:30,070
dollars in debt.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,690
Just got to dumb parents who also use a
bunch of fucking moose in their hair and

11
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:36,340
somehow she's so out of control.

12
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:41,180
They have to go on television to
Friday to try it near check podcast.

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,460
I know this, the show is
crazy. Where she, she,

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,570
everybody that were Maria. Yes. Romaji
job. Let's talk about this brought here.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,550
She is so much most in her hair. She
looks shit faced even when she's sober.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,700
It's a show here in Montreal,
Canada, maybe monorail,

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,820
ballsy called Princess.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,630
Some of them off the
ends are dollar signs.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,460
And I guess the whole premise of this
show is to get these young spoiled women

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,223
who are just

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,180
out of control with their spending to
get a wake up call and learn how to be

22
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:20,260
responsible. But she has like
boozy eyes to saying her dad,

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,570
she has a dad the same. Yes.
Booze eyes. They advertise,

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,270
they have like bedroom eyes.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,170
They're kind of like look like they
about to go to sleep heavy eyebrows.

26
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,380
I sound terrible right now.
I think cause I,

27
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,280
you didn't have any booze last night.
You somehow just a guy,

28
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,380
I didn't have a cigar but I had
drank booze and I sound like,

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,120
like you drank some booze. Yeah,
we'll look at, now she's back out.

30
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:47,770
We got this on the background. She's
sitting there, she's going out to the,

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,860
I don't understand people that
lose control of their kids.

32
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,470
It's like you're taller than them,
you know, you just intimidate them.

33
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,640
Well she's not a child. She's like 20
something years old. So yeah, but the,

34
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,150
it never should have
got to this. Yeah. Well,

35
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:08,230
that's the whole premise of this show
and now she's going to like do chores and

36
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,770
earn her keep and all that kind of
stuff and she's going to learn a lesson.

37
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:15,400
It's just, it's TV, it's fake.
I'll turn it off. I understand.

38
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,570
I understand it's that,

39
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:20,380
but you can't tell me that this is not
actually people that lose control of

40
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:24,920
their kids. Yeah, she is a fucking mess.

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,360
You can't marry that mass. She's
unmarriageable with that fucking hair.

42
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,150
She looks like she fucking
Moses it with ges. Oh,

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,580
she just looks like a total party whore.
There's not one guy.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,890
It's going to look at
that other than the only,

45
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,410
his only thought is going
to be like a fuck that.

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,060
That's all you're gonna do with that.

47
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,580
Well that's all she's
concerned about right now.

48
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,760
So what do you think party on Wayne?

49
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,800
What do you think about maybe
that's all she's confirmed forward.

50
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,970
She's still fucking dope.
Yeah.

51
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,180
So yeah, a lot of young
girls are like, go wow,

52
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,320
your party it up. Yolo and whatnot. We,

53
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,210
you stopped seeing this.
I don't see it on like on a regular basis.

54
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,310
Saying that I don't say right.

55
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,430
The Instagram pinched to grandma

56
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,540
and yet too fucking old,
let's say Yolo,

57
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,760
I'm too old to be participating
in the call. You don't know.

58
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:27,780
It helps my act because you know all
the pop stars Shit. What was, you know,

59
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:30,360
I was surprised.
I knew that Taylor swift song last night.

60
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,480
I was very surprised that they tell me
the name of it and I'll sing it shaken up.

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,080
Oh yeah. Players gonna play, play,
play, play and somebody is gonna hate.

62
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,500
Shake it off. Shake it up. Shake
it. Yeah. Cause you play that shit.

63
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,940
I fucking hate that song.
Play that shit.

64
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,290
Is that literally written
on a piece of paper?

65
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,000
Players want to play because she go dot,
dot, dot. Or she really right. Play, play,

66
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:59,430
play, play, play of
whenever. I'm sure she did.

67
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,360
I got creeped out by her. I always
think she looks like a, like a,

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,450
like a little fucking sexed
up mere cat to me. Jeremy.

69
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,510
That's like up on her hind
legs looking at the whole,

70
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,640
you know, she looks very, I think she's
tall and then she wears heels and so yeah,

71
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:17,030
she's very,

72
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,030
I just remember on 60 minutes and alert
when we were watching her and the little

73
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:26,810
girls would be screaming in the upper
deck and she would look up there and she

74
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:30,710
would just sort of mouth,
oh my God.

75
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,330
It was the fucking phoniest. I think
even if I was sick, I'd be like,

76
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,490
this a, this lady's fake. This is fake.
She's not blown away by this right now.

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,430
She's just trying to,
maybe if you were that far,

78
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,700
what am I at six years old with
a sport coat on up in here,

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,000
like I know what's going on.
I probably be like,

80
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,550
why is my little six year old Dick?
Sorry.

81
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,950
Listen,
it's not something that you can relate to,

82
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,290
but the first time you're a little
kid and had fucking stands up,

83
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,610
you don't understand. When I first
understood that it was related to sex,

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,260
I was in a fucking tree.

85
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:11,210
Fort Wright and this kid had stolen
playboys from his dad is the 70s we didn't

86
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,360
have the internet like these kids, we
could actually watch video of real people,

87
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:17,960
fucking poor kids. So he, we were
looking at the things, right.

88
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,520
We were sitting there,
you know,

89
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,400
in the tree fort and there was like five
of us looking at him and this other kid

90
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,790
fucking balled up his fist and punched
me in the Dick. And I was like, oh,

91
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,660
that's when I realized like,
oh,

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,710
so what's going on with my dick is
going on with everybody else's Dick.

93
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,160
And that's what happens when
you look at naked women. What's,

94
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,263
that's how I learned,

95
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,500
cause somebody punched me right in
my fucking little hard on. Ouch.

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,900
Yeah. I take strong. It took it, took it
on. The Chin was rolled out the round.

97
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,740
God got back to the corner, you know,

98
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,270
through some water on it.
Anyways.

99
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,760
Yeah. So I know a little bit
about pop culture. Who are
some of the other, uh, uh,

100
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,900
ladies of a, or maybe
guys, I know a few people.

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,033
You do.

102
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,920
Do you know who one direction
is one direction? The, the,

103
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:21,810
the, uh, the, the Biebers, right. They
all got the Bieber, the Bieber hair,

104
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,980
and they all face the crowd.

105
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,250
When they sing one direction,
they,

106
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,250
they send it out as a weird name for
them to be called because I assume the

107
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,610
whole thing is like,
we only go in one direction and that's up,

108
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,590
but they should call it same direction
because when that band flop, sorry,

109
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,530
that was really bad. Um, I'm not
offering you, but this or not.

110
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,330
I'm fucking crushing it.
People are liking.

111
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,330
I just sank Taylor swift into first
fucking six minutes. It's no what,

112
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,670
what? Um, what's one of the
songs they sing up, but I know

113
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,000
they have a song, I think call you.
You don't know. You're beautiful.

114
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,440
What they, you don't know.
You're beautiful. That's
what makes you beautiful.

115
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,160
Or something like that.
Despite the fact she robbed me.

116
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,450
And you calves are rarely fat. I
Dunno. I have to be honest with you.

117
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:24,890
I don't fuck freckles,
but it's not about all that.

118
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,190
That's pretty close. Sad.
You're fucking beautiful.

119
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,200
And I'd let you suck my Dick
in the back of tour bus.

120
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,210
You got to go out the window.

121
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,570
You know what the other band mates to
see it. Oh my God. He's thinking to me

122
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,270
some boy band lyrics right there. Yeah.
Did you say hanging tough earlier?

123
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,820
Yeah. Shout out to Joe.
Joey Mack from the heat,

124
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,430
from the um, the he yay.
My favorite new kid.

125
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,980
Joe Mac. But really what were your options
you had to do with the mosquito face,

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,350
right? What do you mean
mosquito fan? Yeah, the other
guy who wasn't mark Walberg

127
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,460
and I got the other guy who looked
like the guy with the mosquitoes.

128
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,190
They were brothers. And I know
you're talking about, I like Donny.

129
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:22,910
Give me a fucking break. I gotta make
it funny. Donny dated Halle Berry.

130
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:25,730
Are you kidding me? Like Donnie
was crushing it back in the day.

131
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,390
When did he date her? Well, when he
was on the cop show, like in the 80s,

132
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,890
maybe early nineties, she
was like 14. She wasn't,

133
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,790
there was options for every girl
with that band yet. Tough guy. Donny,

134
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,080
Donny. And then you had Jordan his
sang in that crazy false that, oh,

135
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:49,460
with the dark hair. Right. And
then you had the brothers. Dot.

136
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,590
Think I'm combining them with like
fucking one of those other bands like Oh,

137
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:57,180
town or, uh, why do you keep bringing up
old town? I feel like I heard you say,

138
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:01,850
oh Tom, last night during your show, did
you say, oh, town during your ear bit.

139
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,320
Hey, it's my fuck. [inaudible]
lady. I remember. No, but a flash.

140
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,980
It was a boy band. They were, well they
were called. I was the guy with the,

141
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,900
he had this synchronized
tattoos. Yeah. Yes, exactly.

142
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,920
I want to on that side.

143
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:26,490
Then later on he shot heroin
in the same vein on both sides.

144
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,890
And then he was on the Rehab show.
Steven Adler. Yeah. Wait, what's he,

145
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,550
oh, was he in celebrity rehab?
Well anyway, yes. He was kind of,

146
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,620
they were kind of a boy band ish. I think
you can tell by this podcast that yes,

147
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,450
there is a presidential
election coming up.

148
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,320
I love how much you're getting
annoyed by Donald Trump.

149
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,820
This guy's the most entertaining thing.

150
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:54,560
That's ever since other than that fat
so that they had up here in Toronto and

151
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,570
only annoyed because you were the one
that was trying to like get me to prove to

152
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,520
you that other people thought that
Donald Trump was an asshole long,

153
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,320
long ago and you were like, prove
it. Prove it. What are your sources?

154
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:14,060
All that night I was hammered
sores that came up did before we,

155
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,060
I gave up drinking.

156
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,380
I was fucking hammered and I watched one
of his speeches and I wanted to hear it

157
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,740
because it was a great piece of comedy
and you will fucking kill that guy.

158
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,090
I can't believe you said that.

159
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,430
Like this guy's actually
going to become president.

160
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,060
Like it's this as he's like the fucking
guy the first week on American idol who

161
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:34,980
can't fucking sing. It's just funny
to watch. I love what we gave out.

162
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:39,210
That person's phone number, like a
seventh grade girl fucking deal with that.

163
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,380
Do you think he fucking, he did a little
flip to his cowlick after he did that?

164
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,160
Yeah.
He's just an asshole though.

165
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,550
John Mccain is a war hero
because he got caught.

166
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,250
He got captured
fucking terrible thing to say.

167
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,090
I know it's terrible.
I know,

168
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:04,860
but his above his head. Can I tell
you this right now? And you say he's,

169
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:08,910
he's a hero because he got captured.
I know, but here's the thing you do.

170
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:12,150
You know who has the right to
get offended by that John Mccain,

171
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,940
why can't I be offended?
Because you never went to war.

172
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,300
And that means that because I
didn't have that direct experience.

173
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:22,830
I can't have a strong reaction to you can,
you know you cannot be offended.

174
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,230
You shouldn't be offended by,
you can be,

175
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,420
you can sit there and have
empathy and be like, wow,

176
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,760
that's a really fucked up
thing to say to John Mccain,

177
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,870
but to sit there and literally
get offended like he owes
you a fucking apology.

178
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,630
You weren't net bamboo fucking cage.

179
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,520
Is that what it's about being about
being offended about something like you

180
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,730
shouldn't be offended because
you didn't experience it.

181
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,960
You can just feel like,
I don't understand that rationale.

182
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:52,290
You feel like if someone's offended
by something, they're taking it super,

183
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,340
super personally.
Look,

184
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:58,510
I can sit there and I could watch that
and realize what he said was completely

185
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,820
fucked up.
I can see why it's so fucking fun.

186
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,720
The fact that he's going to offend so
many people by saying it makes it fucking

187
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:09,160
hilarious. Watching his reaction to people
being offended is fucking hilarious.

188
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,570
But the people that went through it,

189
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:14,510
they're the ones who are truly fucking
affect. Like how would, uh, it's,

190
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,150
it's insulting to John Mccain for me
to get fucking offended by it. Like,

191
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,710
oh, it hurt. Did it hurt your bill
is you sit there and your pj's,

192
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:27,730
you fucking marry here.
Just coming at it from light,

193
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,700
that comedian perspective though.

194
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,680
You guys have this whole thing about
people being offended. That's what,

195
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:33,514
that's all I'm not,

196
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,610
I can be offended by what Trump says
and not have been in the war myself.

197
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,490
I can be and not, not that. Like
I'm offended for John Mccain.

198
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:47,200
He can obviously fend for himself. The
man, I think the guy can fend for himself.

199
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:50,530
He was fucking tortured. He didn't
break. But I can be like I'm,

200
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:55,330
I'm fucking offended by that.
As what other people who
have any respect for what?

201
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:55,931
John Mccain.

202
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:59,680
Why don't you just say I don't approve
what you said Donald and you need to grow

203
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,920
up and I feel like I could say that to
you cause you don't have my cell phone

204
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,990
because I can be offended if I want to.
I don't know why you were saying that.

205
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,020
I can't be offended by it.
I said it's the wrong wording.

206
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,970
I think it's childish for you to
be offended. All right. I think,

207
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,520
I think you just want to, you want
to be part of the group like yeah,

208
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,920
that affected me too. Yeah,
exactly where I'm coming from.

209
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,810
I'm all about being a part of the group
offended this week about something. Yep.

210
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,690
That's my emo.
Why do you hate me?

211
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,880
They donate it. Do you always,
you know what you have to,

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,420
you know what shit deal is near look
deal is you always got to take me down a

213
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:40,960
fucking notch. You just got
to make sure I get, what am I,

214
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:44,350
what am I doing over here? And you, Oh,
you're telling me I can't be offended.

215
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,580
I guess that's kind of an asshole move.
I wish you wouldn't be offended.

216
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,720
I wish people who didn't go to war. I,
look, if you've got to fucking relative,

217
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,850
that's in the military. I'll give you that
too. But people like me and I do. I do.

218
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,160
Oh good.
My Dad was in the fucking navy.

219
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,860
I mean I don't fucking sit
there acting like, you know,

220
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:07,570
I have some direct connection with
the military. I'm a softie. All right.

221
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,630
I never got a deferment,
but I would have second,

222
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:16,960
I was out there marching in
the sun. I can't take, oh,

223
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,060
pick up your fucking cover pile.

224
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,870
And that's what they were saying that
he like a avoided the draft like five

225
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:26,020
times. I hate when they
say that about rich people.

226
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,860
What do you mean why they avoided
the draft? Yeah, of course they did.

227
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,671
Of course they did.

228
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,490
They did exactly what you would have
done if you had hundreds of millions of

229
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,410
fucking dollars,
you wouldn't have gone.

230
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,530
I love all these fucking people that
act like if they were sitting there,

231
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,760
you know with a Butler that they'd fucking
join the marines and be on the front

232
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,680
lines and they would have fought.
They wouldn't have,

233
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,380
you would have done the same
fucking thing that they did.

234
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,390
I would think that he knows. Some people
like they, they volunteer for that Shit.

235
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,650
Even today they're like,
I want to go and you know something.

236
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,380
Those people are so few and far between
that they make movies about them.

237
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,740
And I'm not talking about people that
volunteer. I'm not talking about that.

238
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,150
I'm talking about somebody that's
sitting there with a golden spoon

239
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,020
in their mouth. Sorry Rick Flair.
He goes pointing out my mouth.

240
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,790
If you're fucking dude. No, I'm trying.

241
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,280
You may me one fucking blue
blooded kid sitting there.

242
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,840
He doesn't even have a trained set.

243
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:25,480
He has like a real train that goes
around his fucking house. Rich. Yeah.

244
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,650
Did he have a real train? Oh No. Not
a silver spoons. Silver spoons. Maybe.

245
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:34,040
It wasn't like a real as rain,
but it was a train that went around.

246
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:38,420
Speaking of trains. Quit derailing
this idea over here. Oh Jesus.

247
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,510
Um,
someone like someone like that,

248
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:46,300
like came from a really fucking rich
family in my lifetime. Yeah. You know,

249
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,940
maybe if you want to go back to
the Kennedys, but even then though,

250
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,280
you know they were fucking
bootleggers that right. So they,

251
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,950
as much as they tried to be all
hoity toity they were filthy near,

252
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,830
there's a bunch of animals.

253
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,770
You will fucking everything that
moved down there. You know La. Yah.

254
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,120
I would like to have sex with her next.

255
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,743
Uh Huh.

256
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,770
What did you just cover
the microphone for?

257
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,310
Like I have some sort of connection to
that family. What are you talking about?

258
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,090
Oh nevermind.
I'll tell you afterward.

259
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,080
Okay.

260
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,850
I, I don't give a shit. Alright.

261
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,480
It's podcast is not about,
yeah,

262
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,590
it's not about fucking caring
about people's feelings.

263
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,410
They need it. Do me a favor,
shake it off, shake it off.

264
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,340
I really can't believe you know that
song I had because I never played it for

265
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:45,960
you. Well, I don't understand
tailored does it? No.

266
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,110
Barely anybody pop culturally,

267
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,220
like what's a lie towards me the other
week they'll remember how we were talking

268
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,840
about how bills interpretation of
gone girl was. Where'd the bitch ago?

269
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,030
Like that's just kind of how,
but I knew,

270
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:03,660
I knew that was wrong and I knew it
was enough in the right direction.

271
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,700
One direction did that. Fuck you know
what I was talking about. All right,

272
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:12,090
you're going to quiz me on pop
culture right after these messages.

273
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,030
Now hang on one second
here. I have to, uh,

For another video. Doorbell read.
Why isn't the fucking music working?

284
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,440
Can you please play?

285
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,680
Oh, it's not going to play when I
got the fucking thing going here.

286
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,300
You fucking suck.

287
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,113
Okay.

288
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,431
Why?

289
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:04,090
I want to do that because it's the
fucking mini iPad and it doesn't have that

290
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:09,030
ability. Ah, these fucking nerds, man.
Well, when were they ever have just,

291
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,470
that just kills my whole fucking thing.

292
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:13,300
I got to read the video doorbell with
the sad music underneath the door.

293
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,880
That doesn't count. Well,
hang on a second. What is
that come? It doesn't work.

294
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,070
It's sad.

295
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,050
Anna Mae Music collection and
evidently it's a masterpiece.

296
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,310
How did you find this? I just,
I just look up sad music.

297
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,030
All right, I'll read the other one while
you get the sad music going. All right.

298
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:36,440
Mile Iq, Iq, everybody. Uh,

299
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,060
driving for work is a double edge sword.

300
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,020
Okay.

301
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,510
A, somebody punched me in my sword
when I was looking at playboys.

302
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,340
Either you're spending too
much time tracking every
mile or you're guesstimating

303
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,550
and end up losing money and even then
your estimate falls about 20% short of

304
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:58,430
what you could be deducting.

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,150
I guess I don't understand it.

321
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,200
I just kind of like a vision of you in
middle schools. They drive it for work.

322
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,250
It's a short class and just like this is
the seeds being planted right there are

323
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:19,000
driving for work. All right. You're
a cab driver. You're a, you're a,

324
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,280
you're a taxi driver.

325
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,120
He'd drive a limo and he was
spending too much time track oh sins.

326
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:26,250
Rather than having to write it down.
The sink does it for you.

327
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,590
Then you can just cruise around, right?
Jesus. Six days on the road. You got it.

328
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,140
All right. Well there you
go. I over explained it then.

329
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,520
I guess everybody else understood it. Is
this the one? Sometimes I have to, yeah.

330
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,240
Okay. Hold on. Sad. Anna

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,120
Huh? [inaudible] cheese.

333
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,550
It's been a big goal.
Is that one of those ad you can't skip?

334
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,270
This is just going off the fucking rails.
They should only just,

335
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:03,690
you just make five second ads.
All right.

336
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,160
He turned it down a little bit.
Mike.

337
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,490
Hello again,
friends

338
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,570
and I'd like to take a moment to
talk to you and the ones who vote

339
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,903
video doorbell.

340
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,660
This is the sound of a package
being delivered, being bombed,

341
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,330
supposed to have a dog or
friends coming over to dinner,

342
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,870
but it's also the sound of
someone planning to rob you blind

343
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,630
each year. Over 95% of the home
break ins happened during the day.

344
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,080
You'd think the old people across
the street would say something,

345
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:48,730
but they have cataracts
in burglars.

346
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,890
Almost always start by ringing your
doorbell to see if someone's home before,

347
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,200
but what do they do after
you answer the door,

348
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,800
we'd take the lift their mascot up.
Sorry about that.

349
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,560
Don't you weren't going to be,

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,580
Even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell,
it's like caller id for your home.

355
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,560
Please share a personal story or how
this could happen to someone you love.

356
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:40,400
I know this guy, Scott, he
lives in Boise at once. I mean,

357
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,870
he was at work and someone rang his
doorbell and he wasn't home to answer.

358
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,860

377
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,970

394
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,690

end of this. Good. And apology for what?

395
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,220
For questioning my pop culture.

401
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,590
This is an Oldie, but no,

But what is the name of the film that
you called? Two whores in a pool.

407
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,413
Oh

That was with the chick.

409

A Richardson that married a
Emilio's touching Charlie Sheen.

410
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,150

00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:53,730
A chlorine clam.

415
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,760
Wild thing.
I know what you did in the shallow end.

416
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,650
Okay.

417
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,730
Wow.

418
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,990
Who has been carols with two good looking
women who has been cast as the new

419
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:16,010
Batman? Ben Affleck. Oh my God. The
whole nerd and universe flipped out.

420
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,050
I'm an old man.
I go on Facebook.

421
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,100
I will tell you that Batman mask it is
really hard to not look like a jerk off

422
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,140
and that thing that is
just not a flattering.

423
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,740
It's all he got to have the Ben Affleck,
jaw Clooney.

424
00:27:27,741 --> 00:27:29,570
You have to have a fucking jaw.

425
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,390
You know would have been a great Batman
if he could have lost the gut with

426
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:36,380
sergeant slaughter. He had, he had
the quintessential fucking Batman Joe.

427
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,410
God's name is sergeant slaughter.
He's a veteran.

428
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,350
I bet he was offended by fucking John
Mccain who's been cast. John Mccain,

429
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,380
a Jared Leto who has been
cast as Harley Quinn.

430
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,290
I don't know who is Harley Quinn?

431
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,870
She's a character in the comic
books. I don't know. Superman.

432
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,720
Oh,
these are fucking obscure.

433
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,520
Do you know how loud and awful
the last one superman was?

434
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,310
I sat there watching that
fucking superman. This is what?

435
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,730
This is nerd shit. Nerds don't get
laid. That's not popular. Go go to the,

436
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,320
I thought you're going to do music.
Come on. Oh, music. Yeah, go ahead.

437
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,280
I think I did pretty good.
I think I did pretty good with the movies.

438
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,143
You gotta admit.

439
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,950
What are some of the songs and we
listened to when we were in Paris that you

440
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,030
like. It's just, it's just
sing it because that's, that's,

441
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:30,170
that's better than you trying to figure
out the names of it. I don't remember.

442
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,530
I'm the melody. The TDD. Oh,

443
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,650
I'd like to make money get turned.
I like to make money.

444
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:44,270
Get Dark. I like to make
money. Gay Turn. I got to walk.

445
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:45,830
Go during a bowl.
The work.

446
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,480
I got a white girl are her or you kept
like a whole bottle of Rosae when he just

447
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:56,510
fucking starts. Just keep saying
it up to the music goes in the end.

448
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,030
What's his name? Is that generic? Why

449
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,130
Mannequin Mannequin?

450
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,150
Does he spell it in a cool way?

451
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,360
In a graffiti type way?
Exactly.

452
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,010
Man is all capitalized and there's a k
in there and with the fucking Q with a

453
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:20,900
couple of dots over it. Not that, but
yeah, he spells out in a funky way.

454
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,980
Alright. Alright. I feel like
this is dying is you know why?

455
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:28,900
Because I actually did fucking great on
it. I did great on it. Well you know what,

456
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:32,090
I bring it down.
Bring it down for a second.

457
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,700
I want to thank you all for coming out
Thursday afternoon podcast. Um, anyways,

458
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,830
ear crowds in Montreal have been awesome.
Yes,

459
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:42,920
they happen and I'd been having a great
time during the goddamn comedy jam.

460
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:46,280
I had a good time. You can send that one
night. Yes I did. I played all right.

461
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,840
You've played really, really well. Yeah,
so I did and tonight you're going to

462
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,070
yeah, I got my last comedy jam. I'm doing
the Ron Bennington unmasked. Uh Huh.

463
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,860
And then I got on Mass Gilbert.
What's behind those freckles

464
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,670
and the freckles,
the bill birth story.

465
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,790
You'll feel like when you got punched
in your six year old Dick that then

466
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,360
informed you as a comedian. Wait,
why did the kid punched you?

467
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:17,770
Because we were all looking at naked
girls up the playboys and it was like all

468
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:21,440
the old days back when you didn't have
play dates and shit and you stole stuff

469
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:24,800
from somebody else's dad and you
looked at it and there was kids of all

470
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:29,090
different age groups so they understood
what the fuck was going on and the kid

471
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:32,300
fuck any did the all right
dear Fred did my fucking Dick.

472
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,480
I ain't, you know, I learned something.
What did you learn from that?

473
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,470
That that happens when you look at a
naked woman and that it hurts to get

474
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:46,120
punched again. And on that note, Oh,

475
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,930
it hurts even more when it's
fucking standing up. Um, all right,

476
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,480
sorry if you guys envisioning that
this has been the Thursday afternoon,

477
00:30:56,481 --> 00:31:01,160
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast, I got turned around in that,

478
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,410
um, I got one more day here before I go
back. I had just a great time last night,

479
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,700
um, before show was awesome and then this
check second show went to a whole other

480
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:15,380
level. And um, you know what, I
was up here. I've been dressing up,

481
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:20,381
you know when our old sport coat here
trying to out French the frogs and a

482
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,860
French Canadian. That's right. You
know it was great. Last night was,

483
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:28,120
I actually was talking about and I brought
up, you know I was flying into Boston.

484
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,270
Somebody yelled,
Boston sucks and did they?

485
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,940
Why did I just stopped by? I said, why?

486
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,770
Because we win all the championships
and they were like, oh yeah, oh yeah.

487
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:40,500
I rubbed it in,

488
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,780
I fucking rubbed it in and then they
tried to give me shit about the Bruins

489
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:48,860
trades and it's stupid. Don't do that.
Montreal Canadien fans. All right.

490
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:52,130
Because then I could just say, well, we'll
least, we want a cup in this century,

491
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,380
and then they go, well,
we want blah, blah, blah,

492
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:56,540
and I just started singing glory days.

493
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,510
They'll pass you by glory days

494
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,500
and the wink of booing Patrick Wall.
All right,

495
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:07,060
that's the podcast for this Thursday.
I hope you guys have.

496
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,790
Thanks and I'll talk to you on Monday.

497
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,070
Hey, what's going on? It's milk bar.

498
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,300
This is a very special edition
of the Monday morning podcasts.

499
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:06,220
Those of you who are longtime listeners,
all 15 of you,

500
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,520
um, you know, every once
in a while I will, um,

501
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,360
rather than Babel for an hour about
the inane shit that pisses me off.

502
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,720
I'll actually bring in,
uh,

503
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:20,120
a comedian friend of mine and like I
told you these only guys that I respect,

504
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:25,121
only people that I find funny hack lists
hacklabs podcasting here and today we

505
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,440
are a, have the pleasure of having on
our show the wonderful, the talented,

506
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,320
the cock suck in Greg
Fitzsimmons everybody. What's
up Gregory? I got to tell you.

507
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:40,000
And being a standup comedian and you know,
in the media in general,

508
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:44,680
there is, what other job
begins with a stroking session,

509
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,780
you know,
I mean I really needed that.

510
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:49,270
I had a shit day and I'm
sitting here in your house,

511
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,580
you've invited me out so
I know I'm not a hack.

512
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,240
And then you get a nice little build up.
This guy is a good guy.

513
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,640
What if you were a plumber? You think
you'd show up at someone's house?

514
00:33:57,641 --> 00:34:01,420
We think it's shit and knee deep in there.
Get in there and clean up the shit.

515
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,800
I know that's like my dad's a dentist.
I worked with him when I was younger,

516
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,180
then just handed him the shit is,

517
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:08,940
he yanked off the teeth and
every other person will come in.

518
00:34:08,941 --> 00:34:10,130
The first thing he's saying,
first of all,

519
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,530
just wanna let you know I
hate the dentist. And that's
all he heard all day long.

520
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:16,250
Number one, suicide rate of any
profession. Is that right? Yeah,

521
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,380
that's absolutely true. Well, give it
up for my dad for hanging in there.

522
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:23,760
We all did you notice a lot of
depression in him? Uh, no. Jesus Christ.

523
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:28,260
We've really gone deep here and me. Yes.
Not In him. Jesus. I got a two man lately.

524
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,520
It's hit me hard. No, but I got a beat.
I know how to beat it. I actually,

525
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,960
now I stepped back and I observe the
thoughts in my head and I just see a bad

526
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:38,340
one. I'm like, do I want to, uh,

527
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,990
do I want to spoon with that idea for
the next fucking three days? Yeah.

528
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,990
And hate my life. I literally,
I'll go out, I'll go on a hike.

529
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,070
I find that walking around and getting
the blood going and just start telling

530
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:53,760
myself lies. You're amazing. You're
amazing. See what you just did though.

531
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,090
That's exactly.
Look like music on.

532
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,610
And I fantasize that I'm playing it like
I'm Stevie Ray Vaughan and it gets me

533
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:03,010
out of it. Well, I took
a yoga class yesterday.

534
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:05,950
That helps me a lot because not
only you get the physical exertion,

535
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,690
your deep breathing,

536
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,560
and then there's hot ass every direction,
all getting stretched out.

537
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,880
That's why I, in another life I
would do, I would be like that,

538
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,100
that Yoga instruction shit. Oh hell
yeah. Yeah. You get a pony tail.

539
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,810
You would, and not only do
these women have hot bodies,

540
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,830
they give a shit about themselves enough
to go to a place to make themselves

541
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:32,830
better. I'm all stretched out before
you bang them, Greg. I mean it's like,

542
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,910
I used to go to this one out in
Santa Monica and this guy was why I,

543
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,360
it was because it wasn't
that chanting shit.

544
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,960
It was the teacher was this
angry guy trying to be happy.

545
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:47,100
So I totally related to him,
but he used, he used to do,

546
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,880
this is true dude, this and he was
a great teacher and he used to,

547
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,910
he used to be teaching the class while
subtly putting out how sensual he was

548
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,060
during lovemaking. You'd like, he
would be like, he would just, yeah,

549
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:03,550
I can't even she do that
with your podcast, man. It
wouldn't work at this point.

550
00:36:03,551 --> 00:36:08,340
And people know I hate women. Yeah.
Individually. I like women one on one,

551
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:09,180
but as a group,

552
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:12,570
when they all start yammering around a
table like that fucking show the view.

553
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,210
I mean, I mean, yeah, when I look at the
view or I think of, uh, uh, what was that?

554
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:22,140
Just sex and the city or now cougar town.
I really do.

555
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:27,000
I say to myself, women, the
best is the Bachelorette party.

556
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,920
That's what sums up with
all those shows are,

557
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:33,750
it's an attempt by women to be men
instead of being women in a group.

558
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,770
When you're with a woman alone,
they are empathetic,

559
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:42,990
acted emotional there, everything that
you kind of want to dude one on one,

560
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:44,160
but a guy can't go there.

561
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,210
Like you have a strong female side and
sometimes we really connect on that level,

562
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,530
but very often you're just the angry
dude. But women are always, that means,

563
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:54,250
but okay. No you don't. Funny.

564
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:59,010
I was hoping that someone was gonna come
here and finally actually compliment

565
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:02,040
women after all the trashing that I've
done. I'm like, Greg, he's married,

566
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,370
he's got a couple of kids. This would
be a nice thing. You come right in.

567
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,890
Just kicking them right in the
Twat. But he told me about, I said,

568
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:10,980
you're a sensitive guy. No, not me. I
was talking about like women you like,

569
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:14,770
they want to be mellow. I was
just picturing all of them
rolling their eyes. Well,

570
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:19,460
let's actually pick,
let's pick a strong female role.

571
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,670
Know we like who's abroad out there.
You're like,

572
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,770
I don't mind those women
who stand on the sidelines.

573
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,560
I liked their business suits.
The football games. Oh yeah.

574
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,390
Shoulder pads and a skirt. Why don't you
just get in the fucking game sweetheart.

575
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,960
No, you don't. To me, it's like, you know,

576
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:40,650
my wife and I've been with her
for 11 years and you know I,

577
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,860
I'm one of the few comedians that
can tell you I fucking love my wife.

578
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,170
I have not had a day in my
life that I didn't think.

579
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,790
How did I get this check? And
she's perfect. There you go.

580
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,930
And you've met her. Now she's
the greatest, isn't Jayla.
I knew she was a good one.

581
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:01,350
That time when we were,
we were driving back from Boston.

582
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Holy that we did this gig somewhere in
Boston or Rhode Island for like two or

583
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:10,340
three weeks.
Where are we going to,

584
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,190
where are we going anyway?
Yeah. Anyways, whatever. We,

585
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,680
I thought we were doing a Gig.
It was, you meet Tom Carter.

586
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,250
We were going to a wedding. It was
Robbie Prince, his wedding. Yah, Austin.

587
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,250
Cause I didn't go to
Shannon. No, no. Okay.

588
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,980
Well let's just get to the meat of
the story. Okay. Well coming back,

589
00:38:25,981 --> 00:38:30,981
Tom Carter was hung over and you and me
are in the car doing the Boston accent

590
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,820
on 11 and just saying the most ignorant
racist shit you could possibly say.

591
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:44,230
AIDS, Joe Jo, everything, just
total green room, standup comedy,

592
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:49,080
just driving Tom nuts. Trying to make
a few key. Remember that. And Eric,

593
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,521
I remember.

594
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:52,970
What's the laugh laughing the entire
time at the ridiculousness of it.

595
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,370
My favorite part was when it got quiet
and Tom Thought after two states of doing

596
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:00,640
it that we'd finally given up and we
drove over this bridge and there was this,

597
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,720
this lake or something underneath
and you and the back just go water.

598
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,070
Which of course started it all up again.
A Fitzy,

599
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,910
you're fucking fudge pig.

600
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:21,250
Let's get some beers. Go down the
Cape, beat up some colored kids. Oh,

601
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,200
three states, three states. We did that
and just watching Tom just being like,

602
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:26,411
dude,

603
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:31,120
it's not funny anymore from that trip
to this day I do the Boston accent and

604
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:35,530
it's immediate. It's like this Pavlovian
response. She just starts laughing again.

605
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,620
It's the worst.
And I was reading George Carr.

606
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,790
Did you read George Carlin
before we get too deep and let's,

607
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,080
let's get onto what you're hyping here.

608
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:45,520
Greg Simmons actually wrote a book that's
coming out. Uh, what's the name of it?

609
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,210
It's called Dear Mrs Fitzsimmons dear Mrs
Fitzsimmons and that will be available

610
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:52,690
in stores when, well, he
can preorder preorder now,

611
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:56,410
which they actually just bumped up my, uh,
you know, they do an order of the books.

612
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,630
They just bumped up to a second order,

613
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:00,810
are ready the chopping
up a body next door.

614
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,580
Just ignore the smell of the
podcasts. I love that they, um,

615
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,170
so to the book, basically it's
doing great. Preorder. Go to Fitz,

616
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:12,580
dog.com Fatz dog. And
it's a, basically my,

617
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,710
it's about us.
It's about Irish guys,

618
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,800
a lot of anger that do the opposite of
what they're told to do their whole life.

619
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,640
Oh,
there you go.

620
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,530
So my mother saved every letter that
was ever sent home from teachers.

621
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,970
Police clipped out things from
the newspaper when I was there,

622
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,370
and then I saved them all from
adulthood. So it's like, uh,

623
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,600
my life through bad letters that were
sent home. That's phenomenal. Man.

624
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,260
Phenomenal. Yeah. And the Ebook is
cool to have people buy the ebook.

625
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:42,100
I've actually, I got celebrities.
I, I can get a shoot you after this,

626
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,710
who they read the letters.
So when you're reading,

627
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:46,780
when you're on your iPad you can,

628
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,920
you can click on a particular letter and
all of a sudden Pete Yorn is reading it

629
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:55,740
or Zach Galifianakis or Natalie May.
So it's very hard on that div.

630
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,110
Yeah, you're very, you know something I
have to hand this to you is you're very,

631
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:03,490
you're not afraid of the Internet the
way I am. I am really, who's that guy?

632
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:06,520
Andy Rooney. The 60 minutes. That's fine.

633
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,040
Why is everybody going over to Facebook?

634
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:13,390
I'm just younger and notice where he is
on 60 minutes in that 30 seconds after

635
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:17,440
the night commercial. Yeah. And he's
just the, and I'm so trying not to be,

636
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:21,360
that guy just hates everything new,
but it really is like I really,

637
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,140
you were ahead of the
way with this podcast.

638
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:26,740
You've been doing this longer than
I have. Yeah. This appealed to my,

639
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:29,710
a psychosis of just being by myself.

640
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:33,130
Like I do this thing by myself
every week just for like an hour.

641
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,210
Do you ever pause it or do
you go straight through it?

642
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,470
Just go straight through and I do.
I do what I do.

643
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:40,380
Probably one out of four or five, I'm
alone and I, they're my favorite one.

644
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:41,191
If you start bombing,

645
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:45,390
you just talk about how you're bombing
and then people actually laugh at you.

646
00:41:45,391 --> 00:41:49,320
Struggling trying to get back on
the, uh, the road to comedy people.

647
00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:53,580
I find I get more comments on the alone
ones in any other ones. They're like,

648
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:54,450
I love,
I did one,

649
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:57,750
I was down staying with my mom and
Florida with my family and I went out,

650
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,310
sat in her car

651
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,600
across the street from our condo and
did one just ripping her a new asshole,

652
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,620
hating everybody.
And is by far the best podcast.

653
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,160
Overrated for this week.

654
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:07,080
This is a great one. Overrated.
When change let's, it says,

655
00:43:07,081 --> 00:43:11,310
I hate the annoying clink clink
sound with a fucking passion.

656
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,690
What is wrong with the people? Huh?
What's wrong with people? Seriously,

657
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,890
the world is not loud enough.
You have to fucking add to it.

658
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,340
You know,
they,

659
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:28,290
they do believe this sounds will make
them better people or make life better.

660
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,810
You know what dude? You want
such a great role to you, right?

661
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:33,340
Broke that fucking sentences.
Oh,

662
00:43:33,341 --> 00:43:37,530
what do they believe the sounds will make
them better people or make their life

663
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:41,310
better? I found it most
annoying and have an invasive,

664
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:47,400
right? I find it the honor Jesus Christ.
I'm never drinking on the podcast again.

665
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,240
Go Fuck Yourself. All right. What
is wrong with people? Where am I?

666
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,680
I find it the most annoying and
invasive thing I am forced to listen to,

667
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,910
even with closed windows,
but they're so peaceful.

668
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,730
Um,
if you fucking like the sound,

669
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,300
why don't you put him up inside your
home and half the fucking fan going

670
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,600
in any way? What gives anybody the right
to push their taste on others? Dude,

671
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,480
I totally agree. It's like if you're
gonna make smokers smoke outside,

672
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,930
then you want to make these fucking wind
chime. People take that shit indoors.

673
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,790
I can't tell you how annoying that is.

674
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,070
You know what's annoying about it is it's
an annoying sound that's trying to be

675
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:30,170
fucking spiritual. That's what
kills me. It's even, it's,

676
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,610
it's more annoying than just the loud,
annoying sound that's fucking annoying.

677
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:37,060
Cause at least the loud annoying sound
has to fucking courage to be annoying.

678
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,260
Those fucking things. They actually,
they're, they're there. You know what?

679
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,540
When I go on Youtube and just get some
fucking wind chime sounds for all you

680
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,080
dumb [inaudible] out there who do yoga,

681
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,790
you know and actually think that these
fucking things sound good. Here we go.

682
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:56,770
Wind fucking chimes. Youtube.
Let's see what we got. Here we go.

683
00:44:56,771 --> 00:44:59,350
Yeah, cause somebody fucking loves
him so much. They put up a video.

684
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:02,440
Here we go for all you cats out there.
Here it is.

685
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,503
Okay.

686
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,933
Okay.

687
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,300
I got to met.
Those are nice.

688
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,350
This isn't fair.
This guy's got fucking,

689
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:21,230
he's got the professional
grade level ones.

690
00:45:21,231 --> 00:45:25,790
He thinks look like the exhaust on a
God damn. Oh that's giant wind chimes.

691
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:30,740
All right. I just learned
something. I don't mind. Giant
wind chimes. Oh, here's one.

692
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:33,530
Here's the one of these little douchey
ones you get at a fucking hardware store.

693
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,590
It's typical youtube. You just
can't put wind chimes. Elliot Bay,

694
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,220
Beautiful Wind Chime
is just the Cantisano.

695
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,263
There it is.

696
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,900
You know what the great thing is,
is they're made out of metal.

697
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:54,980
So when you rip 'em off,

698
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:57,980
you have a fucking blunt object to
beat your neighbor to death with.

699
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,721
That's what you do.

700
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:03,830
And then you dip it and fucking peroxide
bleach and you hook it back up again.

701
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:09,100
Let those a and e comes to figure out
that murder a man murdered on his porch.

702
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,210
You know, somehow they'd
find, you know, and a fucking,

703
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:20,390
I dunno, an eighth of an inch of his
face imprint on that fucking wind chime.

704
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,030
If you ever watch shows and things,
how they catch people, it's,

705
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,070
it's like it's not even fucking fair.

706
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,800
Do you ever see the one as I take
another healthy swap. I got news for you.

707
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:34,020
I'm having another beer.
This might be the new thing.

708
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:37,770
I might do this shit Thursday night.
Take a night off from stand up.

709
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,680
Tell my chick to hit the fucking bricks.

710
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,830
Is anything better than
drinking your own goddamn house.

711
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:48,030
It just makes you want to start screaming
about the shit you own. You know

712
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,440
I paid for this shit.
You hear that old man downstairs,

713
00:46:55,441 --> 00:46:56,940
I'm going to get louder and
he's going to come up here.

714
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,710
That would be the ultimate podcast.

715
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,760
You know the thing about old people is
you always have to worry that they are a

716
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:07,200
fucking, like they, they, they fought
in a fucking work cause I never had,

717
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,221
I never have.

718
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:12,180
So I have total respect for
fucking veterans and the
fact that they still got it

719
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:14,790
in him, you know, that would be insane.

720
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,520
One night if I actually just totally
pissed him off and he really did fight in

721
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:21,540
the Korean War and he just fucking through
whatever that fucking thing is your

722
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:25,470
throw up when you, when you get to climb
up the rope on the side of the building,

723
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,010
you know that, that, that fucking
land fish hook thing throws it up.

724
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:34,990
Dan just climbs up, comes over my railing
as I'm sitting here doing this podcast,

725
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:39,310
half in the bag, he's got a
kitchen knife between his teeth,

726
00:47:39,311 --> 00:47:43,050
like a fucking pirate.
What would I do?

727
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,280
I've probably taken 12 karate classes
in my life and they've all been like,

728
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,400
you know,
six years apart.

729
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,730
Fucking guide coming in full.
Lay me.

730
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,090
Okay.

731
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:58,923
You know?

732
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,360
Okay.

733
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,510
I don't fucking know. I just sat back
and I just lost the screen here. Yeah.

734
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:06,900
So whatever wind chimes are
fucking overrated. They really are.

735
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:09,120
But I got to tell you, if you get
the giant ones, the giant ones,

736
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:12,450
a nice listen to the giant ones.
A giant ones have a nice tone to them.

737
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,210
It's a little deeper.
I think I figured it out.

738
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,413
Okay.

739
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,140
Come on man. You gotta admit that's
not bad if you let go of the anger,

740
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:28,540
your childhood, right? Like,
oh, your anger for a second

741
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,980
c sound of a ship in the background,

742
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,160
uh,

743
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,610
hoshin coming up on the beach.

744
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,370
Yeah. We get to that point right when
you're going to get relaxed and let go,

745
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,290
and then he gets so fucking scared.

746
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:05,740
You get right back into the anger and
then you want to punch somebody in fucking

747
00:49:05,741 --> 00:49:06,574
yoga pants.

748
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,763
Okay.

749
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,063
Okay.

750
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,350
Fucking went to go to this pizza place.
I really try to do fun things.

751
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:54,860
When I was in Portland, tried to be
healthy. I went for a fucking hike.

752
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,130
I was sticking with my smoothies,
you know,

753
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,200
dropping pounds here.
And uh,

754
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,010
anyway, somebody tells me that in, in
Portland, they have this fucking room.

755
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,030
They got this pizza parlor where they
had the best God damn pizza and all the

756
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:11,864
fucking northwest.

757
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:16,850
So this guy has like this homemade goddamn
doe and he only makes so much of it

758
00:50:16,851 --> 00:50:20,330
every day. And when he's done making
the dough, he's done making pizza.

759
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:25,220
Go Fuck Yourself. All right.
So I'm like, well shit,

760
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:30,050
I got to try this pizza. So I go on the
Internet, I look up, I see where it is.

761
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:34,670
It's right on Hawthorne Street,
like 45th and Hawthorne,

762
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:37,790
46 and Hawthorne, something like
that, right? So I'm like, all right,

763
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,950
I gotta go check this fucking thing out.
So I allow,

764
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,980
I get myself an hour and a half before
the show to get there to get a God damn

765
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:47,270
pizza, right? It's a fucking pizza. Okay.

766
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,800
So I call up just something told
me to call just to call this place.

767
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,540
And uh, I call up the, it rings like 11,

768
00:50:56,541 --> 00:51:01,250
12 fucking times and uh,
nobody picks up. So my guy,

769
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:03,720
you know what, they're probably busy. No
big deal. I got an a, I'm, I'll get there.

770
00:51:03,721 --> 00:51:06,410
We're an hour and a half before,
right? I get a God damn cab.

771
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,980
I'm driving over there. Cab driver
goes, oh, just to let you know,

772
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:12,380
this guy's kind of like the
pizza Nazis, like, like the,

773
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:16,340
like the fucking a soup Nazi on Seinfeld.

774
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:19,730
So I show up and I walk in. Lo
and behold, the place is packed,

775
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:24,590
but I see this little two top gets up,
waitresses cleaning off the table.

776
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:25,400
She walks away.

777
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,670
So I go over and I sit down
getting ready to order the pizzas,

778
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,930
checking out what people are ordering
of getting excited is what I'm trying to

779
00:51:32,931 --> 00:51:36,350
tell you. And then the waitress
comes over, she's like, um,

780
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,510
well you over in the waiting room next
door or did you just like walk in here

781
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:46,370
and sit down? And I was like, um, I
just came in and sat down. She goes,

782
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,700
yeah,
I'm,

783
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,550
you have to like thein when I'm next door.
You know those people,

784
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,870
everything's, everything's a question
you have to like sign in next door.

785
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,060
And I'm like, oh, all right. I go, well,
how long is the wait? She's like, wow,

786
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:06,200
I can't really like say it's, you
know, it's kind of busy at that point.

787
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:08,410
He's like a quarter of it go,
well, I got to show at eight.

788
00:52:08,411 --> 00:52:12,470
It's a quarter to seven. Am I going to
have time to order a pizza and eat it?

789
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,810
She's like, yeah, no,

790
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,210
now.

791
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,020
And um,

792
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:23,910
and then that's when my blood starts
fucking boiling because I realized what I

793
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:25,950
just walked into.
You know what I walked into?

794
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:31,100
I walked into the pizza version of
pink's hot dogs out here in fucking La,

795
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:37,010
the pizza version of Magnolia Bakery
in New York City or that fucking place.

796
00:52:39,091 --> 00:52:41,160
We get the hot dogs in Chicago,

797
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:43,723
you know,

798
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,420
hour and 15 minutes to
make a fucking pizza.

799
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:51,260
You can't do that guy sitting
here acting like, you know,

800
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,640
like he's making some sort of gourmet
for now. I'll tell you right now,

801
00:52:55,641 --> 00:53:00,470
that's my overrated for the fucking week.
Standing in line at any restaurant.

802
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:01,310
These, you know, the, the,

803
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,510
the breakfast place in your neighborhood
and your girlfriend's like, oh my God,

804
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,690
the stuffed French toast is to die for
and you stand there and fucking line,

805
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,040
never worth it. It's never
worth the hype, okay?

806
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:19,880
If you learn anything from this podcast,
other than I'm an ignorant asshole,

807
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,620
don't ever stand in line for
fucking food, okay? And less some,

808
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,580
there's a natural disaster.

809
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,260
The place is flooded and this dis
scooping out fucking pea soup. You know,

810
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:33,900
when you're putting it into your
baseball hat, then you'll stand in line,

811
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,310
soup kitchen. You stand in life, but
don't stand outside these fucking places.

812
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:41,070
It's stupid. It's never worth
it. You know, fancy restaurants.

813
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:43,410
You don't stand outside. You call
up, you make a fucking reservation.

814
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,170
But I'm not standing out there
like I'm waiting to fucking

815
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,280
okay.

816
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,900
Do they even make God damn sense?
You know what I mean?

817
00:53:49,901 --> 00:53:53,740
He's fucking people in New
York. They stand outside for
90 minutes for a cupcake,

818
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,230
for fucking cupcake.
It's gone in three seconds.

819
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,190
You know it's going to Piss me off
is some people in Portland. Okay.

820
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,670
They're actually going to figure out
what pizza parlor I'm talking about and

821
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:06,160
then they're going to tell, tell me
dude, it's totally fucking worth it.

822
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:08,200
These low self esteem Douche bags

823
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:14,820
who just allow themselves to get totally
treated like absolute fucking shit for

824
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:16,234
pizza.

825
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,630
Yeah.

826
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:21,050
Yeah. Sorry, I can't make you a
pizza within an hour and 15 minutes.

827
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:23,960
Will you know what?
Fuck you and your fucking pizza.

828
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,420
What do you think about that and
your number one God damn rating.

829
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:30,200
I'll go to pizza hut.
Eat their fucking slop.

830
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,130
You. What's killing me is that I
know I'm going to have to go back.

831
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:37,620
I have to try it.
People hyped it so much.

832
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,560
That's what I'm really
mad about is as I know.

833
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,780
As much as I just fucking
talked about that shit.

834
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:46,370
I'm going to have to go back there and
go get it and for all you guys wonder and

835
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,040
yelled at Magnolia. It's a great
cupcake, but it's not that great.

836
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:55,020
It's not that great to have to stand there
and listen to that awful conversation.

837
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,370
Yeah.

838
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,800
Now, if people driving by looking
at you, trying to figure it out,

839
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:00,090
what are they standing in line for?

840
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,473
You know

841
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,330
it's the president.
They're doing a book signing.

842
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,550
Is there a pornstar there? It was going
to blow you at the front of the line.

843
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:14,940
Can I raise the stakes for something
funny within the last seven minutes?

844
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:17,940
All right. Fuck this. Fuck
this podcast. Here we go.
