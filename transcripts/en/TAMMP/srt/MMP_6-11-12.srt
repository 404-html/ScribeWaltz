1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,830
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:07,810
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast for Monday, June 11th

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,400
yeah,

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,380
2012 2012 which I am
actually recording on Sunday,

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,510
June 10th which is my birthday.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,693
My birthday.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,130
It's your birthday.
You fucking cunt.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,940
Another year's gone by.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,370
Your still sitting there
in that fucking place.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,130
You don't want,

11
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,710
I'll be so eat some cake.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,110
Blow out the candles,

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,220
but not in that order or else
you will burn your fucking mouth.

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,660
Mouth.
Mouf

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,170
f mouth.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,320
Hey, did, did Manny Pacquiao lose
last night? Is that what I heard?

17
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:03,760
Somebody left me a message that he
fuck he lost. That's unbelievable.

18
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:07,000
I can't believe that little
roided up guy couldn't

19
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,410
do it. I think everything is
fucking fixed. Don't listen to me.

20
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,460
I don't think it's possible for a guy
comes in and 109 pounds to put on 40

21
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:18,340
pounds of muscle,
not lose any speed or any power.

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,390
Get actually get faster and stronger.
Okay.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,050
I've seen that show.
It's called the fucking bionic man.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,960
That's the only thing that was missing.

25
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:31,090
That's what they should have shown
in the beginning of all packy.

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,980
I'll fights was him crashing some
experimental aircraft like John Denver,

27
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,060
except he doesn't die.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,570
Okay.

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,850
You know, and John Denver
would died, wouldn't have died.

30
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,370
He would have lived if he wasn't
wearing those stupid glasses.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,430
That's what did him in
those little granny glasses,

32
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:50,360
like he sat around making cookies and a
tree, you know, like those Keebler Elf.

33
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,770
That's what killed them.
A lot of people don't know that.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,370
They thought it was
massive head trauma and a,

35
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,110
and a carnage to his rib cage area with
the, with the vitals there behind it.

36
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:03,591
You know,

37
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,620
the floating rib that they gave over
to that fucking contract couldn't stop

38
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:10,880
eating the apples. Right. Wasn't
that, it wasn't massive head trauma.

39
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,770
It was very minimal,
very specific.

40
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,980
He slammed his head off the
experimental dashboard and, um,

41
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,360
his mainstream glasses then shot it
through his eyes into his brainstem,

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,030
rocky mountain hack, Colorado. And
then he died. And that's what happened.

43
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:32,230
Everybody blamed the aircraft,
you know,

44
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,780
but everybody who actually goes
out and gets a pilot's license,

45
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:38,260
I believe on the first day they
tell him not to wear those glasses.

46
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,160
When was the last time you got on a plane
and you saw your pilot wearing those

47
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,750
John Denver glasses.
All right.

48
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,100
There's a reason for
that. Think about it. Um,

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,430
what am I talking about here?

50
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,930
Can they show that fucking John Malcovich
talking to his phone and just having

51
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:58,390
the time of his life commercial
one more fucking time.

52
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,790
What's more annoying that one or
where that weird family does the, uh,

53
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,791
the acapella version of Ozzy Osborne's
crazy trade with that random black kid in

54
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,380
the back. Like where did they
get that kid? Like, you know,

55
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:16,810
it was he an exchange student and he just
seems like he's over all of it and not

56
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,770
enjoying hanging out with the other white
people as he fucking shakes the ice in

57
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:22,930
his, in his great drink, you know,

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,670
and then they gotta end that great song
with the parents singing like they're on

59
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,504
Broadway.
Right.

60
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,933
Go.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,193
You know

62
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,800
anybody else with me on that? John fucking
Malcovich sitting there all, you know,

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,070
if that, if that commercial was 30
seconds longer, he'd have the phone. Like,

64
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:47,240
like blowing him.
Yeah.

65
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,920
Tell me a joke.
Do I have anything coming up tonight now?

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,610
Oh,
okay.

67
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,000
Lobster souffle or whatever.
Pretentious fucking foodie orders.

68
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,710
Was it pretentious,
Bill,

69
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:01,800
or are you just not cultured and in his
order made you feel dumb. All right,

70
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:06,090
you got me on that one.
You got me on that one. Um,

71
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm the only one who was creeped out
that there's a fucking robot in my phone.

72
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,080
Well, whatever it is, it's
that they try to make it human.

73
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,700
Why did they do that?
Just make it sound like a robot.

74
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,290
Okay.

75
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,250
How can I help you?
Massage Parlor.

76
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,510
Gary's Mhi rack. My brains
just do it like that. So I,

77
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,350
it's still keeps that like
we keep that distance.

78
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:33,530
I don't need intimacy with this
thing that isn't fucking alive.

79
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:36,530
I don't need that 2001
space odyssey experience.

80
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,960
That's all I'm trying to say here. People,
oh, he's bill burr. He's mad at phones.

81
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,490
Get out of his way. Everybody.
This guy's got something to say.

82
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,510
What's the deal with y'all?

83
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,153
MMM.

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,680
You have a wonder if you're going to
stand the test of time, your decisions.

85
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,910
You know what I mean?
I had a fucking panic attack last night,

86
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,800
you know, turning 44 years old. I just
woke up mill and night like Jesus Christ,

87
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,290
I'm sliding into 50,
you know,

88
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:12,040
and I don't give a fuck how well you
take care of yourself when you're 50.

89
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:17,041
You fucking look 50 unless you had some
fat for your ass blasted India face and

90
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:21,160
then you just look shiny.
But everybody knows you're 50.

91
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,840
You're not fooling anybody with your
real housewife for forehead, Aria,

92
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,530
for forehead. Eight head. Huh?

93
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,180
Is that show still on?
You know,

94
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,840
how long are they going to keep doing
that to the clams are hanging out in their

95
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,110
bikinis.
It's not how it

96
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,350
is that,
how am I going to do that one for?

97
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,430
Let's try to beat beat
out the drew Carey show.

98
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:49,960
How many fucking episodes that mummy
years of that fucking show did they do

99
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,940
while people still didn't give a fuck?

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,770
Um,
the

101
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,460
second they rolled in that fat lady
with the makeup, I mean, right there,

102
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,230
it's just like, we're really not going
to develop anything on this show. Are We?

103
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:06,090
If we're just going to try to keep
it, uh, just kinda keep it wacky. Um,

104
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,250
ah, Jeez. There goes the
phone. Hang on a second.

105
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,360
Hang on a fucking second. Christ's sake.
Why don't I shut the damn phone off?

106
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:18,290
Who's this? Who's this dopey?
My mom. It's my dad. Oh.

107
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,890
I just chose the podcast over
my own father, who I owe.

108
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,930
I owe a huge apology to.
I owe a huge apology to my dad.

109
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,293
All right.

110
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,910
Last night I was sitting on a couch
Bududa Lou do it mine and my own fucking

111
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,430
business. Lou Lou Lou. Dude.

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,800
I was watching metal mania on VH one.

113
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,980
Metal Mania.
Cleo.

114
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,700
Okay.

115
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,610
I think my dog is sleeping
with, with his eyes open. Oh No.

116
00:06:47,611 --> 00:06:51,300
She just moved her eyebrows. Dude.
Where the fuck did you just go?

117
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,093
Uh Huh.

118
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,540
Cleo. Whatever you're thinking
about, it's going to be okay.

119
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,243
All right.

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,650
Anyways, you know, it's weird when my
dog sees a squirrel through a window, it,

121
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,320
it cries

122
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,750
like it's a long lost buddy.

123
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,860
But if my dog is outside and
there's a squirrel, you know,

124
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,310
if there's no window between
my dog and the squirrel it,

125
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,880
we'll try and rip his
fucking head off so I don't,

126
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,910
does anybody know anything
about dogs? What is it crying
about? Is it crying? Like,

127
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,260
Ooh, I want to rip it set off.
Oh, I wish I could just end.

128
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,460
That thing's fucking life.

129
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,660
You don't make any sense to me anyway.

130
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:39,680
So I'm watching fucking
metal mania alliteration.

131
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,630
This has gotta be a hit show, right?
So I'm watching this shit and uh,

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,720
okay.

133
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,690
At the risk of pissing
off a lot of listeners,

134
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,550
I think most metal slash hair metal,

135
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,650
it arguably is the worst
fucking music ever made.

136
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,220
Worst the disco, I don't know why disco
gets such a bad rap. Like disco was the,

137
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,850
is that the default example of bad music?
The Way Hitler is,

138
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:12,700
the default example of,
of evil duties.

139
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:17,650
The next Tatler it's always the next
fucking Hitler never pull pot yet. No,

140
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,830
never a fucking, I dunno. Pick a
noun. I don't even know another one.

141
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,163
Okay.

142
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,080
You know, Ivan, the terrible,
was that a wrestler?

143
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,640
Was that a comic strip? I know. Horrible.
Haggar I don't fucking know. Right. See,

144
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:37,540
I don't even, I don't even have any
other examples. Whose fault is that?

145
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,510
Bill is a library right down the street.
I'll go fuck yourself.

146
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:42,860
You know what I'm saying?
Um,

147
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,320
everybody always talks about disco and
how bad disco was and it just needs to be

148
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,270
a change man.
Right?

149
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,020
And like then they'll talk about like the,

150
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,280
and all this new wave shit and the
punk scene and all that, but what they,

151
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:04,281
they completely fucking ignore
is that right after disco,

152
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,170
uh,

153
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,170
just immediately the mainstream then went
over to like this fucking heavy metal

154
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:14,070
music,
like that was better than disco.

155
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,600
I think it's fucking worse.

156
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,950
And I think all these times where they
keep saying that everybody there was a

157
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:24,390
big change and that this quality music
came out. I don't know if that happens.

158
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:29,330
I think it just, you know, you know,
nirvana comes around and they're, what,

159
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:30,111
four years later,

160
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,640
everybody's listening to fucking
old town or the main stream is,

161
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,580
it's just this long,
tragic,

162
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,980
just flat line of shit music.
I was watching the shit last night,

163
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:46,610
shit that I used to like, and my jaw was
on the ground. How fucking bad it was.

164
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,720
It was horrible. I, I
actually, I was so bad.

165
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:55,721
I was like texting paragraphs to the
sensation Joe to Rosa capitol records.

166
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,800
The guy who built capital records.
Joe Rosa, I'll actually, you go, wow.

167
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,380
I'll get a little intimate here with you.
I'll,

168
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:07,280
I'll read you the text message
I fucking wrote Joe. Uh,

169
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,060
Joe, where the hell out
here? Where the hell are we?

170
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:10,680
Okay.

171
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,190
Joe Hair slash heavy metal
is the worst music ever made.

172
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:18,660
Disco gets a bad rap watching
metal mania on VH one.

173
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:22,620
Guns and roses. Queens,
Reich, wasp, quiet riot.

174
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,030
David Lee Roth Solo Shit.
It's fucking God awful. Yeah.

175
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,580
I saw David Lee Roth on, on his, uh,

176
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:35,960
eat them and smile tour
and I saw that video last night.

177
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,030
Go wing crazy

178
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,090
from day he,

179
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,880
that sounds like a song Wahlberg's
character would have written with John C.

180
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,560
Reilly and Boogie nights.
I remember that

181
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,300
he will rock you

182
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,360
and he will low you like it was,
it was that bad

183
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,860
teenage Frankenstein.
I'm a teenage package died.

184
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,210
You're telling me that that song
is better than more than a woman?

185
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,220
You know, I think arguably it's, I dunno,

186
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,460
I can't believe the shit that I used to
watch and like I used to listen to this

187
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,560
shit around checks,
you know,

188
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,050
just hopelessly thinking
that this would get me laid.

189
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:37,020
Like they would think that I
was some Badass, like Loner Bang

190
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,950
your,
I mean,

191
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,460
the whole fucking, the fact that
I never got laid in high school,

192
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:47,700
it just fuck it went away. Right
in that moment. It was like,

193
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,240
this is what I was going to do.
I wasn't going to try to make them laugh.

194
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,900
I wasn't going to hit on him.
I wasn't going to try it.

195
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,110
I was just going to play this music
around them and this was going to bring me

196
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:04,111
to the fucking promise land looking
like a fucking teenage Ron Howard.

197
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,950
That was my game plan.
Is it any wonder I failed Jesus Christ?

198
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:13,720
And I remember I would be
watching it on a big square TV.

199
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,490
Um, just watch it. Lay it down.

200
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,840
Lay Your Dad is fucking
horrific fucking music.

201
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,090
And my dad would come in and just have
his face would just be all twisted up,

202
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:31,510
gone. Jesus Christ. What the fuck?
You listen to it. You like to shift.

203
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,570
And I thought I was a rebel. I mean
he doesn't know. Understand man.

204
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,380
You know what? He totally
understood. He totally understood.

205
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,190
My Dad called it back in [inaudible]
83 called it jungle music,

206
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,700
says a bunch of shit.

207
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,950
He told me straight up
gay man, he was like, son,

208
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,040
this music you're listening
to is fucking horrible.

209
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,220
And there was all these
shout at the devil.

210
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,350
Is anybody really going to sit there
and defend that fucking song? Doodoo

211
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,273
delay

212
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,500
Doodoo Doh,

213
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,930
Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh,
Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh.

214
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,840
You couldn't find that you do.
You could fucking,

215
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,110
a five year old could write down
on a xylophone shout at the devil.

216
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,680
Never knew why we were shouting,
you know,

217
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,240
blacking lawless, blackie
lawless, that was his show name.

218
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,140
And he took a radial arm saw and cut
the blade in half and put one hat,

219
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:36,070
one blade, one of his forearms at
one or the other on these leather.

220
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,900
Uh, I'm going to do a bunch of
dishes in an evil way. Gloves

221
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,900
and we all thought it was crazy.

222
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,560
Can you imagine if we
gave you a forearm shiver?

223
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,290
It was just Eddie used to throw
fucking raw meat to the crowd.

224
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,041
A couple of them did.

225
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,940
That's why that lady Gaga covering
or clam and that fucking Pastrami,

226
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,040
it's just been done. You know, comes
out in a fucking egg from Mork.

227
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,103
I Dunno,

228
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,310
I've seen the nasally horror
act my whole fucking life.

229
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,810
You know those fucking checks with
the big noses. They can, you know,

230
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,190
that's like white people's answer to the
big black girl who can sing at church.

231
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,470
We, we what, what the, what the
check we bring to that fight is the,

232
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,530
the white chick with the big nose
white chicks with big noses can sing.

233
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,020
I don't know what it is.
Barbara Streisand,

234
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,740
right. I Dunno. It's like their nose is,

235
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,030
it's like that dome at the top of
all those con con uh, concert halls.

236
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:50,000
There you go, Bill. Try to spit
it out. You dumb fuck. But um,

237
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,530
I, some emails people, I
want people try to tell me

238
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,290
how a rowdy crowd love book,

239
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:04,690
by the way. Good. Damn. It'd be,

240
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:09,691
tell me the musical validity
that that has over like disco,

241
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,210
that all those people probably
had Comiskey plaque when
they blew up those disco

242
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:19,810
records like fucking five, six years
later. That's what they were listening to.

243
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,483
Okay.

244
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,483
Nope,

245
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,220
that was a hit.
It was a hit in the 80s.

246
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,300
Okay.

247
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,230
Wow.
Do I owe my dad an apology?

248
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,720
I just, I was sitting there just one
video after the queen's Reich. I mean,

249
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:52,360
all this stuff that I thought was just
fucking unbelievable. You know what?

250
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,160
I'm going to get emails this week.
It's like,

251
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,020
I don't know what it's going to be.
It's going to be like,

252
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:01,930
people either going to be like, yes,
absolutely. This is going to be,

253
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,100
there's going to be no middle ground.

254
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,980
If he was going to 100%
agree with me or a,

255
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,160
I'm going to get punched
in the face by Eddie trunk.

256
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,133
Okay.

257
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,690
I just, I was taken aback. I mean,

258
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:20,770
I haven't seen those videos and fucking
forever Kasian I'll go back and I'll

259
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,750
look at some old videos,
but I mean a lot of it was like ACDC,

260
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,550
like shit they can like, you know,
I mean back in black is timeless.

261
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:32,310
There's some timely shit in there.
You know?

262
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,420
I even watched that guns and roses,
sweet child of mine and I thought,

263
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:37,320
I thought it was horrible.

264
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,913
Wow.

265
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,673
Please.

266
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,640
And that little fucking Shim Sham
dance he was doing, it's just was

267
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,850
okay.

268
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,950
Oh, and then the emotion he
tried to have in the end.

269
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,823
Wow.

270
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,220
All right. And they kind of
closed his eyes like, ah,

271
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,240
I really went somewhere when I've, I
was just fucking horrible. You know,

272
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,410
I was right down. I helped
hold it up. Oh, def Leppard,

273
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:10,340
pour some sugar, rob me. I hated
that when I fucking came out

274
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,530
and all the ladies liked it and he
came out in his acid washed jeans.

275
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,410
I actually saw him on
that tour, didn't I? Yeah.

276
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,340
Reynolds' Coliseum and
Tesla opened up Tessa,

277
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:25,860
which I didn't think they were that bed.
They weren't that bad.

278
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,270
I Dunno. I thought you're supposed to go
back and listen to the fucking music of,

279
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:36,620
uh, of your youth being like, wow, that
stuff was wow. That was awesome man.

280
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,820
I remember that. And then, you know, that
was the first time I tried blow, you know,

281
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:44,920
reminiscent
actually first time I ever saw cocaine,

282
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,563
uh,

283
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,750
sought and saw it being done was a,

284
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,320
at the providence civic center.

285
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,910
I saw ACDC on the who made
who tour with loudness,

286
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,600
the Japanese heavy metal band that
couldn't speak any English yet.

287
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:03,330
Sang in English.
Um,

288
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,690
I just can't imagine
the disconnect as yours.

289
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,260
I can't imagine like memorizing a bunch
of Japanese and going and over there and

290
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:11,820
just singing it and then not knowing,
uh,

291
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:14,630
what the fuck I was saying going out there

292
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,940
and everybody just be like,

293
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,390
I have no idea what I just said.
Tee Shirts at 20 bucks.

294
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:27,660
Did I just say that or did I say, are you
ready to rock? I have no fucking idea.

295
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,460
Um, anyways, so I saw them,

296
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:37,050
they opened up and uh,
anyways,

297
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,150
we're out in the parking lot
and we're drinking beers.

298
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:43,200
They can work crazy driving of course,
cause it's the 80s.

299
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,090
This was right around before,

300
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,870
right before mad kicked in and they
used to bring like wreckage from a fatal

301
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:51,570
drunk driving accident.
Anybody else's high school do that?

302
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,050
They actually brought a car
from a fatal drunk driving, uh,

303
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,680
accident. They dragged in
onto the lawn of our campus.

304
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,800
You want to call it a campus?
A little island with the tree.

305
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,480
They just left it there and we all just
stared at it trying to figure out how

306
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,560
many people were in the car, how many
people died. And then we just walked away.

307
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,480
Like, you know, when you're
young, you don't give a fuck.

308
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:19,410
10 minutes later you're talking about,
dude, I can't fucking rap tonight. Rat.

309
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,570
That was the word. Get wrapped. Getting
steroid handed, right? So anyways,

310
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,480
we're driving down their beer between
your legs. As you do see eighties,

311
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,140
you know,
you fucking lifted weights all that week.

312
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,590
Never all of it above the waist.
Curls,

313
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,690
fucking bench shoulders.
Nobody did squats in the 80s.

314
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,830
Nobody did.
Right?

315
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:47,520
So you got your fucking tight five oh
one blues on with the Little Pencil

316
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:50,040
fucking legs.
Then you overdeveloped upper body,

317
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,360
you stupid gold chain and a,
he had a beer between your legs.

318
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,640
That's how he did it.
So we're fucking going down.

319
00:19:56,641 --> 00:20:01,030
There were probably on eight
a piece fucking hammered. Uh,

320
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,750
I was driving this piece of shit.
83 Ford Ranger.

321
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,840
I got like five fucking
drunk friends in the back,

322
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,390
which was still not even
grounds for getting pulled over.

323
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,010
You could just have people in the back,

324
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,300
like you bring in fucking turkeys off
to slaughter. Nobody gave a shit. Right?

325
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,760
So we pull in and right as I pulled
up and it got a parking spot,

326
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,530
there was this kid,

327
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:27,360
he had his door open and he kinda had
like a Sammy Hagar meets John Fogarty

328
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:28,680
haircut blonde hair.

329
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,390
And I remember he fucking did
align right as I was pulling up.

330
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,860
And I had fortunately had my
window up and he saw me and he saw,

331
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:42,690
we all had ACDC tee shirts on or whatever,
and he just got to, the cow is just,

332
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,270
it's like a haunted house right
up to the fucking window.

333
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,080
And I was just trying to take
it all in like, okay, he just,

334
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,190
how am I supposed to behave around
somebody with, with WHO's on coke?

335
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,160
Does this guy have like, you
know, Hulk Strength Right now?

336
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:04,570
Is he going to tip over the truck?
Um, anyway, so that was the,

337
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,100
Fred was the first time I saw blow.

338
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,790
I don't even know what the point of
all that was. I was just shocked. Look,

339
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,340
I know it wasn't all bad like
the street early Metallica,

340
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,120
you know, right through and justice for
all. I know that that stuff was great,

341
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,270
but uh, I'll tell you it
is slim. Fucking pickings,

342
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,050
my friends slim pickings.
Um,

343
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,770
okay.

344
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,560
Ah, I don't even, I didn't
know what to tell you.

345
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,880
Yeah,

346
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,030
I mean, I even go back sometimes I try
to listen to appetite for destruction.

347
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:38,831
I know that's this,

348
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:42,710
this watershed fucking moment and that
music with some of those fucking songs,

349
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,650
they're out to get me.
So you can stop me.

350
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,410
Take that one to heart, kill yourself. Um,

351
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
all right then I'd get me
a lot of fucking criticism.

352
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,840
Okay.

353
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,870
Ah, really. Okay, well let's,
you don't want, I think it's
time for some advertising.

354
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,990
You're listening to the Monday morning
podcast, by the way. And this is my, uh,

355
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,430
my trip down memory lane.

356
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,570
The 1980 [inaudible] they'll fuck and 80.

357
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,740
Did I nail it though, by the way?
Everyone had the five one blues.

358
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,880
Remember that button fly dude,
I washed him three times and you're nuts.

359
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,130
Couldn't breathe.
You know,

360
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,010
and you wonder why you've got all these
fucking crazy kids that need to be on

361
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,220
drugs now. There you go. Hey everybody,

362
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,600
father's day is next weekend.
God knows I'm going to get my dad a man.

363
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,830
Great Guy.

364
00:22:33,831 --> 00:22:37,520
Tried to help me out 30 fricking years
ago telling me that the music I was

365
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:40,550
lifting, the two sucked and I
didn't even listen to him. Um,

366
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,330
you got to act quickly on this one.
Seriously. Uh, it's Monday. All right.

367
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,620
Is there anything worse than when either
mother's Day or father's day comes

368
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:51,710
around and you ran out of time
and you didn't get him a card?

369
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:54,620
You didn't get them flowers. You didn't
get them. You didn't get them a damn man.

370
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:59,060
Great. Why don't you just take care of
it today? All right. Just go on there.

371
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,810
Slap it on your cad and
he's going to be psyched.

372
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,780
He's going to be psyched.
Father's days, next weekend.

373
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,300
You got to act quickly and get
the perfect father's day gift.

374
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:12,710
It's the man get man. Great Grill
enhancement system. So heavy duty grill.

375

Great banner on billboard.com

381
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,170

Every bill burr order comes with a
heavy duty man, Greg grilling brush.

383
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,680
Um, so for father's Day, go to
[inaudible] dot com the podcast page.

384
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:52,820
Hit the button and take advantage
of our special $20 offer.

385
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,600
These things are great.
Instead of having like those little Wussy,

386
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,780
you know like when you buy your grills
you have like, you know, little skinny,

387
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:04,010
you have all the way from
the little Hibachi ones that
they're the size, the uh,

388
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,650
the grill marks,
basically the size of pretzel rods.

389
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:11,290
And then if you get a halfway decent
one, you know, they move up to the,

390
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,150
the thick pretzel rods.
When, when you were a kid,

391
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,750
you pretended like you smoked a cigar.

392
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,250
Wouldn't it be great if you could just
switch it out and just have the same size

393
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,380
ones you do when you go to
your favorite steak houses?

394
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,960
That's what these guys are
doing with demand. Great.

395
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:27,050
It's actually a genius system.
Um,

396
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,170
and it kind of annoys me that I didn't
think of doing that. It's the same way.

397
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:32,810
It's like building a hot Rod,
right?

398
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:35,810
You're switching out the crap you got
at the factory to put it on some high

399
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:39,590
performance stuff. Help Your Dad's
supercharged his grill this Friday.

400
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,960
Maybe we'll make you a burger,
you know,

401
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,250
and you guys can share an awkward hug
the man. Great. Everybody $20 off.

402
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,670
There we go. There we go. That
was, that was, that was easy.

403
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,220
That was easy advertising.
Oh, and by the way,

404
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:55,370
I finally sent off a check to the,
uh,

405
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:58,400
the wounded warriors project so
I can stop feeling like a fraud.

406
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,030
I know I told you I finally
got to check in two weeks ago,

407
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:06,830
but I've been so damn busy that I
couldn't take two seconds to click on the

408
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:10,040
Internet to find where to send the
check. And uh, we gave him a nice check.

409
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:14,480
I rounded it up to the next hundred
cause I'm a good shit. And, uh,

410
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,040
I felt like it did my good deed.

411
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,710
And if you're new to my
podcast and you wondering, oh,

412
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,180
how can I donate to this podcast and
the wounded warriors project all at the

413
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,014
same time,

414
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,200
just go to [inaudible] dot com
click on the podcast page and uh,

415
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,210
and you'll see a banner for Amazon.
All right?

416
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:35,600
And if you're going to buy anything on
amazon.com instead of just going directly

417
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:40,310
there, just go to the podcast page on
my website, click on the banner and a,

418
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:41,570
whatever you buy on there,

419
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,420
they kicked me a percentage
and then I take 10% of that.

420
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:47,690
Give it to the wounded warriors project.
And now you can feel good about yourself

421
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,010
knowing that you helped a group
of people that truly needed it.

422
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,910
And one jackass who, uh, probably doesn't.

423
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,100
All right. All right, let's start it
off. Good. It started off as a good read.

424
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,200
You know, it's a good read or that
three o'clock. Hi. Um, all right,

425
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:10,340
let's get back to the, uh,
the podcast. Um, all right.

426
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,370
What do we got here? She would,
you know what? I think it's time.

427
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,550
I think it's time for a, uh, for uh, for,

428
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,950
for one of a pyramid scheme. Let's read
this one. Hello Mr. Byrd. I liked that.

429
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:26,540
Very formal. A lot of respect. We did
it out of respect. We were wise guys.

430
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,700
We did what we wanted.
Um,

431
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,350
I am writing to you today because
I need some help about something.

432
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,110
Uh, recently my girlfriend's father,
mother, father separated. Thank God,

433
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,670
uh,
started reeling,

434
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,520
really annoying everyone with calls,

435
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:49,521
emails and meeting requests for
some Mlm Multilevel Marketing,

436
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:54,930
Aka pyramid schemes. I was pyramid
schemes. Retarded little brother.

437
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,480
All right. Your girlfriend's
father started really
annoying. Everyone. Okay, I'm,

438
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:01,560
I'm back on Pacey, right. At first it was,

439
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:06,120
please look at a DVD about a poor guy
becoming a rich guy by spending his time

440
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,940
building a water aqueduct
instead of wasting his time,

441
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:13,680
like the second guy doing the hard work
and carrying the water on his back to

442
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:18,570
the village plan for the future, they
said, or some other bullshit of that sort.

443
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,291
Uh,

444
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:23,220
there's been a few other great and amazing
business opportunities that I could

445
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:28,050
just delete from my inbox. But this
time it's just gone too far. Okay,

446
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:29,580
so first they gave you the DVD,

447
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,420
then he's sending you some emails and it
was sort of, yeah, whatever, you know,

448
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,340
use the DVD as a doorstop or maybe to
break up your weed and then you just

449
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:42,480
delete the emails. So, so
far he's not being annoying.
Let's move onto the second.

450
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:45,180
That's the first 10 pages of
this screen play. All right,

451
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,950
let's move on to the action here.

452
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,670
Now he requires all of us to drop all
our phone internet providers to go with

453
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:56,940
his offer.
What do you mean he requires you?

454
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,660
He actually can't get anyone
to go along with that crap.

455
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,940
But as in every fable,

456
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,680
he's got many pseudo facts about
a big thing that will come, oh,

457
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:12,630
big thing that will make this company
rich and that for the small fee of $500,

458
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:17,100
we can start selling those great
deals to how is this shit legal?

459
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,290
Um, by now he's contacting me
everyday, text message to Mimi, emails,

460
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:25,530
Facebook comments, all of
that. At first he was nice.

461
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,290
Now we starting to use his
skills on me saying things like,

462
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,890
he's doing this for me and
for his daughter's future.

463
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,630
I couldn't believe he argued back when I
told him I believed it was not worth my

464
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:40,830
time and effort for the little
monetary reward. Good for you.

465
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,840
He said I was wrong not to want to do it.
I mean,

466
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:50,070
my opinion is wrong. Lol. Uh, in any case,

467
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,140
if it was anybody else, I
would take pleasure. Why can't
I read this week? I mean,

468
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:57,890
I know I can't read every week,
but this week I'm just really just,

469
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,590
was it cause I just had bacon is the
grease fucking up my clogging up my

470
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,600
synopsis here. All right, let's try this
build. It's dragging a little momentum.

471
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,210
In any case,
it was anybody else.

472
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,410
I would take pleasure out of telling
him to go fuck himself with his residual

473
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:17,310
income and that I am perfectly happy
to be a fucking loser with the linear

474
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:20,870
income. Uh, he taught me
those terms. Yuck. Uh,

475
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:24,840
I want to tell him that I would like to
work by the hour better than having to

476
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:28,380
beg or suck a dick in the back
of a gas station to sell a phone,

477
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:32,730
Internet package that will be worth a few
points. I already have a great day job.

478
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:36,240
I work on my photography.
I played PC games.

479
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,070
I jerk off a lot too. I have no time
for this. Not that I would even not,

480
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,790
I would even if I had the time,

481
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,690
I'm thinking of a good old fading
technique I learned in the past.

482
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,800
Love relationships,

483
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,970
but we'll always be there at Christmas
parties and such pitching his bullshit.

484
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,470
Please help me before I strangle
him. Thank you. Uh, all right.

485
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,340
What do you do here?
Well,

486
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:03,820
you've already done what I said what I
was going to fix it say was basically say

487
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:06,910
I'm not interested.
Um,

488
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,410
why don't you make your own
DVD and what'd he hands you?

489
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,740
A DVD of what you should be
investing in investing in you.

490
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,420
Just hand him a DVD of you going,

491
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,270
thank you for your interest
in making me a millionaire.

492
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:23,170
Unfortunately at this time
I am not interested. Uh,

493
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,620
please don't try again later
just to see how annoying he is.

494
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:30,490
Why don't you start spamming him?
Nah, that's gay. Don't do that.

495
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,150
Sorry. I'm fucking throwing shit
against the wall here. What can you do?

496
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,830
Why don't you just, anytime he starts
bringing it up, just anything. Oh,

497
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:44,030
Jj is just fucking yell something.

498
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,560
Why don't you just go all my God really
loud and walk out of the room every time

499
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:50,394
he does.

500
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,040
How about you get an Air Horn and
anytime he brings it up just right in his

501
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:01,350
face. Something. I don't know
what I mean I don't, I don't know.

502
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,160
You already told the guy
you're not interested. I can
tell you what you don't do.

503
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,520
Don't bitch about him to your girlfriend.
All right.

504
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:16,460
He's his own separate annoying entity.
And uh,

505
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,810
always keep it a joke between
you and your girl. You know,

506
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,030
that's the only way you could do it.

507
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:26,510
If you really care about this girl and
you want to and you want to stay with her,

508
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:30,080
if you don't, this is a great reason
to fucking dumper. But I mean,

509
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:34,580
I don't know what to tell you.
Uh, this is your girlfriend's dad.

510
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,220
And, uh, to be honest with you,
if he wasn't doing this shit,

511
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:41,000
he probably do something else
that would annoy you. You know,

512
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:44,360
maybe this is his passive aggressive way
of trying to just ruin a part of your

513
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:48,350
life because he knows at the end
of the day, you're fucking his kid.

514
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,470
You ever think about that?
Why don't you stop being so selfish?

515
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,470
Put yourself in his position
for as an annoying as his,

516
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,310
his,
you know,

517
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,030
pyramid scheme is the end of the
day when you need your Dick Suck.

518
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:08,250
You're going to this guy's
daughter. So you know, if, if you,

519
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,740
if you look at it that way, I think that
you're winning. All right? All right.

520
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:17,450
Bill fathers is another topic. Uh,
what's with fathers having this,

521
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,070
the standard ringtones,

522
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:23,600
standard father's shoes and not giving
a shit what they were for a hat.

523
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:29,030
Oh, I can answer that. Despite
the fact that I'm not a father,

524
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,290
I know what that is.

525
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:35,030
It's what I've been fighting my entire
adult life is having the woman in your

526
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:40,010
life just wear you down. It's
not that. And then just the

527
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,540
laws in society,
it's

528
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,490
what happens when you get
married is a guy, is the,

529
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:52,750
uh,
the pilot light goes out

530
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:59,050
for a lot of things. You just don't
give a fuck anymore, you know?

531
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,860
I know you have kids, so you put them
first and all of that type of shit,

532
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:06,310
but this, it, as much as
it's, from what I've heard,

533
00:33:06,311 --> 00:33:09,820
having a kid is the greatest fucking thing
ever, and I'm not making fun of that.

534
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,070
But there is a part of you that dies,

535
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,010
you know that howling at the
moon that fuck it. You know,

536
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,450
don't want to, I just
living this, just something,

537
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,660
this is a part of life that just
dies and you just don't give a shit.

538
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:30,310
You're a beaten man. All
right? You gave him the love.

539
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,050
You're married.

540
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,160
There's no way out without just fucking
having your wallet ripped out through

541
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,770
your balls and then back
into your chest cavity,

542
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:42,220
through your heart and through
your spinal cord. You're fucked.

543
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,800
You're looking at a beaten man.
He doesn't give a fuck.

544
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,350
All I need is the phone to make
a noise, you know, and I can,

545
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,960
I know it's ringing and I'll answer it.

546
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,230
I just need these shoes to cover
my feet so it doesn't hurt.

547
00:33:56,231 --> 00:34:01,030
If I step on a nail and I don't get wet
when it rains and I don't give a fuck,

548
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,270
I just don't want to get a
sunburn on top of my head.

549
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,490
I'll fucking wear whatever hat
you give me. I don't give a shit.

550
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,370
You just don't give a shit after awhile.
I guess what it is.

551
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,640
It's really sad actually when that
part of you dies. You know what I mean?

552
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,980
Like I hate all that.

553
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:22,540
That midlife crisis shit that people talk
about that if you're in your mid life,

554
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,590
you can't go out and have a good
time if you go out and get hammered.

555
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,210
If you buy a cool car,

556
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,380
you know if you haven't played guitar
forever and then you want to start playing

557
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:35,290
guitar again, it's like you
trying to recapture your youth.

558
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,910
Now I'm trying to fucking live. I'm trying
to, to have something that excites me.

559
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:45,370
You can't be excited beyond
a certain fucking age. When
are you going to grow up?

560
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:49,330
I think it's time to grow up and if
anybody says that, even if it's a woman,

561
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,750
you slap him right in the fucking
face and say, how dare you.

562
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,070
That's how you get away with it.

563
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,090
Because the second the bouncer
sees you slap a woman, the face,

564
00:34:58,091 --> 00:35:01,600
he's coming over there to choke you out.
But if he hears the magic phrase,

565
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:02,440
how dare you,

566
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:06,010
he stops in his tracks cause he's
immediately knows that the woman was

567
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:09,880
completely out of line, that that
works. Try it out this weekend.

568
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,310
Slap a woman in the face and then scream.
How dare you.

569
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,910
I guarantee you that the physical way
that you're removed from that bar will be

570
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:24,430
less than if you just
hauled off and slapped.

571
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:29,320
A woman is haul off and slap a woman.
You're an animal. Okay? If you,

572
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,250
if you say, how dare you right
afterwards, you're sort of the victim.

573
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,290
That theory has never been tested.
Um, if you're a faithful listener,

574
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:48,680
I'd like you to try it out.
Not just randomly.

575
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,210
You know, you got to find a woman
that deserves it. In other words,

576
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:57,430
stand in a bar for about eight minutes.
This is bad.

577
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,520
Don't do it. I do not Cook
Doug. Uh, the slapping of women.

578
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,960
That was actually to get me out of any
legal trouble and I said it in a funny

579
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:09,800
voice, so then I'll get in trouble. We're
weren't you mocking or it wasn't that,

580
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,070
it wasn't even the warning part
of the comedy. Mr [inaudible]. Oh,

581
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,640
go fuck yourself, counselor. Huh?

582
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,230
What are you supposed to win
when those Matlock suits? Um,

583
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:25,790
all right. Do Roses. Bio
To hell is this bill?

584
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:29,810
I was reading Joe to Rose's IMD
be bio and it said something like,

585
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:34,400
he did all these things despite the
fact that he was born without shoulders.

586
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,400
Is this a fact? Um, no,

587
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,650
that's actually
people who say Joe,

588
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,360
like that whole urban myth that Joe Rosa
doesn't have shoulders is like the same

589
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:53,361
thing like that Mama Cass from the Mamas
and Papas died by choking on a chicken

590
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:56,140
bone.
You know,

591
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,060
people just assume that that's why
she died because she was a fat chick.

592
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,360
But that isn't how she, she died
of a, of a, of cardiac arrest.

593
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,140
But the rumor started that she died
choking on a chicken bone and a,

594
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:14,100
and it stuck
like that Gerbil up Richard Gere's ass.

595
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,120
That's just some urban
myths that just never died,

596
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:22,030
that just have no facts behind them.
Um,

597
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,650
Dan Richard Gere,

598
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,470
he ain't get a durable up his ass
and it got stuck or some shit.

599
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:31,240
I don't ran the wrong way. Fucking
fell asleep in a rest area up his ass.

600
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,500
I don't know what the fuck happened,
but um,

601
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,470
you know that like, it's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard of my life.

602
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:45,060
And that was just clearly started by
somebody whose girlfriend thought Richard

603
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:50,010
Gere was dreamy and he just walked
into a bar and just, just set it.

604
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,410
I mean, I don't know how these fucking
things start. Jode Rosa has shoulders.

605
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,120
If Joe de Rosa did not have shoulders,
it would be impossible for him to then,

606
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,370
you know,
he'd be missing his shoulder joint.

607
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:05,540
He couldn't hold that microphone in the,
the um,

608
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,030
and drudging this way that he does

609
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,740
the reality is what Joe is missing is
he's missing the meat between his neck and

610
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:18,200
his shoulders. That's what he's
missing. Like it's a birth defect.

611
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:21,460
Joe was actually born without collarbones

612
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,940
if you are in, which gives the, the
fact that he doesn't have collarbones,

613
00:38:25,941 --> 00:38:30,740
it gives the illusion that he doesn't
have any shoulders. And the reality is,

614
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,910
is because his shoulders are aware that,
I don't know what you call it,

615
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,130
the shoulder taint, it's that meet
between your neck and your shoulders.

616
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:45,120
Joe was not born with that,
unfortunately. And, and even sadder,

617
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,660
there is no cure at this time,

618
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:50,290
but that doesn't mean we're not going to
stop fighting and we're going to have a

619
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:53,290
benefit, which is trying to get, you
know, it's hard to get all these guys,

620
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,910
you know, get everybody's schedules lined
up, but we're definitely going to have,

621
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,550
um,
you know,

622
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:06,180
some sort of benefit to try and get
Joe some sort of prosthesis for a,

623
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:12,580
you know, plastic collar bones. So,
all right. I hope that clears it up,

624
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,600
but,
um,

625
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,600
I'm not trying to take away the fact that
he has accomplished amazing things for

626
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:23,320
a guy who has a defective torso.
You know,

627
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,160
you ever think about that?

628
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,910
Me collarbones are a bone that you
really do take for granted. You know,

629
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,360
he really is an inspiration
that just why is this sensation?

630
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,700
You'd have to be a sensation to achieve
what he's done with that awful body,

631
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,080
that awful hand that God
dealt him. Um, all right.

632
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:42,700
Okay.

633
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,520
All right. So Bill, you've been,
you've been doing a lot of activities,

634
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,740
you know, when they say what do you, what
do you buy the man who has everything,

635
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:52,270
you know, what you do,
you get them activities.

636
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,050
My girl gets annoyed at me cause she goes,
I don't know what to get you.

637
00:39:56,051 --> 00:40:00,500
You buy anything that you
want. You know, I fucking a,

638
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,280
and I do and I don't apologize for it.

639
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,620
If I want to play hockey, you know,
I'll go buy some skates. God dammit.

640
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,770
I got to sit around and wait for you.

641
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:12,820
Wait for a fucking birthday and a Goddamn
desert with flames coming out of it

642
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:16,180
before I get what the fuck I want.
All right.

643
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:21,440
And the words of Bobbi Brown, I made this
money. You didn't, I'm fucking buying it.

644
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:24,870
I want to buy a guitar. I'm going
to fucking buy it. So she's,

645
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,110
I don't know what to catch you.
Should I get you a shirt?

646
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,440
You know what? I'd rather you
slapped me in the fucking face.

647
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:36,270
Don't ever get anybody a shirt for
a gut for birthday or Christmas.

648
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:39,880
Said that's the go fuck yourself
gift. Here you go. Here's something.

649
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,270
Here's something that I could
put paper around and you could,

650
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,610
you don't buy anybody close.
How dare you?

651
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,540
So the lovely Nia has, has been
getting me a, you know, just,

652
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,960
she got me tickets to the John Bonham
birthday bash, which was the shit.

653
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,200
Um, oh, that was one,

654
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:09,180
a heavy metal video that I fucking
loved. And really, it actually,

655
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,360
uh, stood the test of
time was the second album.

656
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,800
Um,
I liked the second skid row.

657
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:22,640
Sebastian Sebastian Bach, Sebastian
Sebastian Bach bill or Sebastian back.

658
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,240
Sebastian Bach.

659
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,843
MMM.

660
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,410
They had a couple songs on there
that I liked. It wasn't all bad,

661
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:33,950
but I mean come on. I was,
it was shockingly bad.

662
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,570
You went from that awful quiet
right video to teenage Frankenstein.

663
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,140
Like I just was, I couldn't, I couldn't
fucking believe it. It was unbelievable.

664
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:47,140
So anyways, so the lovely
Nia, yesterday she took me uh,

665
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:52,140
uh, horseback riding over
in Griffith Park and uh,

666
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,790
oh I shouldn't have said that. Why
did I say where we went? Ah, Jesus.

667
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,710
Cause now I'm going to shit on
it. Um, so we went over there.

668
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,450
I've only written a horse once in my life.

669
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,800
And the hard fucking thing about riding
a horse when you've never written one or

670
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:11,240
taken any lessons is when they start
trodding is to stop your balls from

671
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:15,350
slamming off the fucking saddle. There's
a way you supposed to ride with them,

672
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:18,530
which of course they don't explain.
So I was kind of, you know,

673
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,690
that was like my goal to learn how to
ride a horse while it trots without having

674
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:28,340
my nuts slammed, you know, backup into
my body. Like I'm freezing to death.

675
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,880
You guys are aware of that, right?
Your balls pull up into you.

676
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,840
If it gets cold enough

677
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,680
in a desperate attempt to preserve heat
down there, they pull up into you. That's,

678
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,730
that's, that's where that term freezing
your balls off, you know, came,

679
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,890
you know, if you stomp somebody long
enough, like they will shit themselves,

680
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,150
which is the, the genesis of
a, I beat the shit out of him.

681
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,520
Beat the piss out of him. You know,
that's the thing about getting, you know,

682
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,160
if you got the shit beat out of you,

683
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,700
you already got the Piss beat
out of you because the, the, the,

684
00:43:03,701 --> 00:43:08,360
the piss gets beaten out of you before
this shit gets beat out of you unless

685
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:11,090
you're dehydrated. All
right, those, those are the,

686
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,440
those are the different levels
of, of an ass kicking. So anyways,

687
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:17,090
we go over to this, this, um,

688
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,240
this place to go to go horseback riding
and we go over there and there's these

689
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,980
horses and the, the, you know,
if you don't ride horses,

690
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,560
the first thing whenever you see him
aside from the fact that they're beautiful

691
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:33,561
you like that is a big fucking animal
and that thing is a 100% muscle.

692
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,960
And if that thing kicks me in my temple,

693
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:41,370
I am going to be drooling until
the fucking till Jesus comes,

694
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,320
I'm going to be done. And uh, so
anyway, so we're feeding these things,

695
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,140
you know, with their English man teeth,
you know, really straight and yellow,

696
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,641
you know,

697
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:56,640
home you hand out like it's a plate in
the sitting there with the soft little

698
00:43:56,641 --> 00:44:00,270
muzzle eating a carrot and uh,

699
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,310
that was all the good types. And
then, then we go to, uh, you know,

700
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:06,720
there's all these good looking horses now.

701
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:11,370
Then we go to like go to the horses that
were going to ride and they're all back

702
00:44:11,371 --> 00:44:14,700
in this pen and is like
fucking 12 of them.

703
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,780
They all have saddles on them and
they just got this look on their face.

704
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,393
You know what I mean?

705
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,080
Like you remember in platoon when fucking
Charlie Sheen's character just fucking

706
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:29,580
lands in the nom, remember
that? And it's, he's walking in,

707
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:33,420
he's seen all those fucking troops home
and he just sees that fucking look and

708
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,840
if that's what those horses look like.
And I felt like Charlie Sheen,

709
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,330
I was waiting for one of the horses out.
We got ourselves a crusade to here.

710
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,093
MMM,

711
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,660
I did. I felt like the uh, you know,

712
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,000
the little bitchy guy going into prison,
I felt all these things is,

713
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:56,940
I looked at those fucking,
they just had this one

714
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,700
vibe and uh,

715
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,500
so they pulled two horses out,
one bigger than the other.

716
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,140
And the bitch in me is like,
I want the smaller horse

717
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,250
cause I'm telling you the
second you get on a horse,

718
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:14,120
all you think is Christopher Reeve
fucking lawn dart right in the ground.

719
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:18,110
And then I wheeled myself out at some
fucking benefit and act like I'm still

720
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:20,660
enjoying life. Fuck that. Right.

721
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:25,640
I drive myself right off the end of
the stage, I'd go right along with it.

722
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,160
Get myself a Tuxedo. Oh
yeah. Everything's all good.

723
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:32,240
Just fucking Florida with my tongue.
And I zoomed myself right off.

724
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:36,210
Hopefully hitting a TV executive,
taking them out with me. Um,

725
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,720
that's how I would handle that
challenge in life because I'm a coward.

726
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,733
So anyways,

727
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:41,883
I fucking,

728
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,270
you know, then I'm like, come on man,

729
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,640
you gotta let your girl
had the smaller horse.

730
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:49,100
So now they go drag the bigger horse
out and this thing is just fucking like,

731
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,490
it's not rearing back,
but it's making it really difficult.

732
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:55,070
The thing is clearly communicating.
I don't want to go

733
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,630
and uh,

734
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,470
so I get on this fucking thing.

735
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,240
Okay.

736
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,860
And the guy, hey, you
know, you could go right,

737
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,620
your pull right to go left you
Paul left and now you want to stop.

738
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:08,450
You just pull it back.
All right?

739
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:10,700
So we start riding these
things and they know the trail.

740
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,940
They're just completely ignoring
me. And Nia, you want to go left?

741
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,940
They fucking Yank they head back. Like,
go fuck yourself. We're going this way.

742
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,320
I know,
I know the trail.

743
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,870
Okay.

744
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,540
All right. There. Fucking a, what's a,

745
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:24,220
what's a word they use
for some novice cowboy.

746
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:25,620
Okay.

747
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,060
Ah, what does that word all right there.
Huckleberry. Some of those western words.

748
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:30,721
Hey,

749
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:35,610
what is worst hair metal or some of that
fucking patriotic country music post

750
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:39,930
nine 11. What is worse to you?
What is more cringe worthy?

751
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,660
You know,
um,

752
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,730
shout at the devil or that,
that Toby Keith,

753
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:50,910
Uncle Sam's going to pull
the boot in your ass.

754
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,330
Ugh. Um, oh my God.

755
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,790
Every dime that guy made in that song
should've been thrown in his face and then

756
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:05,050
give it to the troops or something else
or just, and then the, and then the,

757
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,310
then a partial of it would be to
incinerate any record that, that,

758
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,060
that track was ever recorded.
The most pandering horse shit

759
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,190
you could ever come out with.
A horrific, sorry, sorry.

760
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,890
Plowing ahead here. So anyways, like

761
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,860
the horses were just in bad moods.

762
00:47:24,861 --> 00:47:26,870
They'll bite and in each
other and they just like,

763
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,860
at one point I tried to make the thing
go left and went back and I tried to bite

764
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:34,360
my foot and I said the knee, I go,
Jesus, I go, this fucking thing hates me.

765
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,960
And then I just thought, I was like,
you know what? I'd hate me. Okay.

766
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:42,580
If I climbed on my back and I had a walk
me up this Goddamn Hill, I'd hate me.

767
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,240
There's somebody said that, you know,
they don't even feed a well over there.

768
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:48,660
I shouldn't say that shit cause
I named the place, I don't know,

769
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,010
tried to claim it.
They're over there.

770
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:53,080
They feed them like fucking shredded
wheat instead of the real stuff.

771
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,490
I have no idea.
But um,

772
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,110
okay.

773
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,200
It started off as this really
peaceful thing to be riding the horse,

774
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,140
which was awesome.
And then immediately I just was just like,

775
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,000
I couldn't get back soon enough
because I wanted to get off.

776
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:08,030
This thing's fucking back because I
knew that that's what the horse wanted.

777
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,780
You know, it's awful.
Just fucking, it just,

778
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:20,140
I think if I ever, if I have a fucking
had a ton of money, I've said this before,

779
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:21,310
I've ever got a horse I would get,

780
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,510
I would buy a horse just so I would never
ride it. So going to have, you know,

781
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,760
maybe once a week just to show him who's
boss, right? You plant those carrots,

782
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:33,280
they're fucking Seabiscuit.

783
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,181
Anyways,

784
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:38,370
I thought that was gonna be a funny
story and I've just been a sad story.

785
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,350
Kind of like the Boston Celtics losing
games seven. Oh, that's, that kills me.

786
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,800
That kills me that those guys, they're
going to break up that team, man.

787
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,420
I got to tell you, I've been, you know,

788
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:54,330
I wa I was lucky Celtic fan when I grew
up, I started watching and you know,

789
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:59,870
in sixth grade when a Larry Bird
came through and all that Shit,

790
00:49:01,891 --> 00:49:06,891
the battles with the 70 sixers the fuck
in a Lakers and all that type of stuff.

791
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,840
And um,
I gotta tell you,

792
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:14,841
I am hard pressed to think of another
Celtic team that had more heart than the

793
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:20,190
Celtics. This, this version of the
Celtics, you know, they just never quit,

794
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,360
never say die.
It was brutal.

795
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:25,260
I'm watching doc rivers getting
all emotional when he hugged Kevin,

796
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:27,660
Garnett was uh,

797
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,040
it was fucking fucking brutal.
Brutal.

798
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:36,810
But you know by him, he, he did that
thing and you, I, I'm loving that Lebron,

799
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,970
you know, Lebron's one of those
guys that like, uh, I was like yeah,

800
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:45,360
what a Douche bag when he said I'm going
to bring my talents to south beach and

801
00:49:45,361 --> 00:49:45,691
all that.

802
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:50,070
But I got over it after a while and then
just people just kept hating the guy

803
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,130
and it's to the point now I
almost want to see him win.

804
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:57,510
If I didn't like George didn't so much
like either way I'm going to be really

805
00:49:57,511 --> 00:50:02,190
happy. Um, because uh,

806
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,170
I would love to see Lebron get one just
to make all everybody who hates him,

807
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,470
unless you're from Cleveland, if you
still hate Lebron, you're a Douche bag.

808
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,070
You know, you really just hate some aspect
of your life. But people in Cleveland,

809
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:18,600
they should hate that guy
and New York and Chicago,

810
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,950
they should be annoyed with that guy.
Cause he got you.

811
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:24,450
You guys get you all
excited. Like, you know,

812
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,760
Chicago six fucking rings.
They have the greatest player of all time.

813
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,710
Michael Jordan.
Okay.

814
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:34,340
They roll out the red carpet for you
and all you can come up with was, yeah,

815
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:38,690
I found their, their offer
intriguing, intriguing,

816
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:42,980
like he was rubbing his little,
uh, you know, I read books, beard,

817
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,870
that he's grown,
you know,

818
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:54,790
I'm into alternative medicine.
Uh, half a goatee. You know,

819
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,040
if you grow a fucking
beard like Brian has,

820
00:50:57,041 --> 00:51:00,520
you better be like inventing
shit somewhere, wearing
some sort of a lab coat.

821
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:00,941
All right.

822
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:05,260
And stop putting on your fake black
rimmed glasses with the clear windshield.

823
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,710
Um,
you gotta hand it to black people.

824
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:12,640
They are the only ones who could make
somebody within a fucking erector set look

825
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:17,320
cool. They can somehow make
that look appealing, I guess.

826
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,220
But I got to tell you that NBA montage
where they showed like 12 of them in a

827
00:51:21,221 --> 00:51:24,970
row all wearing those glasses was
fucking ridiculous. But anyways,

828
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:30,030
Chris Bosch killed us and
all that type of shit. Uh,

829
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:35,090
so I don't know. I have
no idea. But, um, I dunno,

830
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,610
I thought that they hate fucking aren't
it? They came out in the second half.

831
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:38,444
They fucking,

832
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,880
and they just never let up and we
couldn't get back in it. And uh,

833
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,780
I dunno. I don't know why the fuck we
were trying to guard Lebron that far out.

834
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,170
I mean, even van Gundy,
the whole game was like,

835
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,010
just make the guy take a jump shot.
You fucking press up on the guy.

836
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,510
He's too quick.
He's gonna run by you.

837
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,650
Once he gets to fucking a step and
a half that freight trains common,

838
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,370
you know, did, first of all,

839
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:08,450
there's no way to get in front of
them quick enough to get a charge.

840
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:10,370
You're going to get hurt.

841
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,460
All he could do is just try to hack at
the guy and he's going to get fouled and

842
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:18,080
it's either going to be two shots
or an an one. So why not hang back?

843
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,830
I don't know. Look at me watching
fucking the NBA for a couple of weeks.

844
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:25,550
All of a sudden I think I can
coach better than doc rivers. Um,

845
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:26,960
but anyways,

846
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,920
I'm going to game six tomorrow night
because the fucking kings have lost two in

847
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:34,660
a row. Flows. You don't watch
hockey man. They were a four game,

848
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:38,410
three games to none. Going to close
out the fourth game. I went downtown,

849
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:40,360
got absolutely fucking hammered.

850
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,043
MMM.

851
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,430
I planned on getting drunk.
I did take this subway

852
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,050
and uh,

853
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,290
what I also planned on eating something
went down there on an empty stomach and

854
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:54,950
we found this fucking bar that no one
was at that had this giant screen.

855
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,270
And we was sitting there laughing
lives two minutes before the game,

856
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:02,720
there was nobody in there felt
like we were on MTV cribs.

857
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:05,870
We didn't have to pay for the house.
And I don't know, we had two drinks.

858
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:10,040
We turned around and the place was jam
packed and then I went to order food and

859
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:10,461
the guy's like,

860
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:15,461
I'm sorry I'm not serving food now because
the stupid manager didn't take into

861
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:20,670
account that the kings could have won
their first Stanley Cup ever and that this

862
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:23,750
sports bar was going to be packed.
So he just had one guy working in the bar.

863
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:28,110
So while he was doing was making a
make drinks and uh, you know, me,

864
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:30,660
I'm trying to watch my girlish
figure here. So I fucking,

865
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,760
after a couple beers I
switched over to crowns at, uh,

866
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,440
I don't know what happened.

867
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:42,150
I vaguely remember at the end of the game
going out and getting a cheeseburger.

868
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:48,350
And uh, the dude behind
the counter, you know,

869
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,300
was a standup fan.

870
00:53:50,301 --> 00:53:54,290
So he knew me and my buddy and he gave
us a drink and then he actually brought

871
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:57,440
over some sort of like, and I never
drink shit like this. He goes,

872
00:53:57,441 --> 00:54:00,800
you should try these out. They're really
good. And it tasted like a milkshake,

873
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:03,650
but it had, it was like a shot
of it, but it had booze in it.

874
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:06,560
I just don't do well with that Shit,
you know,

875
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,680
I don't like that cross pollinating,
you know,

876
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:13,700
a let's have a dessert and get fucking
hammered. I don't do that. You know,

877
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,620
let's go to a titty bar and
get a cheeseburger. I don't
do that either. You know,

878
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:19,590
all the strip clubs that
serve fucking food, you know,

879
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:22,940
it's like do one or the other get,
get one of these things to focus,

880
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,700
need to be streamlined.
All right.

881
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,180
Okay.

882
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,830
So I'm trying to be the best
buy a titties. Right. Um,

883
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,070
just got absolutely fucking a knee.

884
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:37,940
Variated went down on the
subway and the subway,

885
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:41,760
it's almost like the red line in Boston.
Well one goes out to Braintree,

886
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,010
the other one goes to Matt a pan.

887
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,670
I was trying to go to Braintree and I
got on the mat of Pan one by accident.

888
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:50,330
I was like fuck.
So I had to get off hammered,

889
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,690
took it back the other way and I
go, yeah, I want the brain tree one.

890
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,710
Oh go downstairs.

891
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:57,680
So I go downstairs and they still
have two trains running on that track.

892
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,930
So I fucking got on the
mat of pan one again.

893
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:04,700
It was actually the Wilshire one and uh,
Oh God,

894
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,310
I was fucking livid when I
realized they made a mistake,

895
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,280
looked over at other passengers.
I was like,

896
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,320
it's just fucking thing
going down Wilshire.

897
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,140
And somebody looked at his buddy's like,
is he with you?

898
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:16,510
And everyone laughed at me. I
was like, Oh God, I'm that guy.

899
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,690
Then I got off the platform on the
platform and just had Tourette's fucking

900
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:27,000
Goddamn fucking stupid ass fucking city.

901
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:32,010
No fucking subway in the whole fucking
countries are just absolute f bomb.

902
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,570
And then some really nice girl

903
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,960
actually talk to me like ignored my
cursing and my angry anger and spitting on

904
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,510
the tracks. Just like, oh,

905
00:55:42,511 --> 00:55:46,190
did you get on the wrong way to like,
yeah,

906
00:55:46,191 --> 00:55:49,470
it's fucking fucking fucking fucking.
And then she's just like, yeah,

907
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,860
it is kinda confused. She didn't,
she didn't give it to him.

908
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,660
She was a saint. Everybody, that's
what I'm trying to say. All right,

909
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:01,560

Cleo,
we just stop licking your privates.

928
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,453
Hey,

929
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,750
we just go off in the corner.

930
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:09,360
Okay?

931
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,193
What are you doing?

932
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,733
Okay,

933
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,350
fucking weird.

934
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,530
You do it like every fucking 20 minutes.

935
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:19,900
Yeah.

936
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,600
Do you know?
Do you need to go to the doctor?

937
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,180
You if you could see the way
this dog is just staring at me,

938
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:30,620
like she actually understands what I'm
saying. What's up buddy? You know what?

939
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:33,590
You know what's a great place to
scratch your dog is underneath the call.

940
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,960
Every once in a while they
wear the collar forever.

941
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,710
I take my dog's collar off
like every night, you know,

942
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:41,030
not because I'm a good dog owner.

943
00:57:41,031 --> 00:57:45,680
It's because she wakes up before I do
and she shakes like a madman like this,

944
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,300
like that. And it's basically
my alarm clock in the morning.

945
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:54,890
So I take this fucking thing off and then
I give her a nice scratch on the back

946
00:57:54,891 --> 00:57:56,490
of the neck and she gets,
you know that look,

947
00:57:56,491 --> 00:57:59,090
dogs get on their face
where they kind of like,

948
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,390
it's this weird thing where they
don't move their body forward.

949
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:07,010
They just move their face forward. Like,
Ah God, that's what it's doing right now.

950
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,040
And you liked it, don't ya? Huh?
That's what you can't get to.

951
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,640
Alright,
next scratch.

952
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,340
That's it right there. That's what
she does with her fucking years.

953
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:22,800
And I know it did sound that loud, but
at fucking six in the morning. I'm sorry,

954
00:58:22,801 --> 00:58:25,320
seven o'clock in the morning.
It's real loud. All Right, Bill,

955
00:58:25,321 --> 00:58:27,600
we've had enough of your personal life.
Hey Bill,

956
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:30,900
is there any way you could bring the post
office into my apartment? Absolutely.

walking around eating a bowl of fruit

one hand and type on a keyboard,

991
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:35,903

week's that epic story, uh,

998
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:05,290
a gay dude story you told in your podcast
most recently about the guy who moved

999
01:01:05,301 --> 01:01:10,010
from the Carolinas to Arizona for college
and it got caught doing the deed by

1000
01:01:10,011 --> 01:01:14,570
his mom. I am not gay. I do not have any
gay tendencies or anything like that,

1001
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,990
but I've seen a similar circumstance
happen with a close friend.

1002
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,800
I know that the dude's mom and the whole
family feels awkward about him being

1003
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:24,200
gay,
but the more indifferent they act,

1004
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,990
the more likely the 19
year old guy from Carolina,

1005
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:30,910
we'll end up doing something he will
probably regret. Absolutely. Anyway,

1006
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,120
my advice is this,

1007
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:36,710
show your mom the movie prayers for
Bobby and she will turn right around.

1008
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:40,640
I guarantee it. Hope things work out. All
right. I don't know what that movie is,

1009
01:01:40,641 --> 01:01:44,410
but if the person who wrote in last
week, uh, go ahead and read that,

1010
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:48,590
go watch that movie will show it to your
mom and hopefully she'll come around.

1011
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,410
Um, dilemma number one, Bill,

1012
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:56,411
would you rather have been born with this
sporting talent to be an NHL all star

1013
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:02,140
or the musical talent to drum
for ACDC after Phil Rudd?

1014
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:08,150
Ah, that's a good, that
is a fucking dilemma.

1015
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:11,720
MMM.

1016
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:19,270
God dammit. That's a coin flip
right there. All, all right,

1017
01:02:19,271 --> 01:02:21,190
well here's the deal.
If I could play in the NHL,

1018
01:02:21,191 --> 01:02:26,050
I play in the eighties despite the hair
metal music that would probably be being

1019
01:02:26,051 --> 01:02:28,930
played while I did the skate
around at the beginning.

1020
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,800
That's a shoot around whenever
the fuck you call it. Um,

1021
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,930
wait. Do I have my body? I
mean, I want to be a tough guy.

1022
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:44,120
If I'm going to play in the
NHL, I'm be, I have a a a eight.

1023
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,670
The very best a goal scorer,
his body.

1024
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,220
And even then I'm too small.

1025
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:54,930
I'm barely five foot 10 guys could
do that back then. Could I be,

1026
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,870
if I could be chippy every once
in a while, Nevin mark what style?

1027
01:02:59,871 --> 01:03:03,810
I don't know. Oh, the musical talent
to drum for ACDC after Phil Rudd Wolf.

1028
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,380
I drummed for ACDC after Phil Rudd,

1029
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:10,730
I'd be Simon Wright from 83 to 90.

1030
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:14,110
Then I would leave to Joan [inaudible]

1031
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,350
and have to play last in line.

1032
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,610
Okay.

1033
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:23,240
Or I could have been considering balding.
Maybe I'd be Chris Slade

1034
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,620
who drums from 90 to 96 and all of a
sudden gets kicked out just because they

1035
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:30,930
want to bring Phil Rudd back. I
don't like those endings. Those are,

1036
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,290
those are like running back careers
was a real short, I know what,

1037
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:36,030
I'll take the Nhl all star,

1038
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,250
a fucking all star and I get to worry
that that Campbell's or whales jersey. Oh,

1039
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:44,640
I take that have a fucking red mullet.

1040
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,090
I'm a Harris to gets
curly when it grows long.

1041
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:51,900
I'd looked like Bernie from run to 22
I take the NHL. That was a good one.

1042
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:55,050
That was the old coin flip.
All right, now, but to dilemma,

1043
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,660
imagine you're walking in a built up
area and come across a glittery box.

1044
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,400
What does a built up area,

1045
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,660
curiosity compels you to look
inside it and upon doing so,

1046
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,750
find it stacked full of child pornography,

1047
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,400
your prints and DNA or on the box.
She can't walk away from it.

1048
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:18,480
If you set it on fire,
what happens if the cops stop?

1049
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:23,720
If a cop stops you or a residence and
they notice a half charred picture of an

1050
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:27,270
eight year, ah, he's burning evidence.

1051
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:31,800
If you handed it into the complete the
police, you'd still be implicated. No,

1052
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:36,210
I wouldn't. If I find a fucking
dead body on the side of the road,

1053
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:40,290
I don't get charged with murder.
Quick light it on fire.

1054
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:42,660
Okay.

1055
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,770
This is hilarious. Anyway, let
me just keep reading this. Um,

1056
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,150
I'd be implicated as a suspect because
I found a tin of child pornography and I

1057
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:55,380
brought it in. They probably give me
shift for contaminating the evidence.

1058
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:59,940
That would look weird though if I walked
in. Hey, I found this on the side.

1059
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,690
I kind of see where you go with this.

1060
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:05,720
Yeah.

1061
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,710
Ah, you just would, uh, oh,
he's just saying no matter what,

1062
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:10,790
you just would get implicated.

1063
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:15,020
And I think you could do without
headlines like comedian hands,

1064
01:05:15,021 --> 01:05:19,990
child porn into police claims
found it and he's misunderstood.

1065
01:05:19,991 --> 01:05:23,110
Like Michael Jackson, if you decide
to take it home to destroy it.

1066
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:26,650
What if you stopped by a gang of use
on the way and it's knocked out of your

1067
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:30,820
hand and the entire Detroit depraved
mass spills across the floor.

1068
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,840
Uh, if you don't get at home and turn
it into a paper machete and the sink,

1069
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:38,703
what

1070
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:41,680
if you do get it home and it turns
into paper machine, the sink.

1071
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:45,460
What if it blocks it? Or Nia
asks what? You're up to. Nothing.

1072
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:48,070
They are just destroying images of naked.
Preteens.

1073
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:52,750
So how would you deal with this
terrible situation? A simple,

1074
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:54,740
yeah.

1075
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:57,050
Curiosity compels me to
look at the glittery box.

1076
01:05:57,051 --> 01:06:01,490
I would open it and upon
seeing the content within,

1077
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,880
I would jump back like Morgan Freeman's
character in [inaudible] seven,

1078
01:06:04,881 --> 01:06:07,520
when he sees Gwyneth Paltrow's
severed head in the box.

1079
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,233
All right.

1080
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,460
Then I would just start
running in circles yelling.

1081
01:06:13,461 --> 01:06:17,430
He has the upper hand until I'm
arrested and put in an insane asylum.

1082
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,250
I just, if I've found, I would
just, I would report it immediately.

1083
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,440
I would report it immediately,

1084
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,020
you know,
that's it.

1085
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:38,130
I saw it, I opened it, it was in
there and that's it. Go ahead.

1086
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:42,900
Parade a bunch of half naked kids in
front of me and watch me not get aroused.

1087
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,510
There you go. There's my fucking
defense. Go Fuck Yourself.

1088
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,860
I'm trying to help you guys out.

1089
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,800
Why don't you dust it and find the other
set of friends and go start with that

1090
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:53,520
Douche. All right, now me and my pussy
looking dog or getting Outta here.

1091
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:57,600
Go Fuck Yourself. Hi,
I'm all right. Lights,

1092
01:06:57,601 --> 01:06:59,850
camera dumped bill.

1093
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,200
I'm a 29 year old guy in recently broke
up with a funny attractive and all

1094
01:07:04,201 --> 01:07:08,670
around Greg girl. Oh Gee.
Why Sir would you do that?

1095
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,570
You ask.
All right.

1096
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,870
MMM.

1097
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:12,321
Two things.

1098
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:17,321
Her Dad was born without teeth and you're
worried your baby will if you braid

1099
01:07:17,931 --> 01:07:19,010
with her or

1100
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:24,820
is she has got something
going on in the vaginal area,

1101
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,560
some sort of odor, stinky pussy. I
don't know. Well, here we go. Well,

1102
01:07:29,561 --> 01:07:30,394
let me tell you,

1103
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:33,580
this girl and I had been dating for about
three months and we had a great thing

1104
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:37,720
going. She's half Afro Cuban,
half Puerto Rican and really sexy.

1105
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:42,040
She had a rough upbringing,
but I didn't care because she's honest,

1106
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:46,030
easy going and not bitchy. Like so many
girls I've dated. She was a bit needy,

1107
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:48,880
but I didn't mind.
Um,

1108
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:52,390
we were out at a bar one night having a
few drinks and I was feeling pretty good.

1109
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:55,810
I was looking at a couple of floozies
at the end of the bar and asked her if

1110
01:07:55,811 --> 01:08:00,340
she's ever been with another woman.
She coyly looked at me and said, yes,

1111
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,340
good stuff. I thought, yeah, dude,
this is a fucking fantasy right here.

1112
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:10,170
If I get a red shoe diaries.
Um, then I proceeded with,

1113
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:13,800
have you ever been in a threesome
with two girls and a guy again?

1114
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:14,910
She answered yes.

1115
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,390
Okay.

1116
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:20,560
Okay. Kind of slutty, but I'm no
saint. While he couldn't stop,

1117
01:08:20,561 --> 01:08:23,410
they are God, you're going to
go for the rotisserie question.

1118
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:28,600
What's in the box? Ah, here we go.

1119
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:32,290
Here we go. Strap yourselves in for
this one. Well, I couldn't stop there.

1120
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:35,590
So I asked, have you ever had
a threesome with two guys?

1121
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:42,460
She looked down at the ground
and she looked up a bit ashamed,

1122
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,750
Lee and said yes. Wow. Skank alert.

1123
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:49,810
I thought I then asked
her one more question.

1124
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,600
I knew this one could back for
where the fuck do you go from here?

1125
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:58,750
Like throwing the high heat to Albert
Albert pool hosts. I finally asked,

1126
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:02,350
wait,
have you ever been in a porn?

1127
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:06,910
She then blushed and look me
in the eye and said, yeah.

1128
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:13,160
I looked at her calmly and was
like, oh, but inside I was like,

1129
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:16,100
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yes. Well, you should,

1130
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,280
you know those first couple.
I mean,

1131
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,750
you can look at let, let's,
let's break this down here.
All right. She's been with,

1132
01:09:25,751 --> 01:09:26,584
uh,

1133
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:31,270
she's had a threesome with another
girl and a guy who get that.

1134
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:33,730
That's who gives a fuck right there.
All right.

1135
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:37,630
You're already knew she banged
another guy. All right. But, uh,

1136
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:41,330
the fact that she also did it with another
girl, that takes a little fucking, uh,

1137
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:45,100
that tones down his dick in her pussy.
Right? This is how guys think. Women,

1138
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:50,080
I'm sorry. All right. That's something
that, that's something in the, uh,

1139
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:54,740
the credits that the
credit a bit. Why, why,

1140
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:57,270
why do you try to talk with counting
shit yet to dump. All right,

1141
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,690
that one's all right.
The two guys thing.

1142
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:07,410
Now you can look the other way on that.
Maybe if it, if it was in another state,

1143
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:12,300
but it can't be in the same state because
if you run into one of the two guys

1144
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:16,610
that fucking, you know, we're high fiving
as they fucking banged her that, I mean,

1145
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:21,720
I dunno about that one. But then the third
one she did a porno. I mean, yeah, no,

1146
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:22,710
that's a,

1147
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:24,150
yeah.

1148
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:27,880
You got to walk away from that
or,

1149
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:32,090
or you have to go to NASA to get
tested for the latest fucking STDs,

1150
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:36,200
I would think. And then also
God knows what's going on, uh,

1151
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,690
mentally that you would do that.
What I just liked sex,

1152
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:46,310
not on health is some going on. Who
doesn't like sex? I Dunno. Anyways,

1153
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,620
plowing ahead. See, she's so, she egos.

1154
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:52,220
So basically she had moved down
to Los Angeles when she was 20.

1155
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:55,700
She's now 25 and after a
short stint in the military,

1156
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,320
somehow she got into the porn industry
for eight months. She did everything.

1157
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,740
Ooh.
Fox sucked the whole Shebang.

1158
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:08,420
I asked her if I could see her video but
she wouldn't tell me her performer name

1159
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,010
and said Vietnam, the that it would be
impossible to find her body of work.

1160
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:17,130
I asked her why she got
into porn and she replies,

1161
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:18,980
yeah

1162
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,680
cause I wanted some feeling in my life.

1163
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:27,140
And then he writes Dao Ji Ji is,
yeah dude. Oh this poor girl.

1164
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,530
Something happened to her.
The thing was she was clean,

1165
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:35,390
had a good job and I really liked her
and the sex was great. Yeah. Obviously,

1166
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:35,901
you know it's funny,

1167
01:11:35,901 --> 01:11:37,970
there was something you wrote in the
beginning where I just thought she was

1168
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:42,530
going to be good. 29 year old guy.
Attractive all around. Great girl.

1169
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:49,500
Oh, the fact that you said she had a rough
upbringing but she was easy going and

1170
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:52,680
honest and not bitchy right there.
I was like, that girl's good in bed.

1171
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:53,810
Okay.

1172
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:57,010
That just seemed like a kind
of free open person. I Dunno.

1173
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,240
Okay.

1174
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,000
I didn't know she was going to be
that open. Oh Geez. Um, anyways,

1175
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,200
okay.

1176
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,990
The thing was she was clean and
I have a blah. The sex is great,

1177
01:12:05,991 --> 01:12:10,991
but I couldn't stop picturing her in some
sleazy porno that was probably filmed

1178
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:12,980
in some junk yard on labrea.

1179
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:16,730
So I went to ask for a friend's advice.

1180
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:21,820
Most of my guys were telling me to dumper
my gay friends told me it was fabulous

1181
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:24,470
and that I should overlook it.

1182
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:28,610
I didn't even bother asking my girlfriends
because they would automatically

1183
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:32,390
reject her and assume I had aids.
There you go. Keep your options open.

1184
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,850
So regretfully I dumped her.

1185
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,520
Okay.

1186
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:41,520
I felt terrible and obviously didn't tell
her it was because she was a porn star

1187
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,350
because she would have been
ashamed for the rest of her life.

1188
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:49,000
And I was happy that she was honest with
me. I've done my fair share of sleeves,

1189
01:12:49,001 --> 01:12:53,290
but this was too much. My question
bill was, Bill, my question bill,

1190
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,770
was it wrong for me to dump him for
some decisions she made years ago?

1191
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:01,660
Should I have stayed with her?
What would have you done? Um,

1192
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,250
well, you don't want to know what I
would've done. I'm a fucking degenerate.

1193
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,570
So lets you, you seem
like a good person. Um,

1194
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:11,990
okay,

1195
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,823
dude.

1196
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,830
When you're trying to find the person
you're going to spend the rest of your

1197
01:13:15,831 --> 01:13:19,340
life with you, you have to have
a list of criteria. All right?

1198
01:13:19,341 --> 01:13:23,420
You sound like you still young, so there's
no reason to compromise. All right?

1199
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,130
I mean,

1200
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,100
when you get with somebody like that and
you're going to live with them and you

1201
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:31,520
would, you get with anybody, you're
taking on all of their fucking baggage.

1202
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,220
All right?
You're only three months in.

1203
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:36,650
Okay.

1204
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:40,660
And you know, people who go into
the porn industry that, you know,

1205
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:46,310
it's like people will come. Comedians
were not healthy individuals. Okay.

1206
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:50,220
And that is like a
specific area that I just,

1207
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,900
this is just my own personal nonmedical
feeling that you're just not a healthy

1208
01:13:53,901 --> 01:13:58,880
person. Something awful happen. And that
line, I just wanted to feel something.

1209
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:03,320
I mean, something bad happened to
her, caused her to a wall or self off.

1210
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,980
I don't even want to try to guess what,
but you know,

1211
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:13,600
there's nothing wrong with that. She
did purse, you know, technically,

1212
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,280
and she was honest with it.

1213
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:19,480
It all comes down to whether or not
you want to deal with it. All right?

1214
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:20,950
And if you feel that you know,

1215
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:24,280
you want to deal with it and that there
was this sort of connection that you

1216
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:26,440
just had,
this girl had to be in your life,

1217
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,400
then you're going to have to learn
to live with it and get past it.

1218
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,380
Okay.

1219
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,430
MMM.

1220
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:36,443
Okay.

1221
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:39,440
But I would be definitely,

1222
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:44,441
I would definitely be concerned
with a certain mental issues,

1223
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,090
um,
now like she's insane.

1224
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:54,680
And then I would also be concerned with,
uh,

1225
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:56,960
sexual boundaries,

1226
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,283
you know,

1227
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,020
like,
would she have any,

1228
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:07,270
and could she remain faithful after a
while and when you settle into the seven

1229
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:08,530
year itch or whatever,

1230
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:14,230
and you really start needing to work at
the relationship and it's feeling boring

1231
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,770
and she needs to feel something again,
is she going to go back to that

1232
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:23,570
leather couch from that show,
Martin? My end, you know,

1233
01:15:23,571 --> 01:15:26,750
down on fog in the valley and get
bagged again. I mean, I don't know.

1234
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:33,570
I Dunno. That is a, uh,
that is, you know what,

1235
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:36,120
that is beyond my skills.
I don't know how to tame that horse.

1236
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:41,130
I can tell you that right fucking now.
I have no fucking clue. That's a a,

1237
01:15:41,131 --> 01:15:43,140
you know what?
That's a doctor drew question.

1238
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,800
That is a classic doctor drew question.

1239
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:49,860
And that guy within two seconds
we'll get right to the core of it.

1240
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:54,960
I would call out, call in love line
man, if you're out here, call him up.

1241
01:15:54,961 --> 01:15:57,530
Cause that's a, that's a great one. Um,

1242
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,910
yeah,
I guess you'd have to figure out is,

1243
01:16:02,911 --> 01:16:06,000
is has she worked through whatever the
fuck she was working through and now

1244
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:06,870
she's ready to.

1245
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:09,663
Okay.

1246
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,600
I mean, I dunno. Hey those are some good
looking girls down there and she's like,

1247
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:16,380
yeah they are or whatever. Like, I mean
if you kept steering it in that direction,

1248
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:20,520
you'd probably get you fucking
threesome right there. Um,

1249
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,140
okay.

1250
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,760
So there's that,
there's that option.

1251
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,830
The option that you have is if
you're with her, like I think that's,

1252
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,770
that's a selfish fucking and I,

1253
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:32,430
and a shallow reason to stay
with somebody long term,

1254
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:34,563
uh,

1255
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:40,140
that Jesus, I don't know.
Great fucking emails by the
way. Everybody open and Piss.

1256
01:16:40,141 --> 01:16:44,160
You guys off too much by fucking trash
and all that metal shit. You know,

1257
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:46,500
I have half those t shirts
and I went to go see that.

1258
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:50,550
I was just embarrassed by some of that
shit that I used to listen to. Um,

1259
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,280
okay.

1260
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:56,710
Oh Jesus. Right up until I was like
2021 fucking brutal. What, what, what,

1261
01:16:56,730 --> 01:17:01,140
what redeemable thing that I have.
I did listen to the Beatles,

1262
01:17:01,141 --> 01:17:04,710
the doors to stones, all that
white boy shit. Stevie Ray Vaughan.

1263
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:08,990
I did listen to Hendrix.
I listened to all the big band swing.

1264
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:13,200
My Dad shift from the fifties.
Uh,

1265
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:15,290
I had such a weird musical
upbringing anyways,

1266
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,630
which was actually good because
it was kind of all over the map.

1267
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:19,700
MMM.

1268
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,010
I started hanging out with
Patrice back in the day.

1269
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:25,670
Patrice was the one rest
his soul got me the, uh,

1270
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,820
I still remember when he got in that same
piece of shit truck that I went to the

1271
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:35,530
ACDC concert and seven fucking years
later, I'm still driving it. Right.

1272
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,010
Making the sacrifices.
Remember that I told you,

1273
01:17:39,011 --> 01:17:42,370
you don't get some fucking job and
go out and buy a fucking new car.

1274
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:44,860
You just change yourself to your cubicle.
I was kept Mike,

1275
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,750
I put a new engine in the fucking truck,

1276
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:49,750
had somebody slap that
in there for 1200 bucks,

1277
01:17:49,751 --> 01:17:54,100
pay that down rather than 12 grand for
a new car like it was back then. Um,

1278
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:55,450
so when he was,
I still remember

1279
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:57,623
mmm.

1280
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:03,150
Swinging by picking Patrice up and going
into next and he had the cassette tape

1281
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:07,760
of re, uh, ready to die.
And him putting that in.

1282
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:09,720
MMM.

1283
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,150
Telling me that this guy was
going to be the next guy.

1284
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:14,640
And then through all of that,

1285
01:18:14,641 --> 01:18:19,641
like he cured me of all the rap that a
white kid liked who lived in a cul de

1286
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:21,354
sac.

1287
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:23,283
MMM.

1288
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,030
And he showed me all the, all of that
shit. So I had that whole background,

1289
01:18:28,031 --> 01:18:32,440
all that stuff fucking held up.
But the fucking metals that I listened to,

1290
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,350
I even watched like Lawrence
Welk when I was a kid,

1291
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,330
when the creepiest shows ever even
that was fucking thrown in there.

1292
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:41,740
Okay.

1293
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:42,251
It's funny,

1294
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:45,610
like fucking almost 40 years later I'll
be walking down the street and all of a

1295
01:18:45,611 --> 01:18:47,230

1296
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:52,650

Chester could thedro Bozzuto de to yell

1297
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:56,020
Brang and made down.
Am I really gonna sing this?

1298
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,390
You could have done something.

Thank you for listening. Um,

1323
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:45,630
God dammit. I'm going to miss him.
Hell of a run. And it still kills me.

1324
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:49,140
That fourth quarter of the 2009 finals,

1325
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:52,550
I really wished the refs had gotten out
of the way and if the Celtics were going

1326
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:57,270
to lose, I could have watched the
Lakers. You know when that, you know,

1327
01:20:57,271 --> 01:21:00,240
not taking 24 unguarded
shots that just fucking kid.

1328
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:04,260
And it's not the Lakers fault. I
just, the fucking reps, they just,

1329
01:21:04,261 --> 01:21:06,000
they have too much goddamn power.

1330
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,780
Too much fucking power, man.
Puts you a fucking whistle
away. All right. That's it.

1331
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:14,370
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
