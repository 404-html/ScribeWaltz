1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,760
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,500
June 2nd,
2014 oh my God.

3
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:14,920
Is it really Jill? Yes. Yes. Uh,

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,950
Tricia fucking June comes after me
every goddamn year. That's right.

5
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:24,720
The summertime is coming. You know,
you, you, you just showed us started.

6
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,040
You're going on your fucking bikini
diet back in February, but you didn't,

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,390
you got all wrapped up in
your life. Didn't yell well,
it's not your fault Tricia.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,490
What I pick Trish. I don't
know why. You know what?

9
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,890
Cause I'm sick of saying Karen and Cathy,

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,030
I've got to fucking make fun of some
other God damn names and I'll have the

11
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,430
audacity to do it.
Even with a name like bill,

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,830
a nice generic fucking name.
No imagination. You know,

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,150
actually I actually liked my name.
I don't know what happened.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,530
Somewhere along the lines about
in the 90s you know what I mean?

15
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:00,530
Everybody started to have all
these fucking, those names.

16
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:04,150
George Carlin made fun of,
right? George Callen, you know,

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,380
Dakota and all those things,

18
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:11,270
all those names that had to sound
like a fucking canyon right now.

19
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,240
All those people are coming of age
and all of a sudden I saw my first,

20
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:14,541
I don't know,

21
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:19,541
I was watching some sport and they
fucking over to a fucking Dakota assumpted

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,511
and I'm like,

23
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:23,870
am I that fucking old that somebody
named Dakota is old enough to play a

24
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:28,790
professional sport? I'm sorry.
Anyways, I'm in a weird mood today.

25
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,190
I uh,
this podcast is actually late this week.

26
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,990
I'll give you two cause it's
not even Monday morning.

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,310
You probably think of why bill, you're
a fucking comedian. You're a bum.

28
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,140
You don't even have a real job.

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,670
How come you can't get your ass out of
bed early enough to even record it on

30
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,710
your Monday morning?
Well, I'll tell you why.

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,090
Last night I uh,

32
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,920
took the lovely Nia out to the Hollywood
bowl and we saw Bruno fuck in March

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,490
with the,

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,930
for Ralph or feral and I have
fucking says they Farell,

35
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,940
the guy who walked by watching his set
evidently wrote 40% of all hits in the

36
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:09,660
last 15 years. I was just standing
there as he went in from song to song,

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,770
go like Jesus Christ, this guy,
Yo, he wrote this song too.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,760
It's just him. I thought that other guy
sang it and then my wife would be like,

39
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:21,510
no, he produced it for him
and it went all these grammys.

40
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,800
He's kind of awesome.

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,340
I know he kind of was, he was out there
with his big smokey, the bear hat.

42
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,900
This one was red. Probably a special one
because he's playing the Hollywood bowl.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,360
That was a great thing about the show
last night and you could tell that both

44
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:35,770
him and a Bruno Mars,

45
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:39,790
we're really excited to be playing the,
uh,

46
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:43,330
the Hollywood bowl was great. They were
just phenomenal fucking performers.

47
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,940
And uh,
you know,

48
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,580
the only thing the whole night I would
say was for rouse a backup dancers.

49
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,750
They would dress like they
was still at rehearsal.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,160
That's the only thing I didn't
like, you know, I'm sure I

51
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,960
obviously they did it on purpose,

52
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,100
but you ever watch one of
those movies like fame or,

53
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,580
uh, I dunno. Bill and Ted's big adventure.

54
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,390
One of those fucking movies from
back in the aids, the debt eighties.

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,290
The fuck did I say aids? the
80s, the age 80. He VH one.

56
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,580
Who got it? Who didn't? And who
is surprised about the results?

57
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,250
Um, the 80s. Um, what the fuck? You know,

58
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,740
there was a bunch of those,
those movies, Michael Douglas,

59
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,780
all of those movies when they
would be in rehearsal, right.

60
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,310
And there'd be all these fucking smoking
hot women dressed like they were going

61
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,970
to paint their bedroom. That's how, uh,

62
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,600
for Elza backup dancers were dressed
last night. And um, other than that,

63
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,440
I thought it was great.
He sang all these fucking songs.

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,420
I don't know. He sang that one with
the guys who dress up like the robots,

65
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,950
you know? Yeah. Well I'm
up all night to get lucky.

66
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:04,880
I'm up all night to get sub debt.
I'm up all night doing blow. Yeah,

67
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,110
he's about boop, boop, boop. All right.
And everybody's going nuts. And as a desk,

68
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:13,090
go ball was a great fucking time.
Great fucking time.

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,100
And I take through the
whole God damn concent.

70
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,170
So we're sitting there and
now I'm one of those people,

71
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,430
I never see a nightmare can spot
famous people all the fucking time.

72
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,950
I never do. So we're
sitting there, we got,

73
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,010
we got great seats and uh,

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,490
she hits me on the arm.
She goes, oh my God,

75
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:33,940
there's Henry Winkler and I look
over and there he is, the fonts.

76
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,870
Henry Winkler having a great time dance
into Farell and then in between the

77
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:45,010
break she fucking elbows me again is like,
oh there's Tom Hanks,

78
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,400
swear to God and there he
is standing in the aisles.

79
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,570
People are coming up to him and he's
grabbing their phones and doing a selfie

80
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,420
forum.
He looked like he was running for office.

81
00:04:55,421 --> 00:05:00,070
He stood there for like a half
a fucking hour. Like you know,

82
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,590
my wife was go look at that. He's
like the greatest. So he's looking,

83
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,570
he's the greatest guy ever.
It's like gag gift.

84
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,160
Guess that's how you
have a 30 year career.

85
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,150
You have a 30 year career by doing
exactly the opposite of what I do.

86
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,400
I can tell you this,

87
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:20,401
after watching that man stand there
for a half an hour as gracious is,

88
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,350
is you could possibly be with anyone
and everyone who walked up to him. Um,

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,360
I can honestly tell you without a doubt
that Tom Hanks does not have one drop of

90
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,460
cont in him.
He's just a fucking great guy.

91
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,390
I already liked him and then I watched
that and I'm like, Jesus Christ, you know,

92
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,400
I need to work on myself.
Guy.

93
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,420
He's putting on a goddamn good shit
clinic here at the Hollywood ball.

94
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,540
So, uh, so now I'm like, Jesus Christ,
these all these fucking people here.

95
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,330
Neal's like, oh, there's
Natalie call. There's this fog.

96
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:58,010
Can I Eddie Rabinowitz? I didn't even know
half the fucking, she's pointing out. So

97
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,220
I start looking around and I go,

98
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:01,550
I look at that guy over there
with the Jackson Brown hair cut.

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,760
He turned around with Jackson Brown.
He was not standing in the aisles.

100
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,830
But does that make them a bad person?

101
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,090
Maybe that's the Cantinas Tom Hanks
because he does that now you're expecting

102
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:19,180
every other famous person doing. Then
when they, when they don't do it,

103
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,130
okay.

104
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,280
I bet all those famous people are just
sitting there looking at Tom Hanks,

105
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:28,090
staring daggers at him. Like, why
won't he just sit the fuck down?

106
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,720
He doesn't like doing that
either. They're all fucking, um,

107
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,010
and he's been out there for a
half a fucking hour, you know,

108
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,750
and then all of a sudden
they all seem approachable.

109
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,220
Okay.

110
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,330
I liked the handlers.

111
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,540
There was a couple of handlers when
they were down there to basically be a

112
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,360
security person.
Eat.

113
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,730
What you have to do is you have to master
the hand an inch away from the small

114
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:55,710
of somebody back. You just sort
of leave it there. You know,

115
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,461
I don't know when,

116
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:59,820
if they got like a fucking inner ear
piece that dense says when they actually

117
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:04,620
make contact with the lower back of the
famous person to guide them through.

118
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,130
But the thing is,
is when you're,

119
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:10,770
you're in the ready position
as a security person,

120
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:14,580
you have your hand in the
small, like an inch away, right?

121
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:17,160
Like you're warming your
hand on a fucking fire,

122
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,800
except it's some famous
person's lower back.

123
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,430
This guy stood there the whole fucking
time and every once in a while he just

124
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,030
sort of shift the person.

125
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,550
Okay.

126
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,210
It's incredible. I Dunno how it
was fucking arm didn't get tired.

127
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,000
Just holding it like that. You don't have
it. He has to do stretches. So anyways,

128
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,870
so for outcomes out, it's like
broad daylight. He's got to perform.

129
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,920
Then I thought he did.
You know, I don't know,

130
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:43,020
just as a comedian performing outside in
broad day light, to me that just says,

131
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:47,470
oh my God, I'm going to bomb. And uh, um,

132
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,630
I better get the check before I go out
on stage. That's what I see. But he was,

133
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,470
he was phenomenal. Um, and then,

134
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,510
then Bruno Mars came out and it was a,

135
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,960
I don't know, dude, I called it, Nia
told me that she was like, you called it,

136
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,400
you saw this kid like whatever,
three,

137
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,630
four fucking years ago you saw him on
something and you will, I did. I was like,

138
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:13,380
this guy, he's old school. He's this song
and dance man here. This is throwback.

139
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:15,750
This dude can do anything.
He's going to have a long career.

140
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:20,040
The only thing stopping him is him. And
he didn't stop himself from there. He was,

141
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,340
and he put on a fucking unbelievable show.
His band was awesome.

142
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:27,660
His drummer was fucking sick.
He introduced him and his as his brother,

143
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,760
I dunno,
I dunno if he,

144
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:34,761
if he meant that in a cool way or we
literally came from the same parents.

145
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,230
I have no idea. Uh, but that
guy was killer and then his
band was fucking amazing.

146
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:43,410
And uh, what I liked about it was
that they were like, they were silly.

147
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,900
They were having a good time
and they were killing it.

148
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,560
And there was moments during the show
where they were fucking around trying to

149
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:53,520
make each other laugh and shit.
And, uh, I dunno man. It was just,

150
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:57,600
it was an amazing show.
And I also, you know,

151
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:01,350
with each concert am getting older and
older and I really should have, you know,

152
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:04,980
like when you see a, uh,
a performer on stage,

153
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,300
okay.

154
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,230
You know, and they just fucking old
now and everybody says like, Oh man,

155
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,680
he should just stop. She should
just quit, hang it up. You know,

156
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,650
put a couple of shirts on. If you're
going to go out there, Jesus Christ,

157
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:19,620
at least at a fucking treadmill
or whatever they say, you know,

158
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:23,610
we should just stop. You know? I think
that that goes with audience members too,

159
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,920
because I got to tell you last night,

160
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,670
I can't even tell you how many times I
had to sit down because just literally

161
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:33,030
standing up for too long,
my lower back starts killing me.

162
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,840
And I remember sitting down at one point
as Bruno Mars is on the stage and he's

163
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,500
fucking sitting there going,
ah,

164
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:41,960
yeah,

165
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,410
you know, hey, the fucking left side,
the right side now down the center.

166
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:47,720
And I'm just saying, if this
guy sees me sitting down, right,

167
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,740
okay.

168
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,573
You know,

169
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,840
I don't want somebody on stage see me
sitting down thinking I'm sitting down,

170
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,260
you know, because I'm not
appreciating what they're doing.

171
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,120
I almost wish I had like a neon sign
that said, it's not your fault. It's me.

172
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,620
I'm fucking old.

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,030
And I was literally sitting there
laughing as I'm drinking a water.

174
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,230
Okay.

175
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,350
You know,
like I,

176
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:14,570
I was actually exercising rather than
just trying to stand up for longer than 12

177
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:17,910
minutes that I sat down and I really
thought about it. I was like, is it,

178
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,380
am I too old to go to a concert?
I, I, I think I need to retire.

179
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Okay.

180
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,401
You know,

181
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:27,480
cause I'm getting to those scary years
when you're older and you go to a concert

182
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,270
and you just feel the need to put on a,

183
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm going to a rock show tee shirt.

184
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,460
You know what those older white guys do?

185
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,720
And they'll put on one of those fucking
Justin Timberlake hats and you're

186
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,550
wearing a tee shirt, which, you know,
unless you kept you self and shape,

187
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:46,150
we should never be out of the house
with a fucking tee shirt on, you know,

188
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,960
with your fucking man
boobs. You know, look,

189
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:52,640
I'm like be cups just sitting there and
then you have some sort of bedazzled

190
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,400
mint on your tee shirt to let people
know that you still can rock. You know,

191
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,990
you show up with those
fucking genes that just say,

192
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,550
I saw fucking Molly Hatchett
back in [inaudible] 82 or
whatever the fucking guys

193
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:14,240
name is, right. Don't want to be that guy.

194
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,740
And I'm, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I saw a lot of that last night,

195
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:20,540
which is just a testament
to both of those guys,

196
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:25,310
how talented they are because it really
was everything from little kids, um,

197
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,210
little kids to me and like 14,
15 all the way up to like,

198
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:32,930
I don't know how old is
Henry Winkler? Like 70. Um,

199
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,580
okay.

200
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,730
But anyways, and it was funny, it
was a guy sitting in front of us,

201
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,830
this old dude who was well
into his sixties, I think,

202
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,590
and he was part of that last
of that generation. You know,

203
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:50,120
those older guys from that generation
that just always walk around with that

204
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:52,970
navy captain's hat on.
You know,

205
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,990
some of them was because they were
in the navy. The rest of them,

206
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,960
I don't know why they wear it, but
they just, maybe they have a boat.

207
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,280
They just walk around with
that fucking navy hat on. Um,

208
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,620
he was of that age and what was
killing me is I'm sitting there going,

209
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:13,330
you know what? I'm closer in age to
the fucking navy hat guy. Then, uh,

210
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,710
you know, the fucking twentysomethings
here, whatever. Anyways,

211
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,610
it was a fucking great show.
And so that's why the podcast was like,

212
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,140
so he probably thinking like,
wait a minute, bell, let's show.

213
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,550
Probably started at seven o'clock.

214
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,790
Meaning you probably left your
house around six game seven Chicago,

215
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:34,720
La Kings. That was at five o'clock. What'd
you watch the first period and leave?

216
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,670
No,
I taped the game.

217
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:37,960
Yeah,

218
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,230
listen to this shit. This is how great
it is to be a hockey fan out in la.

219
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,740
I taped game seven of the western cons
conference finals involving the Los

220
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,880
Angeles kings and the Black Hawks of
Chicago. I go to the Hollywood bowl.

221
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,240
There's like, what? I don't know how many
people is that place hold? 10 15,000.

222
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:59,110
I'll fucking know.
And I didn't have to worry about anybody.

223
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,450
Okay.

224
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,200
Shouting out, going age two to
one, two to one, five minutes in,

225
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,810
rolling in it for me all.
I did it with,

226
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:11,700
all I need to do is shut up my phone so
no one would send me a text. And, uh,

227
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,640
I went to the concert,
I came home,

228
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,530
I watched the first period and if by
that point I was like one in the morning

229
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,180
and I was fucking tired as shit.

230
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:25,970
So I went to bed and then I woke up this
morning, but we'll do a little dude.

231
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,710
And uh,
I just watched the rest of it

232
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,170
this morning and like an asshole. I
didn't add time to it. I don't know why.

233
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,710
Always had time. This is the one time
I did and I just hit record and I left.

234
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,740
So I didn't have the overtime.
It looks like he scored about six.

235
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,560
Alec Martinez scored
six minutes into the overtime.

236
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,830
Uh, my condolences to all Blackhawk
fans. Congratulations to all kings fans.

237
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,240
And not to use the Cliche, but I'm
going to go, I'm going to use it.

238
00:13:56,241 --> 00:14:00,320
There really are no losers in a Shitty,
like of course, series a series like this.

239
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:04,820
Of course there is, um, you know,
because when you lose it sucks.

240
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:06,020
But I gotta tell you,
man,

241
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,080
like if the NHL ever decided to put all
seven games of that series on a DVD,

242
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:15,410
I would be one of the first
people to buy it because it was a,

243
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:20,411
it was that good top shelf level hockey
and all you fucking cunt to watch

244
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,500
hockey. You know, you
watch the gold medal game.

245
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,910
Okay?

246
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,330
You know, once every four years,
you watch one fucking game.

247
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,030
Just imagined seven of those,

248
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,390
that level of intensity except even more
cause it's actually for a real trophy.

249
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,620
Okay. Then not play it for a
fucking necklace. You know,

250
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,420
with some bgs Medallian hanging off of
it that play in for the fucking Stanley

251
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,780
Cup. That's what they all want
to win. They would never say it.

252
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,910
You can't say that in public.

253
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:56,540
What would you rather deal when the
gold medal game for your country?

254
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,050
Or would you rather win the fucking
challenge that they're going to put your

255
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:04,310
name on? It's a no brainer. F My country.

256
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,190
I'm going to Nashville and I'm
going to try to win the cup. Right.

257
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,040
Least that's what I would think. Um,
gives a fuck about winning a gold medal.

258
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,340
Yeah. Unless you're like you're
cross country ski with that rifle.

259
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:21,760
I mean there's no way to go pro in that
so that, that Chicago, you got to do it.

260
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:24,580
But if you're actually
professional athlete, right?

261
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,950
You got a Maserati sitting in
your fucking garage. You know,

262
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:33,100
you've got some hottie jumping
on your fucking Dick every night.

263
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,690
Do you really? EMEA got fucking
gold necklace. I go by what?

264
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,630
You can't buy a Stanley Cup. Oh, show.

265
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,030
You can make one out of cardboard and tin
foil and stand in the crowd wearing in

266
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:48,940
a jersey look like some giant
fucking make a wish kid right now.

267
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,570
That's not what these people play for.

268
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,650
This fucking series was amazing.
If you get a chance,

269
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:03,940
I don't know if nhl.com is gonna
is gonna. I mean, I don't know.

270
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:07,250
They have the highlights, but they
usually, I dunno how you do it.

271
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:09,850
I remember back in the days when I used,
when I used to live in Boston,

272
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:14,851
what was cool over the summertime was
Nesson and that's a network over the

273
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,220
summertime. They used to have
these, these things called, uh, uh,

274
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,940
some are cooler and over the summer they
would play like the best Bruins games

275
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,270
throughout the year.
So the Bruins would always win the game.

276
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,880
It'd be some dramatic victory and there'd
be like a bench clearing umbrella and

277
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,230
a big fight or something like that.
It was great. The summer coolest.

278
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:36,520
So I don't know if they're going
to show it, but whatever. Um,

279
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,380
I got to tell you this and
somewhere along the lines, you know,

280
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,250
I was rooting for the kings even
though I still love Chicago.

281
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,270
I rooted for the Kings cause
they were the underdogs. And uh,

282
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,920
but then I was also going man,
Chicago Rangers to original six.

283
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:53,860
I mean when's the last time they
met each other in the playoffs?

284
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,810
I mean the finals, I'm trying never
in my lifetime as far as I know,

285
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,050
seventies were a little weird.
We'll see.

286
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:05,260
The Rangers got to the
finals in [inaudible] 79 and
they played the Canadians

287
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,850
and I don't think they got
in the rest of the time.

288
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:13,650
76 was the fucking flyers lost.
The Canadians savvy.

289
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:16,500
Seven or 78, one of those was the
Bruins. Too many men on the ice game.

290
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:20,550
When Gila floor the fucking flower,
um,

291
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:23,170
scored on the weakest fucking
wrist shot you ever saw.

292
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,170
We nobody knew to go
down in the butterfly.

293
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:30,171
So to fuck we had was standing up in neck
and he did like a little fucking flail

294
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:35,140
that at with this
fucking pad. Um, anyways,

295
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,870
let me just continue one. Oh, by the way,

296
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:39,750
remember long time ago I gave a lot of
today's hockey players Shit because most

297
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:43,440
of them hadn't even scored 50 goals.
And then I listened to Dan practice. Uh,

298
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,900
I recorded it because he had Wayne
Gretzky on the great one. And uh,

299
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,790
I actually listen it in Gretzky
said that he would have a PR,

300
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,650
he would have problems scoring 50 goals,

301
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,100
how good and how big the players are
now and how great the defenses are.

302
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:02,450
So I will shut the fuck up
about that immediately. Um,

303
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,480
but anyways, yeah. So I
started rooting for the Kings.

304
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,710
You know, I've just liked that
team for a number of years.

305
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:12,270
I just like how they play and everything.

306
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:16,200
And I just watched a bunch of games and
I somehow became a fan and I was sitting

307
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:20,280
out there this morning watching the rest
of the game and somebody on the king's

308
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:24,740
took a shot. And I like when like, oh,

309
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:26,900
like I freaked out
cause he just missed it.

310
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,530
Then they scored a goal and I flipped
out and then Nia just looked at me.

311
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,900
Okay.

312
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,550
And she just went,
shame on you.

313
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,300
But did you abandon the Boston Bruins
and just put me in this defensive on

314
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:41,490
McKnight and abandon Moses out.
You know, I'm a fan of hockey,

315
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:42,750
I'm rooting for the king.
She goes,

316
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:47,751
how can you as a fan of Annie Boston
team route for a fucking La team?

317
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,830
It's like, I know, you're right. You're
right. I don't know how it happened.

318
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,270
You know,
I actually was a fan of the,

319
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,860
the Los Angeles Dodgers in the late
seventies before the Lakers Celtics thing

320
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:04,340
heated up in the 80s and that was
just because they hated the Yankees.

321
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:08,210
We can have a beat them. And there was
the Bucky Dent Games. So in 77 and 78,

322
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,740
the Dodgers played the fucking Yankee,
so I'm not rooting for the Yankees.

323
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:16,950
So I would really root for the Dodgers
and I became a Dodgers fan. Um,

324
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,270
I love Tommy Lasorda right through
when they beat the Yankees in 81,

325
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,830
Fernando valance Swayla when they beat
the A's, Kurt Gibson hobbling around,

326
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:30,060
fucking pumping his fist, all of that
shit. I was a Dodgers fan. And then, uh,

327
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,310
then I moved out here and I went
to a Dodgers game, you know,

328
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:37,660
when I saw how cunty they're fucking
fans are, they don't show up late.

329
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:40,960
They got a knife to your throat. I
mean, I'm exaggerating but not really,

330
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,290
kind of has like a little
sort of biker rally vibe.

331
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,840
Um, yeah, I told you it's just, I'm
a kings. Fans are more mellow though,

332
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:53,920
but it's just not,
it's,

333
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:59,200
I don't know what it is about from fucking
San Francisco on down out here on the

334
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:03,520
west coast.
These people take it way too seriously.

335
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,070
If you have the Jersey of another team,
I mean,

336
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,650
it's bad enough when you do that
in other parts of the country.

337
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,630
But this is the last fucking place I
would come wearing the Jersey of an of the

338
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:16,990
opposite team. There's no
fucking way. No fucking way.

339
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,860
I like where my nose is on my
face. I like my teeth. I like my,

340
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,580
my brain and swollen, you
know, I like not having little,

341
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:28,270
a extra breathing holes throughout
my chest. And he called me crazy,

342
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,720
call me a pussy. I mean, that's
just, just, just how I am.

343
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,610
You haven't one time from some fucking
celebrity, you know, one of those,

344
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,710
those Tufts celebrities,
you know,

345
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:41,770
they get movies and they played enough
tough guys that they start to think that

346
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:46,771
they know how to fight and save the
world was talking about wearing um,

347
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,600
another team's Jersey to a Laker game.
They like,

348
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,780
aren't you worried about blah blah,
blah. And he's like worried about what?

349
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,080
Like he says, bad ass.
It's like, fuck you.

350
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:59,890
What the court side seats,
you know,

351
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,660
walking in and out of the celebrity
entrance at the fuck a town car go where

352
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,000
that and the upper deck.
All right.

353
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,760
Let's see if you live long
enough to do the sequel

354
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,000
to a I am cunt face part too,
right? All right. Whoa. Jesus. Bill,

355
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:20,080
you're in a mood. I am. I'm a little
tired and then I ate bad already today.

356
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,150
Oh my God,
eight so bad.

357
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,870
Do you know last week I got
to mention this before I,

358
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:28,210
before I do in the advertising
was fucking hilarious.

359
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:31,000
I didn't even realize I said it. I
was talking about something. I said,

360
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:31,481
I've got him.

361
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:36,481
Such a Gemini I have never taken out of
that might've been the most shit I ever

362
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:41,440
took for anything that
I said on the podcast.

363
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,840
I must've got like,
I don't know,

364
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:48,460
like 30 or 40 I retweeted a couple.
They,

365
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,770
whoever wrote those, you guys had
me dying laughing. Just, you know,

366
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,221
like when you,

367
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:59,221
you say something and you don't even
realize how fucking a feminine it is until

368
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:03,760
somebody brings it up and then it's
just so bad and the jokes are so good.

369
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:05,050
You can't do anything but laugh.

370
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:09,660
I was like sitting by myself and
the first one came in and this,

371
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,030
I think that was the one who
retweeted somebody wrote,

372
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,380
you know, I really had you, I don't know,

373
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:21,640
something about the level of
respect they had for me, you know,

374
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,930
was that a high level?

375
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,490
And then it all went out the window
the second I said I'm such a Gemini.

376
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,810
And then I got like, and I was
just like, Oh fuck did I say that?

377
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,250
And I kind of started laughing.

378
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,520
Sarber tweeted that one and then I kind
of scrolled down and there was like 10

379
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:41,170
other ones and each one was just more
and more brutal. Um, so whatever.

380
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,130
That's a shout out to ever fucking wrote
those things because you guys gave me a

381
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:49,090
great left this week. So,
so why, why, why, why,

382
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:54,091
why not just continue setting
myself up to get trashed here.

383
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,750
Um, you know what I did this morning,
you know why the podcast is late?

384
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,810
Because this morning I was
making homemade cupcakes.

385
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,250
I swear to God,
frosting and all that shit.

386
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,990
That was frost and cupcakes when
I was watching the end of a game,

387
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:19,440
seven Nhl game,
the toughest man sport,

388
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,040
arguably out there,
I was frost and cupcakes.

389
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,240
You know what?
I stand by it.

390
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,540
I don't give a fuck how much shit you
guys give me on Twitter because I know you

391
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:36,190
got it because it's fun. But uh,
you know, what do you want for me?

392
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,900
It's my wife's birthday today.

393
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,370
One of our favorite
things in the world is a,

394
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,500
she likes cupcakes with
chocolate frosting,

395
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:48,620
but out here they usually
have the chocolate frosting
with the chocolate cake.

396
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,580
She likes the yellow cake with chocolate
frosting, myself included. All right,

397
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,580
insert interracial.
Couple joke there. Um, so,

398
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,930
and how I was, I'm sick of driving
around trying to find them at fucking,

399
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:05,120
and you know, every God damn
bakery out here. I said, fuck it.

400
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:08,870
I'll make some went out and bought
a couple of trays. You know what?

401
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:11,900
Let me tell you something about
people make cupcakes. Okay. Fuck them.

402
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,930
It's not that hard.
It's not that hard.

403
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,320
Actually took out my kitchen aid is
the second time I used it one time.

404
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:22,710
I used it for fucking Ah, look at all this
product placement, nhl.com. Kitchenaid.

405
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:27,170
I, she's got to start getting paid
for this shit. Um, so I fucking,

406
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,033
uh,

407
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,940
I took that thing out for the first
time a couple months ago and I made some

408
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:38,560
homemade pasta and a, this is the first
time I used it when I was actually bacon.

409
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:39,394
It's the shit.

410
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,510
It's like having an assistant that you
don't have to fucking pay ever things

411
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:45,640
over in the corner just doing the shit.
You don't want to do.

412
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,670
Stern it up as you're
doing some other bullshit.

413
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:50,620
And I gotta tell you
something dead delicious.

414
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,830
And everybody who wanted
the wants to give me shit.

415
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:57,860
I'm going to tell you right now, if
I shut one down your pie hole, you,

416
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,310
you'd have to say, God dammit.
Bill. It's a good cupcake.

417
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,370
I got to give it up to you.
I don't respect you anymore as a man.

418
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,590
That's a good God damn, uh, cupcakes. So,
Hey, get into the Stanley Cup finals here,

419
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,120
the Stanley Cup finals.
Uh,

420
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,910
I picked Chicago to winning it all wrong.
I crushed the first round.

421
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,610
You know when the number one
was playing the eighth seed,

422
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,210
I called those all day after
the fucking second round.

423
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,450
I mean into the second round after the
first round is what I'm trying to say.

424
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:32,860
I have, I've just been horrible.
Um, so if I pick your team, you,

425
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:35,440
you should be nervous.
So right now,

426
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,960
range of fans and kings
fan supposed to be saying,

427
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:42,961
if you believe in that Mojo fucking Voodoo
shit should be telling me to shut up.

428
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:46,840
Well, you know what, I'm not gonna. Um,

429
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,400
I thought the Canadians were going to
beat the ranges and I thought the, uh,

430
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,540
I thought Chicago was
going to beat the kinks.

431
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,880
Obviously neither of that happened,

432
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:01,740
but I'll tell you who picked it perfectly
was Joe Barton. Nick, Joe Barton.

433
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:06,720
Nick said Kings in seven gangs the
kings one in seven games add Joe Barton.

434
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:10,390
Nick. All right, getting off. You want to,

435
00:26:10,391 --> 00:26:13,060
you're going to give a little tippy a cap.
Go to add Joe Barton.

436
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:17,350
Nick on the Twitter, on the Twitter APP
thing, whatever the fuck you call it.

437
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:20,380
And I have a listen to a Joe Barton.
Nick has his own podcast.

438
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:24,400
It's all hockey talk.
It's called puck off. Um,

439
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,950
and uh,
have a listen to whatever the guy,

440
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,740
the guy really knows his shit and
he's as big as fucking Cam Neely.

441
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,930
So there you go. Um, anyway, so who am
I picking in the finals? I think, uh,

442
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,610
I actually love both teams.
How fucked up is that?

443
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:42,700
I love in New York and an La team.
I don't love the fans,

444
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,090
but I loved the team and uh,
just watching both of them throughout the,

445
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,310
the last series, I don't know how
you can hate either one of them,

446
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,440
but I got to go with the experience
and I got to take the fucking La Kinks,

447
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,850
you know, two great
goaltenders you know what?

448
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:03,370
And I say bet the over
and all of these games,

449
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,730
cause everyone's gonna think
Johnathan quick and fucking, uh,

450
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,840
whatever the fuck his name is suit
wherein Lundquist said Henri Henrik,

451
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:12,760
whatever the fuck you call a,

452
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:15,070
they think that there's going to be low
score and I don't think it's going to be,

453
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,940
I think they get to run into them.

454
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:21,030
I think doesn't make a lot of
goalie masks falling off, you know,

455
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,340
and there's going to be some upset,
padded,

456
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,940
bearded gentlemen on both sides of the
ice going, what the fuck? You know? Um,

457
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,260
I just think it's going to be a great
series and uh, good luck to both of you.

458
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:36,090
I'm watching every second of it.
So this is your last series.

459
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,730
If you're gonna ever going
to watch hockey. Well,

460
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,220
I make you want you to get an October,
but you know, whatever. Come on man.

461
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:44,820
Jump on the fucking bandwagon.
Have a good time. All right. Um,

462
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:50,250
okay, what else? Oh, let me
do some advertising. Let me
just knock these things out.

463
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,470
Shall We?
Where am I?

464
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,040
Where the fuck is he advertising

465
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,200
that right? There we go.
All right, note to host,

466
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:07,340
please personalize areas highlighted
in bold. You know, I'm really getting,

467
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:09,740
isn't it, isn't it? It's hard enough
for me to read these fucking things.

468
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,170
All right. Dollar Shave club, everybody.

469
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,030
There were so many things that
piss me off. You know what?

470
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:18,800
Sticking my hand into the bowl,

471
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:22,940
like towards the end when I'm trying to
frost a cupcake and the frosting gets on

472
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:24,500
my knuckles and I have to lick it off.

473
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:27,380
Just knowing that that's extra time
I'm going to spend on the treadmill,

474
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,400
you know? But then I'm happy that I
am frosting a cupcake. So you know,

475
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:34,700
it's kind of happy and sad,
you know, I'm such a Gemini

476
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,350
and paying way too much to shave.
My face is definitely up there.

477
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:45,310
Nothing feels better than
shaving with a fresh new blade.

478
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,960
But new razors are so ridiculously
expensive that you can't afford to change

479
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,970
your blade more than
once every six months.

480
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,700
So you end up scraping up
your face with an old blade.

481
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,380
Dollar Shave club delivers top quality
raises for a few bucks a month.

482
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:03,010
Dollar Shave Club members always shave
with a fresh blade because they get a

483
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:05,800
fresh pack in the mail every month.

Talk candidly about your
experiences with the program. Well,

485
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:14,380
I lather up my face and I use that fresh
blade and when I'm done I wash it off

486
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,750
and my face is smooth.

Hey,

499
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:10,090
when you think about the best
time to go to the post office,

500
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,310
you probably guessing before work, after
work or during lunch. Wrong. That's,

501
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,480
that's, that's when it's the most
crowded. Well obviously nobody's at work.

502
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,180
Are they talking down to us@stamps.com
and I don't think I liked this. Um,

503
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,480
everyone's going at that time.

504
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:28,240
The truth is there's no convenient
time to go to the post office.

505
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:30,850
That's why you need stamps.com
actually in defense of them,

can go if you have a job,

507
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,270
right with stamps.com access
all the services of the
post office right from your

508
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:37,930
own desk.

509
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,670
Buy and print official US postage for
any letter or package using your computer

510
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,240

hand it over to the mail carrier.

511
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,610
So easy and unlike the post office,

512
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:53,611
stamps.com is open 24 seven with no

[inaudible]. All right. Oh,

523
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:36,640
I almost forgot to thank everybody who
came out to the Improv in Arlington,

524
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:37,570
Texas this week.

525
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:41,320
I had a great time performing few guys
getting ready to do my standup special

526
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,430
June 20th at the Tabernacle
Theater in Atlanta.

527
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,430
Tickets are on sale right now.
Um,

528
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,170
both shows looking like
they're going to sell out.

529
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:51,640
So I want to thank everybody that,
uh,

530
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,880
spent your hard earned cash to watch me
go dance around and tell my jokes on the

531
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:58,360
20th. I'm really looking
forward to it. And, um,

532
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,060
I had a great time in Dallas, as
always, big fan of Texas and um,

533
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:09,090
and most of you who listen to my
podcast know that I am a huge fan of,

534
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,020
uh, the discovery channel show fast
and loud, the gas monkey garage guys.

535
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:18,190
So, um, I'm like, I gotta go over
there, I gotta go check this place out.

536
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,420
And, um, I went over to their garage,

537
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:27,100
they got a gift shop over there with
all these tee shirts and stuff. And um,

538
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,660
you know, fortunately enough, the,
uh, the owner Richard was nice enough,

539
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:36,250
he was out of town. He had a few
people over there take me around.

540
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,480
And, um, I just, I just had
a great time. I saw the cars.

541
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,460
It was ridiculous. I came walking in
the back total fucking fanboy, right.

542
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,420
Actually nervous as I'm walking in there,
I'm such a fan of the fucking show,

543
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,230
right. And, uh,

544
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,550
I come walking in the back and then
there's like all these guys that I've seen

545
00:32:55,551 --> 00:33:00,080
on the show and, um, long
story, fucking short,

546
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,960
long story short, I,
uh, I got to, you know,

547
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,160
I got to see all these cars,
some of the cars that they're working on,

548
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:09,830
upcoming episodes, I'm not going
to ruin anything that's coming up,

549
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:13,430
but they're working on some of the
coolest cars that they've had since the

550
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:15,710
beginning of the episode. And, um,

551
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,240
and then as I'm walking out in
the parking lot and there's a,

552
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:25,450
that army green f 100 that he has
Frankenstein or whatever they call it,

553
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,140
a lot of you guys who are
fans of the show, watch them,
you know, Redo that truck.

554
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,740
And, um, I guess since they did it,

555
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:38,620
he put an even faster engine in it. Long
story short, the guy over there, Jason,

556
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,490
was giving me the tour, who was really
nice to me the whole weekend. Um,

557
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,840
he goes, hey, you want Casey to give you
a ride in that truck? And I'm like, man,

558
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:51,200
I don't want to bug the guy. Of course
I do, but I don't want to bug the guy.

559
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,860
I don't to be some fucking jerk off.
I already met the guy.

560
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:58,340
He didn't know who the fuck I was. Right.
So it's not like I could be like, Hey,

561
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:02,150
I'll give you one of my fucking stupid
standup DVDs if you get, I had nothing.

562
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,620
I was just another jackass
walking in there. So he was
cool as hell. He goes, yeah,

563
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:11,120
I'll give you a ride. So we start
driving around the block in the truck.

564
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:13,310
He's talking to me about the
truck and all that type of shit.

565
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,570
And we get on this straight away. Right.
Thank God they didn't film the state.

566
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,270
They wanted to film it, but they didn't
have any batteries in their camera.

567
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,610
They will stick one on
the, uh, the windshield.

568
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,700
It was the fastest fucking
thing I've ever been in.

569
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,310
He just lets out the clutch and it just,

570
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,313
wow.

571
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,970
We start flying down the street.

572
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:38,971
I can literally feel the back end just
ever so subtly going left to right

573
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,430
because there's no weight
in the back. And, um,

574
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,730
I felt like it was in a drag racer and I
was trying so hard to not freak out and

575
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:49,840
not be a pussy, but I'm not
gonna lie to you had to put my,

576
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:53,470
I put my foot up on a fucking dashboard
cause there was no seatbelts and I'm

577
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:56,800
feeling this thing skating in the back.
So we just go down the street.

578
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,143
Yeah,

579
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,610
I fucking faces contouring
and then he slows down

580
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,690
and I just go,
Jesus fucking Christ.

581
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,890
What are you trying to give me a
heart attack? And he just, you know,

582
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:13,440
it deadpan humor just sort of laughs and
he goes, uh, yeah, that was second gear,

583
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,641
second gear.

584
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:19,641
We're going like 70 miles an hour down
this little ass fucking road cars parked

585
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:22,860
on both sides. Um, it took,

586
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,860
it literally took me about four hours
to come down from probably the three

587
00:35:25,861 --> 00:35:29,640
seconds that we would drive in that
fast. But uh, I got to do that.

588
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:32,760
How cool is that and how cool are the
people at gas monkey that they actually

589
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,830
took time out of their day to let
me do that? I'm a huge of the show.

590
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,040
I went over to their bar,
they got their own restaurant over there.

591
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:45,270
It's like the number two live place to
play music now in Texas already or in

592
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:49,500
Dallas. They just passed house of Blues,
the fucking crushing it over there. So,

593
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,390
um, I dunno if you get a chance. I I man,

594
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:56,640
I asked all kinds of
Geeky fan questions too.

595
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:59,610
I'm trying to remember some
that won't ruin any episodes.

596
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,750
They get like 400 emails a day cause I
asked them like, how do you guys find,

597
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,450
how do you find all these fucking
cars? I know Richard, Zoe, Sam,

598
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:09,040
I'm going to go on the
interweb and blah blah blah.

599
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,180
They get 400 emails a day of people
with these cars that they want to sell.

600
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,500
Either they don't want to handle them or
the person who owned them passed away.

601
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,800
And, um, man,

602
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:26,360
you should see I got to shut up
cause I don't want to ruin any of,

603
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,280
so thank you to Richard Rawlings
for hooking me up over there.

604
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,860
Casey for giving me the ride and uh,

605
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,030
Jason and his lovely wife Linda
giving me the tour and everything.

606
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,020
I just had a great, great time and I
can't wait for the next season. So, uh,

607
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,530
if you don't watch it fast and
loud on discovery, look at that.

608
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:47,310
That was like a fucking 20 minute
commercial for him. Um, all right, let's,

609
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:51,870
let's move on to the, uh,
to the questions this week.

610
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,060
Ever so slight. Where are we at 36
minutes in. Okay. Uh, solar panels.

611
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,770
Last week I talked about,

612
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:01,410
I was thinking about maybe
getting solar panels off my house,

613
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,280
off my house on my house and uh,

614
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,230
I dunno if I want to go off the grid,

615
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:11,100
but whatever the city of Bacon
in the sun in his fucking house,

616
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:14,610
I might as well get something out of it.
Right. All right, so here we go. Hi Bill.

617
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:16,980
First off, huge fan of your
comedy podcasts. Thank you.

618
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:20,670
I saw you perform a Brian Regan
oh with Brian Regan cubs comedy.

619
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,490
While that was a, that was a bucket list
night for me to be able to perform it.

620
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,070
That guy show was absolutely hilarious.

621
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:29,190
Well thank you and thank you
for Brian Regan to um, anyway,

622
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,530
regarding your question about solar,

623
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,370
there is no solar power that
is completely off the grid.

624
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,080
You use all the energy that you can
provide through solar and the rest that

625
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:45,081
can't be provided by the sun like at
night or if it gets shady on your roof.

626
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,700
The utility provides, this is
called interconnection. Uh,

627
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,670
you save a ton of money and you
use clean energy in the process.

628
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,140
I worked for a solar company,

629
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,740
I promise this isn't a bullshit sales
pitch and I managed the construction

630
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:00,780
timeline so I've learned
a lot about this stuff.

631
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,760
Here's the link to my
company I worked for.

632
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:05,580
We install a lot in la
and in Boston as well too.

633
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,250
I think we're in like 12 different states.
Anyways,

634
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,700
thanks you for the awesome podcasts and
you know something about this Psoas Shit.

635
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,940
This, every person you talk
to says something different.

636
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,160
I watch people on Youtube
make up a solar thing. Um,

637
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,670
what a solar thing.
Put up their solar panels,

638
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,920
broke down how they worked and uh,
and how you could get off the grid,

639
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:32,580
but it was really, really,
really fucking involved.

640
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,970
Sky's digging a God damn trench. I can't
even know what the fuck was going on,

641
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:40,360
but I'm just like, all right, I don't
have room for a trench. All right.

642
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:44,950
My little piece of property here so I
don't, you know, I got room for a whole,

643
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,350
does that work?
I can't even know what he was doing.

644
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,110
They dug this translation stuff
like a fucking top in there.

645
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,413
Yeah.

646
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,150
I don't even know what the heck. I can't
even tell you what, what's going on.

647
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:58,560
But um, I will definitely,
I'll definitely look into it.

648
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,810
Um, hopefully I'll have more luck
with you guys and the fucking concept.

649
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:04,950
Put the roof on this house.

650
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,040
Okay.

651
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,840
Fucking assholes.
I told you what they did right.

652
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:12,220
They put the roof on the house
and then like the drain pipes,

653
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,370
because it's an old house,

654
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:18,371
old stupid design with a drain off was
it goes down into a pipe that actually

655
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:23,180
goes into like, uh, I don't, I have
like, uh, my attic is actually ever see,

656
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:27,110
seen John Malcovich or being,
being John Malcovich.

657
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,750
Remember they had that floor, we
had to walk around, bent over.

658
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:34,160
Like that's basically how much
space there is between, um,

659
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,690
the ceiling on my top
floor and then the roof.

660
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,060
I don't even know what
the purpose of it is.

661
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,770
All it is is just try it just traps air
that gets heated up and causes my house

662
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:48,620
to be hot. But anyways, that's what it is.

663
00:39:48,621 --> 00:39:53,621
So the drain off of the water on the
roof goes into a pipe that goes in,

664
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:59,450
into the fucking crawl space and then
back out the front of the house and down

665
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:03,740
the side. So you take water from the
roof, you bring it into the house,

666
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,320
it's inside a pipe.
But nevertheless,

667
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:11,321
you're bringing into the fucking house
and God forbid that pipe bursts or you

668
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:18,740
have some fucking moron who disconnects
it when he's putting the new roof on and

669
00:40:18,741 --> 00:40:22,950
forgets to hook it back up and
then tries to blame it. Not yet.

670
00:40:22,951 --> 00:40:25,530
He blamed it on mobile, you know,
the fuck it all the blah blah blah.

671
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:27,960
And I'm just sitting there going, all
right, this is at least a year in court.

672
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,240
You know what? Why don't you
just get the fuck Outta here?

673
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,970
I'll just put in a goddamn claim.
You can't.

674
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,500
That's what I did cause I didn't
want to go to court. So, um, anyways,

675
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,770
I'm hoping you, you're better than
those guys. I mean, how couldn't you be?

676
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:45,990
All right. Here's my favorite one of
this week. A solar roadways debunked.

677
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,090
Um, I got a note from my
guy here, Andrew says,

678
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:55,680
a ton of people forwarded the same
link as the one in the email below.

679
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,470
I watched this, so you don't
have to, it's 30 minutes long.

680
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,270
Basically he bitches about
costs maintenance and the
efficiency is efficiency of

681
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:07,530
the perks. Advertising original video,
like heating, repairing the road. Yeah,

682
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,770
I actually watched the
first 10 minutes of it. Um,

683
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,370
I'll save my opinion until I read
this. Uh, Yo Billy, the sunburn kid.

684
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,060
I know you were pretty pumped up about
solar roads to be honest. So was I,

685
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,080
but someone's smart sat down and crunched
some numbers and brought up points is

686
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:25,140
why as to why solar roads
are economically in tech,

687
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,980
technically not feasible.
It's about 30 minutes long.

688
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,350
So if you got some time to
kill in any airport, check
it out. Well, you know, sir,

689
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:34,250
I watched the first

690
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,550
10 minutes of it. Uh,
he didn't debunk them.

691
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,500
He just brought up a bunch of questions.

692
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,810
He's just like a road has to be durable
and I would have some questions about,

693
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,870
I mean,
they showed a tractor run over the tiles,

694
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:52,500
but it was a small tractor and
they only did it once. Um, I,

695
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:55,370
I would like to see how these,
you know,

696
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:59,660
these things hold up when it's wet
out and you need water to run off.

697
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:03,890
And he just brought up a bunch
of fucking questions. You know,

698
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,550
he didn't debunk them. He did
basically, basically what he did.

699
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,650
It's like 50% what you have to do. You
can't have somebody just come in and, hey,

700
00:42:12,651 --> 00:42:17,280
these are brand new roads. Can I make
them? Oh, okay. You think they're good,

701
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,300
you think they're going to work okay.
I mean obviously you can't do that,

702
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,260
but it's 50% that, which is smart.
You got to ask the right questions.

703
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,520
And then the other side is anytime
he tried to do something new,

704
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:31,730
there's always people saying
it's not going to work. You know,

705
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,360
and this guy in his half hour,
I'm sure he brings,

706
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,790
he brought up a number of
things that would be a problem.

707
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:40,610
It doesn't mean they can't
work. Okay. So I don't,

708
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:41,930
I wouldn't say they were debunked.

709
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:46,190
I would just say somebody asked a bunch
of fucking questions and rather than

710
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,920
just one, what he does is he just
throws it out there. It's like,

711
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:53,780
why don't you contact the people at the
solar road who tried to make the solar

712
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:56,960
roads and actually get some
answers and get some fucking, uh,

713
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,560
or maybe order some tiles and tried to
do some experiments yourself rather than

714
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:04,850
wasting people's time with the half
hour of questions and speculation.

715
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:09,440
That's basically what it was. So I
wouldn't say that it was debunked. Um,

716
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,560
but you know, you throw up
three pointers for half an hour,

717
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:14,450
some of them are going to
go in even if you suck.

718
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:18,460
So I'm sure a couple of his concerns
were true, but uh, you know, I mean,

719
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,200
look at electric cars
since way back in the day,

720
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,970
people who are, they show
up, they're fucking up.

721
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,930
Like people actually question the
power of electric electricity.

722
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,550
It powers the entire fucking city
can light up a whole fucking city.

723
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:38,770
And I get a Prius and my own mother,
my own mother is going,

724
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,280
can it go up a hill now mom?

725
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:46,360
I just got to get out and start walking.
It's great for my weight.

726
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,470
And look at that. They sell,
they're underpowered and
their this and their that.

727
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,530
First of all,
the Prius is not an electric car.

728
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,940
It's not even a fucking 50% electric car.

729
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,550
It's like an 8% electric car.

730
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,200
That's what it is from like zero.
I've told you this Gus,

731
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,420
for years from zero to
seven miles an hour,

732
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:12,200
that car runs an electric power and then
switches over to gas for the rest of

733
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:14,450
the time.
And if you drive with a lead foot,

734
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,810
you're going to get maybe 25
miles a gallon. But if you listen,

735
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,690
if you listen to the engine,
okay.

736
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:24,860
And you don't stomp on the gas and drive
like a fucking maniac and slam on the

737
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:28,960
brakes, you can get, you know, I don't,
I wouldn't say 40 miles a gallon. Yeah,

738
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:32,040
you can get like 35,
but it's great. Perfect

739
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,840
car. If you live in, in the
city. I absolutely love the
fucking thing. So anyways,

740
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:36,674
so you had that,

741
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,990
I bought that thing in October
of 2007 and now look at these,

742
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:46,140
these Tesla cars. I actually
wrote in one of those, uh,

743
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:50,970
the end of last year before I wrote in
Casey's fucking truck, Jesus Christ,

744
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,600
which probably gets two feet
to the gallon, especially
the way he was driving it.

745
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,013
MMM.

746
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,770
Those Tesla cars are fucking amazing.

747
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,360
And you can drive from last I checked
from San Diego, all you have to Vancouver.

748
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:05,983
MMM.

749
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,230
You know, they have recharge stations
from San Diego. All we have to Vancouver.

750
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:13,930
And I think recently someone just
drove one across the country.

751
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:17,430
So it's not like that guy in
the speculation video. Um, I'm,

752
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:20,230
I got to look that one up or you
should look it up or whatever. But um,

753
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,450
I'm actually, uh, I'm leaning towards
that fucking thing. Thinks bad ass.

754
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:26,740
You walk up to,
when you turn it on,

755
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:29,920
like the door handles are flush against
the car and you walk up and things pop

756
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:33,250
out. I'm sure why the cars do that.
But I never seen it, you know,

757
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:36,630
it was cool to me. The only thing
I didn't like about the car is it,

758
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:41,350
it has like a supersized fucking
iPad right in the dashboard.

759
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:42,970
Um,

760
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,580
and that just seemed like that would be
really distracting for somebody like me.

761
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,300
I need like a shade just to sort
of pull that thing down. But um,

762
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,970
I'm actually thinking
of maybe getting one.

763
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,390
How's that kind of like the idea
that they just sorta one price.

764
00:45:55,391 --> 00:45:58,440
Like you don't go in there and
there's none of that haggling. Um,

765
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,150
so you don't feel like a
pussy when you walk out.

766
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:02,080
Cause I don't give a shit how
many fucking videos you watch.

767
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:05,200
You still get your ass handed
to you. Um, but either way.

768
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:09,970
Let's bring in the birthday
girl. Hi Neha. Come on in.

769
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,690
Got to bring in the
birthday girl over here.

770
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,293
MMM.

771
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:22,280
Just trying to find something that
she can relate to. NBA. Oh, Bill.

772
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:27,440
Not asking you to rat for 20 minutes.
Oh, there we go. The lovely knee.

773
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:32,180
Everybody happy birthday to you.

774
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,780
Happy Birthday to you
will be birthday dear Ni.

775
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,193
Uh,

776
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,820
happy birthday to you.

777
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:52,550
Yeah, sorry. That was beautiful.
It was in its own sad way.

778
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:57,770
Um, how'd you like your cupcake?
I loved that. There you go.

779
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,980
You made me a cookie.
My favorite kind of cupcake too,

780
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:04,680
which is very sweet to put it with candle,

781
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,950
candle Roman candle in it saying yeah,
happy birthday. It was very nice thing.

782
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:12,710
And you didn't wash shit in
my face. I did it. All right,

783
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:15,740
well happy birthday a whole bunch
more that you made. So you know.

784
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,580
Well that's the thing. All my
recipes, p's and q's suite on.

785
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,100
Well the thing is is all my
recipes come from my mother.

786
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:30,160
So they all serve like 10
people so well a cupcake recipes

787
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,510
are going to be for like
they made more than 30 yeah,

788
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,110
I stopped after I went to rounds
through what did I make, what does it,

789
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,040
was it, was it six and a
tray or eight and the tray,

790
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,000
there's like 18 to 20 of them out there.
Well nobody makes one cupcake. So yeah,

791
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,200
any kind of recipe is going to be,
why didn't you just make,

792
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:53,590
make like six six is perfect.
They never think about like they don't,

793
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,670
they never think about the lonely
people when they make a cookbook. Well,

794
00:47:57,671 --> 00:48:02,500
the thing is you could put the batter
in for six and cook the six and then

795
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:05,080
freeze the rest of your battery and just
have it for the next time you want to

796
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:09,100
make cupcakes. So it's not like it's
a complete waste, but all right.

797
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,370
Who's going to give you the exact
measurements for like one or two cupcakes?

798
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:14,410
That's, that's silly. Well, you know what?

799
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:18,190
I think that'd be a great
idea for a cookbook.

800
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,430
What cupcakes for one?
The loaner.

801
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:25,220
The loaner cookbook or just single?
Yeah,

802
00:48:25,221 --> 00:48:28,510
like when you're fucking single
sitting there trying to do the math.

803
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:30,400
You know Zay serves eight.
It's just like,

804
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:33,150
I'm fucking 22 I'm trying
to make spaghetti over here.

805
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,980
Why don't they just make what? That's
why you have left. But the thing is,

806
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,690
that's why it's good to have leftovers.

807
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:43,090
You free is a shit and you have
it for later. Well it's not,

808
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:46,060
it's not bad now because you can
go on the Internet. Like today,

809
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:51,540
I'm sitting there looking at that fucking
cane sugar and they're asking me in

810
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:53,741
the bag,

811
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:58,741
it says two pounds of cane sugar and they
wanted a certain amount of ounces and

812
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:03,730
I'm sitting there and all they have is
like a quarter cup. So I go, I was like,

813
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:07,880
how many cups are in a pound? And they're
like, well, cups is more of a like a uh,

814
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,370
size. Now the size, what is
the word? Like a, like a did.

815
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:15,180
They couldn't figure like it's
not a weight cup is not a weight.

816
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:17,740
It's more like a fucking handful
kind of looking at it like that.

817
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,740
So what I actually did was I took out
one of your little sports fucking things

818
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:25,120
that you drink out of that
has ounces on the sides.

819
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,010
So the protein shakes then yes, that
works. Yeah. Well that's why the,

820
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,270
the thing was a disaster once I got out.

821
00:49:32,271 --> 00:49:36,230
It's like a bakery exploded in
there. Yeah. Lauer everywhere. Yep.

822
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,870
Mix thislike kicked on the countertops
and on the floor and it's ride little

823
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:44,320
white puddles. That's right.
You're like a little kid.

824
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,300
Whenever you make something,

825
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,930
you make that biggest fucking
mess I have ever seen.

826
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,660
The kitchen is a disaster.
That's why I like it.

827
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:55,630
You've got like stains all
over your apron. You know,

828
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:58,990
you're sweating a little bit.
You're Harry. You're like what?

829
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:03,190
Stepping around and your socks in
the kitchen sliding around in flower.

830
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,910
You're all like stressed out. You're all
red in the face. I wasn't stressed out.

831
00:50:06,911 --> 00:50:09,910
You weren't sets at this time, but other
times you've made stuff. It's been fun.

832
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,220
That's when I have learned to stay
away. Here's the kitchen. No, no.

833
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:18,010
Here's the thing. That was, that was
the younger me who flipped out all, no,

834
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,240
I flip out a year ago. Quit going for
the joke. Come on, I'm getting better.

835
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,170
Um, yeah, and also back in the
dead. Didn't have a neighbor.

836
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,110
You've got to have an apron.
Yay. Bernie fans or don't mess.

837
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:33,350
He just laid it out on the front of
them and you just keep marching forward.

838
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:39,020
Leave the casualties, bind.
It's fucking phenomenal. Um,

839
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,650
it was delicious though. I
really appreciate it. And
your gifts were amazing.

840
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,470
Of course they were killed it.
That's birthday. And of course I did.

841
00:50:45,471 --> 00:50:45,951
And you know what?

842
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:49,310
You know I killed it because you always
figure out what I'm going to get you is.

843
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,390
I just played like I was a moron.
I really hate that though.

844
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:57,650
And can I just say I really,
you drove me crazy with that yesterday.

845
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,380
You were driving me nuts.
You were actually mad at me.

846
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,100
That was the oldest trying not to be,
but you were really pushing my buttons.

847
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:05,380
You were trying to make me mad.

848
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,290
See that's the thing you're
toying with me though. Huh?

849
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,240
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

850
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:14,640
I emailed you something like
a month ago to say, Hey,

851
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,690
if you're wondering what to get me for
my birthday cause I know you're busy.

852
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,350
I know you're on the road and all this
other stuff. Look at you and help you out.

853
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,180
I'm telling you what I want also, you
know it's like I'm not like a little kid.

854
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:29,420
You know what I mean? I got to tell you
exactly what I wanted. Like give you,

855
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:31,820
leads you in the right direction.
What a little kids say what?

856
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,350
Say what they don't want.
Why mean you know,

857
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,580
there's a little kid as a breadth
of you're like, hey, I have a toy,

858
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,230
get out of here, beat it. But when
you're older set, what happens?

859
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,660
Like specific things that you know, maybe
you'd like to guess. He let people know.

860
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:46,610
My parents asked me all the time,
what do you want for your birthday?

861
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:47,480
What do you want for your birthday?

862
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:50,900
Because nobody has time to sit around
and like figure out what you want.

863
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,030
So you know now what I did this year.

864
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,300
But that's what you did because you
took what I wanted and then you kind of

865
00:51:56,301 --> 00:51:59,860
riffed on it and you've got a bunch
of stuff to surround. No, it was,

866
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:04,430
it was wonderful. But my point is you made
me cry like, Hey, you still took credit.

867
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,540
You took what I said and then your
riffed on it and I didn't actually will

868
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:12,541
listen to you this year and four months
ago and I figured out what the fuck you

869
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,620
wanted and then you did your usual
thing because you are an organizing.

870
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,003
You like you,

871
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,870
you're an organized person literally
to the point that you're organizing.

872
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:25,560
My shopping for what I get you now,

873
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:27,860
one of the great things
about giving somebody a gift,

874
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:31,940
it's the surprise where they're like, they
like me out to brunch and you're like,

875
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,340
all right, I gotta get you home cause
I gotta go shopping for your birthday.

876
00:52:34,341 --> 00:52:37,880
Like the, how's that supposed to make me
feel? I'm sitting there like, uh, okay.

877
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:41,990
This is why. This is why I did that.
Because you emailed me something.

878
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:46,160
I knew you wanted this shit. Okay. Now
if I just went out and got it for you,

879
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,950
I mean, why don't you just fucking,
even when the, when the mailman comes,

880
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,650
he hands it to me and then I throw
it at you. When you're sitting there,

881
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,180
it takes no fucking
imagination whatsoever, right?
So I knew you wanted it.

882
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,740
I knew I was going to get it for you,
but I'm like,

883
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,590
how the fuck is it still a
surprise that she gets it?

884
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,130
So what I did was I
acted like I wasn't an,

885
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:06,560
I already knew the other things that
I were going to, I was going to get.

886
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:09,740
I knew where the hell they were.
I waited to the last second to get it.

887
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,540
She thought I was like a an unthoughtful
jackass and it worked in his life.

888
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,550
Fucking sharp.
Why would you buy?

889
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:21,320
Why would you make yourself seem like
you know a last minute jackass like that?

890
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:24,110
Like why would it just to torture me
and I'm telling you what torturing me

891
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,330
because you cannot just give me the
gift and be like, here you go, honey.

892
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,720
You have to have some other little
thing where you throw me off my game.

893
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,020
You give me all in a tizzy
and then it's like, oh wait,

894
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:37,360
he actually did the perfect thing.
Why? Why do you play those songs?

895
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,740
That's exactly what type of things that
you accuse women of doing and you do it

896
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:45,630
to me all the time. This is why,
because when I don't do that,

897
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,260
you get exactly what I'm going to
get you and it's fucking annoying.

898
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,680
Fucking and I wrapped something.
You already know what's in it.

899
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,210
You make me feel like an idiot.
Why do you feel like it?

900
00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:00,330
Just cause I guess what it is. Guess your
peak. You look that time when I came,

901
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:04,770
when I went Christmas shopping.
Oh my God, yes we are.

902
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,500
Yes we are told you not.

903
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,040
See what you brought up is when you know
you're going to bring up a good point

904
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:13,380
with your woman and she immediately
starts trying to talk over you.

905
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,980
I do the same thing. Yes, he too.
So I'm pulling up in the car.

906
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:20,070
You knew I was going Christmas shopping
for you. I'm getting out of the car.

907
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,700
I opened the hatch back to our
sweet, innocent little hybrid. Right.

908
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,860
I take the bag out that has the name of
the fucking store and I glanced and I

909
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:33,870
glance over at the house and you're
standing there like a specter looking out

910
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:38,280
the window. My fucking heart. My
heart like jolted. When I looked up,

911
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,640
you know you had a
creepy look on your face.

912
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,930
You were doing something sneaky. No you
weren't. And then you didn't see me.

913
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:49,350
Can I show you? Can I show you what you
were doing? All right, fine. This is,

914
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,630
this is what you were doing.
I looked when I,

915
00:54:52,631 --> 00:54:54,930
I'm looking at the house and I
look up and you would like this.

916
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,190
Nobody can see me.

917
00:54:58,191 --> 00:55:01,560
So what you're sitting there looking
like some weird like stalkers.

918
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:04,680
That's what you were doing. No,
I did it. Yes. As you were doing,

919
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,660
you're a spoiled Brat and you,
you,

920
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:11,520
you wanted to see what was in the
spoiled Brat. Alright, you're spoiled.

921
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:16,200
He's spoiled me. Oh God.
Blaming the victim once again.

922
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,800
Now here's the deal.
No, that's why I did it.

923
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,830
I like to try to surprise you. If I'm
going to spend all my fucking money on,

924
00:55:24,831 --> 00:55:28,950
on some goddamn thing here, I
want you to, I, I want, I want

925
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,160
to throw how much money it
costs for you to get in my face.

926
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,040
You didn't have to say how much it costs
just by saying, if I'm going to say,

927
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:41,100
am I really gonna lose this? I'm not
going to lose this one. It's my birthday.

928
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:45,870
It's like, oh yeah. Oh my God.
All right, let's go. Let's because

929
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:51,210
yeah, because it's like a sport for you
to figure out what the fuck I got you.

930
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:55,140
It's annoying. I never tried it for
you to always throw me off my game.

931
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,330
You know it's a sports for me
teaching you how to use a microphone.

932
00:55:57,331 --> 00:56:01,920
Just talk into it. Oh, okay. There you
go. You couldn't hear me before. Well,

933
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:04,080
I hear you and then you're over here.
No,

934
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,690
you only go over here when
you're mentoring somebody
else. That's what you do.

935
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,800
Or when you go lady. There
you go. That's all it is.

936
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:14,220
That's the mic technique. There you go.
All right, we're going to talk NBA here.

937
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:19,200
Nini, the NBA, the NBA National
Basketball Association.

938
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:24,400
A professional league. Now with
basketball, I know what it's like. Soccer.

939
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,080
You use your hands but not your feet.
You can't kick the ball. It's reversed.

940
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,740
Soccer. I'm swearing when I'm going to
possibly know about the MBA. But anyway,

941
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:35,950
let's, let's go ahead and read it. Well,
I mean I have to read the questions here.

942
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:36,900
Okay,
there's,

943
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:42,020
there's no penalty and just tapping out
on what NBA bill not asking you to ran

944
00:56:42,631 --> 00:56:46,030
for 20 minutes on this. Cause I know
not everyone cares about basketball,

945
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:48,250
but seriously,
the NBA,

946
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,640
the NBA is so rigged. How can announcers
and former players not be up in arms?

947
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:58,300
Lebron got three files in the
first quarter. I Hate Lebron,

948
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,310
but Christ's let's have a fair game.

949
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:04,390
I think the trick is to watch shitty
teams and hope shitty teams make it to the

950
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:05,110
playoffs.

951
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:09,670
So there's no incentive to
Suede the momentum if the
raptors played the jazz and

952
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:13,540
the championships.
There's no superstars, uh,

953
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:17,650
help or to help or to penalize
it. Yeah, I mean I think it's,

954
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:22,510
look at any sport, the top players
definitely get preferential treatment.

955
00:57:22,511 --> 00:57:26,530
I mean there's the Tom Brady rule is,
there's all kinds of shit that goes on,

956
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:29,410
but I just, you know, that's
one of those ones where look,

957
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:33,780
I mean they make more money
if it goes more games. I, I,

958
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:38,020
I just feel like I've already
said what I said. Okay.

959
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:41,800
I'm not going to keep reiterating it
either you believe it or you don't.

960
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,730
I know for years, I said it was fixed
and then they found a mobbed up ref,

961
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,470
you know,

962
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:52,470
who was actually fixing games and fuck
the Sacramento Kings out of a series

963
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:55,330
against the Lakers and the Lakers
went on to win a championship.

964
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:59,230
They literally affected who the fuck won
the championship that year or this guy

965
00:57:59,231 --> 00:58:03,370
did. And then everybody,
when I was vindicated and I
was right just when lag. Ah,

966
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,160
it was just one guy.
It's just one guy.

967
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:11,190
I think it's in their best interest to
have the stars of the big teams in the

968
00:58:11,261 --> 00:58:15,580
finals and for it to go
more than four games. Okay.

969
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:19,210
And I think, you know, those
reps get paid by the game,

970
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:23,860
those fuck in arenas,
you know, more games,

971
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:28,930
more concession, more tickets,
more commercial, more money. So,

972
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:32,980
and I think that, uh, that plays a fucking
roll consciously or subconsciously.

973
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:36,360
I'm not saying that they sit down, I
just think that it's fucking, I just, I,

974
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,200
my thing I'm done saying it's fixed.

975
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:41,590
I'll just say that the reps have way
too much power and they have to stop

976
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:45,370
dictating the tempo of the game. I
would like the players, you know,

977
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,830
I would rather have that.
All right. There we go.

978
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,540
But either way don't blow in Lebron's
ear even though that was funny as fucking

979
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:55,340
hell. Did you see that? This guy on a,

980
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,530
on the fucking Pacers,
I forget his name and not a big hoop guy.

981
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,800
He blew in the bronze. Yeah,
there was sitting there.

982
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,780
I think they were both sitting there.

983
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:06,370
You know when you get
your hands on your knees,

984
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:09,910
I don't know if they're waiting for the
jump ball or something and he was sort

985
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:13,810
of not quite perpendicular to the side
of Lebron's face, but he just sorta went

986
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:20,080
right into his ear. And what was funny
was it took Lebron for like half a second.

987
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:22,250
Then he sort of smile
and shook his head like

988
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:26,330
so it didn't have the desired effect or
he was hoping he was going to get like

989
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:28,340
when will Smith slap
that guy who kissed him?

990
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:33,890
I think he was trying and then get
him off his game. Lebron James. Well,

991
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:36,800
I mean he's like a,
he's like a fucking x man out there.

992
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:39,380
The guys that Goddamn Superhero,
although I got to tell you,

993
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,300
I get so turned off by the NBA.

994
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:44,420
I don't understand what all this screaming
and yelling is after of you make a

995
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:48,950
basket. What do you mean
screaming you like they're
excited. Like they're like, no,

996
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:52,490
like they're mad at somebody.
You can't see the yelling.

997
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:54,170
Just looking at the crowd yelling.

998
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,900
Lebron James took the ball when coast
to coast like I've seen my entire life.

999
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,090
He's not the first guy
to go coast to coast.

1000
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:07,270
He dunks the ball and when he's done he
first walks and he starts glaring at the

1001
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:12,420
crowd and then he's going all
the way up to sideline. No,

1002
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,880
I mean what he's saying is he just
like all hyped and like, yeah.

1003
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:23,430
Yeah. I like would they always hyped,
which you always hyped. You give,

1004
01:00:23,431 --> 01:00:26,600
you gave a high five.
He's sitting there screaming and yelling,

1005
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,140
thumping his fucking chest. They're out
there acting like that. It's like, dude,

1006
01:00:30,141 --> 01:00:32,630
you put a ball through a hoop.
I know you will.

1007
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:36,110
You're the one of the greatest
to ever fucking did it,
but you, you're not Jordan.

1008
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:41,050
I never saw Jordan do that. He doesn't
have to be Jordan. He's limping on.

1009
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,400
I'm just saying why I don't like it.

1010
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,990
I'm not saying he can't do
it through Kevin Garnett.

1011
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,210
I swear to God it's
like he has Tourette's.

1012
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:51,830
He does any of these walking up to the
line like talking to himself and every

1013
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:52,910
other word is fuck.

1014
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:58,130
You can clearly see that the guy say
and fuck and I don't understand why.

1015
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:02,720
It's just, it's, it's bizarre. Every other
word out of your mouth as fuck, you know,

1016
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:04,820
but I'm not on fucking T.
Oh, I guess I am on TV.

1017
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:09,350
Yes you are on TV and oh
no, no, no, no, no. That's,

1018
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:10,640
I'll tell you why this is different.

1019
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:14,960
That would be like if I told a joke
and then it killed and as the crowds

1020
01:01:14,961 --> 01:01:17,330
laughing and applauding, I
was standing up there, go

1021
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,240
to the show.
It's stupid.

1022
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,620
I just do your job and shut the fuck up.
It's stupid.

1023
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:32,560
That's the difference. All
right. That's, and that's why my,

1024
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:37,490
my thing is I can't like,
like your,

1025
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,230
your applauding yourself.

1026
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:43,220
You're more if I can't even get to the
level of amazement that they are about

1027
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:46,460
themselves. That's what turns
me off about the fucking game.

1028
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,710
You ever read catcher in
the Rye, Nia? Oh my God.

1029
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,230
Fucking catcher in the Rye analogy,
you always make. I'll tell you why,

1030
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,390
because the catcher in the rye,

1031
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,660
that's that dead fucking thing when
he sees that great piano player,

1032
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:01,670
but the guy knows he's great
and he's making that face,

1033
01:02:01,671 --> 01:02:04,010
that Ge Smith thing and
it's just like, yeah, dude,

1034
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,450
you're up your own ass right now.

1035
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:08,370
You don't need me and I'm not going to
sit there and watch your fucking Jerky

1036
01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:11,540
self off after you just did something
that a bunch of other people have already

1037
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,370
fucking done.
It drives me.

1038
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,050
It drives me fucking nuts and all I know
is that little kids see it now and then

1039
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:18,820
they're going to be doing that.

1040
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,900
Even go on a little kid's games and
they've got to fucking take like a diaper

1041
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:23,250
shot. Then he'd go, yeah,

1042
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,470
high pitch voice coach on the fucking
thing and I'm going to say they're going

1043
01:02:27,471 --> 01:02:28,720
to want,
I'm going to want to throw a hotdog.

1044
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,450
Them really are an old fogy now with your
complaining about how these young kids

1045
01:02:32,451 --> 01:02:35,750
go out there and they're thumping their
chest and they're just go out there and

1046
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:39,200
do your job. Yeah, I mean I look,
there's definitely an element of that.

1047
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:43,160
I'll even take 60% of that, but 40% of
it as I'm writing. What are you doing?

1048
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:47,420
I never, Magic Johnson never did
that shit. Jordan didn't do it,

1049
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:50,930
but they talk shit to each
other occasionally. You know,

1050
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,960
there'd be a second you didn't turn
around glare at the crowd like,

1051
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:56,660
like,

1052
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,520
like you just fucking diff
painted somebody on planet
Krypton and then fucking

1053
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:05,130
go down the side, scraped
up, screaming and yelling.

1054
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,220
That's where the camera's though
with this crazy. Maybe it's,

1055
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:11,370
maybe it's for the cameras and maybe it's,
you know,

1056
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:15,590
you know when the crazy homeless guy gets
on the subway and just starts yelling

1057
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,810
and then you just look down at the floor,
go and please don't pick me.

1058
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:20,060
Please don't pick me. Don't look
at them. Those are the rules.

1059
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:22,610
They are they doing it for the clips
when they do like the commercials where

1060
01:03:22,611 --> 01:03:25,840
they play the music and stuff and they
show all the clips in the game and they

1061
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:29,090
show the guy's like, yeah, like looking
out at the crowd. Maybe it's for that.

1062
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,940
Of course playing up
to the fucking camera.

1063
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:35,030
They all hang out with each other on
the same fucking yacht and go, hey,

1064
01:03:35,031 --> 01:03:38,420
let's all jump on the same team
and then we'll become a dynasty.

1065
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,880
And then you know,
then the,

1066
01:03:39,881 --> 01:03:43,880
the announcers who make money announcing
the NBA so they're never going to

1067
01:03:43,881 --> 01:03:45,680
criticize it and then
they just say the saved,

1068
01:03:45,681 --> 01:03:50,681
I'll tell you what are you getting a
breath of Magic Johnson aura or Michael

1069
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:56,210
Jordan because they are accomplishing
the same thing on paper,

1070
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,080
but they're not doing what those guys did.
And when those guys did it,

1071
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,100
you did it through the draft and
maybe a blockbuster trait. Okay.

1072
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,490
There was way more cerebral back then.
How you had to put it together, team,

1073
01:04:07,491 --> 01:04:09,740
you had to lean way more
on your fucking scouts.

1074
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:13,490
He didn't have a bunch of players all
jump on the same team and then you jump on

1075
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:15,590
this team.
Okay.

1076
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:21,110
He jumps on this fucking team and becomes
like this three headed fucking monster

1077
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,590
just stopping on all these
other goddamn tea. I mean,

1078
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:27,200
well why don't I just watch it go
fucking go play a bunch of kids,

1079
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,880
a high school team. I mean I know
it's not that bad, but it did that.

1080
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:35,000
That's what's killing
it for me. Okay. Yeah.

1081
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:35,970
You know it was funny.

1082
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:38,780
You're not even a sports fan or whatever
and I said why she called me in for

1083
01:04:38,781 --> 01:04:43,360
this one we've been wanting, I call you
and you said you, I'm on the podcast.

1084
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,020
Yeah, cause I know I am wanting to
talk about other things. Not the NBA.

1085
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:54,010
All right. Office bitch. Oh is
that it? Is that a good one? I,

1086
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:57,880
it sounds like something that you would
want me to just because it has bitch in

1087
01:04:57,881 --> 01:05:01,150
it. Like, oh, that's good.
A ladies a billion in here.
Okay. What is it saying? Well,

1088
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:04,690
this is how long you were unbelievable.
I just did the NBA. That's a guy topic.

1089
01:05:04,691 --> 01:05:08,680
You didn't like that one. So now I'm
giving you a lady talking to add this one.

1090
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,250
I want to hear this one. I'm
with you. I'm like, yeah,

1091
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,350
you didn't sound like you
were you selling, get back
pedaling. Okay. All right.

1092
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:18,490
This guy writes Billy Parmesan
and then writes Palmer. John like,

1093
01:05:18,491 --> 01:05:22,000
I don't know how to read.
Yeah. Why? What do I say?

1094
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:26,210
Tommy John as John [inaudible] permission,

1095
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:27,580
the lead farmers.
John,

1096
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:32,581
I'm Italian and very much so at that I
speak Italian and I'm first generation

1097
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:37,690
Italian. Ciao. This guy,
Italian prego. Prego. Vino Vino.

1098
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,450
I work with the girl who
claims she's Italian,

1099
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,010
but she really isn't at all
Hashtag Middle Easter. Um,

1100
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:47,560
I mean, how does he, oh, I mean,

1101
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:51,290
her grandmother may have
fucked a Sicilian. Oh.

1102
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:55,810
Or She's all of garden Italian,
you know, less than one 16th.

1103
01:05:55,811 --> 01:06:00,260
Italians are not fucking around about
who's Italian. It's not, it's high.

1104
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:03,040
And then if you're Cecelia, that's
like a different thing. Yeah.

1105
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,450
You guys don't play with that.

1106
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:08,080
They don't fuck around the same way gas
monkey does not fuck around when they

1107
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:12,400
build a car. I told them that story
right in Casey's truck. Jesus Christ. Um,

1108
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:16,150
anyways, in the office,
she's constantly, uh,

1109
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:19,880
calling me and a few other Italians,
guineas and Gumbos.

1110
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,490
She says it like she's one of us and
most times in a manner that really forces

1111
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:28,990
it into the conversation. Like, hey,
Gainey's don't grease up my stapler.

1112
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:33,220
Now I'm not completely insulted,
but the catch is she's black.

1113
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:38,140
A year ago she complained to the human
resources that a coworker who had

1114
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:42,640
listened to rap music on his headphones
at lunch would mouth lyrics that weren't

1115
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:44,500
meant for him, I. E. The n word.

1116
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,300
There really is no proof that even mouth
the words because he sat facing the

1117
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:54,040
wall and all she knew was that he was
listening to Jay z's new album at the time

1118
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:58,030
and assumed he mouths all the words,
none of which were audible by the way.

1119
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:01,340
Um, how do you know this
if you weren't there? Um,

1120
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,370
so one day last week she was calling
us dumb guineas and asked if my friend

1121
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:11,050
Leonardo yes, that is his name. If
he could ring out his hair over her.

1122
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:17,370
Oh my God. Cause the place she ordered
from didn't give her enough dressing.

1123
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:21,150
The Garner Salad. Wow. Wow. That
is a funny joke though. If you're,

1124
01:07:21,151 --> 01:07:23,860
if you're cool with somebody,
that's fucking hilarious. Uh,

1125
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,870
the funny thing because those are the
rules hardly offensive if you're not,

1126
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,510
if you're not. Yeah. Cause that's
one of the things if your friends,

1127
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,040
if someone was,
you know,

1128
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:35,340
some Italian guy was breaking my balls
would being a pasty freckled cunt.

1129
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,520
And then I came up with that ring your
hair out over the salad. I mean that's,

1130
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,880
that's fucking, I might have him for the
week. You'd have to come back with the,

1131
01:07:41,881 --> 01:07:45,690
I don't know what the funny thing about
the situations that Leo doesn't have

1132
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:47,430
greasy hair at all.
Oh yeah.

1133
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:50,490
I mean it's a huge stretch
of a joke and a stereotype.

1134
01:07:50,491 --> 01:07:52,350
It's hacky and not even insulting.

1135
01:07:52,351 --> 01:07:55,500
The insulting part is that
she thinks nothing of it.

1136
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:57,720
I know what you're going to say.
This is one of those things.

1137
01:07:57,721 --> 01:08:00,390
You just got to let go. But I
didn't, I stood up and said, listen,

1138
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:04,650
you're not Italian if you're Italian
than I'm black because I'm Sicilian and

1139
01:08:04,651 --> 01:08:07,650
we've all heard the true romance speech.
That was the end of it.

1140
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,710
Did I handle that right? Cause I sure as
hell wasn't going to let myself become,

1141
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:16,010
I'm an HR whore. Uh, thanks
for listening. Um, I think

1142
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,870
you did the right thing because
I know you don't want,

1143
01:08:19,871 --> 01:08:21,250
why don't you go first name?
What do you, what do you think?

1144
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:26,160
No, I actually think he did
the right thing to, cause
the girl says she's Italian,

1145
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:30,240
but you say she's black,
but like dis meaning like she looks black,

1146
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:35,241
like she looks like me or like she's
actually has said I am black and Italian

1147
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:38,790
because maybe she's biracial or whatever.

1148
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:43,140
So I mean the whole thing about
she's not really Italian, Duh Duh.

1149
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,230
That's why I was laughing at
how Italians are very, you know,

1150
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,530
protective about who can say
they're Italian and who was not.

1151
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:53,400
So she might be biracial. Right.
But the thing about it is, you know,

1152
01:08:53,401 --> 01:08:58,200
in this country they have that whole like,
what is it, the one, eighth, whatever,

1153
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:00,030
drop paper bag test,

1154
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,420
all that kind of shit where it's like if
you've got a drop of black blood in you,

1155
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:06,480
you're black. That's the way
it's considered in this country.

1156
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:07,950
That's the way it was set up in America.

1157
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:11,340
So maybe that's why you're feeling like
you're not even Italian, you're black.

1158
01:09:11,341 --> 01:09:13,680
So that all aside. Yeah, for her,

1159
01:09:13,681 --> 01:09:16,920
I'm making a joke saying like dumb
guineas and Goombas and stuff.

1160
01:09:16,921 --> 01:09:19,350
Like if you're offended by it,
you should definitely tell her.

1161
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,040
I'm offended by that. I know you said
that you were Italian, but I just,

1162
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:26,670
I find that kind of speech,
you know, offensive,

1163
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:30,300
so please don't say it around me. I don't
like that. And I think that is better.

1164
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:33,300
I had to think it is better to confront
the person then running off to HR.

1165
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:38,460
You know the whole thing with the guy
mouthing the lyrics, the Jay z's album,

1166
01:09:38,461 --> 01:09:42,210
and he was facing the wall like,
listen. Yeah, unless you were there.

1167
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,430
I mean he probably had a
conversation with this guy.

1168
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,960
That's why he's coming at like that.

1169
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:50,060
She said I was melting the n word and
she couldn't even see me. I used to too.

1170
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,040
I mean, but is a, here's the thing.
Here's the thing. This is the only sheet.

1171
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:56,550
This is the deal. She
sounded a little nuts, right?

1172
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,210
And this thing,
all those jokes are funny.

1173
01:09:59,211 --> 01:10:03,590
If it's done the right way and she's not
doing it the right way. And if she look,

1174
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:07,280
I think if she came to this guy and
said, hey, I'm whatever, one, eighth,

1175
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:08,690
Italian or whatever,

1176
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:14,100
and talked about Italians
in a respectful way, um,

1177
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:18,680
that this guy would embrace her, that
she would, that she, her Italian blood,

1178
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:21,020
and then they would have
this bond where he'd be like,

1179
01:10:21,021 --> 01:10:24,590
oh that's the Italian in you see I knew
blah blah. If you come at them that way,

1180
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:26,970
if you start going, hey,
if you day go fuck good,

1181
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,350
right, right. Quick Grecian up the
floors, all the whole thing about,

1182
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:34,220
give me some of your hair cause I
don't have enough. I got to tell you,

1183
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:38,150
layer it the fuck off money. I can't, I
can't read that without laughing. Yeah,

1184
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,050
it's fine. It's fine. But
now it's, it's, it's wrong.

1185
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:42,720
I'm going to say that especially if she's
going to turn around and be upset that

1186
01:10:42,721 --> 01:10:46,740
someone's listening to rap music in their
headphones and Malbec word that don't,

1187
01:10:46,741 --> 01:10:51,300
boards that aren't four years.
Yeah. JC, we'll take JC,
we'll take your white money.

1188
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:55,140
You'll take your white money. Those
lyrics are not for, you know this,

1189
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,383
I will,

1190
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,370
you and all your friends can
finance my next big purchase.

1191
01:11:00,371 --> 01:11:04,000
But these lyrics are not for you.
What is the rule on that?

1192
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:08,020
Can a white guy in his car can sing log?

1193
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:09,390
Yeah,

1194
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,710
right to the rap music.

1195
01:11:10,711 --> 01:11:14,310
I'm not going to tell you what
are alone when I'm not there.

1196
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,600
I can't. What do, what is,

1197
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:20,310
what would you say as an African American
is the protocol if you're singing

1198
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:22,050
along? I mean, it's just a song, you know,

1199
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:27,051
sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy.

1200
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,560
Are you allowed to say the end of the
front end, but then what? Rap Song?

1201
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,100
So somebody has already singing a
song. Okay. You're on a bus, right?

1202
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:39,300
It's a terrible day for your knee. You're
on a bus. Oh, Jesus. What are you going?

1203
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:43,170
What happened? Um, as long as I'm
not in the back, I'm all right. Um,

1204
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:49,060
so somebody's got their little
fucking iPod on right? Or phone thing,

1205
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,440
whatever. Right. And they're
singing to the songs, right?

1206
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:55,650
And the first song they sing it is that,
you know,

1207
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:59,220
sunshine on my show and you laugh and
like wow, this guy is singing out loud,

1208
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:01,350
he's singing off key.
You kind of laughing to yourself,

1209
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:05,310
but he's got his iPod on shuffle.
Okay.

1210
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,890
And then the next one
is that Wu Tang Song,

1211
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,730
right? And he's singing
along to old dirty bastard,

1212
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:17,120
tried to run game on a WHO's buck wild
and he starts singing along with that.

1213
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,070
I think you should do it
just the way you did it.

1214
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:24,460
Do it the way I feel like the silent
listen when I went to go see Jay z would

1215
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,130
you get mad? No, but at this, this is
a good example of that. Once it goes,

1216
01:12:30,131 --> 01:12:33,210
see Jay Z and Kanye the watch
the throne at the staple center,

1217
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:38,580
you know the whole stadium arena full
of people, all black, white, whoever,

1218
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:44,240
and everybody was singing along to all
the songs and it wasn't in the context of

1219
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:47,280
it. It was like, yeah, cause it's not like
the white people are going to be like,

1220
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:49,380
Ooh, I can't. It's like
we're all singing along.

1221
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:51,570
It's all enjoying the
music is not a big deal.

1222
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,770
So if there's a big crowd of people
singing the n word, like is it different

1223
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:01,020
than the white person who's like trying
to show you how down they are and

1224
01:13:01,021 --> 01:13:05,160
they're like all in your, what do
you call it again? Appropriating the,

1225
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:08,760
what do you call it? Oh, cultural
appropriation. Yeah. Yeah.

1226
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:11,460
If you're like a white person that was
like, yeah, I'm down for my niggas.

1227
01:13:11,461 --> 01:13:13,620
You know how we need to do with it and
I'm going to look at you like you're

1228
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:14,520
fucking crazy.

1229
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:19,970
I want to do that tomorrow
because you know it, it's,

1230
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,350
it's,
it's ridiculous for you to do that.

1231
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:25,950
But it used to shock me in New York
when I would hear these kids that were

1232
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:30,960
seemingly, now I'm like the guy that
wrote in, not black but like Latina, like,

1233
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:32,970
you know, Dominican or
Puerto Rico, Puerto Rican,

1234
01:13:32,971 --> 01:13:35,250
and they call themselves
Niggas all the time.

1235
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,000
And I wasn't aware of that when I first
moved to New York. So I was like, what?

1236
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,520
And then I just realized he had made,
they do that too.

1237
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:42,750
I remember that it was okay for them.

1238
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:48,060
I remember when I was at in and out
Burger [inaudible] sitting outside the one

1239
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:53,380
on a sunset boulevard and I was
sitting there and there was this dude,

1240
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:58,180
I think he was Mexican, which once again
he's probably Middle Eastern. They get,

1241
01:13:58,181 --> 01:14:02,530
they get, they get mistook for everything.
Mexicans, no Middle Eastern people.

1242
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,160
Oh yes. It once they, once they
get out of the stereotypical,

1243
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,430
God dammit,
it's 110 degrees out here.

1244
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:12,440
I'm going to wear this robe
thing when they just start, well,

1245
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,610
when they know I'm talking to Middle
Eastern people. Okay. Once they,

1246
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:21,190
once when they were Americanized
fucking clothes, they can go,

1247
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:26,710
oh yeah, cause they're, then they're just
brown. I knew, I knew a guy for years.

1248
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:32,020
I thought he was Italian and it onstage,
he was pretending to be Italian.

1249
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:36,820
Right. And it turned out he
was Lebanese. I had no idea.

1250
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,180
No idea. You had the
fucking, you know what?

1251
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,700
Isn't there another famous comedian who
kind of had an Italian persona and it

1252
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:45,190
turns out he's actually
Jewish. She, I don't know.

1253
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:47,840
Nia Is there are

1254
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:54,070
fucking set me up here.
All right, let's go to a,

1255
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,660
here we go.
A dear Billy goat.

1256
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,100
I was listening to old
some old podcasts and a,

1257
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:02,350
you are sharing your feelings
on movies you'd recently seen.

1258
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:07,330
What was the last movie theater experience
you enjoyed? I mean, the movie itself,

1259
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:12,220
not all the necking net that goes on
in the back row. You old bloodhound.

1260
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:16,300
Oh, he's using those old words. Just this
is just him acting like I'm fucking old.

1261
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:21,370
Um, all right. The movie in the
theater all, I probably would,

1262
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:22,181
I would have saw it with you.

1263
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:26,080
I'm not a big wolf was the last one
we saw in the theater. Oh my God.

1264
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:29,500
Which I hated. Hated. Hated. Hated, hated.

1265
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:31,570
I got to tell you this,

1266
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:36,070
it was worth seeing Leonardo's the
actress that played his wife, Jeez,

1267
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:41,050
Margot Robbie. She's gorgeous. She's
Australian. Did you know that? Uh,

1268
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,440
no. I just, you know, oh,
she was like, you know,

1269
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:49,620
what was great about her was she was
totally naked and she's still within that.

1270
01:15:49,621 --> 01:15:53,890
It didn't look dirty. She was just,
she was a goddess. Gorgeous. Okay.

1271
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:58,840
I mean, yeah, when I look at
her. But did you like the movie?

1272
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:00,160
That's what he wants to know.
Was your,

1273
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:05,161
your the last time you were in a movie
and really enjoy the movie itself was uh,

1274
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:07,160
I don't,

1275
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,880
I can't remember what was done in the
movie theater before that because I feel

1276
01:16:09,881 --> 01:16:13,000
like we very rarely go to the
movie theater. I what did,

1277
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:17,350
we must have saw something since then.
Move walls from the walls of Wall Street.

1278
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:21,760
I have to see again why?
Because it can suck another,

1279
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,570
my thesis, it wasn't that
bad. It was definitely law.

1280
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,080
It was too long and it was like
repetitive. It's like I get it.

1281
01:16:29,081 --> 01:16:32,890
These guys are drug taking assholes.
How many more scenes of this do we need?

1282
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:34,781
And it's like,

1283
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:38,470
I appreciate the chemistry between
Leonardo Dicaprio and Jonah Hill,

1284
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:41,110
but it's like, all right,
already he just, you know,

1285
01:16:41,111 --> 01:16:43,960
Scorsese just let the camera
run and run and run and run.

1286
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:48,310
And I will say that some of those
sales meetings, dammit, we're so long.

1287
01:16:48,311 --> 01:16:51,310
I started to feel like I worked at
the company. I thought that they were,

1288
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:53,800
they were kind of, uh, in real time,

1289
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:56,770
they were really trying to hammer home
the fact that these were just these

1290
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,570
underhanded, dirty kind of excessive
eighties guys. And it's like,

1291
01:17:01,571 --> 01:17:02,200
we got it.

1292
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,130
The opening shot was them tossing in
the one we live in this world now.

1293
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:09,620
We get who they are. You know what
I do want to see? I want to see the,

1294
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:14,440
I don't know how to say it
then I say, yeah, let's go.
So I kept saying male, Male,

1295
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:18,800
a fuss. I just kept seeing Malan.
Maleficence that's not a word, right?

1296
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,850
It's the name of the character. It's the
name of the evil queen in Snow White.

1297
01:17:21,851 --> 01:17:25,500
That's her name. Is it Latin for
something? I have no idea. Alright,

1298
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,473
dear Billy goat.

1299
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:31,880
I was listening some old to some old
podcasts and you are a shift. Read that.

1300
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:37,360
Oh, you fucking crazy. I didn't
even, I didn't even realize that. Ps,

1301
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:42,170
I love the x men. He says, and
uh, please remind listeners. Oh,

1302
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,473
oh,

1303
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,030
oh, okay. Hey, this is just my,

1304
01:17:46,031 --> 01:17:50,170
please remind a family listeners that
which family member would you fuck

1305
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:53,770
dilemmas are hacky and won't
make it to the podcast? Yeah.

1306
01:17:53,771 --> 01:17:55,870
Why would you even ask
a question like that?

1307
01:17:56,130 --> 01:18:00,390
Because some people want to have sex with
a fucking family member and they want

1308
01:18:00,391 --> 01:18:04,480
to feel like they're not
alone in this world. They do.
I don't know. All right. Oh,

1309
01:18:04,481 --> 01:18:06,880
they're just doing it's,
I hate those weird leg.

1310
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:11,910
Would you rather fuck your
mother or fuck your dog?

1311
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:17,190
Like what I talked to even
put out a doubt. Well,

1312
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:21,480
depends on the fence on what kind of dog
it is and how much fight does it have

1313
01:18:21,481 --> 01:18:24,030
in it?
A dilemma.

1314
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:28,630
Would you rather give up blow jobs
for the rest of your life or cheese?

1315
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:33,580
Cheesy. Cheesy. Of course you'd
give up. She's absolutely,

1316
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:36,850
I give up cheese at fucking less dairy,
less stomach aches.

1317
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,970
I wouldn't get bound
up. Less bloating. Wait,

1318
01:18:39,971 --> 01:18:42,490
do I get more blow jobs to
doll the cheese I don't eat.

1319
01:18:42,491 --> 01:18:45,880
Does that go into the
more blow jobs he goes,

1320
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:49,870
this includes the fake cheese like
cheese whiz or Mac and cheese. Dude.

1321
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:51,820
I fucking hate that. She's,
that's, that's why I can,

1322
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:55,180
I can never get on board with the Philly
cheese steak that have the whiz on it.

1323
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:00,400
If that stuff, that was the perfect
name for two whiz as an pis.

1324
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:05,680
Like if cheese took a piss, that's
what it is. She's Wiz. She's Biz. Yeah,

1325
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:09,040
it's fucking gross.
I wonder if that's why they call it that,

1326
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:12,760
but maybe it's who do you know what it is?
It's probably some process shit.

1327
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:17,050
Something is scrape it off the top of
the bottom of something. Yeah. You know,

1328
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:18,760
for years we will throw on this out.

1329
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,330
Then we added a little something to it
and all kinds of preservatives and salt

1330
01:19:22,331 --> 01:19:26,170
and stuff so it can stay in that little
aerosol can for that longer than you

1331
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:30,650
live on the food chain. It's below the
hot dog. Cheez whiz. I mean cheese was,

1332
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:34,830
I mean that's like that's there with
fluffer nutter that's in there with like,

1333
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:38,260
I mean cheese fluffer
nutter mellow spread.

1334
01:19:38,261 --> 01:19:41,200
Like it's like yummy toxic waste.

1335
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,110
It's just horrific.

1336
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:48,280
Like that's the kind of shit you
eat and your body is just like,

1337
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:52,600
what the fuck is this? Yeah. Where do
we put this? And it just like that.

1338
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:56,200
It's trans rat shit.
Like it just sticks it wherever.

1339
01:19:56,201 --> 01:20:00,250
It can put it twice to spread
it out through your body.
Yeah. I'm not into Jesus.

1340
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,900
You'll,
you'll never see it in the house.

1341
01:20:01,901 --> 01:20:05,410
It's not something that I'm into so you
don't have to worry about that. Okay,

1342
01:20:05,411 --> 01:20:10,280
good friend. Did you talk Kim
and Kanye is wedding. Alrighty.

1343
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:15,240
What I thought maybe you were talking
about Kim and Kanye is wedding.

1344
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,900
I don't know because I
want to talk about that.

1345
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:21,990
They already bought topical stuff first.
They already have a fucking kid,

1346
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:25,830
you know stupid. What do you
mean? What's stupid about it?

1347
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,620
You already had a kid. What
do you what? So now what?

1348
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:32,220
We're getting married so I
can be like, oh my God. Hey,

1349
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:36,400
I'll soon before all you already
have one. It's dumb. It's dumb.

1350
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,690
You talking about,
I'm saying,

1351
01:20:37,691 --> 01:20:40,500
are you saying that people who leave the
kids shouldn't get married if they're

1352
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,240
not married? No. They should get married.

1353
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:45,450
If they want to but they shouldn't
make a big fucking deal out of it. Oh,

1354
01:20:45,451 --> 01:20:49,260
but this is Kim and Kanye were thought
that was such a waste of a castle there.

1355
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:53,630
Now let's, they had there. They did.

1356
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,330
They do it at first sight.
They had their dinner like they're,

1357
01:20:56,331 --> 01:20:59,050
they're like rehearsal
dinner or whatever ever Psi.

1358
01:20:59,051 --> 01:21:03,930
And then they got married in this old
castle in Florence and I have to say,

1359
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,760
I don't know,
I'm looking at the pictures,

1360
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:09,090
which is hilarious because they're
supposed to be so private and we're not

1361
01:21:09,091 --> 01:21:10,470
selling our pictures everywhere.

1362
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:14,380
People magazine is like practically
a guest at the whole funnel.

1363
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,860
This cell until one and then
all your books. Yeah. Yeah.

1364
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:21,861
Which I'm what do you think they're going
to have to divorce that parliament in

1365
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,183
London,

1366
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:29,850
but I'm looking at the pictures. I got
it. I don't know. I think they look,

1367
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:34,290
they look really happy. It
sounds so cheesy, but it's
true. I'm like, I was good.

1368
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,360
I was very skeptical of it,

1369
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:41,610
but I have to say they look super happy
and I thought I was going to be all I

1370
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:45,990
rolly and all the pictures and the time
smile anymore facet he that's the thing

1371
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:48,150
is smiling and all those pictures they,

1372
01:21:48,151 --> 01:21:52,150
I mean of course it's also for the second
car accident when he got the that that

1373
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,550
the thing going there. Yeah. He
always has like a, the the bitch,

1374
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:01,110
the bitch base, his resting phase is
bitch face. Like when he doesn't move it,

1375
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,170
he's just kinda sitting there. He looks
angry like that. He just has that.

1376
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:05,990
You kind of have it all when he has,

1377
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:08,780
you kind of had that resting
phase where you look pissed off.

1378
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,490
I definitely have that,

1379
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:15,080
but my job doesn't look like it's made
out of like the same jar of like the tin

1380
01:22:15,081 --> 01:22:18,530
man. You're like that. Those rural
robots, the initial ones you make with,

1381
01:22:18,531 --> 01:22:20,510
they just sort of,
he yeah,

1382
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:24,650
but they had is jargon all broken
so it's going to be a little weird.

1383
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,240
Oh that's right.
And then he wrote a song about you,

1384
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:30,560
one of the studio and made a video about
how awesome he was that he was in the

1385
01:22:30,561 --> 01:22:32,030
studio with survives.

1386
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:37,100
That he had a wife that he
had a jaw wired shut. Yeah.

1387
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,120
Oh man, you gotta film this. God,
I can't believe how awesome I am.

1388
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:46,610
That's when I literally started feeling
old is just the absolute fucking just,

1389
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,900
I mean, I don't know if it, cause
everybody started doing yoga or whatever.

1390
01:22:50,901 --> 01:22:55,070
Just the self blowing,
blowing, blowing, blowing.

1391
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:58,820
That's just goes on like where it's just
like [inaudible] people are amazed with

1392
01:22:58,821 --> 01:23:03,350
how fucking amazing they are. The second
they get to that fucking level, I just,

1393
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:06,300
I can't watch it. It's just, it's
gross. You gotta be your, your,

1394
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,090
your own cheerleader though. You know what
I mean? You gotta be your own hype man.

1395
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:14,860
Doesn't mean you gotta be an arrogant
ass. That's very true. Yeah. Look,

1396
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,560
you fucking negative shit. I'm getting
nowhere. I can't do this. Then you got,

1397
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:21,130
fuck this. I've got to do
something positive. I've got
to go to the gym. Come on,

1398
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:23,350
Bill. You can do this, but
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1399
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,330
That doesn't mean I've got
to have a look on my face.

1400
01:23:25,331 --> 01:23:29,230
Like I just conquered a country by
myself and start yelling at people.

1401
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:30,461
This is really,

1402
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:34,960
I just feel like this is kind of ironic
coming from a man whose job it is to

1403
01:23:34,961 --> 01:23:38,470
stand on stage and make people laugh,
which is what I do.

1404
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:42,400
But it's also a part of it is like giving
your own opinions about stuff and sort

1405
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:46,540
of like, you know, this is how I feel.
And of course it's for labs. But I mean,

1406
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:49,480
I'm not saying what you and
Kanye do or they die one stages.

1407
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:53,710
I'm a moron who doesn't
read, who has add, right?

1408
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,890
If you really listened to it,
that's all I'm saying for an hour.

1409
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,400
No one ever thinks that about you though.
No, they just seem angry Leprechaun.

1410
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:03,011
But the thing is,

1411
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:06,070
you know what you're talking about how
he's hyping himself up and he says he's

1412
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:06,820
so awesome.
Like,

1413
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:10,870
apparently at their wedding he
gave this speech and he said like,

1414
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:16,090
Kim is like a work of art
and the Kardashians are
like this amazing brand and

1415
01:24:16,091 --> 01:24:17,050
they're like the future.

1416
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:22,051
He just gave this whole like he is so
into them and her and her family and that

1417
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:26,540
whole amazing brand. That's a compliment.
That's a compliment now. Yeah. Yeah,

1418
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:30,820
he did. And it was saying that right
up there with coachees and yeah,

1419
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:35,140
because of how, but the thing is
though is he, is he completely wrong?

1420
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:40,320
Because they turned her little like z
list status sex tape until like this

1421
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:46,201
million dollar industry to the point
where they're like [inaudible] their

1422
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:51,160
wedding lot. Not saying they're not
successful at it, so their brand is huge.

1423
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:54,880
I'm not saying, I'm not saying
that they're not a huge brand. Oh,

1424
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,140
you're saying they compliment.

1425
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,840
If you're saying it's a weird
thing to say at a wedding,

1426
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:03,160
but then you're complimenting
a family or an amazing brand.

1427
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:08,910
I can see you guys whoring out all
other aspects of your private lives too,

1428
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,090
too will listen.
He,

1429
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:15,460
he himself has said he's not the
greatest speaker. You know what I mean?

1430
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:17,870
Like the way it comes out,
it doesn't always come out the right way,

1431
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:22,630
but for a family who's trying to
be a brand, you know that is a big,

1432
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:23,381
huge compliment.

1433
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:27,820
And I tell you something just got up
and I'm not trying to be a dick here.

1434
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:31,840
Oh God, what do they do?
What exactly do they do?

1435
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,620
Everybody always asks that question.
It's a valid, what do they do?

1436
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:37,000
They have a TV show.

1437
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:42,240
They have various fashion lines and
cosmetics and the whole like sort of like,

1438
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,700
I know what they have. They have retail
store. I know what they have. They do,

1439
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:50,230
what did they run? They do, they do.
They are the faces of their businesses.

1440
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,850
So they are reality stars.

1441
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:56,851
They are reality personalities who have
then transcended the reality genre and

1442
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:02,130
to legitimate million dollar businesses
including clothing and et cetera.

1443
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:06,170
And they, you know, that's in their
spokespeople for various brands. The,

1444
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:08,940
all those pictures of them
come at a Haagen, Dazs dogs.

1445
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,540
We would add around Paris
that they came out of Haagen.

1446
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:15,380
Dazs is paying them for that so they get
money. Just to hold an ice cream cone,

1447
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,440
which I'll take any fucking day
of the week. Take [inaudible].

1448
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,300
You know I can does,

1449
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,950
if they were like Bill Barr hundred
thousand dollars you and your wife come

1450
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:31,400
matter Haagen daas holding an ice
cream now you wouldn't do it though.

1451
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,040
Cause then cause then I then
you become then, then, then,

1452
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:40,960
then everything you say I, I've, I'm,
I'm still of that. I'm still loved that,

1453
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,790
that old school thing

1454
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,090
where,
look

1455
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,341
this,
this was it.

1456
01:26:47,341 --> 01:26:50,330
This was after I've come to this point
as far as what I think selling out,

1457
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:54,740
it's selling out is not
something that the fans decide.

1458
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:58,640
So I shouldn't, I'm not even a fan
of this, but as an observer of them,

1459
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:01,440
I shouldn't say whether they
sold out or not. It's, yeah,

1460
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:06,550
I really think it comes
down to the performer and
basically selling out is when

1461
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:08,150
you don't want to do something,

1462
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:12,170
but you do it anyways because of the
money and then afterwards you feel fucking

1463
01:27:12,171 --> 01:27:16,190
horrible to me. If that's what
you feel like at the end of it,

1464
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:19,940
then, then you, you sold
yourself out. You did.

1465
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,540
I don't think selling
out, doesn't it? You,

1466
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,130
I feel like selling out isn't
even a real thing anymore.

1467
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:29,060
I just feel like that's an antiquated
concept is that I feel like there's no,

1468
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:32,000
the idea of selling out,
I don't,

1469
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,910
I don't feel that it
really truly exist anymore.

1470
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:39,650
There's just different platforms for
artists to make money and you know,

1471
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,020
your time can come and go very quickly.

1472
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,980
So if you can get $100,000 for holding
an ice cream cone and getting your

1473
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:48,860
picture taken, is that really
gonna like keep you up at night?

1474
01:27:48,861 --> 01:27:52,520
Like I can't believe I did
that for the money, you know?

1475
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:55,710
No, I'm not saying it's going to,
I'm not saying it's not going to,

1476
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:59,370
I'm going to say with some people
it is and some people it isn't.

1477
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,630
Yeah, but you're, you're
very, you're, but you are,

1478
01:28:03,631 --> 01:28:08,490
you're very particular about where you
choose to do any kind of advertising and

1479
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:11,340
stuff because you care about stuff
like that. So I understand. Look,

1480
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:15,360
I, I mean I do like
advertising on this podcast.

1481
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:20,190
I'm not against it. I'm not saying
that. I mean love Jesus Christ. To me,

1482
01:28:20,191 --> 01:28:21,540
that's how this whole fucking business,

1483
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,540
I mean I got to advertise for my shows
and that type of thing, but it's,

1484
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,850
it's like anything, it's
like, hey, I like to drink.

1485
01:28:26,851 --> 01:28:30,510
Then there's a point where you've drank
too much and you're making an ass of

1486
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:33,690
yourself. There's there, there
are limits to everything. I'm not,

1487
01:28:33,691 --> 01:28:34,920
I'm not gonna sit here and be like,
oh,

1488
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:38,640
this is like I'm doing this
grassroots thing. I'm not saying that,

1489
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,690
but what I'm saying is like,
just that,

1490
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,370
that whole selling out thing, I
think it still exists, but it's,

1491
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:51,990
it's up to the individual.
So I would never say that somebody,

1492
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:56,730
if I see somebody do a commercial, they
sold out, it would have to come from them.

1493
01:28:57,630 --> 01:29:00,780
It has to come from them where if they
did it and then afterwards they're like,

1494
01:29:00,781 --> 01:29:03,630
oh my, I was in all these great
movies and next thing you know,

1495
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:08,130
I'm standing there doing a cell phone
fucking commercial. And when I saw it,

1496
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:11,850
I just felt like, what did I
do? What did I do to my image?

1497
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:14,620
Because this whole fucking
game, you know, is,

1498
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,110
is constantly trying to stay ahead
so they don't fucking pigeonhole you.

1499
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:23,760
And then also not stepping on a fucking
landmine, which is doing a bad movie.

1500
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:25,260
You are putting out a bad special,

1501
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:28,860
there's all these different landmines
that you try not to step on.

1502
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,270
But um, I def, I think that
there's, there's all this,

1503
01:29:33,271 --> 01:29:37,320
there's definitely ways that you can
sell out, but like the younger me would,

1504
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:39,930
you will, you know, I bonded that whole
Bill Hicks thing of like, you know,

1505
01:29:39,931 --> 01:29:42,900
you do do a commercial,
you're off the artistic role call.

1506
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:46,440
And I was hardcore believe in that.

1507
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:51,180
And then by two, you know,
just getting older and it's
just like, no, look, it's, it,

1508
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:55,470
it all comes down that gets your career.
You do

1509
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,230
what you want. Look, there's
people out there, I mean,

1510
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:00,900
does commercials for
proactive but so do a lot.

1511
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:03,840
It's like did he didn't want and Katy
Perry doesn't want a lot of them do that

1512
01:30:03,841 --> 01:30:04,051
whole,

1513
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:08,580
I had acne and it made me feel really
bad about myself and now I am proactive

1514
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:11,820
and now I'm happy again. And this is the
thing, they can all afford proactive.

1515
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:14,770
So you're basically just going
there to get paid, right.

1516
01:30:14,771 --> 01:30:17,430
And you're going to stand there and
the Holden hall closer up to your face.

1517
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:22,110
Now to me, that would make me want to
go jump off a fucking building. Okay.

1518
01:30:22,111 --> 01:30:25,320
I felt weird when I first started doing
advertising on this thing, but what I,

1519
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:26,850
what I tried to do is
like, oh, at least like,

1520
01:30:26,851 --> 01:30:28,800
I'll try to make these
things fucking funny. But um,

1521
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:34,100
against taking like, you
know, um, advertising, right?

1522
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:37,320
Money, I guess if you really believe
in it, like the shit that I've,

1523
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:41,190
I've read on this stuff, the
stuff that I believe in, right?

1524
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:45,840
I fucking read it. And then if it sounds
fucking stupid of me, Oh, you know,

1525
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,920
it just says one. I do. I just say it's
still, what am I going? I'm just saying

1526
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:54,910
it wasn't, you know, look, it was beyond
Sherry's berries and nature's boxes.

1527
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:58,020
There's some shit that fucking
didn't even make the pot God

1528
01:30:58,030 --> 01:30:59,120
cast.
There was,

1529
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:01,970
there was one thing that I read when I
wasn't even thinking when we go some,

1530
01:31:01,971 --> 01:31:04,430
some fucking banker thing and my buddy,

1531
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:08,300
you know Andrew who puts the whole all
the lists together and everything that I

1532
01:31:08,301 --> 01:31:10,490
read, he was in banking. He said, Bill,

1533
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,460
these guys that trick and people that
are doing this and they're going to fuck

1534
01:31:13,461 --> 01:31:14,121
over you listen to.

1535
01:31:14,121 --> 01:31:17,480
So I immediately took it off and I was
there was supposed to do a three week

1536
01:31:17,481 --> 01:31:21,350
thing and I had read one of them and
I just told my ad lady said, listen,

1537
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:23,360
just take them off.
That first one's a free one up.

1538
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:25,070
They don't have to pay me
but I don't want to read.

1539
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,840
I don't want to read it
cause they know I don't,

1540
01:31:26,841 --> 01:31:29,210
I don't have time to fucking
look at all of those things.

1541
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:34,300
So sometimes I will read something they
don't believe in and then if I'm smart

1542
01:31:35,361 --> 01:31:38,240
enough, when I catch it, as I'm reading
it, I make fun of it. That's what I do.

1543
01:31:38,241 --> 01:31:39,650
I make fun of it and say it's shit.

1544
01:31:39,651 --> 01:31:44,030
And then they get mad and they
yell at me or yell at my Ad Lady,

1545
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:45,980
and then we just go, oh, we're
not going to have fucking,

1546
01:31:45,981 --> 01:31:49,330
you're not gonna be on the podcast then.
It's cool. Which is funny. So I can,

1547
01:31:49,331 --> 01:31:53,780
he can't get fired off your
own podcast. So, um, look,

1548
01:31:53,781 --> 01:31:57,170
I'm not saying that like, you know,
I don't want people to think of that.

1549
01:31:57,171 --> 01:32:00,130
I'm sitting here saying that I'm this
righteous fucking, I'm not saying

1550
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:04,870
that, but there's definitely,
you know, there's,

1551
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:08,920
I, there's always does always
selling out. There's all,

1552
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:13,560
unless you just completely don't give
a fuck you, you never gave a fuck.

1553
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:16,470
And he does like, look at me and pay me.
I'm going to fucking do it. Then. Then I,

1554
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:21,520
I left about selling out and more about
like survival and more about like,

1555
01:32:22,031 --> 01:32:25,210
you know, let me just sort
of hit everything. Well, if
you need the fucking money,

1556
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,020
if you need,
look,

1557
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:29,330
if you're sitting there in a house and
they're going to throw you out and then

1558
01:32:29,331 --> 01:32:30,820
chitchat comes up, says, Hey,

1559
01:32:30,821 --> 01:32:34,300
we want you to wear a thong and go
down a water slide backwards. I mean,

1560
01:32:34,301 --> 01:32:38,170
you've got to sit there and be like,
ah, fuck man, I got to do it. I mean,

1561
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:41,860
I can't be out in the fucking
street. Maybe it's not their
first choice, you know,

1562
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:46,390
be paid by Haagen daas again,
but, but he's also, they're
also having a, you know,

1563
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:50,450
a wedding or whatever and
written Versailles and that's
just gotta be paid for.

1564
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:54,250
But listen, so Haagen daas paid
for that. Look, I'm not saying,

1565
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,990
I'm not saying that, that if
you do that, you sold out.

1566
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:01,300
But I'm not saying that if you do it,
you didn't.

1567
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:04,690
It all depends on the
person after they did it,

1568
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:09,430
after they fucking did it.
How did they feel if they
thought, fuck, that was great,

1569
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:12,100
that was easy money, blah, blah,
blah, and they continue on,

1570
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,470
then I don't think they
sold themselves out.

1571
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:17,740
I really think at this point in my
life, I feel like selling out is, is,

1572
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:22,720
is a personal thing and as much as fans
will accuse of you are a person of it or

1573
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:24,610
whatever,
um,

1574
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,260
that it's just speculation because it
really comes down to the person like,

1575
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:30,910
like a lot of musicians now.

1576
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:34,630
I mean because the whole
star making thing went away.

1577
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:38,040
There is no MTV, there is
no videos, there isn't,

1578
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:42,940
there aren't these labels in the CD
stores now. It really is on your own.

1579
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,670
It, you know, back in the day
when I was growing up, if, if,

1580
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:50,140
if your music was in a car
and it was in any commercial,

1581
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,040
you are a fucking seller
and like that really,

1582
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:55,930
like people would just say
he's a fucking sell out.

1583
01:33:55,931 --> 01:33:57,170
He took the corporate buck and all that.

1584
01:33:57,171 --> 01:34:02,171
It was a really thing because there was
all these other ways I think then where

1585
01:34:02,741 --> 01:34:04,510
you could,
you could still be this big person,

1586
01:34:04,511 --> 01:34:09,511
but now be like this pure
artists uncorrupted by the
system that you're trying

1587
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:13,360
to get into. And that's kind of the
whole fucking point of it. Not, it's not.

1588
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:15,820
See now that I disagree
with it, I just, I just,

1589
01:34:15,821 --> 01:34:19,750
I disagree with that because what you're
saying is either you're a fucking horse

1590
01:34:19,810 --> 01:34:24,440
sucking dick or you're this
lonely bastard rather than that,

1591
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,890
then then you can be in a
healthy fucking relationship.

1592
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:29,350
There's plenty of people that look this,
plenty of people that,

1593
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,170
that are in this business and they,
they just do their movies.

1594
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:34,480
So they just do their TV show.
This is zillion people that,

1595
01:34:34,481 --> 01:34:35,860
and you don't see them going,
like,

1596
01:34:35,861 --> 01:34:38,680
I'll tell you and I come home
from work and I want to relax.

1597
01:34:38,681 --> 01:34:42,180
I fucking Blahblahblahblahblah this.
Plenty of people that don't do that.

1598
01:34:42,181 --> 01:34:45,610
Now I'm not saying that there are any
better than the people who decide like,

1599
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:48,150
yeah, fuck it. I'll take
the money to go to a pro,

1600
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,750
actually liked that product or whatever.
Uh, I'm really saying that it's,

1601
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,660
it's an individual. It's an
individual thing. All right,

1602
01:34:55,661 --> 01:34:59,980
how you want to be perceived,
you know,

1603
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:02,840
how you want to go about this business.
And I think the more that people do it,

1604
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:06,600
the less, um, the, uh, the,

1605
01:35:06,601 --> 01:35:08,240
the less it's going to
have like that stigma.

1606
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:11,330
Like you see a lot of these
movie stars that are on doing it.

1607
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,630
The commercials now it's
because people stole movies.

1608
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:17,720
So right now basically the
only movies that they make,

1609
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,070
it's this shrinking puddle.

1610
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:22,110
The only movies that they make now are
either those hundred zillion dollar

1611
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:26,000
transformer Godzilla things where even
though they're going to be on a pirate

1612
01:35:26,001 --> 01:35:27,350
bay,
um,

1613
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:31,910
people still will hopefully want to get
the experience or it's going to be a low

1614
01:35:31,911 --> 01:35:36,020
budget thing. The thing that got killed
was the 30, 50, 60, $80 million movie.

1615
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:38,950
Those things are gone.
Not totally be a view.

1616
01:35:38,951 --> 01:35:42,500
You get like a Martin Scorsese behind
it. You can get the thing made, but like,

1617
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:45,620
like I don't have the exact numbers.

1618
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:48,550
I was talking to my agent about
this because I'm seeing a lot,

1619
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,170
I'm seeing a lot of movie stars all of
a sudden going back to doing stand up.

1620
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:55,460
I'm seeing a lot of them do like, like uh,
commercials and all that type of thing.

1621
01:35:55,461 --> 01:35:57,860
It isn't necessarily because they want to.

1622
01:35:58,070 --> 01:36:03,070
It's because the business has changed
and is going in the direction of the,

1623
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:05,710
uh, of, of, of the music.

1624
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:09,600
Yeah. So then to that end, and they,

1625
01:36:09,601 --> 01:36:13,020
I don't think they can be accused
of selling out either, you know,

1626
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:15,420
because of everything that you
said. I don't think you can, you can

1627
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,280
choose anybody of selling out,

1628
01:36:17,281 --> 01:36:21,270
but the only person who knows I
feel is the person who did it.

1629
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:24,660
If afterwards when you fucking,
you've walked out of there,

1630
01:36:24,661 --> 01:36:27,960
if you felt like you needed a
shower, if you just, you know,

1631
01:36:27,961 --> 01:36:31,680
you sit in there and drag fucking
whatever the fuck you're doing,

1632
01:36:31,681 --> 01:36:36,030
whatever job it is that you're
doing. Um, and believe me,

1633
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:37,140
I've had those,

1634
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:42,310
I feel like it affects people's
brands are images in that way anymore?

1635
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:47,270
Like I just don't, I don't either. I
don't either. People thought like Kanye,

1636
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:49,130
even getting involved
with Kim Kardashians,

1637
01:36:49,131 --> 01:36:52,940
let alone marrying her and singing the
praises of her and her family was going

1638
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:57,410
to like destroy his fan base and
no, no way. It's not happening.

1639
01:36:57,411 --> 01:36:59,540
If anything,
it's make it even bigger.

1640
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:00,463
Here's one for you.

1641
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,530
This is how much this business has changed
with the perception back in the day.

1642
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:07,100
If you are a movie star, you are a
movie star and you did not do TV.

1643
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,620
That was considered a major fuck up.

1644
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:12,890
I mean you could start in the business
too when your commercials and then once

1645
01:37:12,891 --> 01:37:15,950
you got to the TV level of something,
it was really hard when you're a TV star,

1646
01:37:15,951 --> 01:37:18,860
like they won't even look, oh you though.
People see you on TV, you are this,

1647
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:22,400
you are that, you know, you're a
commercial actor, you're a movie star,

1648
01:37:22,401 --> 01:37:26,750
you're a TV star. And then over the
years it started to like, you know,

1649
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,070
I mean it was in when it was still,

1650
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:31,790
it was an amazing thing back in the day
when a guy like Bruce Willis went from

1651
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:36,290
moonlighting and then he did die hard
and all of a sudden he was this fucking

1652
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:40,460
movie star. I mean that
was, that was like, that was
still an amazing thing to do.

1653
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:45,290
And now it's like people jump back
and forth, which I think is, um,

1654
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:50,240
is a cool thing. But way back in the day,
it's my who is, who is that? Who is that?

1655
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:55,240
Um, that that actor and actress
we went, um, will going,

1656
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:55,980
went to that party

1657
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,580
and turned out she had lived around the
corner I African American actress from

1658
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:03,150
like the thirties or forties
dated that fucker. Yeah.

1659
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:05,580
Now she dated this guy or married this,

1660
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:10,640
this white dude who had a fucking
supper club and he marries her in his

1661
01:38:12,151 --> 01:38:16,350
convincing her that she should go
down there as a movie star in Sing,

1662
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:20,100
add his supper club in Hollywood.
That is not going to be filmed.

1663
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:24,510
Nobody's going to see it. And all of
our friends begged her, don't do that.

1664
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,790
That's going to kill your
fucking movie career.

1665
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:31,560
If you as a movie star are seen
singing in this supper club.

1666
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:34,890
And I'd love for this guy who
turned out to be not a good guy.

1667
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:39,080
She did it and it actually hurt her movie
career. So back then, you know, like,

1668
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,090
like how hardcore those
lines were back then.

1669
01:38:42,091 --> 01:38:46,410
I don't think that that exists anymore,
but I have to tell you though,

1670
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:50,760
there are certain people that I don't
want to see doing a fucking snickers

1671
01:38:50,761 --> 01:38:52,790
commercial or,
yeah.

1672
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:55,980
How did you feel when you signed Joe
Pesci and the snickers commercial?

1673
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:01,590
Joe Pesci.
Well this is in it for like two seconds,

1674
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:05,070
but those things are well written and
the way it is is what they're actually

1675
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:10,030
saying is you're not yourself. So
there's almost this way that they, it's,

1676
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:14,430
it's a really slick way to
get the celebrity in and
out where they, they don't,

1677
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,560
they can just sort of not
have to take a full shower,

1678
01:39:16,561 --> 01:39:20,760
just sorta dab the forehead, take
their bag of money and leave. Look,

1679
01:39:20,761 --> 01:39:24,720
I'm not saying I would never do
one of those, but as a right now,

1680
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:29,070
like I just feel like, uh, I dunno,

1681
01:39:29,071 --> 01:39:32,640
I like telling my jokes and I like
doing the acting gigs that they give me.

1682
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:35,490
And I think that at the end of it all,

1683
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:40,770
you want to have a quality,
you want to have quality.

1684
01:39:40,771 --> 01:39:42,300
And I don't,
and I just always,

1685
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:47,340
I always feel like when something that
comes down the pike that is just a money

1686
01:39:47,341 --> 01:39:50,670
fucking Gig, there's always that, okay,

1687
01:39:50,671 --> 01:39:54,780
I could take this or I could just do a
couple extra weekends a stand up and I

1688
01:39:54,781 --> 01:39:59,220
could make up, you know, some of that
money. And then I don't have that.

1689
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,690
But I mean, we all got our fucking
shit when we were coming up.

1690
01:40:03,691 --> 01:40:07,980
Everybody's got some student films
and shit that you like, that stuff.

1691
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:12,780
I don't count, but I really
feel that, uh, you know,

1692
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:15,750
um, I, but I, at the end of
it, I thought, I, I just,

1693
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:18,540
I just feel it's a personal
thing that like, look, this,

1694
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:21,120
this people who did get sick of
doing the road, and it's like,

1695
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:22,410
I don't want to fucking
go out there anymore.

1696
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,770
I don't want to fucking
deal with the check spots.

1697
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:27,920
I don't want to deal with the
drunks up the show. I just, I just,

1698
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:31,530
I don't want to get her another
fucking airplane. Okay. I've had it,

1699
01:40:31,531 --> 01:40:35,220
the old me wanting to do that, I did
that and I proved that I could do that.

1700
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:39,450
If you want me to go do a
fucking commercial and take
this fucking money and I'm

1701
01:40:39,451 --> 01:40:42,930
a day and a half and it pays my
mortgage for the year, I'll do it.

1702
01:40:42,931 --> 01:40:46,500
And I don't think there's a fucking
thing wrong with that. They go, okay,

1703
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:49,380
I don't think there's anything
wrong with it. They go, unless,

1704
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:54,040
unless afterwards you feel like a filthy

1705
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,760
fucking whore. So, well
for me, like I, yeah,

1706
01:40:57,761 --> 01:41:00,130
and I completely understand
that I think is, for me,

1707
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:03,760
I think I had to sort of come to terms
with the fact that like I am just like a

1708
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:06,220
pop culture.
Like I want to see all that stuff.

1709
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:10,930
So in a way I'm glad that like they're
all out there and their pictures are

1710
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:14,290
being sold to people magazine because
I want to fucking see the wedding.

1711
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:18,280
I want to see like who wins and what
they're wearing and what the castle looked

1712
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:22,210
like and all that kinds of stuff.
How I feel about that show.

1713
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:25,150
That's how I feel about that show.
I find that show depressing.

1714
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,570
I find it unbelievable.
Kardashians.

1715
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:31,030
I find it depressing when they're
dealing with depressing shit.

1716
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:35,650
Otherwise it's like kind of mindless,
mindless entertainment I find.

1717
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:39,010
I find the whole fucking thing.
This stuff with Lamar,

1718
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:44,040
I find that fucker thing walking around
in your expensive shoes and you've,

1719
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:50,640
you've flashy bag and this
whole perception of this
life that you're leading.

1720
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:55,630
I, I find all of that. I
don't know why I look at it.

1721
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:58,450
I find it gross and I
just find it depressing.

1722
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:01,270
I'm not saying that somebody shouldn't
live that life and if that's what makes

1723
01:42:01,271 --> 01:42:04,900
them happy, it makes him happy. Anytime
I've ever gone to those fucking,

1724
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:08,280
that's all. It's inspiring. It's
aspirational. It's just like, it's like a,

1725
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,760
it's a fantasy thing.

1726
01:42:09,761 --> 01:42:13,690
Like everyone wants to sort of live in
a world where they're in a movie or in

1727
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:16,800
their magazine like, you know what I
mean? Like, it's, it's part of like,

1728
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:21,040
like I'll tell you, I'll tell you this
as far as like cars, I fucking love cars.

1729
01:42:21,490 --> 01:42:22,323
Okay.

1730
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:27,370
But I think it's so much more cooler what
they do on those shows where they take

1731
01:42:27,371 --> 01:42:31,000
an old car, you know, like
fast and loud and what they do.

1732
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,820
Cause there's an artistry to that, that
stuff. Did they do everything from the,

1733
01:42:35,821 --> 01:42:39,130
the deciding of this car,
can we bring this thing back to life?

1734
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:44,640
And then just seeing the old technology
and then see what Erin does to upgrade

1735
01:42:44,711 --> 01:42:48,430
it. And then the whole art of Richard
trying to flip the whole thing. I mean,

1736
01:42:48,431 --> 01:42:53,431
that to me is way more compelling than
just going down to the lot being I'm

1737
01:42:53,651 --> 01:42:57,520
super successful. Uh, so
and so has one of those.

1738
01:42:57,521 --> 01:43:01,570
Let me get dad and let me get that in
fucking this color and let me get the

1739
01:43:01,571 --> 01:43:04,390
fucking lambos fucking suicide doors.

1740
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:08,650
And then I'm going to call the Paparazzi
and I'm going to go to where the fuck

1741
01:43:08,651 --> 01:43:10,660
they're at and I'm going
to have decked out,

1742
01:43:10,661 --> 01:43:13,450
head to toe in the sunglass
people paid me to wear it.

1743
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:17,680
And I'm going to step out and then
act like, oh, why are you here?

1744
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:22,540
That shit to me is I find that
gross. Yeah, it's up there.

1745
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:24,540
It's definitely an
element of buttons to it.

1746
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:29,350
There's an art to everything so I'm sure
that there is an art to doing that and

1747
01:43:29,351 --> 01:43:32,170
the fact that like
people are what they are,

1748
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:37,150
they have become successful
just by showing themselves
on TV at not as you said,

1749
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:38,440
not doing anything,

1750
01:43:38,441 --> 01:43:40,930
quote unquote not being actors
or singers or anything like that.

1751
01:43:40,931 --> 01:43:45,931
Just being themselves and they have
built this like sort of empire off of

1752
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:50,920
originally a notorious
thing that happened is I,

1753
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:55,160
is that not impressive? Are you
not entertained? No, no, no.

1754
01:43:55,161 --> 01:43:58,310
I'm not saying what they
did was bad or anything.

1755
01:43:58,311 --> 01:44:01,700
I just personally when I watch it I just
think it's gross. I think it's gross.

1756
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:06,760
That's somebody's daughter and she made
that fucking video and if what they said

1757
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:11,690
was true that her mother like I don't
know if it leaked out and then her mother

1758
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:15,410
did like the most amazing spin job ever.
I think that's,

1759
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:18,100
to me that's what happened.
This thing. Well, the,

1760
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:21,680
I think that that's the story they tell
because a lot of people, how do you know,

1761
01:44:21,681 --> 01:44:24,620
she wasn't like Kim,
get on your knees and suck that deck.

1762
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:29,120
We have to get out of this part of town.
Milton had a sex tape and it didn't,

1763
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:32,810
she didn't sort of go off to become
this thing that, you know her.

1764
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:37,490
Are we talking about talking about
Kim Kardashians she was seeking,

1765
01:44:37,530 --> 01:44:41,120
she might've been the ultimate
anymore. No, no, no. That's irrelevant.

1766
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:44,530
She was the original.
Um,

1767
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:49,550
I'm bringing nothing to the table.
I'm just showing up to these events.

1768
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:55,320
She was the original. Yeah, of course. So
what happens is, is just like, you know,

1769
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:59,750
somebody sets the bar for guitar playing,
somebody comes along and has to,

1770
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:01,160
has to,
I'll do that.

1771
01:45:01,161 --> 01:45:06,161
She set the bar for empty headed skinny
bitch going to a club who's got more

1772
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:10,280
money than she fucking needs. So then
Kim comes along, it's like, well,

1773
01:45:10,281 --> 01:45:15,170
I got to outdo that.
So then metaphorically sucking the dick,

1774
01:45:15,171 --> 01:45:20,120
I will literally suck it
and God help.

1775
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:23,840
But did, she was already famous when
she did it. Yeah. That's the difference.

1776
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:27,800
She was already famous for
doing nothing where Kim became,

1777
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:31,510
wasn't famous for doing nothing and then
became famous for doing nothing. We,

1778
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:34,240
I wanted to ask you about one other
thing really quick way I have,

1779
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:36,240
I have advertising to read. Oh, you did.

1780
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:39,830
Let's go into your lovely advertising.

1781
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:42,920
I want to talk to you about
Bruce Willis and Demi Moore.

1782
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:47,540
This is almost a fucking two hour
podcasts. I gotta get Outta here. Oh,

1783
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:49,520
it depends on how long
somebody ride is to work.

1784
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:51,183
MMM.

1785
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,830
Well, you know what I want
to hear from you guys, man.

1786
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:58,340
I to hear from a lot of fads. Those little
call one 800, no calm. Let me know. Uh,

1787
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,900
what the fuck did the ads go? Did I
finish them all? Um, oh, here it is.

1788
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:08,000
I want to hear what you got. What do you
guys think is selling out? You know, what,

1789
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:10,270
what do you think that
selling out exist anymore?

1790
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,250
Like I don't feel like it
really is a thing anymore. Well,

1791
01:46:13,251 --> 01:46:17,810
I think also if you grow up just
seeing movie stars doing commercials,

1792
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:21,050
I don't think it's like a big deal. Let's
think about them too. I mean, you know,

1793
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:24,380
these last five years has really changed
because it was funny when you were in

1794
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:27,170
this country, you didn't see movie
stars on billboards and Shit like that.

1795
01:46:27,171 --> 01:46:28,910
And then you went to Australia,
you go to Europe,

1796
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:33,500
you see like Leonardo doing the tag hoyer,
fucking things and all this shit.

1797
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:35,023
MMM.

1798
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:37,150
In way back in the day.
Oh my God.

1799
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:41,260
And I hate Cooper doing ads for a hug
and does actually has pictures there.

1800
01:46:41,261 --> 01:46:44,110
He might not be coming out of
the thing like Kanye and Kim.

1801
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:46,440
He might not actually be coming
out of the store holders.

1802
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:49,500
And to be honest with you, when I
think about that, when I about that,

1803
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:50,070
it's like what's the,

1804
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:54,970
how much fucking money do you got to
make you fucking the star? Those, those,

1805
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:59,130
the, the three hangover movies,
you could get money for life. Yeah,

1806
01:46:59,131 --> 01:47:03,360
but why not make it life?
But why not do that and add to the income?

1807
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:06,480
Because I look at it going, no, we
need it eventually. Like you said,

1808
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,410
I want to keep doing movies and acting
as though I get that. I always say,

1809
01:47:10,411 --> 01:47:13,250
when this business is finished with me,
they probably have that same,

1810
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:16,290
this is my deal. I look at it like, okay,

1811
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,560
so you do all those movies and
you're not getting any more movies.

1812
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,370
Then you fucking do them. Fuck it.
I'll do a commercial. Then you do it,

1813
01:47:23,371 --> 01:47:26,580
but when you're fucking up there,
I mean the guy was just,

1814
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:29,310
and then he was on another movie that
was up for like best picture and people

1815
01:47:29,311 --> 01:47:30,144
want Oscars and,

1816
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:34,320
but the thing is you'll make more money
doing it while you're the big star.

1817
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:37,290
So it doesn't make any sense
to do it after you fall off.

1818
01:47:37,291 --> 01:47:38,340
Because then they're like,
hey,

1819
01:47:38,341 --> 01:47:42,510
here's five grand taking her leave it and
you're like, fuck, I got to take it. No,

1820
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:45,990
take it now. Bank it.
Ah, I dunno about that.

1821
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:50,430
That's a smarter business decision not
to wait until you're like nobody wants

1822
01:47:50,431 --> 01:47:54,210
you anymore. And then you'll hold
an ice cream cone. Like, hi, bye.

1823
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:57,110
Then no one even fucking cares. That's
the other thing I want to, I want to,

1824
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:57,571
you know what?

1825
01:47:57,571 --> 01:48:02,571
I would love to talk to a movie star
and ask them how they feel about sitting

1826
01:48:03,121 --> 01:48:07,590
there with the ice. Some
looking at the spoon.

1827
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:12,360
You know what's funny? I just, I just
look at it as another acting gig.

1828
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:16,110
I think Kim came out with ice cream.
Kanye was just in there,

1829
01:48:16,111 --> 01:48:18,630
but he wasn't holding,
he wasn't photographed holding anything.

1830
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:21,690
And then like her mom has a picture.
Holly and her sister has one.

1831
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,510
So I think Kinda was like, all right,
yeah, I'll go in there with you,

1832
01:48:24,511 --> 01:48:28,860
but I'm not fucking coming up here with
the ice cream cone because I love you.

1833
01:48:28,910 --> 01:48:30,540
Can I shoot this?

1834
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:34,830
Does any of that make you want
to buy Haagen Daz ice cream?

1835
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:37,290
Like it's not like I'm sitting
on the fence going, you know,

1836
01:48:37,291 --> 01:48:40,380
I don't know about that. Hug
and does. I love Bradley Cooper.

1837
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:45,360
What is he eating?
Jesus get me three pints of it.

1838
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:49,090
I think it's supposed to be more
subliminal than that. All right,

1839
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:52,980
let's just fucking read these so we can
get out of here. He voice everybody.

1840
01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:55,110
Now it's my turn to whore
myself out. I'm, this is,

1841
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:58,050
this is my Haagen and ice cream
right here. Perfect. The segue,

1842
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:00,690
if you take all your
business calls yourself,

1843
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:04,710
it's hard to look professional or get
anything done by helping you expertly

1844
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:06,120
manage all your business calls.

1845
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:09,380
He voice provides you with a
better way to connect your,

1846
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:12,360

1847

professional voice greeting
and a dial by name directory.

1848
01:49:15,211 --> 01:49:19,140

into your business phone. Nia,

going on. Uh, when your customers call,

1889
01:51:39,710 --> 01:51:40,543
Okay.

1890
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:44,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come in here for
you know what's funny about this?

1891
01:51:44,131 --> 01:51:49,131
I was just thinking as I was reading
that was that later on in my career,

1892
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:50,423
right?

1893
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:51,490
Yeah.

1894
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:54,910
When it's all fucking set had done and
they are done with me and I'm doing a sag

1895
01:51:54,911 --> 01:51:59,470
nut bar commercial, people will
take the audio from this. Yeah,

1896
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:02,950
but I never said that it was, I never,
I, I said it was an individual thing.

1897
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:06,670
I will tell you this and I could
tell you without a fucking doubt.

1898
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:11,800
As far as I feel that if I ever did
one of those that I would, I would,

1899
01:52:11,930 --> 01:52:13,250
I don't know how I would be able,

1900
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:17,110
I mean I guess you change every
four or five years, you know?

1901
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:20,890
I guess as you become an older man and
he just don't want to fucking go out

1902
01:52:20,891 --> 01:52:23,930
there or anything, like how you change
your physicality. When you say older man,

1903
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,280
you're such an actor at heart.

1904
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:28,660
You just kind of like bent over and may
just off physically and old man come an

1905
01:52:28,661 --> 01:52:33,340
older man. Yeah. He just, he like, you
know what you, when I eat candy bars,

1906
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,960
I like this candy bar.

1907
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:39,520
I don't give a fuck if you want to pay
for my prostate exam this month. Go ahead.

1908
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:42,280
Do it. Now the fear is that, yeah,

1909
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:47,120
the business will be done with you and
you're not gonna have anywhere to turn. So

1910
01:52:49,290 --> 01:52:54,010
make your money and hopefully, you know,

1911
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:55,430
you pay your fucking house,

1912
01:52:55,431 --> 01:52:58,310
you buy a house you can afford
and you pay the fucking thing off.

1913
01:52:58,311 --> 01:53:01,400
And then the next thing you do is you
go out, you buy rental properties,

1914
01:53:01,401 --> 01:53:04,100
so then you don't fuck those people over.
But they help pay that thing off.

1915
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:06,290
And then in the end of your life,
if you got a problem,

1916
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:09,470
you can sell one of those fucking units.
That's what I want to do.

1917
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:13,580
As opposed to go on and sit
there and look with an amaze.

1918
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:18,080
Look on my face as the microwave.
Microwave popcorn is popping. Okay.

1919
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:20,480
But this is the thing,
actually,

1920
01:53:20,481 --> 01:53:22,820
I shouldn't even say that because there's
so many commercials that I think is so

1921
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:27,380
funny and great and I
think the performances of
commercials that are like, oh,

1922
01:53:27,381 --> 01:53:30,440
they're way better than that.
Yeah, they're way better
than than they used to be.

1923
01:53:30,441 --> 01:53:33,470
But I guess the nightmare
is you know what it is.

1924
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:37,580
You just don't want to be in something
that sucks. It's fucking cheesy. Maybe.

1925
01:53:37,581 --> 01:53:41,570
Maybe that's what it is with
every movie or TV. So you do,

1926
01:53:41,571 --> 01:53:45,860
you don't really know as an answer unless
you are like the director or producer,

1927
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:50,300
not just in name, but a real producer on
it. You have no idea how it's gonna go.

1928
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:53,360
So you will go up, but you get
the scripts. Awesome. Yeah.

1929
01:53:53,361 --> 01:53:55,760
You think this is going to be, this is
a funny script, is a great director,

1930
01:53:55,761 --> 01:53:58,290
writer bubble,
and it comes out and it's tracked.

1931
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:00,220
You're telling me that that same,
you think that's,

1932
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:03,740
do you think that same thing happens
when you get the copy for the Zag nut bar

1933
01:54:03,741 --> 01:54:07,470
commercial? No, but at least you know what
she say on paper. This looks good. Oh,

1934
01:54:07,471 --> 01:54:09,740
but you know,
you know exactly what you're getting into.

1935
01:54:09,741 --> 01:54:12,290
You know exactly the purpose
for this thing. You don't,

1936
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:14,620
you don't know exactly what
you get your son is that,

1937
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:17,510
I can't believe you said not yourself.
Oh, you're so old. Sometimes.

1938
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:21,980
He snippers Fifth Avenue,
Fifth Avenue,

1939
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:27,230
payday, payday, marathon bar commercials
prepare their think. But, but anyway,

1940
01:54:27,231 --> 01:54:27,990
yeah,

1941
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:31,400
no more what you're getting into because
you have no power on how they're going

1942
01:54:31,401 --> 01:54:33,710
to edit it. You don't know who's
fucking direct in the goddamn thing.

1943
01:54:33,711 --> 01:54:37,910
You don't know if they, if he
the editor as opposed to, wow,

1944
01:54:37,911 --> 01:54:40,420
this is really something that
I was really believed in.

1945
01:54:40,421 --> 01:54:42,050
And it's unfortunate that it didn't,
you know,

1946
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:45,620
you didn't get to see what we really
speaking to that how many buddies,

1947
01:54:45,650 --> 01:54:50,420
how many people's careers were ruined
by that one. Batman movie was one,

1948
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:55,610
one of the one where the went chick
and when the girl went, oh no,

1949
01:54:55,611 --> 01:54:59,870
she played poison. Oh Shit. Oh, Scarface.
Michelle Pfeiffer. And then the guy,

1950
01:54:59,871 --> 01:55:01,310
the guy doing the fucking,

1951
01:55:01,490 --> 01:55:05,490
the guy doing the TV show with ll cool J.
Okay.

1952
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:11,090
Chris, uh, Chris Christiansen,
he played Robin. He played Robin.

1953
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:15,350
That's career wasn't ruined. He's on
that. He took a major fucking hit.

1954
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:18,760
He didn't write that God,
their movie wasn't his fault.

1955
01:55:18,761 --> 01:55:22,790
He was playing the boy wonder whole CSI
and he's doing all right. I know, but he,

1956
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:26,480
he in there. Yeah, but he was on the
fucking ropes because of that movie.

1957
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:27,770
Okay.

1958
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:28,603
Yeah. Well, you know

1959
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:34,630
what I didn't want my point
is I'm just saying, all right,

1960
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:39,900
I'm not trying to do a two hour podcast
is like seeing a to 200 point envy again

1961
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:43,980
later on so we can talk
about what that word mean.

1962
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:49,620
Addendum. That's like an addition Scout
Willis. What was weekend too? It's,

1963
01:55:49,621 --> 01:55:53,070
this has been over two hours. I don't
think my listeners give a fuck about what,

1964
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:56,070
what happened was Scout Willis.
Well she's uh,

1965
01:55:56,100 --> 01:56:01,100
she went parading around New York a
topless because she was in protest of

1966
01:56:01,801 --> 01:56:06,350
Instagram cutting out her
account because you know,

1967
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:08,730
she was wearing a sheer top
in his shoulder nipples.

1968
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:11,280
And that's been a thing where
people's nipples or whatever,

1969
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:12,180
haven't been on Instagram.

1970
01:56:12,181 --> 01:56:15,810
Like they shut down Rihanna as account
because she posted some pictures from a

1971
01:56:15,811 --> 01:56:20,340
magazine. She like a French
magazine shoot. She did. And
then this editor at Vogue,

1972
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,430
uh,
named Grace Cottington just put a picture,

1973
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:26,700
like a stick figure thing with little
nipples on it and they shut down our her

1974
01:56:26,701 --> 01:56:27,060
account.

1975
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:30,270
They gave her account back because it
was ridiculous cause of the cartoon

1976
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:33,720
because this whole thing now
where Instagram is like, you know,

1977
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:35,970
cutting people off or
excessive nudity and shit.

1978
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:41,030
So Scout Willis and protest quote unquote
when walking around topless in New

1979
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:45,570
York City and had our picture taken
and stuff because she was like,

1980
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:49,590
I just got my breasts reduced. I
felt good about myself. And you know,

1981
01:56:49,591 --> 01:56:54,591
Instagram is shaming people and I think
that is the most ridiculous non cause

1982
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:58,800
ever. Like really scout will
as the daughter of delight,

1983
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:00,300
famous movie stars,

1984
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:04,020
you're really being oppressed by Instagram
because they want to shut down the

1985
01:57:04,021 --> 01:57:06,060
fucking nipples.
It was the most insane,

1986
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:09,920
ridiculous thing I had ever seen it
in my mind. Think about their uh,

1987
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:14,550
their, no, no nipple policy. I mean,

1988
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:19,560
I mean I don't, I don't give a
fuck. Yeah, no nudity. Sure. Fine.

1989
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:24,470
I feel like I still see plenty of booty
shots on it. Yeah. That's like youtube.

1990
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:25,081
It's like,
you know,

1991
01:57:25,081 --> 01:57:28,590
there's a certain level of whoredom
that you can go to and then they stopped

1992
01:57:28,591 --> 01:57:30,730
because they're trying to
protect their image. Yeah. Exit.

1993
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:32,940
I tried to come a porno hub.
Exactly.

1994
01:57:32,941 --> 01:57:34,740
And they've got all kinds
of young kids on it,

1995
01:57:34,741 --> 01:57:36,210
so they're trying to
be mindful of that too.

1996
01:57:36,211 --> 01:57:38,180
They don't want it to be
what's funny about like,

1997
01:57:38,190 --> 01:57:42,990
don't use Instagram heads in a zillion
places on the fucking Internet.

1998
01:57:42,991 --> 01:57:44,310
That's just like, you know, I've talk,

1999
01:57:44,311 --> 01:57:48,510
I wouldn't talk like this and church
am I let him an old during somebody's

2000
01:57:48,511 --> 01:57:52,020
speech. But you know, right. You got
to respect. It's Instagram. That's it.

2001
01:57:52,021 --> 01:57:56,040
That's their church. And yeah, and
that's the thing. I don't, I don't,

2002
01:57:56,041 --> 01:57:56,791
the thing is though,

2003
01:57:56,791 --> 01:58:01,320
she's really trying to make
it about censorship and
you're shaming women and men

2004
01:58:01,321 --> 01:58:01,920
can go,
right.

2005
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,600
It's like you are not shamed or
being like oppressed in any way.

2006
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:10,780
Daughter of famous, yet guys
are being oppressed. Oh God.

2007
01:58:10,781 --> 01:58:15,180
Guys are being oppressed God. Cause you
get to look at Man tits all the time,

2008
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:18,660
man. And I can't see,
you know, that's all.

2009
01:58:18,661 --> 01:58:23,070
That's all we're thinking about as mantids
male, male, male, pex. I'm sure you're,

2010
01:58:23,071 --> 01:58:27,810
and I'm sure you're really like scared
that all the people googling your, your,

2011
01:58:27,811 --> 01:58:31,140
your pecs, right? You live sort of
in that fear of going to the beach.

2012
01:58:31,141 --> 01:58:35,880
I looked like a piece of chalk that was,
somebody threw some cinnamon at flex.

2013
01:58:35,881 --> 01:58:40,881
Some cinema really annoyed me that
Scout Willis has the to act like she was

2014
01:58:43,121 --> 01:58:48,121
somehow being oppressed in any way
because Instagram bands are account names.

2015
01:58:50,101 --> 01:58:50,934
Scout.

2016
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:53,680
What do you think they're going to fuck
it do their parents were movie stars.

2017
01:58:53,681 --> 01:58:55,220
What do you think they're going to do?
You know,

2018
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:59,560
even Rihanna is like whatever moving
on and just as her Twitter account now,

2019
01:58:59,561 --> 01:59:01,570
and she had an a and the thing
is she wasn't even doing it.

2020
01:59:01,571 --> 01:59:03,450
Like I'm doing it for Rihanna.
In fact, she had split.

2021
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,920
I'm not gonna try to act like
all black people know each other.

2022
01:59:05,921 --> 01:59:08,710
But is there any way you can get in touch
with her and tell her to stop drawing

2023
01:59:08,711 --> 01:59:13,150
on herself? Rhea, Rhea,
her tattoo. Oh my God. Yes.

2024
01:59:13,151 --> 01:59:16,850
No I don't. I don't know where yet. I
saw no, I would not be with her. Uh,

2025
01:59:16,910 --> 01:59:20,690
with their air force tattoo under a tip

2026
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:27,220
to something that's not an iron maiden
has power slave album cover that she has

2027
01:59:27,641 --> 01:59:30,460
that little uh, what she wants with
her body. And what's your little,

2028
01:59:30,461 --> 01:59:34,570
some on the side, what's your problem
with Rihanna? Having a bunch of tattoos.

2029
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:37,780
She's got a beautiful body. She
has a great canvas for it. Yeah.

2030
01:59:37,781 --> 01:59:41,490
No and so he started scribbling
all over it. Oh, you're like anti,

2031
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:45,420
you're not completely anti tattoo, but
you're kind of our anti tattoo. Oh,

2032
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,390
you know what I don't like,

2033
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:51,100
I don't like when somebody tries to
write something fucking deep on their rib

2034
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:54,490
cage or their shoulder blade like hey,

2035
01:59:54,610 --> 01:59:59,230
the next time the butterfly flaps its
wings. You're talking about Megan Fox?

2036
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:00,490
No I'm not.

2037
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:04,600
Oh cause she had something
that butterflies will latch
the gilded butterfly or

2038
02:00:04,601 --> 02:00:09,601
something about Jesus when the fire dances
with the water on the butterfly wings

2039
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:17,050
that drunk Jim Morrison Horse Shit,
you got on the back of your leg.

2040
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:21,340
I don't give a fuck. Like, like,
like just advertising that you,

2041
02:00:21,341 --> 02:00:24,910
you understand life or some shit.
Like I'm supposed to be like, wow,

2042
02:00:24,911 --> 02:00:29,590
that person is deep. Yeah.
You know, tattoo artists
don't like doing those things.

2043
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:32,230
They float. Yeah. Cause
they feel like they say,

2044
02:00:32,231 --> 02:00:34,240
they feel like they're on punishment.
Like they're writing.

2045
02:00:34,241 --> 02:00:37,030
Like I will not talk in class because
they're just sitting there writing.

2046
02:00:37,090 --> 02:00:42,070
There's nothing creative about
it. Well then that's, let's see.

2047
02:00:42,071 --> 02:00:46,450
That's how I feel about Scout
Willis. It was, I was very, my role,

2048
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:48,940
my eyes rolled in the back of my head.
I was having a seizure.

2049
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:52,390
That's how hard we were at the two
hour mark. We are at the two hour mark.

2050
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,370
I'm going to end this bitch fest.

2051
02:00:54,430 --> 02:00:57,730
Thanks for having me on the
podcast on my birthday. No worries.

2052
02:00:57,731 --> 02:00:59,200
It's already three 15 now.

2053
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:03,130
Half over notice was half over at noon,

2054
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:06,910
but you stay up until three Oh, so
then you find, right? Yeah, exactly.

2055
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:11,230
That's what you're trying to say. Oh,
artists. Artists can't do math. All right,

2056
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:15,280
I'll talk to you guys next
week. Hey, watch the kings
and ranges. Go Fuck Yourself.
