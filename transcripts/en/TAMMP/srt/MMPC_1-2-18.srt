1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,623
Hmm.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,070
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:06,070
Is Bill burn his time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:10,240
January 1st,
2018 oh my God.

5
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:15,241
It's a new year with the new year comes
hopes in jeans for a better world and

6
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:24,790
God wants us to sit there and try
to make it a better world. Well,

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,050
you should probably start with yourself,
friends.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,570
Have you seen those people late at night
trying to tell you how to make it a

9
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,404
better world?

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,343
You know,

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,080
or somebody writes a song about it,

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,720
make it a better place for you,
ed,

13
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:49,700
for me and up plumber down the street.
Right?

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,670
It's very difficult. The older you get
to listen to those songs going like,

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,533
all right,

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,723
so

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,390
not only are you not going to
make the world a better place,

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,280
you're going to write some cheese ball
fucking song and make money off the fact

19
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,040
that people want to
make it a better place.

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,070
You're going to give some fucking
stupid pop culture psychology,

21
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:16,680
right? Pop Psychology. Is that
what you're going to throw it?

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,760
I don't know what the fuck it is.

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,000
It's like after nine 11 when that
country guy wrote that song, you know,

24
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:28,140
Uncle Sam's Buda, Buda, Buda, and you're
right. It's like, how did he like,

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,300
like that wasn't going to be a giant hit,

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,933
you know?

27
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,700
I Dunno what I'm talking about.

28
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:41,300
All I could tell you is I'm doing this
Monday morning podcast on Tuesday, uh,

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,200
because I was like, well,
what do I do? Do I do it?

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,090
Do I do it the night before
I go to the Rose Bowl?

31
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,990
And then by the time I tell you the
Rosebowl stories, it's like four days old,

32
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:55,840
or do I just go to the rose
bowl and do it a little late?

33
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,350
I decided on the ladder.
All right.

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,390
And I apologize to any, I
dunno, whatever fucking group,

35
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,970
you know what I'm hoping
in 20 2018 happens,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,930
I just hope that people start
standing up to all of this fucking,

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,423
you know,

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,920
the amount of people being offended.

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,700
Okay.

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,410
You know,
it's not that you didn't get offended.

41
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:24,411
It's the level of coverage that it gets
compared to shit that really is way,

42
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,060
way, way more devastating to
our lives. By the way, you know,

43
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,470
it's really was bugging me.

44
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,860
Okay.

45
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,410
You know, and there was all
those hurricanes and everybody,

46
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:39,280
everybody sending fucking money
out and all alleged shit. Right?

47
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,410
Got To help all these people in Houston.
Got To help all these people in Florida.

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Hey, where the fuck were you guys when
the Hollywood hills were on fire? Ha,

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,060
I didn't see any fucking benefits.

people floating on a mattress?

53
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,030
A Houston a few months ago,

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,030
a rubber couple of nickels
together and send it to him.

55
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,490
Make some teary eyed videos.

56
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,420
I just kind of seems like
it's a one way street here.

57
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,520
The fuck is the guy's name alone.

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,270

in high school and then all of a

60
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:41,460
sudden he owns like the biggest
network ever and all those women are,

61
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,470
I should've fucked Ralph.

62
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,440
Why did I have to fuck to the quarterback?

63
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,650
Baker mere fucking Mansfield,
whatever the fuck his name is.

64
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,040
The guy won the Heisman,
the hell's his name.

65
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:02,440
Baker Mayfield. Boom, boom, boom,

66
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,100
boom, boom. Sorry. That was
my bed. Curtis Mayfield one.

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,640
Apollo pass to that guy was, huh? If I
could sing and all these great songs,

68
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:14,270
he's doing a Goddamn gig and
that literally the lighting
falls down on them and

69
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:18,170
breaks his fucking neck.
I mean, how did it,

70
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,870
and he continued to write music.

71
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,690
I don't know how the fuck it's at. Some
people, I don't know. I hate to say this,

72
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:30,710
I know this about myself at that
ever fucking happened to me.

73
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:34,130
I would just be yelling, kill me to
everybody who came walking into the room.

74
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,130
We're going to start your
rehab. Kill me, kill me.

75
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,190
Gimme a fucking something.

76
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,310
I'm not strong enough to get through this.

77
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,160
Jesus. This is dark. Sorry, whatever.

78
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,500
That's what happens when you just
fucking start running your gap.

79
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:52,820
All of a sudden this happens.
Okay,

80
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:57,650
so I'd like to apologize to all Curtis
Mayfield fence in anybody's stubbed their

81
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:58,670
toe.
Speaking of which,

82
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,700
I'm at the fucking I co I cooked
up a goddamn storm this weekend.

83
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,730
I went out strong.
All right,

84
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,130
so the Great Jay law have Rosebowl
tailgate legend Jason Law head.

85
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,140
He fucking uh, he goes to put together
the menu, right? And he does, doesn't go,

86
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,680
we're doing burgers, we're doing dogs.
He just, he doesn't do that horse shit.

87
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,500
J fucking analyze like bill Bellacheck,
he fucking looks okay.

88
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,340
Oklahoma is playing George's playing.
So the next thing you know, he's like,

89
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:34,610
well, in Oklahoma, you know, they
do this tri tip something or other.

90
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,970
So he gets that going. I tell them, hey,
you are may make a pie this year goes,

91
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,900
yeah, why don't you make
a peach Pie for Georgia?

92
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:46,010
And He ties this whole fucking Oklahoma
Georgia thing together was incredible.

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,100
So I had never made a peach pie, right.
And I know peaches or out of season.

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,971
So I'm like,

95
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:55,790
why am not going to go down there and
buy some fucking out of season peach to

96
00:05:55,791 --> 00:06:00,620
some poor fucking had to pick off of
what used to be his own property down in

97
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:05,350
Costa Rica, whatever the fuck they do,
however they do the fruit nowadays.

98
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,570
I fucking, I said, I said, fuck it man.

99
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,820
I'll go down and get them canned peaches.

100
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,960
I'm going to get some God canned peaches.
So I got some canned peaches.

101
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,790
Yeah,

102
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,760
pick the fucking recipe off the Internet.

103
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,490
This is what I found with
recipes on the Internet. Okay.

104
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,870
They're going to get it to you so it
tastes really good, but they're not gonna.

105
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,840
They're not gonna give you the
recipe. We're, it tastes great.

106
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,810
So what they're going to do, is it
going to, you don't remember that guy.

107
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm going to bring it up a notch. Bam.
And he'd be screaming and yelling.

108
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,460
He had that fucking band.

109
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,560
Okay.

110
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Emeril Lagasse, right? Remember
how you said take it up a notch?

111
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,680
Don't they do on the Internet
is every fucking recipe.

112
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:52,440
They take it down a notch
to take it down a notch.

113
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,270
And then they fucking remove something.

114
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:55,830
Okay.

115
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,950
They take something out, some
little specials, special spice.

116
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,840
So anytime you make an a fucking pie,
it's a little sage advice fee. All right?

117
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:07,380
It's going to be the usual. Okay. If
you're doing some sort of fruit there,

118
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,490
it's going to be basically
a quarter cup of sugar.

119
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,770
I mean quarter cup of flour
and like a cup of sugar.

120
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,870
And then there's going to be cinnamon,
Nutmeg, uh, possibly vanilla,

121
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,250
I dunno, some sort of bullshit. And
then going to see 80 to teeth when we,

122
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,130
the eighth is like a teaspoon
of that. Fuck that. Fuck that.

123
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:27,811
All right.

124
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:31,750
They say eighth of a teaspoon taking
nice helping of it with the eighth of a

125
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,920
teaspoon. That's what I do. I throw
that shit in there. What do you want?

126
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,630
A teaspoon?
I'll give you a teaspoon and a quarter.

127
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:41,100
Maybe a teaspoon and a half
if I'm feeling crazy. Right.

128
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,600
You just kind of bring the levels
up on everything and then you think,

129
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,820
what else would they have on their,
you know, they probably, you know,

130
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,860
squeeze a little lime on the peaches,
you know,

131
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,160
before they fucking do all of this shit,
right?

132
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,930
Maybe a little vanilla in there and then
you always got to throw like, you know,

133
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:01,680
a little bit of butter in there
to mix all of that shit together.

134
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,610
Then you taste it. You throw a little more
sugar on top, you bring everything up.

135
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,990
That's what I did. And
uh, I gotta tell you, man,

136
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,930
I got rave reviews on a peach
pie. Who Knew? Who Knew?

137
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,630
Okay.

138
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,250
You know, people, you know, if you don't
try to explore the limits of your talents,

139
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,700
you'll never truly find out
how great your life could be.

140
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,920
So I made a peach pie.

141
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,940
I made a practice one with Nia and it
was a deal I didn't have a lot of times.

142
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:37,940
So I actually went to the
store and bought a store,

143
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:40,580
bought frozen pies on the bottom,
sec religious,

144
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,530
and then I made a homemade one for on top,
you know,

145
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:46,790
cut my work in half.

146
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,280
And then there was just all this weirdness
where the one on the bottom was kinda

147
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,680
dumb, but the one on top
wasn't. So I took it out and uh,

148
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,560
you Nia took one bite of it and just goes
[inaudible] [inaudible] does that shit.

149
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,160
And I knew she was right, but I also
got mad at her, you know what I mean?

150
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,680
Cause I'm lazy.
I didn't want to go back.

151
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:08,860
So I fucking egg wash the God damn
pie because I forgot to do that.

152
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,720
Sprinkled some sugar on it,
threw it back in,

153
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,820
then it was better and
I mean a decent pie.

154
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,790
But then I brought all the levels up
and the one that I did to the rose bowl

155
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,320
fucking crushed
or maybe people would just be a nice,

156
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,730
I don't know. Um, I also
made a quiche Lorraine.

157
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,360
I've always wanted to make a quiche.
I mean, who doesn't like eggs?

158
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,250
Who does it like Pie Emmy right there.
You got both things going on.

159
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,300
This is breakfast and dessert
all at the same fucking time.

160
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,190
And uh,

161
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,820
I go to make this thing and of course
knee is all over me looking at this,

162
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:49,810
looking at that, look at it. This,
I fucking stick to Keishon there,

163
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,810
right?
Do the whole damn thing.

164
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,450
I fucking 45 minutes in. You know, I
give it a little poke with the tongs.

165
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:00,190
It still looks Jello is hell.

166
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:03,700
So I leave it in for another 10 minutes
and then it looks pretty much solid and

167
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:06,970
I'm getting nervous dot. I'm going to burn
it. So I take it out, I let it cool off.

168
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,690
Couple of hours later I cut into it.
It looks a little runny,

169
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:12,310
but I'm too hungry so I don't give a shit.

170
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,250
So I'm eating and it's clearly needs
to go back in the oven for 10 minutes,

171
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:18,310
but it's fucking delicious. So
I get, I got near to try this.

172
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:19,510
I think it needs to be,
you know,

173
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,510
I think it needs to go back to
the oven maybe for 10 minutes.

174
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,370
And she just cuts it and she goes,
Ooh.

175
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,940
And then eats it and goes
[inaudible] [inaudible] and
I just went, you know what?

176
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:32,820
Fuck you. And she's like, what? I'm just
being honest. I'm like, I know. Okay.

177
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,880
I know I just want it, but it still
tastes good, right? She goes, yeah,

178
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,250
but it's running. His shit needs
to go back in the oven. I'm like,

179
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,260
we could've said it tasted good first

180
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,580
and she stormed out of the room and then
I was like, oh, come on honey. Come on.

181
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,440
Sorry.
Sorry.

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,010
I won't be like this in 2018

183
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,350
so I put it back in the oven for like
another 10 minutes. Actually Nia did.

184
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,890
She finished the thing off and
it takes the fucking delicious.

185
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,190
And then before the fucking
rose bowl the night before,

186
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,290
I'm thinking,
all right,

187
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:13,291
la ahead is going to be making his
classic fucking a breakfast sandwich,

188
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,450
which is basically a English muffin.

189
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,910
He puts a little Habari cheese on one
side and then he has his avocado spread.

190
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:26,050
He does on the other side.

191
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,510
Then he cooks this fucking egg
to absolute perfection. Okay.

192
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,060
Or it's not too runny. It's not
overhardt, it's just perfect.

193
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,650
Not quite over meat. Uh, medium.
It sounded like a medium rare.

194
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,640
So when you bite into it,
the egg yolk oozes out,

195
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,300
but it doesn't fall out of the
sandwich and all of that shit. Right.

196
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,300
And then also he,
he had marinated this,

197
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:57,301
this tri tip that he put on top of
that and it was the best fucking eggs.

198
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,630
It was such a good egg sandwich.
I only had one cause he goes,

199
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:04,270
you want to have another one? It's
like, no, I don't want to kill it.

200
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,980
You know what I mean?

201
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,310
And the night before I had made
these hash browns, you know,

202
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,740
the thing about it is, is you don't
want to make the fucking things,

203
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,050
but she also don't want the
things to turn all brown and Shit.

204
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:21,051
So I actually did the whole mix and
then put it in a fucking Ziploc bag in

205
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,210
squished all the air out of it.

206
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,610
I possibly could stuck it in
the fridge and it was fine.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,630
I cooked those fuckers up on the side
at that point I was a little shit face.

208
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:32,160
I think I overdid it.
That's right.

209
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,680
I was already drunk before
breakfast even came out.

210
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,613
All right.

211
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,940
We had already loaded up the truck.
We put the game changer in there.

212
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,150
The game changer. Who
by the way? All right.

213
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,980
The game changer is a is a flat
top grill with four burners.

214
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,450
All right, and the propane
gas, I'm telling you right.

215
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:55,550
That's what the fuck you
want to bring to a cookout

216
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,310
that think it's just, you never have
to worry about your fire going out.

217
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,820
There's not like, there's not all of
this pressure. There's none of that shit.

218
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,410
He just turned that fucking thing on.
Jay's just like a short order cook.

219
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,700
I've never done last two years,

220
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:14,270
I've never seen him so relaxed at
a cookout because before you know,

221
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,280
we had a Hibachi that's way down here.

222
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:18,600
We had another one that was up
on its legs. This guy is going,

223
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:22,910
he's doing like fucking 400 squats
and hour trying to cook everything,

224
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:27,440
making sure his fire doesn't
go out time and shit. And um,

225
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,160
and he cooks the whole time.
It's not like he's cooking one thing.

226
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,530
He cooks up breakfast and he
cooks something in the middle.

227
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:38,090
Then he cooks the dinner. So he was
always having to add shit and Kohl's.

228
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:42,380
And all that means is over the
course of like six hours. Um,

229
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,270
so the flat top grill that j
law had dubbed the game changer.

230
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,760
Um,
he was just crushing it all day and um,

231
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,320
yeah,

232
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,600
I got gotten these things
because this was our 10th um,

233
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,230
bowl in a row in anybody who's married
knows that your 10 year thing is 10 and

234
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,500
not only do they know that the, you
know, 10 the 10 anniversary, you,

235
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,310
there's no way you can go out and buy
something made out of tin for your wife

236
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,840
only and she's going to be happy with
that unless you met an absolute sweetheart

237
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:21,410
who doesn't mind being broke or it
doesn't mind that she married a cheek.

238
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:22,910
Fuck one of the other.
Anyways,

239
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,840
so I went out and I got these flasks
made up for me and Barton it cause we,

240
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,940
we were the original guys. It was just the
two, just the two of us the first year.

241
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,580
So I got a giant Roman numeral 10,

242
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:42,230
like the Superbowl engraved on the front
and on the back I just had Joe Barton,

243
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:46,910
Nick Rose Bowl, tailgate legend. And
then I did like the American Express,

244
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,300
the member sense and had oh nine and um,

245
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,360
next year law had gets his in a two years.
Feminists gets his,

246
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,930
although I have to correct you cause I
already had a made up and I thought that

247
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,510
they both came in 2010. Um, anyways,

248
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:08,030
so I'm out there throwing
the football around.

249
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,210
I got some booze in me.
Right.

250
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,750
I smoked a little weed,
which I never do,

251
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:18,800
but I'm just trying to
lay off the bows and uh,

252
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,760
this is why I don't smoke
weed is because you know,

253
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,380
with booze, if you reach for a
bottle of vodka, you know, okay.

254
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:32,210
You know basically what the punch
to the face it's going to be.

255
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,050
Or if you grab a beer, you know what
that's going to be. You grab some wine,

256
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,360
you know what that's going
to be when someone goes, hey,

257
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:41,030
you want to take a hit of this choice?
You don't know what the fuck it is.

258
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,410
Is that the, is it that shit that just
kinda makes you feel like, hey man,

259
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,930
like everything's gonna be alright man.

260
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,950
Or is it going to have you just
fucking staring at a God damn tree?

261
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,413
Okay.

262
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,320
So I, you know, I dunno. What,
what are you supposed to do?

263
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:01,190
Just take one hit and then stand there
and wait for your face to start melting

264
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:06,080
and be like, oh, well it didn't. This
is why I'm done with fucking weed too.

265
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,750
So I take a fucking hit. I
don't feel anything. I'm like,
oh, this must be the, the,

266
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,010
the light ones. So then I
go back, ended about two,

267
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:19,420
three times and next thing you know, I'm
telling everybody at the Tailgate, I go,

268
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:23,170
hey man, listen, I know I'm really high
right now, but look at that fucking tree.

269
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,390
Isn't it? Fucking, that
tree is fucking a mess.

270
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:29,690
Like some shit out of a horror movie.
Book it down.

271
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,190
Look at the way it's like bent like that,

272
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:36,191
and they're just laughing at me and I am
so at peace that I don't care that I'm

273
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:39,110
actually, I don't give a fuck
that they're laughing at me.

274
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,340
I'm just happy at that point.

275
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:43,940
Then it bringing them joy is I
make a complete fool of myself.

276
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,923
Um,

277
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,930
and I'm drinking from the flask
and then Jay throws a burger on.

278
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,150
We've got this grass fed fucking
grass fed fucking me dude.

279
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,810
I fucking, it might've been
the best burger I ever had,

280
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,130
but also I was so high, I was just
talking to people about this fucking tree,

281
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,160
which felt like an intense
minute. So, you know, it was like,

282
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,010
at least probably what,
like 11 minutes.

283
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,050
Okay.

284
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,710
I ate that Burger. It was
fucking amazing. And uh,

285
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,290
then I went over to a chair. I sat down
and I passed out for like two hours.

286
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,990
Jay was making these fucking
meatball subs on a Brioche Bun.

287
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,270
And I completely, I the last
like four or five years in a row,

288
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,230
I have missed the main course.
And by the way,

289
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:43,060
Americans call it an [inaudible], call it
a main course, don't call it the entree.

290
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,910
All Alright?
In French entree means to enter it.

291
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,780
That's actually the beginning of the meal
and somewhere across the fucking ocean

292
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,580
in the scurvy and the fucking
slavery and the indentured servitude,

293
00:17:56,581 --> 00:18:00,840
however, whatever distracted
us, we fucked that up.

294
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,950
Entree means to enter.
That's the beginning. Okay.

295
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,620
So just say the main course and for
the main core cell had this, uh,

296
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,960
what do you have for entrees?
Um,

297
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,170
so I miss that.
I woke up and uh,

298
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,980
I ended up, I tried the pie with the
Allah mode. It was fucking delicious.

299
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:23,910
Everybody loved it.

300
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:28,140
And at that point I was kind of fucking
sober because I was actually way more

301
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,740
high than I was shit faced.
And um,

302
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,190
okay.

303
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,700
I didn't even smoke a
cigar and I went into the,

304
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:40,150
I went into the game
and, uh, I just started,

305
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:42,700
anytime a vendor came by
just started crushing waters,

306
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,290
I was already on the wagon. That's how
fucked up I got at the tailgate. Like,

307
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,420
you know,
you know,

308
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,540
like when you're still legally drunk and
you're already back on the what you're

309
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,460
telling people,
I'm on the wagon as you have,

310
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:57,920
like literally they could
let your breath on fire. Um,

311
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,110
that's, that's when, you
know, you went too hard.

312
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,070
I don't really have any fucking stories
about the tailgate cause I barely

313
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:09,430
remember it. Um, other than
it was fucking awesome.

314
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,200
I do remember I was drinking, uh, Ma, uh,

315
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,010
Miller's, I was drinking out of that
flask. I had, you know, once a year,

316
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,740
uh, mill, I had Miller and Miller lite.

317
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:26,790
Miller lite comes back with their old
school, less filling tastes great bottle.

318
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,120
Okay.

319
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,690
So I had a couple of those.
Um,

320
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:38,110
I threw the football around lefty.
I vaguely remember that. Oh.

321
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,070
And then somebody at the tailgate told
me a fucking story about how Garappolo

322
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:44,200
ended up on the fucking 40.
Niners.

323
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,170
Evidently the Cleveland browns
were interested in getting him,

324
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,360
but bill Bellacheck still holds a grudge
against him for him, for his time,

325
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,870
you know, 1995 when he was coaching at
which I believe he was also with fucking,

326
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:04,570
what's his face?
Nick Saban there.

327
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,480
Yeah.

328
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,240
So he's like, fuck that. And
he calls up the 49. He goes,

329
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,690
give me a second round draft pick. We'll
give you a grappler. How fucking nuts is.

330
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:16,770
Uh, I've heard a couple of
those stories recently. Like,

331
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:21,030
do you know the Celtics got into a
position to get to, to get Bill Russell?

332
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,880
This is his story that was told to me.
I sit down,

333
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:28,820
gather around and listened to this tale.
Um,

334
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,520
the Celtics had too good of a year to
be in a position to draft Bill Russell.

335
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,110
So red our back makes a bunch of fucking
moves to get all the way up to number

336
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:42,260
two. Alright. But the problem is,

337
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:45,350
is the Rochester royals is
some shit head number one.

338
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,280
There was nothing he could do
to get them to not, you know,

339
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,170
to give up the number one pick and
everybody was going to take Bill Russell.

340
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:57,960
He was just clearly the best guy.
So the Boston guy

341
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,920
had the fucking ice capades every year
and they used to make a bunch of money

342
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,321
off that.

343
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:08,950
Now I know a lot of you
fucking millennials out there
like the ice capades bunch

344
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:12,670
of people twirling around, dress
on the ice, right? Skating around,

345
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,740
dressed like fucking Yogi and booboo bear.

346
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,230
Why the fuck would I go see that bullshit?
Well,

347
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:21,370
it was before the Internet is the one
you had a little black and white fucking

348
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:23,890
TV. You know what I mean? The
picture was always jumping.

349
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,450
This was just some exciting shit.

350
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,220
There wasn't a Teddy Barr or fucking free
Internet porn. Every once in a while,

351
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:34,720
you know, once a year, these beautiful
fucking goddess women would come in

352
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,840
with their shapely thighs and he could
sit there and look at them and pretend

353
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,360
you were into the yard and he
just sat right next to your wife.

354
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:48,130
You could fucking, you know, look
at some games over there, right?

355
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,010
So what it would always sell out.

356
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,390
So the Rochester royals
were hurting for money.

357
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,530
So red our back called up the
ice capade guy. He goes, Hey,

358
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:02,860
can you do me a fucking solid?
Can you fucking get the ice?

359
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:07,690
Capades can you guarantee that you'll
do a couple of dates out there for these

360
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:10,960
fucking guys? He said, absolutely I will.
So he called them up as a list. Listen,

361
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,310
I'll get you to give
me the number one pick.

362
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,500
I'll give you the fucking
ice capades for a week.

363
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,500
You make all this God damn money.
And the miser that owned the team said,

364
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:21,490
you know what, I'll take
that deal. I will say,

365
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:24,850
forget Bill Russell.
So Dorothy Hamill can come in,

366
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:28,390
or Peggy Fleming,
whoever the fuck it was back there.

367
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,680
I Dunno.
Way back then.

368
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:34,560
It was probably some woman named Ethel
and she was considered hot, right?

369
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,000
Bethel McGuire. And Hazel said,
Gorski her come and skate.

370
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,760
Oh my God. Have you ever
shit so fucking hot. Right.

371
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,640
Years later they wrote
on the golden girls,

372
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,830
but back then they were
all hot piece of ass.

373
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,660
I know I skipped over a
lot of fucking details,

374
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:55,410
so you should probably listen to
the bill Simmons podcast, right.

375
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,010
To figure out what really happened.
But that's what was told to me.

376
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,990
And you know what, God
dammit, I'm sticking with it.

377
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,370
I'm fucking sticking with that story.
So anyways, all Billie, no fun.

378
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,540
I'm not going a bunch of days
again, but like, I'm just like, uh,

379
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,230
I'm done.
All right.

380
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,260
I came off the wagon on December 26th
and now it's January 2nd and I'm right

381
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:21,450
back on. I had, I had a hell of a week.

382
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,990
One day I didn't drink. All
right. That was the 28th.

383
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:32,730
December 20th. So six out of
the last seven days I drank. Uh,

384
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,010
I don't like how I feel.
I don't like how I look.

385
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:38,430
I just can't fucking do it anymore.
Okay. I'm turning 50 in June.

386
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,060
I had a great half of a century run.
All right.

387
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,430
I never really drank until I was like 17.
So what am I had a good 30 years.

388
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm gonna Larry Bird. Speaking of
the guard, I had a nice 33 year run.

389
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,833
Okay.

390
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,910
So, uh, I am now going to be
that guy that picks a spot.

391
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,440
Am I going to be that fucking dude?

392
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,410
Maybe I'll just be that guy that has a
glass of wine with dinner every once in a

393
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,244
while.

394
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,203
You know,

395
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,061
it's just like,

396
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:13,290
just all this awkward silence between me
and my wife is we sit on either end of

397
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,140
this really long dinner table,
you know,

398
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,600
and all you hear is just me like turning
the pages of the paper and you know,

399
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,480
shaking it, you know, you do that
thing to make sure it straightens out.

400
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,570
Okay.

401
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,180
Every once in a while
just being like hone.

402
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:32,540
Who did you see down in
Brazil in a resilient?

403
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,520
Um, I dunno what I'm going to do, but, uh,

404
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,430
I, I'm just, I'm, I'm bringing the way I
was bringing everything up in that recipe.

405
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:45,770
I'm bringing everything down,
bringing everything down.

406
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,433
All right.

407
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,390
I'm fucking, uh, back to crush in the
waters. I'm back on my diet and, uh,

408
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,910
I got a couple of goals this year.

409
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,643
All right?

410
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,240
On the biggest mistakes I made in my
adult life was buying 34 inch jeans after

411
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,560
being a 32. All right. 32
best shape of my fucking life.

412
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,600
They started getting a little tight around
the fucking waste and I thought, oh,

413
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:15,810
you know, you get all the, you fill out
and it's like, no bill, you put on weight,

414
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,740
you can't, why don't you just take
fucking seven to 10 days to lose?

415
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:24,160
I didn't, I bought the
next size up jeans. Okay.

416
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,810
And that was stupid because that just
gave me this leeway to be a fat fuck.

417
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,720
Who feels comfortable in his pants?

418
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,280
You never buy the next size up jeans
after you'd done growing and all of that

419
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:41,840
shit. You know what I mean? Unless you're
a fucking beanpole, which may be, I was,

420
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:45,440
so I'm back down to 33 I
figure I'll stay there.

421
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,690
So that's what I'm going to do. I got
to like my fucking wardrobe right now.

422
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:52,250
I've got,
it's just like,

423
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,020
okay,

424
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,570
you know, I hate going
shopping. All right.

425
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,120
And I have not bought a fucking shirt,
a shirt or a pair of pants

426
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,840
in a couple of years.

427
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,950
Kind of fucking a couple
of free tee shirts.

428
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,660
I bought a prime his t shirt at the
concert I went to. But other than that,

429
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,060
it is just, I just, you know,

430
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,970
and I got rid of a bunch of old clothes,
so I have like,

431
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,120
I have two shirts that I wear,

432
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:28,020
one of two shirts when I fucking headline.

433
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:32,490
Those are my two headlining shirts and
I think I have a pullover sweater and

434
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,360
that's it.

435
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,300
And,
uh,

436
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,850
I don't think I give a shit,

437
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,243
you know,

438
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,530
I got to go out there,
have some

439
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,990
fucking rhinestone shiny goddamn shirt.
Yeah.

440
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,700
I really believe that as long as I have
a fucking act that nobody's going to

441
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:56,730
read really paying attention to the shirt.
Right? Well, now that I brought it up,

442
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:57,564
you've got to,

443
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,933
uh,

444
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,680
I dunno. Maybe I'll buy Shannon. Maybe
I'll buy a fucking sweat. You know,

445
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,600
I'm thinking, I'm thinking I'm gonna be
that guy that just dresses all in black.

446
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,200
If I wasn't so fucking pasty
and I wouldn't look like
a floating head in hands,

447
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,090
I would do that.
But what's great about a black shirt,

448
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,040
you can wear that like three days in a
row before anybody really even notices

449
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:22,670
like, this motherfucker's not
changing his shirt. You know,

450
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,460
that is the genius of
Malcolm young rest his soul,

451
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:30,170
the greatest rhythm guitarist and
rock and roll history, in my opinion.

452
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,703
MMM.

453
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,950
The genius of the way
that that meant dressed.

454
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,970
The sheer amount of money that that
man saved by just wearing jeans and a

455
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:47,040
fucking tee shirt,
right?

456
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,650
Einstein that said Einstein Shit.

457
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,650
That's what genius is.

458
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:56,910
Do they get rid of all the white noise
and they just focus on what's fucking

459
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:59,920
important?
Others.

460
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,780
What he did ages was his eyeline,
his pants and a shirt.

461
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:06,540
I'm not going to be fucking sitting
there trying to be in style.

462
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,630
I'm going to dress timeless blue jeans
and a fucking black tee shirt and I'm

463
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:17,330
done. Do you ever see the
let there be rock video?

464
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:21,110
That's one of my favorite parts of the
video when he's getting ready for the

465
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:25,780
show and he takes the t shirt off and
then he snaps his fingers like he's a

466
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:28,280
spoiled rockstar and they just
throw him another tee shirt,

467
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:33,140
the exact same color he puts it on or a
slightly different color and then that's

468
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:33,974
it.
It's over.

469
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,613
MMM.

470
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,700
Anyways, my shoulder's been
doing great and then I fucked
it up at the, at the, uh,

471
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:44,790
the tailgate. By the way. I was throwing
left handed doing our right, you know,

472
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:48,780
making sure I was giving my right
shoulder arrest and everything.

473
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,940
I hadn't felt any pain in my
shoulder for days. Long story short,

474
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,130
the end of the end of the, uh,
the tailgate, we're going to,

475
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,560
to a close up the table and,

476
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:02,394
uh,

477
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,900
I'm on one side with the other guys on
the other side and we're folding up the

478
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:09,320
legs and the one was getting
stubborn and where I had my fingers,

479
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:13,460
it fucking slammed down on
both of my fingers, right?

480
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,090
Just wham. And I went, ah, fuck.
And I pulled my arms out, you know,

481
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,530
I was basically reaching around
the fucking table, you know,

482
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:25,820
like I was given the skinniest person
ever the finish who had that finishing

483
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:29,420
move in wrestling where they just put
you in a fucking bear hug and they would

484
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:33,830
act like he was being crushed to death.
I was doing that with the table.

485
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:36,860
So when I went to Yank my arms
out really quickly, it was like,

486
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,220
it was like I was throwing two elbows
at the same time and felt like fucking

487
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:47,140
lightning in my right shoulder. And, uh,

488
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,420
I think I went right back to square one.
I Dunno what the fuck I got.

489
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,040
Do I think I'm going to do that Coby shit?
Um,

490
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,780
Robin told me about that whole stem
cell shit and I just get scared of that

491
00:29:58,781 --> 00:29:59,170
stuff.

492
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:04,170
I Dunno the way Joe Rogan is fearless
and we'll read up on something and then

493
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,770
make an informed decision before
he takes a step in that direction.

494
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,900
I just hear about something new.

495
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:14,830
Do not read up on it and act like an
old lady who thinks the fucking sky's

496
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:18,730
falling. That's the way I approach
life. So I haven't done that yet.

497
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:21,190
My shoulders still fucked up.
Um,

498
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,830
I might do that thing
where they take your own.

499
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,810
What I like about that fucking spin in a,

500
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:29,830
your blood is it's your own blood and
then they shoot it back in. Right.

501
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,990
Although I would want to watch
them the whole time, you know,

502
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,170
follow them around with my own blood
to make sure they don't take like the

503
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:41,320
fucking blood of a yak or a fucking
chimp or some shit, whatever they,

504
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,780
whatever the fuck they would,
whatever they do when these days, um,

505
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,130
to try and get that thing fixed.
Um, all right, let me, uh,

506
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,180
let me reach,
read to what do I have any advertising?

507
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,330
Um, I dunno that I do during
the holidays it slows down.

508
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:00,990
Okay.

509
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,980
I don't have any advertising.
Well, what do you know?

510
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,020
What do Ya know? All right,
let me see here. I guess I
don't have any advertising.

511
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:14,180
Well fuck it. Let's
continue talking. All right,

512
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,650
this is what else I did on my wonderful
over my wonderful holiday break.

513
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I went down to the comedy store,

514
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,920
did his set, had a great time
and I was driving home, you know,

515
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,100
and I'm driving along sunset just starting
to fucking listen to my tunes and all

516
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:38,120
of a sudden I go by this venue
and I look at what do I see?

517
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:43,121
I see Dave Chappelle and
John Mayer or doing a show.

518
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:45,590
I'm like, get the fuck Outta here. Right?

519
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,770
So I call up a buddy of mine that books
all the shows and I said, hey, what's,

520
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,000
what's the story with this?
This John Mayer.

521
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,570
Okay.

522
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,430
You know,
come out with his band.

523
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,540
Okay,

524
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,820
you know this Dave going first is John, go
on first, Blah Blah Blah. And he's like,

525
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:05,620
no. What happens is John comes out, plays
like four songs. He brings Dave out.

526
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,570
Dave does stand up

527
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:08,740
okay

528
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,060
for an hour,
an hour and a half.

529
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,720
And then he brings John back out
and then they just sort of riff.

530
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,560
Okay.

531
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,810
Is Dave talks about shit, John will play
the music underneath. And I was like,

532
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:22,470
I got to fucking see that.
So uh,

533
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,300
me and my me and the lovely Nia,

534
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,710
we went down there cause I never take
her out on New Year's Eve because that is

535
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:33,180
the original St Patrick's Day. Um, plus
I go to the rose bowl the next day,

536
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:36,320
so I need to get my sleep before I get
absolutely hammered and passed out in the

537
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:41,090
fucking chair for a couple
hours. Missing meatball sub. Um,

538
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:43,340
so we went down there and um,

539
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,280
just had such a great fucking night. And
um, I don't think I've ever seen that.

540
00:32:50,281 --> 00:32:52,710
I don't think I've ever seen two
people that fucking talented.

541
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,940
Like there's usually one genius and then
surrounded by a bunch of people who are

542
00:32:57,941 --> 00:32:59,800
just sitting there.
Isn't he amazing?

543
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,600
I'm so happy to be playing bass with this
genius or I'm so happy to be fucking,

544
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:07,090
I don't know,
whatever the fuck else.

545
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,380
I'm so happy to be in the ice capades
with this twirling genius. Right.

546
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:16,240
It was two of them and when I kind of
noticed about both of them is that they

547
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:20,230
just saw like most genius minds take
day [inaudible] they get rid of all the

548
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,160
fucking white noise.

549
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:25,360
Everything about every bit that
Chappelle did was just like,

550
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,800
there was no fat on it.
And he got right to the fucking point.

551
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,950
Another thing that I loved was,
uh,

552
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,940
I can't believe that I've been in this
business long enough that we're like the

553
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:40,990
older guys now.

554
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:47,030
It always blows my mind then I'm like
five years older than Dave Chappelle cause

555
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:49,010
he was already a made guy when I came in.

556
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,870
So I always look at him like he's
got 10 years on me, you know,

557
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:56,210
or 15 and you know, just when
I watch his act, I'm like,

558
00:33:56,211 --> 00:34:00,290
this guy's clearly been doing this a
good couple of decades longer than me.

559
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,180
And the reality is,

560
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,500
I think he's only been doing it
like six years longer than I have.

561
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,570
It's something like that.
He's fucking amazing.

562
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,470
And what I love too is

563
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,640
just, he's that same. Um,

564
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,410
with all that's changed,
everybody getting offended,

565
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:22,950
all of this fucking crap by you get
in trouble. He hasn't changed at all.

566
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,980
He's just like that same guy that I saw
way back in the day when I used to go to

567
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:33,981
the Boston Comedy Club in watch him go
on at like two in the morning and just

568
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:37,440
start murdering at two
in the fucking morning.

569
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,020
And I remember by just always sit there
going, how to find, or you do that,

570
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,250
how do you get that funny at two in the
morning in front of a crowd that gave up

571
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:47,940
on the show like an hour ago and they're
tired and they just want to go home

572
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,550
that second he steps on
stage. Boom. He just like,

573
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,340
he just starts fucking killing. So, um,

574
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,600
you know, days up to him murdering me
and Nia, I like just fucking laughing,

575
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,470
dying and having a great time and I'm,

576
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,530
and then he brings John Mayer back on.

577
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:09,610
I don't want to ruin the show for him
cause I don't know how many they're going

578
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:11,610
to do. But, uh,

579
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,220
basically if Dave was up there and
he would just say in like, you know,

580
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:21,270
I was watching fucking
Hawaii five o like John,

581
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,720
whatever she fucking rifts.
It's clearly that David's just ripping,

582
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,150
like mayor can play
whatever the fuck he said.

583
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:28,440
And Dave said that at one point he goes,

584
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:29,910
I don't know if you
guys realize this shit,

585
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,210
but John Mayer can play whatever he hears.

586
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,390
And then he just started
doing all this crazy shit,

587
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,420
like make it as guitar sound
like a cat or a car beeping.

588
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,560
Like it went beyond.
I can play songs,

589
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,510
like he could just do
noises around the house,

590
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,340
but it was fucking,
there was fucking incredible.

591
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,280
Um, so if you get a chance,
I don't know, you know,

592
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,900
if you get a chance to go see the show,
definitely, uh, definitely go do it.

593
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,490
Um, all right. And what that, let me, uh,
speaking of which, let me promote this,

594
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,110
um,
uh,

595
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,930
the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit and I
forgot to fucking ass Dave Chappelle if

596
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,720
he ever wanted to come in and do it.
God dammit.

597
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,830
Anyways.
All right.

598
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:24,831
Patrice O'Neal benefit
is on February 20th,

599
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:30,090
2018, uh, it makes a great gift
for Christmas. This is old copy.

600
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,290
Uh,
whatever.

601
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,420
It's a great fucking benefit.
Uh,

602
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:39,450
we have all these amazing
comedians on it and um,

603
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,480
what a great way to start the year by
seeing an all star lineup of old comedians

604
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,230
like myself,

605
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,760
all the way down to new comedians that
were influenced by Patrice O'Neal.

606
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,930
By the way. I'm going to post this video
and once a year I got a post. It, um,

607
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,640
is that one when, when Patrice
was watching the up and down game,

608
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,920
just his laugh and all of that shit.
I just got up once a year. I, I,

609
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:09,030
I kind of watched that
video once a year and um,

610
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,160
it's kind of a nice, over the years where
it became less sad for me to watch it.

611
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,280
And now it just, uh, I don't
know. I get it. I just,

612
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:20,190
I guess I got to the point in my grief,

613
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,140
which I'll never be over him not
being around, but I guess, um,

614
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,840
I've gotten to the point with my grief
where I just, I just think like, um,

615
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,670
I like what an amazing
person to have known. Um,

616
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,720
ah, see, it's still sad. It's,
it's always going to be sad,

617
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,590
but can you doubt it's going to be
fucking set. So I'll, I'll post that.

618
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,070
But those who are new to the podcast,
you know, as the years go by,

619
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,140
maybe even new to Patrice, which
blows my mind, but, uh, uh,

620
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,210
I'll post that video and then
you can go down a wonderful,

621
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:58,440
hilarious rabbit hole of anything that
fucking guy ever said. So anyways,

622
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:01,860
we're doing a benefit for his loved ones
that he was taken care of when he was,

623
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,580
uh,
still alive and a,

624
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,220
all the money after we get done paying
for the fucking venue, being upfront,

625
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,060
being transparent, uh, we'll go
to his loved ones. All right.

626
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,100
It's on February 20th in New York City.

627
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:16,200
What a great excuse to
go to New York City.

628
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,140
Go skating down Rockefella center.

629
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:22,200
Watch a bunch of great comedians on
are the greatest comic that I ever saw.

630
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,420
A Patrice O'Neil. February 20th, 2018
at the New York City Center. Alright,

631
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,110
there we go. Um, moving on.

632
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,420
Uh, did anybody watch the Celtics versus
the Houston fucking rocket? Holy Shit.

633
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,973
God Damn.

634
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,920
What a fucking game that was James hard
by the way, is, is fun to fucking watch.

635
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,660
You know I love about tech guy.
He looks,

636
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,010
he doesn't look like a basketball player.
I look at that guy and I go,

637
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:52,720
that guy knows how to play the trumpet.

638
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,470
There's something about him doesn't he
looks like one of those fucking like his

639
00:38:56,471 --> 00:39:00,360
last name should be Hargrove or
some shit. And this, I dunno,

640
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,910
something about his shorts, his
beard and his haircut. It's very,

641
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,560
he looks Aba ish even though I
guess he should have a giant Afro.

642
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,760
I don't know what, but I taped
the game. I heard how amazing was,

643
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,470
I already knew the result and I watched
the game and of course my fucking,

644
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,510
my uh,

645
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,320
my recording cut off right at the end of
the game before Al Horford hit the shot

646
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,430
and a hardened kind of had a
meltdown I guess through style.

647
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,490
Marcus smart to the floor or some shit.
I don't know what happened,

648
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:37,690
but I guess he got pissed. He went a
little bronkowske against the bills.

649
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,390
Um, by the way, congratulations
to the buffalo bills.

650
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:46,730
I was actually really
pulling for you guys, um,

651
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,280
even though you were in our
division or whatever. Um,

652
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,480
I just feel like the football
gods had punished you guys enough.

653
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,570
It was great to see you guys back.
Get back in with tie Rod Taylor. Um,

654
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,250
so congratulations on that.

655
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:07,000
And then also can you believe the
fucking NFL season is already over?

656
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,470
How does that happen?

657
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,670
I'll tell you what else
I don't understand.

658
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:15,910
How it happens is I go to see that
unbelievable rose bowl game I just fucking

659
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:20,260
saw and I didn't even talk about the game.
All right,

660
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,580
here's my breakdown or the game.
Fucking

661
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,623
okay.

662
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,640
Fucking,
here we go.

663
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,740
You know this is going to be an
intelligence breakdown of the game.

664
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,190
Oklahoma's going no huddle.
The whole fucking first half,

665
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,690
George's Goddamn head is spinning around.
They don't know what to do.

666
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:42,010
Right before the half,
they kicked an onside kick,

667
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,680
which I get this six second
slap you thinking, all right,

668
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:48,190
I don't want this guy to run this ball
back. We'll kick it to an up person.

669
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:51,850
They'll, we'll fucking tackle them,
Yada, Yada, Yada. And that'll be over.

670
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:53,770
Who the fuck knew Georgia
was going to come out?

671
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:58,210
Throw a quick fucking pass getting field
goal range and instead of being down by

672
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:00,220
three scores,
17 points.

673
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:04,150
They're only down by two scores were like
dumb fucking move and George's getting

674
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:08,710
the Goddamn ball. All
right. No, no, I'm sorry.

675
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,460
Oklahoma got the ball. They kicked
off to them. That was the thing.

676
00:41:13,461 --> 00:41:17,840
They were up by 17 fucking points and
they would get the ball after the half.

677
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,450
I mean, they had their foot on their
fucking neck. I get the onsite thing.

678
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:25,070
I don't fault fault them for that,

679
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,500
but in the third quarter
when they stopped going,

680
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:32,420
no huddle and they started playing Marty
ball and they're trying to bleed out

681
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:35,960
the fucking,
I actually get that fucking move,

682
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,490
but then Georgia scores a touchdown.
Now they've scored 10 on answered.

683
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,960
You still trying to bleed the clock.
They score another touchdown.

684
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,140
Now they've gone 17 on the
answer is still in your huddle.

685
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,770
They score 24 fucking unanswered points

686
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,640
to go up by seven before you finally
decide out of the fucking blue to go back

687
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:02,460
to no huddle.
And the second they go back to no huddle,

688
00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:06,270
Georgia has a problem again. Bam.
They score a fucking touchdown.

689
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,710
I'm running out of sound effects
because thou we, they fumble the ball.

690
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:13,200
You return it.
Now you're up by fucking seven.

691
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,840
You just got to give it to
Georgia bulldogs. Them Georgia.

692
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:22,080
God Damn fucking bulldogs. Wait.
They came back, tied it up,

693
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,670
and for the first time ever in a hundred
and I don't know how many goddamn years

694
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:29,880
of the fucking Rosebowl all right.

695
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:35,040
They had an overtime game and it doesn't
just go to one over time it goes to

696
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:35,874
two,

697
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,740
two overtimes congratulations
to the Georgia bulldogs,

698
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,170
um, on an amazing victory.
Uh, I don't know why I was,

699
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,160
I was actually, even though I'm
a big SCC guy, I was kinda torn.

700
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,500
I was a little emotionally torn.

701
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,800
I was rooting for Oklahoma
for whatever fucking reason.

702
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,540
I just decided I was
going to root for them.

703
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,750
I don't have anything
against Georgia, but, um,

704
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,380
okay.

705
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,440
I was,
uh,

706
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:09,090
I was actually also on another level kind
of sight to see Georgia wind because j

707
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:16,300
law head is so fucking pissed
that Ohio state didn't get in.

708
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,330
And he thinks the SCC is
totally fucking overrated.

709
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:21,130
MMM.

710
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,540
And you know, he was arguing
for the PAC 12. He was our,

711
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,920
it at one point he was fucking
arguing. I was like, Jesus Christ Shea,

712
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,030
it's eight o'clock. You're already
fucking wine and a by the buckeyes.

713
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,491
And he said,

714
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:36,880
the most innocent voice every pointed at
somebody else at the tailgate. He goes,

715
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:42,030
he brought it up, he pointed, he went from
like going and we, and we fucking bomb.

716
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,520
We beat Penn state and they'll
say, he goes, he brought it up.

717
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,990
So I thought it was kind of funny,
you know, and then Alabama also one,

718
00:43:52,991 --> 00:43:54,940
so both SCC teams,

719
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,030
sec teams that got in are now
going to play for the championship.

720
00:43:58,031 --> 00:44:00,250
So the SEC is going to
win another fucking title.

721
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,010
And it just cracks me up that
that's going to bug j law head.

722
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,930
And he just will not admit that the Ohio
state buckeyes had no fucking business

723
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:12,820
last year of being one of the final four,
considering they lost to Penn state.

724
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,830
And then Penn state won
the title. He goes, Bill,

725
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:18,280
you're not listening to what I'm saying.
I'm saying that Penn State got screwed.

726
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,140
But that's all he'll say.

727
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:24,670
He will not say that Ohio state did
not deserve to be in their last year,

728
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,780
despite the fact that they then went
there and lost 24, seven and he's all,

729
00:44:28,781 --> 00:44:32,160
all fucking Deshaun Watson was
unbelievable. It's like, dude,

730
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:35,890
he wasn't tackling guys too.
You scored no points.

731
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:40,510
So I feel like Ohio state this year,
God punished,

732
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,540
um,
for the fucking snooze fest.

733
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:46,730
They basically ate their balls last year.

734
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,150
They wanted to get another Saturday night,
eight o'clock spot at the club.

735
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:53,810
They like, no buddy, you're
going to get a Wednesday. Um,

736
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,130
and I actually think that Ohio state
would have done great, you know,

737
00:44:58,131 --> 00:44:59,870
considering when I watched their game,

738
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,420
how their front for are all first and
second round draft picks on the defensive

739
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:09,060
side. Um, I actually agree with j law had,

740
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:11,060
but like you don't get
your cake and eat it.

741
00:45:11,061 --> 00:45:16,061
You don't get to suck and get in and lose
by 24 points and don't even score one

742
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:18,260
fucking point the year before.

743
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,290
And then the next year when you're
actually good enough to get an also get

744
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:25,950
rewarded, you know? So that's my
beef. That's my beef with j law here,

745
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:30,290
but I still love the Getty death,
so we'll get over it. Um, anyways,

746
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:34,310
but amazing fucking game. And um, we,

747
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,770
we went the whole game without having
an incident until the very end.

748
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,710
I Dunno what happened.
[inaudible] nick was, you know,

749
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,010
a little boost up and I think he bumped
into somebody in front of us in this

750
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:47,160
fucking guy who I swear
to God was as old as me,

751
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,990
starts yelling at Barton Creek and Barton.

752
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:53,550
Nick is just staring at him and I'm
just staring at him and he's like,

753
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,500
got be a nice into you.

754
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,510
We just fucking stare at him and
I'm looking at this guy like, dude,

755
00:45:59,511 --> 00:46:03,890
you're as old as me and you're yelling
at the human version of a fucking Kodiak

756
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:04,724
bear.
Okay.

757
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,700
And the guy didn't know what she was
waiting for us to respond and we didn't

758
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,260
respond to me was just lie ahead.

759
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:14,890
We were all just staring at the guy
and they just looks at Joanie goes,

760
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:16,360
fuck you.

761
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:17,563
Okay.

762
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,250
They fucking turns around.
It's like don't,

763
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,770
between all of us were
about 225 years old.

764
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,530
This is the first rose bowl ever.

765
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:28,760
Okay.

766
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,380
That is going into fucking over time.
You want to, you want to get kicked out.

767
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:34,993
Uh,

768
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,200
you want to roll around in the
stadium floors with your fucking,

769
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,650
this guy wasn't even
wearing true religion jeans,

770
00:46:42,651 --> 00:46:46,640
which appeared for Come Dad James in the
last fucking 12 years. He's, he went,

771
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,380
I think he was, she was
probably wearing the, you know,

772
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:52,520
the lead jeans and on the tag it
just said giant bold letters. Lee,

773
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,200
you know, which, where I came from
basically meant the, you know,

774
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,660
your family was barely,

775
00:46:59,661 --> 00:47:04,070
could barely afford to
live in a blue collar town.

776
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,840
Um, if he had the legions,
the legions in the gap gates,

777
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,940
you know, you had to have
Levi, you had to have lead.

778
00:47:13,941 --> 00:47:16,520
That's how simple life was back then.
If he had Levi,

779
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,750
that meant that your parents
were actually doing well. Okay.

780
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,910
And it before, uh, diesel
jeans came in and fucked,

781
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,180
just fucked it all up.
You know,

782
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,990
jeans were like 25,
30 bucks.

783
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:36,040
And I know with inflation will just
say jeans for like 50 bucks, right?

784
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,280
Then all of a sudden diesel comes along
and they're like twice that and the next

785
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:44,680
thing you know,
there's like $200 pairs of jeans

786
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,890
that suffocate your balls and still
can't get up and over your flat ass.

787
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,500
I don't fucking understand
what I don't understand. Jeans.

788
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,650
And then that tapered in down the bottom.

789
00:47:56,651 --> 00:48:00,520
Like you're going to do ballet and
people need to see your feet, right?

790
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:05,770
Like you're going to reenact
the thriller video. Um,

791
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,890
I dunno. Anyways, let's
read some of the fucking,

792
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,050
the letters here over the a that I got,

793
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,130
if I can find them. Oh, I guess I
didn't copy and paste some, did I?

794
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,970
Where are they? All right. Here we go.

795
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,620
This is a very dramatic email.

796
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:31,210
It says it's the name of
this email is good. Bye,

797
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,070
dear bill.
I'm sadly no longer a fan.

798
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:41,440
It's really too bad because I was a huge
fan. All right. What do you think I did?

799
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:46,000
What did I say? Who
did I say it about? Uh,

800
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:50,410
went to see you and Paul Versey in Albany,
New York. Oh, that was a great show.

801
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,760
And I've watched every one of your
specials as well as F is for family.

802
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,290
And I'm an avid podcast listener.
All right? So what he's doing now,

803
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,320
and he or she is doing is establishing
that they listened to every fucking thing

804
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:09,280
that I do. This is what everybody
does when they complain,

805
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,310
you can't just complain.
You have to establish credibility.

806
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,880
Like when people argue politics,
you know,

807
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,290
they sit there and they
go, Hey, I'm a democrat.

808
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,500
I'm for gay marriage of legalizing pot.

809
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,090
But this Obama has gone too far. All
right? Or the other way around. You know,

810
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:32,080
I'm fucking level blurb, but this Trump is
what everybody does. All right? He goes,

811
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:34,590
I'm not super religious.
Oh,

812
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,360
Gj you're not super religious.

813
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:40,990
But I obviously said something
about your God. All right,

814
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:45,580
but you took it too far when you trashed
Jesus and anyone who believes in him,

815
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,830
when the fuck did I do that through?
Do you understand that this is unscripted?

816
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:53,110
I don't remember half to
shit. I said today. I mean,

817
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:56,320
if you want to take it
seriously, by all means, he goes,

818
00:49:56,321 --> 00:50:00,910
you take his shots here and there,
which is tolerable. But in the 1228,

819
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:05,440
17 replay portion of the podcast,
uh,

820
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,590
it was just too much. Oh, I
got to listen to that one.

821
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,200
I didn't hear it the first time.

822
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:15,970
And I wish whomever is picking the replays
and more of an inkling than to play

823
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,710
that expert excerpt.
As much as I wish you didn't say it.

824
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,130
Um, well, aren't you
glad that they played it?

825
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,640
So now you can know how bad a person I am.
A,

826
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:32,570
this probably won't matter to you
because at this point you don't need me

827
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,290
anymore.

828
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,090
Oh, come on. Come back in though.

829
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:40,750
Comedy Hut. That being said, I bet

830
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:44,380
promoter and a supporter for a long time.

831
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:49,470
This has to be a woman.
This they're just doing,

832
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,420
they're just going 100% guilt.

833
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,790
I'm sure you will never read this as you
probably have a screener at this point.

834
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:02,280
Uh, just taking a shot. I do
wish you continued success. Ah,

835
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,500
look at this. And they're still
going to go out as a class.

836
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:08,940
It's person's a class and nothing but
the best for you and the lovely Mia.

837
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:11,800
It's Nia with an end.
You know what? I'm a, I,

838
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:16,940
I'm saying goodbye to you the amount of
times that I said Nia on the podcast and

839
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:22,050
you still don't even know my wife's
name and you have the nerve to get upset

840
00:51:22,051 --> 00:51:24,830
with me cause I trashed
the old Jay star there.

841
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,290
Why don't you like,
what would Jesus do?

842
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:31,110
Jesus would forgive me and continue
to listen to the podcast, wouldn't he?

843
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:36,390
I would think. Um, anyways, uh,
that being said or being above,

844
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,250
uh, uh, for the lovely mia
and your daughter in there,

845
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,210
uh, Boston sucks and go fuck yourself. Um,

846
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:52,170
ps checkout, Gary Newman's new
album, all synth, but really cool.

847
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:53,323
All right.

848
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,750
P S s if you don't read
this or if you do read this,

849
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:01,250
don't use a southern accent because
I'm from New York. Lol. You know what,

850
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:06,090
but you're going to be back.
I got a feeling you're going to be back.

851
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,270
Um,
I love these fucking people.

852
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:13,320
That is just like all
the dumb shit that I say.

853
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,280
I've trashed people that smoke weed.
I trashed women.

854
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:21,960
I trashed Jesus. I trash fucking
anybody who's a Republican.

855
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:24,330
Anybody who's a Democrat,
all of this fucking shit.

856
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,260
And everybody listens and listens and
listens and all of a sudden once it,

857
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:28,560
you know,

858
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,560
fucking comes into your world like I the
trash above ground pools and all of a

859
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:35,720
sudden I've got to listen
to somebody going, hi.

860
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:41,000
You know, Jess, because I can't afford
a dig a goddamn hole in my back yard.

861
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,350
You know,
look at that right there.

862
00:52:43,351 --> 00:52:47,070
If offensive to southern people as if
there's people up north that can't afford

863
00:52:47,071 --> 00:52:50,340
to fucking have a backhoe come in there
and whatever the fuck it is that they do,

864
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:53,750
right, dig into the Goddamn ground. Um,

865
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:58,800
eh. You know what I mean? All right.
See you draw the line of Jesus for,

866
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,240
there you go.
I mean,

867
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:03,570
as far as my limited understanding
of Jesus and what exactly it was,

868
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:06,600
he was trying to prove with all this
party tricks with the fish and the bread

869
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:10,110
over there. Um, I think he was
a very forgiving person, sir.

870
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:15,140
So I think if you're truly into the
teachings of Jesus and you're truly strong

871
00:53:15,511 --> 00:53:16,740
enough spiritually,

872
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,980
you can handle one 20 minute fucking
clip from a God damn podcast from a few

873
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,140
fucking years ago. You know what the real
thing is here, sir, is you need to grow,

874
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,760
okay?

875
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,930
What I am saying is not
going to infiltrate into your
fucking soul and all of a

876
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:33,450
sudden make you possess and
have you kill your whole family.

877
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,870
Why can't you just look at me and Phil
felt sad for me that I'm going to go to

878
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:39,000
hell and that you're
going to go to heaven.

879
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:42,120
You're going to be on a
little puffy cloud. There is,
I'm burning forever, right?

880
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,740
Why don't you just look at it that way,

881
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:50,100
all right?
It's not that he's leaving.

882
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:53,190
It's that you know all
the dumb shit that I say,

883
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:57,960
all of the dumb shit that I fucking say.
And then that one thing,

884
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,250
you look past everything else,
all right? But whatever, you know,

885
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,840
more power to you. God bless you.
God bless you and your search.

886
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:11,841
I wish you well on your search to
a Jesus only positivity podcast.

887
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,410
All right? All right. Your journey to Aa.

888
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,400
Bear Dare Billy to Shift Drinking
Albino ginge dad bod once a solid C Cup.

889
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:28,350
Now a solid eight cups or moves
a lot and there's a mouthful.

890
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,213
All right.

891
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,400
Me and another friend of bill w agree
that you're qualifying story for AA is

892
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:40,430
unfolding perfectly. Uh,
right. Here we go. Um,

893
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,950
I'm an alcoholic,
so you must be an alcoholic.

894
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:52,110
All right, I'm going to lose this guy's
offense. I hate fucking gay people.

895
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:58,070
There's nothing more self-involved than
someone who has an addictive personality

896
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:02,850
and all they think is whatever happened
to them. Whatever they're going through,

897
00:55:02,851 --> 00:55:07,851
you also have to be going through because
they are the center of the fucking

898
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:12,900
universe. All right? From your
off the wagon on the wagon,

899
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:16,800
off the wagon to your,
let's try some controlled drinking.

900
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:21,060
You are perfect. A material, uh,

901
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:26,090
can't wait to hear about your surrender
and your acknowledgement that you lack

902
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,080
and that lack of power is your
dilemma. Oh, Jesus Christ.

903
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:34,500
Stop projecting all of your shit.
You fucking loser.

904
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,360
I fucking hate people in Aa. I really do.
Not all of them, but people like this.

905
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,780
Listen Dude, just because you are under
the sink during your kid's birthday,

906
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:46,750
drinking fucking mouthwash.
Don't break my balls over a F.

907
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,150
I don't have to go to your
dumb ass fucking meeting.

908
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,570
I've gone to some AA meetings.

909
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,700
The stories you guys tell my
GI is on the fucking ground.

910
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,440
You guys make me look
like a fucking fairy. Uh,

911
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,640
he's in denial right now.
The Gag gag by dude.

912
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,380
I'm going to tell you
something that I just did.

913
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,290
I just went off the wagon for six days,

914
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,940
drank like an animal yesterday
and while I was drunk,

915
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:22,740
effortlessly said, you know, and I'm
not drinking anymore effortlessly.

916
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:27,040
I didn't have to surrender and say,
I have no power over this.

917
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,170
Bad,
bad.

918
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,240
I don't need to go down to your dumb
ass group and smoked cigarettes and he

919
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:39,241
donuts with all you guys down there
with the a blown out fucking wall.

920
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,440
Flower noses. All right, I'm fine.

921
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:50,170
Anyways. And your discovery that there
is a power greater than yourself,

922
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,480
one who can solve all your problems.
Yeah.

923
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:58,560
Or one that you can dump all your shit
on. It's a great life. You could even say,

924
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:02,650
even say it's a life second to none,

925
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,880
one day at a time. Easy. Does
it keep it simple? Stupid?

926
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:11,440
I just can't wait to hear you speak
from the podium delivering a message of

927
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:14,980
hope.
It's not the meetings you make.

928
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:19,750
It's the steps you take. Thankfully,
there are only 12 of them. Ah,

929
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,800
love your biggest 32 year
old blonde Nigerian fan.

930
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,090
Uh, Hey, God bless you and your
sobriety. But no, all right, whatever.

931
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,680
Uh,
uh,

932
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:40,670
this is how my sobriety works. I just like
how I feel when I'm sober from a tall,

933
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:45,140
I like how I look. I like the weight
that I become. It's total vanity.

934
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,950
There becomes a point in
your life where you're just,

935
00:57:48,951 --> 00:57:52,580
you're just too fucking old to drink.
It just beats the shit out of you.

936
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,550
So, uh, thank you sir.

937
00:57:55,551 --> 00:58:00,140
But I don't need to go down
there and surrender and you know,

938
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:04,310
I'm telling you right now,
if you think you're a fucking alcoholic,

939
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:08,630
go to a God damn a meeting. These
fucking people, I swear to God,

940
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:11,420
they'll tell stories where like,
like they're sitting there,

941
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,810
half their nose is hanging off
their face and that just go in like,

942
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:20,110
so I take some duct tape and I fucking
take my nose back onto my face and all

943
00:58:20,841 --> 00:58:24,590
I'm thinking is I got to go back to the
liquor store and get more booze, man.

944
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,153
Okay.

945
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,790
When I got arrested for drinking and
driving about 30 fucking years ago,

946
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,620
um, I ever met why was required to
go to two AA meetings and I was like,

947
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:42,940
these people are out of their fucking,
and every story was that they would do.

948
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,460
And then I belted my wife in the face.

949
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,930
I actually hit my wife over
the head with our own child.

950
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:53,080
And the crazy thing is, is I would
say, can like, you know what?

951
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:57,820
I got to go get a drink
and I'll look,

952
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,050
I shouldn't be laughing at people that
have that much of a fucking problem. Okay.

953
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:06,790
But, um, I could tell you this, sir,
I don't need to surrender to anything.

954
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,800
All right?
I know that I,

955
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:15,990
there are times in my life when I drink
too much and I have the ability to look

956
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:19,960
at myself, say I have a problem,
and then fucking walk away from it.

957
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,100
MMM.

958
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:23,730
Okay.

959
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,170
That's it. All right.
And I want to tell you,

960
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:31,470
I want you to answer me name one of your
fucking Aa friends down there that can

961
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:35,200
come off the wagon and drank like I did.

962
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:40,060
You know the yesterday I
drank six out of seven days.

963
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:43,420
I had two drinks. One day I had a beer
the next day, didn't drink the next day,

964
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:48,460
had two drinks at the John
Mayer's Chappelle thing,

965
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:55,060
and then had two drinks the next day
and then fucking got hammered at,

966
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,110
at the Rose Bowl. And now I can
just be like, ah, I'd fuck that.

967
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:04,550
I'm not doing that now. That's
it. I can, I can do that, sir.

968
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,410
I'm sorry that you can't do that.

969
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,440
I'm sorry that you need to go down
there and put your arms around a budget.

970
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,820
They got to give you a little chip.
Every league, your little fucking cookie.

971
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:21,770
You know, God bless you. How many fucking
people might lose it on this podcast.

972
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,970
God bless you buddy. If that's
what the fuck you have to do. Um,

973
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,360
are you one of those alcoholics too
who's still a fucking cunt, you know,

974
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:35,510
and then blames everything on your
fucking disease. Oh, sorry bro.

975
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,270
I just get a lot of shit coming up.
You know,

976
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,640
you've got that built in fucking excuse.
Um,

977
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,820
anyways,
not saying they're all like that.

978
01:00:43,821 --> 01:00:47,650
Cause I know a lot of cool people
that are in fucking a, but like, uh,

979
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:50,120
I really think that if you're,
if you're an alcoholic,

980
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:54,950
that when you're drinking your life
just like falls apart. It really does.

981
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,630
You know what I mean?
Um,

982
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:03,050
I mean I wake up,
hung over for flights and it sucks.

983
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:08,380
And I definitely am not a casual drinker.

984
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,440
I'm definitely a fucking binge drinker
and I know that I shouldn't be doing that

985
01:01:13,781 --> 01:01:17,860
shit.
But if I actually had a real fucking job,

986
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:23,500
that's my biggest problem is
I don't have a fucking job.

987
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,750
So like I have to tell you like when,

988
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:35,900
you know, when I'm like really
fucking busy and I have shit to do,

989
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:40,190
I don't really drink. But the thing that
like right now it's fucking Tuesday,

990
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,080
it's nine in the morning.

991
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:47,140
I'm sitting here in my fucking pajamas
and I could just sit here for the rest of

992
01:01:47,811 --> 01:01:51,650
the, for rest of the Goddamn week.
I don't have anything to do. I mean,

993
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:55,220
if I wasn't so fucking responsible,
patting myself on the back,

994
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,230
I mean there's a bunch of shit that I
could just put off to next week and in,

995
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:04,130
I could just sit here
drinking non fucking stop.

996
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,890
So that's the problem.
My problem is my fucking free time.

997
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:14,960
So, um, I'm gonna I respect the
fact that you're trying to help me.

998
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:20,040
Um, my wife, my wife on the hand, uh,

999
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:23,790
I've told her a bunch of times saying, I
am I an alcoholic. She goes, God, Bill,

1000
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:27,330
you're not an alcoholic.
You're not a fucking alcoholic.

1001
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:32,190
So I would think that she would know. She
lives with me, but I appreciate it. Um,

1002
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,840
and all these going to say the whole
time is he's in denial. Elo, Willie,

1003
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:40,830
the bug and the example. You know what
alcoholics are like, the like Madonna,

1004
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:45,900
Madonna, we always just did over the top
shocking stuff. You know what I mean?

1005
01:02:45,901 --> 01:02:47,220
And then if you've been like Madonna,

1006
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,370
that music video sucked and
then they get to hide behind.

1007
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,080
We're all I was looking for was a
reaction. It's art. Art is just, you know,

1008
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:58,350
you can't judge it and blub
know that fucking sakes.

1009
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,550
So there you go. Um, I dunno.
Listen, I'm open to the idea.

1010
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,780
If I am an alcoholic,

1011
01:03:07,781 --> 01:03:10,540
but there's no fucking way I'll
ever be able to go to a meeting.

1012
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:13,420
There's no way I'm not going to go down
there and just not fucking laugh my

1013
01:03:13,421 --> 01:03:15,410
balls off. Listening to your, your,

1014
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,210
your fucking stories that would make
Keith Richards go. Jesus Christ.

1015
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,430
I know a guy that fucking, he
drank so much. He did a face plant.

1016
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:29,990
He's fucking teeth.

1017
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:35,030
One of his teeth fucking
went through his lower lip.

1018
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,370
All right. Any woke up the
next day with his fucking lips,

1019
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:43,580
look at like a Goddamn duck bill.
Any,

1020
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:47,840
any g immediately grabbed the
fucking, you know, a 40 ouncer.

1021
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:52,880
They put a stride so he could
keep drinking as the alcohol.

1022
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:54,380
Most of it was going in his mouth.

1023
01:03:54,381 --> 01:03:57,910
Part of it was going through
the hole that was in his face.

1024
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:02,920
Okay.

1025
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,980
As much as my moral is, I am,
I'd be like, ah, you know what?

1026
01:04:05,981 --> 01:04:10,660
I'm going to take a fucking year off
at this point. You know, so whatever.

1027
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,890
I sir,
I actually,

1028
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:16,180
I think that there's different
degrees of abusing alcohol.

1029
01:04:16,181 --> 01:04:18,370
I definitely abuse it.
Admittedly,

1030
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,020
I'm wrong and it's definitely gotten
not a control, but I'm like a habit guy.

1031
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,680
Like if I'm working out,
I'm fucking working out like a maniac.

1032
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:28,690
If I'm sitting around
and I'm eating bad food,

1033
01:04:28,691 --> 01:04:30,760
I eat bad food like a fucking maniac,

1034
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:36,010
but not to the point of like
someone that has addiction.

1035
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,620
Like I'll eat bad to the
point I put on 1520 pounds,

1036
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:43,200
I don't have to be cut out of my house.

1037
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,240
I don't balloon up a hundred fucking
pounds the way somebody who's addicted to

1038
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:49,074
food would,

1039
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,793
all right.

1040
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:56,460
And I'll go out and I'll go
on a fucking booze binge.

1041
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:59,460
It'd be like, I got to knock this
off. What the fuck am I doing?

1042
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:03,510
I got to knock this off and
I'm just kind of able to do it.

1043
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,180
And uh,

1044
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:10,860
I feel like I have to apologize to
you that I'm able to do that. Sorry.

1045
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:15,300
I mean look like I'm done right now.
I will have no problem going.

1046
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,290
I Dunno.

1047
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:22,210
As long as I fucking want to go,
you know,

1048
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,960
it's not like I'm never going to have a
glass of wine with a great fucking meal

1049
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:30,010
again. But, um, I dunno, whatever.

1050
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:34,900
I appreciate your, uh, your concern. But,

1051
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,763
um,

1052
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:40,770
I am going to be sober now just out of
vanity because I got this new fucking

1053
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:46,210
diet right.
And the Dean del Ray was telling me about.

1054
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,640
And when I do that,
when I,

1055
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:52,570
when I'm on his diet and if I just go
for a fucking walk around the block with

1056
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:55,810
my lovely daughter,
I do that a couple times a day.

1057
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:58,480
And I'm not drinking and I'm not
eating sugar or anything like that.

1058
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:01,540
I barely have to work out and I,
and I,

1059
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:06,160
the fucking, the, everything
just falls off you.

1060
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:08,303
Um,

1061
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,490
and it's the easiest way to stay in
shape and I fucking hate working out.

1062
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:14,950
So,
um,

1063
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:20,410
that's way more appealing to me then.
Um,

1064
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:24,010
you know, as much fun as I had
over the last fucking week. I mean,

1065
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:28,780
it's way more appealing at my age,
you know, and plus I got a kit,

1066
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:32,830
you know, I got to have a kid and I can't
be like, fucking, I just can't do it.

1067
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:35,350
I just can't do it. I can't have it
in my fucking life and that's it.

1068
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:39,120
So I don't need to go down there and do
all of that bullshit. All right. I'm,

1069
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:43,840
I'm a comedian. All right. I
don't like groups. All right,

1070
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,460
lady.

1071
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:50,170
Who's bad at arguing a
dear Billy backward balls,

1072
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:54,190
backwards balls a, I'm actually
a 15 year old girl. Oh,

1073
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:59,190
Jesus.
The fuck who the f Andrew,

1074
01:06:59,191 --> 01:07:02,020
you're trying to get me in trouble here.
Uh,

1075
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:06,370
so I guess you couldn't say really
say that. I'm a lady. Oh my God,

1076
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:10,000
this is already creeping me out yet. But
I love your podcast and listen to a 24,

1077
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:14,920
seven because I feel like balanced needs,

1078
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,860
oh,
balance needs to be restored to the world.

1079
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:22,120
After all the females listening to
Dr Phil and loose women have gotten a

1080
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:26,300
slightly fucked up view on things.
Uh,

1081
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,940
I respect that you're not going to let
mainstream media have the only say on the

1082
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:34,300
truth. In other words, what you're
saying is you like to hear my opinion.

1083
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:38,750
I'm not always right, but you'll listen
to it. I appreciate that. All right.

1084
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:45,400
My whole life, the 15 years
of my life, Jesus Christ,

1085
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:51,090
there's shit in my house. Said for 15
years I've been meaning to get to it. Um,

1086
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:55,300
your whole life is 15 years. That's
incredible. Uh, my whole life,

1087
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:59,830
I've been bad at arguing either I say
the wrong thing at the wrong time or I

1088
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:04,240
focus on the wrong point,
or I'm easily manipulated by guilt trips,

1089
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:07,270
et cetera. Uh, whatever it is,

1090
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,570
I can never get it right or
stand my ground. For example,

1091
01:08:10,571 --> 01:08:13,000
I have this one friend
who is literally three.

1092
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,930
I was a little,
a little three year old on the inside.

1093
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:20,060
I thought you said you were hanging
out with a three year old. I was like,

1094
01:08:20,061 --> 01:08:22,170
this is getting even more creepy.
Um,

1095
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:27,240
I can't say shit to her without a crime.
Uh,

1096
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:29,270
one time she wanted some of my food,

1097
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,540
but I told her that I hadn't had
breakfast and couldn't share that day.

1098
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,400
She said to me, you're be, you're so
mean. What the fuck is your problem?

1099
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,960
What? Yeah, you got, you get
that person out of your life.

1100
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,223
Okay.

1101
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:48,420
I just gave her some food cause I hate
it when people think bad about me.

1102
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,930
But inside I was like, bitch, what?

1103
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:56,280
It took me like two hours to realize
that she didn't even think I was mean.

1104
01:08:56,281 --> 01:09:00,240
She just wanted the food and she knew
how to get it. Oh my God. You know,

1105
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:01,074
something.

1106
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:06,620
Your thought process that it took me
till I was 37 to realize that you're way

1107
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:08,910
ahead of the curve here.

1108
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:14,040
What's your realizing for the first time
in your life is that this people out

1109
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:18,690
there that are not good people.
See. So what I did was I, I,

1110
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:24,660
I went out into the world where you are
as a 15 year old and existed as that

1111
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:29,661
person til about 37 before I actually
started to examine human behavior.

1112
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,730
And um,

1113
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,381
yeah,
so what,

1114
01:09:34,381 --> 01:09:39,170
where you are right now is when you
first start to realize that there's these

1115
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:41,720
constant in life,
um,

1116
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:46,490
what's going to happen is like two or
three days later or an hour later after

1117
01:09:46,491 --> 01:09:51,410
the moment, you're going
to be like, oh fuck yeah.

1118
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:54,590
She said Blahblahblahblahblah and not
cause she meant that it's cause she just,

1119
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:58,190
she wanted x, y, and z.
Well the more you do that,

1120
01:09:58,191 --> 01:10:00,830
the more you're going to be able to be
in the moment and you're going to catch

1121
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:03,950
people in the moment. And then once
you're able to do it in real time,

1122
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:08,360
people aren't going to be able to
fuck with me anymore. And then when,

1123
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,720
and then the only thing you'll have
to learn how to do is the judgment.

1124
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:13,160
Is this worth me?

1125
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,343
You know,

1126
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,120
applying this skill in real time.

1127
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,610
Like yesterday that guy had turned
around and yelled, fuck you at Bart,

1128
01:10:20,611 --> 01:10:23,800
nick and all that. There was like
four of us wanting him overtime.

1129
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,160
Rosebowl not even worth engaging.

1130
01:10:26,161 --> 01:10:29,460
We all just stared at him
and then he didn't know what
to do. He yelled, fuck you.

1131
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:34,080
And then he turned around and he felt
good. He said, fuck you to four guys.

1132
01:10:34,081 --> 01:10:38,160
We didn't do anything. He feels good
and insecure around his wife, you know,

1133
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:41,230
and nobody got kicked out.
Nobody had to fight or whatever.

1134
01:10:41,231 --> 01:10:43,470
And then there's other times when
you actually say something back.

1135
01:10:43,471 --> 01:10:47,220
So when he was, I'll read the
rest of this, but um, yeah.
Uh, right out of the gate,

1136
01:10:47,221 --> 01:10:49,590
you'd being too hard on yourself.
Right?

1137
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:52,410
Most of the girls in my class
are pretty weak physically,

1138
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:57,720
and it happens to be that as a girl,
I have unnaturally broad shoulders,

1139
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,630
excuse the pun,
ah,

1140
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,450
and weigh about two pounds
more than most of them.

1141
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:08,750
The fact is hard to ignore when you're
staring at their faces while they giggle

1142
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:12,510
behind their hands.
I have violent tendencies,

1143
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:16,650
which I'm working on, but I know
I can beat the shit out of them.

1144
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:22,090
And that makes it so much harder
to verbally verbally argue. Uh,

1145
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,020
they are much better at it than me.
So even when I'm right,

1146
01:11:25,021 --> 01:11:27,810
I lose and I always end up
wanting to just uppercut,

1147
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,200
sending an upper cut straight
to their fucking skull.

1148
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,153
MMM.

1149
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:36,590
Oh, whatever. All right.

1150
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,040
I would love a few pointers as to what
to do in an argument and how to tell them

1151
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:45,750
when I'm being manipulated before I start
latching onto the fucked up mind game.

1152
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:48,123
MMM.

1153
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:52,690
Of doing things. Some advice
would be great. Thanks a lot
and go fuck yourself. Ps,

1154
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:56,830
me and my sister have a huge disagreement
because it's my personal opinion that

1155
01:11:56,831 --> 01:11:58,080
guys,
whoever,

1156
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:03,090
girlfriend should still be able to go
to strip clubs and have a good time

1157
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,590
without their girlfriend getting mad.

1158
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:10,591
My sister says that for me to say that
I must have no respect for myself and

1159
01:12:10,781 --> 01:12:13,180
we'll end up with a
piece of Shit Guy Jesus.

1160
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:15,580
Also to extreme opinions and my right,

1161
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:19,630
or do I have some sort of self respect
issues that I'm not aware of yet?

1162
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:23,170
All right,
let me comment on the first fucking thing.

1163
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:24,933
All right?

1164
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:28,850
Kids are mean. Kids bullied,
they gang up on you.

1165
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,470
You never should resort to
physical violence, all right?
But what she got to do,

1166
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:38,060
and she'd got to fight fire with fire.
So what you have to do, all right,

1167
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,720
is nobody's perfect.
So you have to find that fucking thing,

1168
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,483
all right?

1169
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,270
You have to find that fucking thing,

1170
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:48,573
all right?

1171
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,290
And you just get them with that,

1172
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,363
all right?

1173
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,090
And then they,
they know it will hurt their feelings,

1174
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,760
especially if they're good
looking popular people.

1175
01:12:58,761 --> 01:13:02,270
You can really fucking
get to them all right?

1176
01:13:02,271 --> 01:13:06,200
Like here's something that I do
that I learned to do after years

1177
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:11,480
of arguing with people after my shows.
You know,

1178
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:14,220
if somebody came up to me and was
like, Hey, let me tell you fe,

1179
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:18,140
then Stephie sanded that way and you're
a fucking get gag. And as they yelled,

1180
01:13:18,141 --> 01:13:21,380
all of that, I used to try to argue
my points go, well, hey, you know,

1181
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,120
it's just jokes. I also made
fun of people in that hurricane.

1182
01:13:26,121 --> 01:13:27,500
You didn't get offended by that.

1183
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,220
You know what I learned to
do when someone was given,

1184
01:13:31,221 --> 01:13:33,760
when they were giving me
shit, I would just go, hey,

1185
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:37,340
you got something between your teeth.
That's what I would say.

1186
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,040
Even though they didn't. And then
they would be so fucking mortified,

1187
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:43,280
they walk away and then they'd
be gone. Like you know, you know,

1188
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,430
sucking on their teeth and shit and it's
just shit. Just shut them the fuck up.

1189
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,190
So you need to find your version of that.
Okay?

1190
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:53,450
So what I would do is I would
really study them all right?

1191
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,960
And what you gotta do is you just got to
find something that's wrong with them.

1192
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,880
Maybe their ear lobes are too big. And I
know this is very immature and this is,

1193
01:14:01,881 --> 01:14:06,620
this is super fucking mean. And that is
an adult. I shouldn't tell you to do this.

1194
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:09,350
Cause adults go with those people.
They're not your real friends.

1195
01:14:09,351 --> 01:14:13,180
You don't need to stoop to their level
and they give you all this fucking air

1196
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:14,890
quote, mature advice. But you know what?

1197
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:18,820
That doesn't help you when you go
back into the shit the next day.

1198
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,280
Tell a teacher, none of that
shit fucking works, all right?

1199
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,600
Because those fucking evil fucking
concert with terrible parents are going to

1200
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:33,340
find the time they're going to find you.
So that's what I would do,

1201
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:37,840
all right? There's no way. One of them
doesn't have a slightly crooked nose.

1202
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:42,370
There's no way one of them's tiddy is
a little bit bigger than the other,

1203
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:46,060
or maybe their nipples point down this
something fucked up about their chin.

1204
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:48,550
If you know,
if you got to fight fire with fire,

1205
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:53,050
if they're talking about you fucking
shoulders, all right? First of all,

1206
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:57,880
laugh at it. Learned to laugh at
yourself. All right, let's look at me.

1207
01:14:57,881 --> 01:15:02,020
I'm an old freckled bald,
redheaded count, okay?

1208
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:07,270
And all of those things should really
end any dream that I ever had in life.

1209
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,770
But if you just roll with it,
if you steer into it,

1210
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:17,960
and if I just be an old bald,
redheaded con,

1211
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:21,650
then then what can you do to me

1212
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,760
each just, you got to get comfortable. I
would get more comfortable with yourself.

1213
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:32,640
All right. And uh, I'm sure your
shoulders are fine and all of that stuff.

1214
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,840
And when they make fun of your shoulders,
laugh, and then I would say, yeah,

1215
01:15:36,841 --> 01:15:41,220
my shoulders are as fucked up as your
crooked Teddy's or just you somehow you

1216
01:15:41,221 --> 01:15:44,070
laugh at your shit and then you fucking,
you get them.

1217
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:48,550
They get them. Just tell them you
just go. Do you once, you know,

1218
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:52,510
just tell them they got bad breath.
You got any, I don't just, you'll find,

1219
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,540
I wish you know what you could have if
he just could have sent me a picture of

1220
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,070
him,
I would have helped you out.

1221
01:15:57,071 --> 01:16:01,870
But then I would've gotten in trouble
because you're teaching them to bully but

1222
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:05,150
bad, blah, blah, blah. You know,
all of these people who want to,

1223
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,720
who want to fix problems with five minutes
on fucking doctor Phil, by the way,

1224
01:16:09,721 --> 01:16:10,630
did I call it?

1225
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:15,530
You see that big scandal over there
and that granted innocent until proven

1226
01:16:15,531 --> 01:16:16,364
guilty.

1227
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:20,630
All doctor Phil fucking bringing
the guests up a notch there.

1228
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:26,600
All right. I punched a girl. Whoa.
Here's another one. Hey Bill.

1229
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:32,300
Like your input on a
situation. Uh, I was recently,

1230
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,950
I was recently at a concert,

1231
01:16:33,951 --> 01:16:37,580
some drunk skank accused me of
stealing her friend's phone.

1232
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:43,160
Uh, I told her you got the
wrong guy, her and her fuck her.

1233
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:48,161
And her father friend tried to wrestle
my phone away from me and I pushed him

1234
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:53,360
off. Then she sucker punched me in
the eye, big bruise, bloody eye.

1235
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:59,390
And her friend snatched my phone out
of my pocket due to work that came up.

1236
01:16:59,391 --> 01:17:00,680
And I told them what happened.

1237
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:04,930
He didn't seem to believe and was
clearly buddy buddy with the girls.

1238
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:08,480
So they go off and we're giggling around,

1239
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:11,060
giggling around.
I don't want the out.

1240
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:14,570
That means after a few
minutes I go up to a,

1241
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,920
to a Fatso.
Oh,

1242
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:21,590
I go up to Fatso and tell
her to give me my phone back.

1243
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,770
She realized it was
mine and handed it over.

1244
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:29,900
As I went to walk away scag
number one introduce bag,

1245
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:33,260
boyfriend accosted me
again and grabbed me.

1246
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:38,570
I punched both them in the face
and then security escorted me out.

1247
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,590
I think I was justified to
hit her in this case. What?

1248
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:46,630
Say you then go fuck yourself.
Uh, yeah, I see. I see.

1249
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:50,970
I don't have a problem with any of that.
I don't have a problem.

1250
01:17:50,971 --> 01:17:53,490
Someone gets physical with you.
You know,

1251
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,520
you take one punch to the a year
over year, physically fucked up.

1252
01:17:56,550 --> 01:18:00,330
He didn't do anything wrong. Some point
you got to defend yourself. All right.

1253
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,583
God bless you.

1254
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,780
I think he showed remarkable
restraint to only hit him both ones.

1255
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:10,810
That was an easy one. I wouldn't even,
I wouldn't even concerned about it.

1256
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:15,100
Not at all. And in fact, you probably made
both of them better people. Hopefully.

1257
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,420
Probably not. But you know, if I will, you
know, when you get punched in the face,

1258
01:18:19,421 --> 01:18:20,300
you know,
if you're an adult,

1259
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:22,390
at some point you gotta be looking
at yourself going like, all right,

1260
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:26,440
did I do something there? If you
didn't, then you're like, all right,

1261
01:18:26,441 --> 01:18:29,260
this person's an asshole and I need to
have them out of my life. But you know,

1262
01:18:29,261 --> 01:18:33,040
if you did, you got to be that guy and I
was kind of shooting my mouth off there.

1263
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:37,930
Right? That's what I would do. Um,

1264
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:42,340
all right, got two girls pregnant
help. Uh, dude, I can't help you.

1265
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:48,910
There's no help for this. Uh, I buckled
down for the next fucking 18 years.

1266
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,260
All right.
Hello Bill.

1267
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:54,130
I have a big problem and I'm hoping
that you and the lovely Nia can help out

1268
01:18:54,131 --> 01:18:54,851
with it.
All right,

1269
01:18:54,851 --> 01:18:58,420
let me start by saying that I don't live
in a trailer is something I'm a normal

1270
01:18:58,421 --> 01:18:59,680
26 year old guy.

1271
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:03,280
I was dating this girl and we broke up
a couple of months ago when we broke up.

1272
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:05,680
A couple of weeks later,
I met this little Hottie,

1273
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:10,090
I started hooking up with her and then
I got a call a couple of weeks ago.

1274
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:14,530
My Ex is three months pregnant
with my child and she's keeping it.

1275
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:16,370
Okay.

1276
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:18,650
I then broke things off with
the hottie. Well, guess what?

1277
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:23,060
I knocked her up to buddy.
Did you ever take a health class?

1278
01:19:23,061 --> 01:19:25,160
Do you know how to fucking
tell people get pregnant?

1279
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:29,270
Neither one knows the other is pregnant
then I have no idea what to do.

1280
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:34,550
I broke things off with the Hottie to
work on being there from my ex and the

1281
01:19:34,551 --> 01:19:35,384
kid.

1282
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:39,800
I want to be there for her and help
her out with all the prenatal stuff.

1283
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:43,880
It'd be a great dad. Now it sees my
life is not going to be that way.

1284
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:48,200
The other girl wants to have the baby too.
I use protection with this girl,

1285
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:52,670
but not enough, I guess.
What does that mean, dude?

1286
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:55,610
If you use a condom, I would get
a maternity. Uh, first of all,

1287
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:57,590
I would make both of them subject to it.
Okay.

1288
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:59,510
Because you broke up for
a couple of months, right?

1289
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:05,090
Get a maternity test times to do not
give either one of them a fucking dime or

1290
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:09,210
else, you know, in some states, the second
you start paying, that kid is yours.

1291
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,610
That's the first thing I would do.

1292
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,730
First thing I would do was tell
both of them your situation.

1293
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:18,360
The second thing I would get more,
make more both of them get a fuck,

1294
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:22,270
isn't a maternity test. A paternity
test. I said maternity, paternity tests.

1295
01:20:22,271 --> 01:20:26,260
They go, oh, Jesus, uh,

1296
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:28,770
the other girl wants to have
the baby to blah, blah, blah.

1297
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,100
My ex was on birth control
yet I still knocked her up.

1298
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:39,760
If I had to be with one of them, it would
be the new girl because she is harder.

1299
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:45,840
I'm a pig Sumi and we also
like a lot of the same things.

1300
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:49,600
What should I do? I'm so sick in an
exhausted of worrying about this.

1301
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,230
I just want to do the right things.
Thank you. And Go fuck yourself. Well,

1302
01:20:53,231 --> 01:20:56,860
I would tell both of them what's going on.
I would get a paternity test,

1303
01:20:56,861 --> 01:20:57,760
not a maternity tests.

1304
01:20:57,761 --> 01:21:01,900
Get a paternity test and make
sure those are your kids.

1305
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:04,840
And I would, if you want to be with
the Hottie, be with the hottie.

1306
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,900
There you go. And then I would
stay in the life for the other one.

1307
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,100
That's what I would dope.

1308
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:16,390
And I would fucking get a vasectomy or
cut up a garden hose because whatever the

1309
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:21,740
fuck you're using is not working.
All right. That's the podcast.

1310
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:26,570
Oh, it's a long, one hour and 20 minutes
here. A happy new year to everybody.

1311
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,560
Uh, good luck, Tia. Um,
I apologize to anybody.

1312
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,060
The AA or whatever the fuck it is.
Um,

1313
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:40,650
and that's it. I'm sipping my tea,
going to go eat healthy. All right.

1314
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,600
And I will go back to booze at
some point if I fucking want to,

1315
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:48,940
cause I don't think I have a
problem. All right, that's it. Uh,

1316
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,480
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
