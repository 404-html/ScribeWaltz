1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,960
HEY WHAT'S GOING ON.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,320
IT'S BILL BYRNE It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday July 17th

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:10,960
2017. What's going on. How are you.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,460
July 17 2017 I'm going to go play that.
No.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,380
No that shit.
Maybe you still do it.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,120
Always remember that if all of a sudden
you know somebody's got something like a

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,400
receipt or something and there
was a couple the same numbers.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,570
That's what I'm gonna play. I'm gonna go
down there and played on the megabucks.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,480
That's what they had
Massachusetts megabucks.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,440
My favorite one best name ever for any
lottery I thought was set for life.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,310
That was just the perfect phrase
every blue collar working stiff.

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,860
That's what they want do just fucking
set for life just sitting there having a

13
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:58,531
fucking beer checks rolling in don't
gotta worry about nothing set for life.

14
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,010
All right kids if you're working class
you will you work paycheck to paycheck

15
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,050
and it becomes a fuckin grind
set for life.

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,870
Dude I could fucking sit right here right.

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,160
I COULD FUCKING SIT RIGHT HERE DO JUST
FUCKING stare into my fucking toes and I

18
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:24,280
still got that shit coming in every
month for the rest of my life.

19
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,590
You know why kid because I'm set for life.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,920
You hear about Mikey Doty
hit the fuckin set for life.

21
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,600
He's fuckin set for life. Kid doesn't
have to do shit. Fuckin cock sucker.

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,813
God bless him.

23
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,480
Anyways I'm in a great goddamn mood.
Why.

24
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,980
Because I get eight hours sleep last
night despite the fact my daughter is

25
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,220
just waking up and she's trying
out her voice now where she sits.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,950
Remember when Mariah Carey used
to hit those really high notes.

27
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,630
SHE'S DOING THAT AND EVERY TIME I LOOK
OVER LIKE OH MY GOD SHE'S JUST LOOKING AT

28
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:09,260
ME AND SHE HAS LIKE HER LEGS ARE
everything's like up in the air and she's

29
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:12,800
smiling at you. It's like impossible
to get upset. You just start laughing.

30
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,740
It's actually riffing about that
this weekend in Grand Rapids.

31
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,290
At one if that works as an adult.

32
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,500
You cut somebody off in traffic and they
look over you if you somehow flexible

33
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:25,250
enough we could just put both arms and
both legs in the air just give him that

34
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,420
fucking baby grin.

35
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,620
That might have been the creepiest image
I've ever seen. I've ever thought of.

36
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,960
There you go.
It would just creep them out.

37
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,960
Be like oh my god that
guy would be driving.

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,600
I think there's something wrong with
them in the mental department there.

39
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,180
So anyways I want to thank everybody that
came out to the shows at the Fountain

40
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,740
Street Church in Grand Rapids Michigan.

41
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,260
It is and it is continuing to be one
of my favorite gigs I've ever done.

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,670
I know I always say I'm going to put up
pictures like I didn't put up a picture

43
00:02:58,671 --> 00:02:59,290
my drum kit.

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,190
Like I said I was going to and I'll tell
you why because you know I got these

45
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:08,810
cymbal stands and the ones that I want
I just wanted the single bracket ones I

46
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:12,020
don't like those double bracket like I'm
going to go play in a fucking hurricane.

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,390
They weigh nine thousand goddamn pounds.

48
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,500
I accidentally ordered those
instead of the ones I wanted.

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,790
So I had to return those and now today
I'm going to pick up the right ones I

50
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,180
just want to have it all set up when
you see it. I want you to see it right.

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,660
I want to have the fucking right look.

52
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm not going to have it like you know
here's the car I bought and I don't have

53
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,540
this fucking.
The tie is on it so.

54
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,980
But speaking of drums my booking
agent my Reuben Kincaid is you know.

55
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,510
Tell them how much fun I
have when I go on the road.

56
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,680
If I find a place where I can go play
drums he goes you know we could put it in

57
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:52,460
your rider that you know any time you
do a couple nights at a theater they can

58
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:55,790
set up a drum kit there and
go get the fuck out of here.

59
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,830
That sounds like some diva shit
he goes in he goes. Do they.

60
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,450
They have music acts there all the time.
It's no big deal.

61
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,670
So I was like All right.

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,480
So I show up at the Fountain Street Church
and they had a fucking bear and this

63
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,690
Yamaha kit with this fucking horrific
white trash like leopard skin rap I don't

64
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:21,530
know what.

65
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,490
I don't know what to call it.

66
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,520
It was like somewhere between the
Stray Cats way back in the day and

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,790
poison maybe you know it actually looked
like the fuckin stretchy pants that the

68
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,980
slutty girls would wear at
the heavy metal concerts.

69
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,100
It was the same kind of print.

70
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,850
And I'm looking at those things
going like What the fuck are these.

71
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,660
And she goes Don't worry.

72
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,440
Everybody always says that sit down and
play him and the kick sounded amazing

73
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,720
and I was able to thanks
to my drum teacher.

74
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,440
You know I have a game plan when I try
to tune something up and I got this snare

75
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:55,290
to sound great and I went in
on those fucking hilarious.

76
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,510
I go in there on Saturday to play and
I'm like about an hour before the doors

77
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:00,344
open.

78
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,010
So I went in there and I
was fucking wailing on him
and when I got off the kid I

79
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,973
know what I was little.

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,500
I can like the place where the priest
dresses and shit you know puts on all the

81
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,740
fucking flowing ponchos and shit.

82
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,950
And I walked out and there was no one in
the church and I walked in the parking

83
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:19,220
lot there was like fucking six of the
security guys just standing out there.

84
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,830
It's like sorry sorry.

85
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,260
It was still it would've been great if
they actually had him out on the stage.

86
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,130
I would've left him there for the show
wouldn't a bug me but it would have

87
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,810
sounded fucking unbelievable.

88
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,360
This giant church and I didn't realize
because you know last time I played there

89
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,190
only played one night
it kind of came in town.

90
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,990
I did it I was like
What the hell was that.

91
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,010
That was fucking
incredible and then I left.

92
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,810
But this time I was there for like two
days three nights and I was able to read

93
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:53,180
up on the history of it.
Listen to this shit.

94
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,380
This is all the people that perform
there because there was no bigger venue.

95
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,200
That was the biggest venue in the

96
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,240
I guess Western Michigan or whatever.

97
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,520
Or at least in Grand Rapids.

98
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,150
So if anybody big came there
they went there everyone.

99
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,200
Winston Churchill spoke there.

100
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,750
Helen Keller spoke there blind and deaf
learned how to fucking read and write

101
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,210
and speak.
Somehow figure that one out.

102
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,240
Who else. Amelia Earhart. Malcolm X.

103
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,550
They say Winston Churchill.
Duke Ellington. Ella Fitzgerald.

104
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,400
Dave Brubeck.
Led Zeppelin Pink Floyd.

105
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,820
You two in like 1984 played there.

106
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,100
I think Zeppelin and Pink Floyd was
obviously on their first tours and that's

107
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:46,030
just that's just what I can
remember trying to picture
when I was looking at the

108
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,860
wall. Who else I saw there. I
mean it was fucking incredible.

109
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,340
Eleanor Roosevelt and they have like
pictures of him and their little thank you

110
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:58,090
notes and shit was fucking ridiculous.
B.B.

111
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:01,080
King and then make that.

112
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,830
I think I said that the video that I
took which I will actually post and I

113
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:10,180
promise you I'll give you a
picture my my drum kit this week.

114
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,350
So anyways we are on to episode two of
efforts for family we're recording the

115
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:17,884
first one.

116
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,960
Just remember this just
remember me telling this
recording the first one on July

117
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,760
18th 2017. You wait to see how long
it takes before you fuckin see it.

118
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,010
Fuckin animation it
takes forever.

119
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,980
But anyway let's let me talk about a
which I talk about here. How about this.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
How about how great fucking Grand Rapids
is and it's one of my favorite cities.

121
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,700
I was there with Dean Del Rey and he was
fucking murdering all week and yet he

122
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,110
had a bunch of fans came out to people
flying in to see him and then he went on

123
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:55,480
to Detroit to go play some rock club
like after after our show Saturday night.

124
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,980
But there was this place a course
post forget the fucking name of it

125
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,410
but they had all these old video games
in there. The fuck was it called.

126
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,030
And why is my stomach still growling.

127
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,590
I had a bowl of cereal trying to starve
myself before the fucking acting gig.

128
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,160
Oh by the way thank you for all your guys
suggestions sack slash criticism of my

129
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:23,200
my dating or whatever guy goes Dude
you can't say you're crushing it.

130
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,340
You know you crushed it. If at night
you still haven't a drink or two.

131
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,150
It's like you fucking think I don't
realize that Mom. Yes I realize that

132
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,643
but anyways

133
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,200
what was it called Stella's is some shit
I can't fucking remember but we went

134
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:45,590
down there and they evidently they had
a great burger which I didn't have.

135
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,810
Went to this healthy place
and got this fuckin rap.

136
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,190
Right in a water water and then we went
over there because they had all these

137
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,670
pinball machines and shit.

138
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,860
Me and Deena fuckin all
shit and we walked in there.

139
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,400
They only had one pinball machine
but they had all these great

140
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,890
old video games and we showed up right
and we sounded like two fucking kids.

141
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,610
D just goes.
They got asteroids.

142
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,920
That we blew out and bugs play in that

143
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,850
I've never been one of those guys.

144
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,290
Never been a video game guy.

145
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,420
Just haven't been because
they're so fucking awesome.

146
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,310
They were like addicting
but that is something.

147
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,910
Remember back in the day when you would
watch MTV Cribs and then like these

148
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:33,380
fucking people would have these
video games in their in their houses.

149
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,880
And I saw a sink like I always feel
like you buy those and then you never

150
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,910
fucking use them like you use it for like
the first day and then it's just like

151
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,650
oh wait I gotta go to work you know I
have to work so I can pay for this big

152
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,880
giant stupid machine that I could've
just pumped a couple of quarters into and

153
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,610
let somebody else own and deal
with the fucking maintenance.

154
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,660
How if I was ever gonna buy one it would
be asteroids and my number two is a

155
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:01,430
game that not a lot of people know about.
And

156
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,540
I think for the most part
they've all disappeared.

157
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,760
It was a fucking great game at least.

158
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,640
I loved that it was called
elevators and it was basically.

159
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,480
I vaguely remember it.

160
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,750
It was like Spy Versus Spy kind of thing
you were dressed in white and all the

161
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:21,870
bad guys were dressed in black almost
kind of looking dark dressed like despite

162
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,930
a spy from Mad magazine and you had to
so you get in an elevator and on each

163
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:30,950
floor there were these bad guys and as
you passed the floor they'd be shooting

164
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:34,280
at you from the right or towards from the
left and you had to get all the way up

165
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:37,370
to the top of the building and get
something and then come back down again.

166
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,560
And the worst was when you were going
back down again and you'd be shooting at

167
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:46,550
the guy and the guy would duck and lay
down on the floor and as you went by when

168
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:49,940
you couldn't raise your gun up and it
was just your head at floor level he blow

169
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,990
your fuckin brains out.

170
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,250
I used to play that one I buy
either one of those I guess.

171
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,090
No I wouldn't I wouldn't fucking waste
of money but I'll go out we had a great

172
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:05,070
time and I got a killer picture of Dean
and his total fucking rock star pose

173
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,790
playing the game and I think
he already tweeted it out.

174
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,250
So if you look at Dean Del Ray's
Twitter thing you can find that shit.

175
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,810
So we did that and I want to thank people
that Dr. grins comedy club I went down

176
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,650
there and did a quick spot

177
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,700
you know went up did
some jokes or whatever.

178
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,750
And it was funny when Dean was up there
he fuckin started trashing this woman

179
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,810
who's sitting in the front row because
she wouldn't shut up and I said to the

180
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,250
other comics got they're gone.

181
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,420
I like one of those deals as a comedian
you'll be onstage and someone's talking

182
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:43,260
and commenting on your jokes and then
you don't realize most the crowd can't

183
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:43,740
hear it.

184
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,690
So if kind of supposed to ignore it I
guess even though it's driving you nuts so

185
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,970
he just fucking snaps and trashes her.

186
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,430
And I would sit in the back of the club
I said to the other comedians it's like

187
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:55,200
you know it's funny we could
even hear what she said.

188
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,810
You probably should've just kept going
I go I've made that mistake twenty

189
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:02,010
thousand fucking times.

190
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,480
Then I went up next and I did the
exact same thing exact same thing and I

191
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:11,481
fucking trashed her and then she got mad
you know said she was offended by for

192
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:15,540
some fucking joke I did about the troops
or some shit like that said no it isn't.

193
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,900
No it isn't I know when you got offended
you fucking ego maniac but I looked and

194
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:22,350
I said something to the effect of Why
would you think that you have anything

195
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,770
interesting to say. Was one of
those lines which was just really.

196
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,290
You know now that I've said it out
loud and I've kind of gotten out of the

197
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,930
emotion it was I was really mean
I went mean that's what I did.

198
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,160
I went fuck in me

199
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,950
so many ways.
Oh by the way somebody tried to scam me.

200
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,560
They tried to scam all Frankel

201
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,180
who you think are dealing with here are
some fucking rap bald Ralph Mal fucking

202
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,640
motherfucker what you are.

203
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,210
That doesn't mean you can scam
me though they almost did.

204
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,920
If I wasn't so fuckin paranoid

205
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,230
I'm hanging in the hotel and I get this
phone call and I pick it up and it's

206
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:05,830
just this computer going out that saying
that they were calling from Apple and

207
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:09,580
that there was a problem with my cloud
and somebody might be breaking into it.

208
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,080
They go you know call this number blah
blah blah blah blah and I'm like Oh you

209
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:18,190
gotta be fucking kidding me so I stole
it and they say that number twice I can't

210
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,024
remember it.

211
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,740
So I just start taking a guess and I
punched in like out of the you know 10

212
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:28,450
numbers you know 1 8 8 8 whatever I
got about 6 in and immediately starts

213
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:32,340
dialing and I somehow get
connected now right there.

214
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,370
That should have tipped me off that these
people are just fish and looking for

215
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:40,660
somebody to react to it. So I dialed like
six other fucking 10 digits I needed.

216
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,810
And then this guy's I low
but the Bubba and I was like Yeah.

217
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,390
You guys just call it what is this
referring to is like you fucking called me

218
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,110
spy my soundcloud or whatever and they go
oh yes yes you have a security problem.

219
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,770
But I go well whose fucking fault is that.

220
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,970
I go Why did you guys set up the cloud
if it wasn't going to be like safe.

221
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,840
Now you've exposed me all this
shit because what I fuckin.

222
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,970
Because I downloaded the Royal Blood
fucking album now all of a sudden some is

223
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:17,960
gonna drain my bank account you
computer cunts I wasn't cursed but I was

224
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:18,794
flipping out.

225
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,240
And then he goes so sir we can help you
we can help you over the phone we just

226
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,710
need to access your computer.

227
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,380
I go You mean access my computer
and the guy just started talking to.

228
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,360
I go I go I don't do that over the
phone he goes Sir this is a very.

229
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,570
So this is a secure fucker blah blah blah.
I go well how to.

230
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,910
How do I know I could because you say so.
Basically I wouldn't fucking do it.

231
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:47,330
Just because I was looking at I was
looking at them like they were legit but I

232
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:50,270
was just like well you already got hacked
why the fuck would I go with you again.

233
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,280
Why don't I just go to the store.

234
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,180
So little he got to the point he goes
Sir this is this is a secure but bubba

235
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:59,510
bubba bar. I just kept going like
Well I don't even know who you are.

236
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,670
You just for I know you're one of the
guys fucking trying to hack into my

237
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,570
computer dude.

238
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,060
I literally felt like I
was in the Bourne Identity.

239
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,750
You know when you don't know who to trust
you don't you just fucking yelling at

240
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,400
the other guy go you put your gun down.

241
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,380
You put your gun down first right.

242
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,780
So finally he gives up on me and he goes
So here's your case number and you know

243
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,643
I'll fucking you know.

244
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,340
He said some dumb shit you've
been to Turkey or Jordan recently

245
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,080
it's like No no I saw the 30 for 30 UNled
bias when he fucking went one on one

246
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:32,520
against Michael Jordan.

247
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,230
Do you call in Michigan
you fucking asshole.

248
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,520
So anyways he ends up transferring me
and it just fucking hangs up and then I'm

249
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:44,750
like flipping the fuck out.

250
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,220
So I called the guy produces my fucking
show and he just goes why he goes yeah.

251
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,400
Apple doesn't call anybody.
He goes now man that's just bullshit.

252
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,380
So thank God I'm a paranoid Jackass or I
might let something happen there so I'm

253
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:01,220
just putting that out there like you know
I'm sure all you young guys know what

254
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:04,700
it is and you feel so smart and you're
gonna shake your head and laugh your ass

255
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:05,610
off at me on Twitter.

256
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,290
Going like you fucking know
do you know like it's 2017.

257
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,640
I learned that back in 2010 did you.

258
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,250
What else did you learn how not to play
a guitar and then still call yourself a

259
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:23,600
musician. Oh Bill Bill. Come along
let's not be the old guy here huh.

260
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,330
I gotta be honest with you Del Ray played
me some of that Skrillex guy stuff and

261
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,320
I fuckin really liked it.

262
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,500
I thought it was way different than
anybody else and that's what I'm learning.

263
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,150
Whenever something new comes out as much
as your old ears listen to it and say

264
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:39,080
what the fuck is that.

265
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,170
You just have to know that there's
going to be the fucking Jimi Hendrix The

266
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:49,541
Richard Pryor the Tom Brady the James
Brown the fucking would is gonna be you

267
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,700
gotta find out who that person is of the
thing that you're listening to and then

268
00:16:55,701 --> 00:17:00,230
you can judge it OK it goes but I swear
to God it goes right back to New York

269
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:02,990
pizza all these fucking dopes
get off the fuckin plane.

270
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,260
The first place that's his famous New
York pizza they eat it and then they go.

271
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,510
This pizza sucks here.

272
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,530
It's like now you did you
didn't go to the right place OK.

273
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,150
He didn't go the right place and deejays
are like New York's pizza in that

274
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,680
fucking everybody thinks they can do it
you know and everybody's claiming that

275
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:25,000
they're the real fucking
deal and everybody's saying
they're famous everybody's

276
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,040
famous Ray the fucking deejay and

277
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,630
I actually I really liked to shit.

278
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,280
I was like you know and I could
actually fucking get the car and drive.

279
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,560
Listen to this shit especially at night
like this great like drive and songs

280
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,020
like the whoo eminence front.

281

Do you ever wanna when a bunch
of fuckin money playing poker.

282
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,830
That's it. Just get your money leave. Get

283
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,840
in your car buy yourself the fuckin
window down and you listen to that song as

284
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:58,390

scream what the top five moments of your

285
00:17:58,391 --> 00:17:59,224
life.

286
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,720
Oh fuck you I'm old

287
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,280
anyways what else.

288
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,050
When I saw I want to.

289
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,630
Oh did you guys watch all the Mayweather

290
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,370
McGregor pressers as they call them
overseas the press conferences.

291
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,160
It's kind of the same thing over and over
again with Conor McGregor he just kept

292
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:29,080
going like What the fuck
what the fuck is wrong with you.

293
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,750
He's got on a contract suit.

294
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,040
That form VOLTRON thing was dumb and I
loved when he trashed him on that but I

295
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:39,850
will tell you this.

296
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,850
Watching all of those people showing up
for a fucking press conference they sold

297
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:48,430
out the Barclays Center they sold out
were like the Maple Leafs play I believe

298
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:49,264
in Toronto.

299
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,140
The Staples Center people showing up
to watch a fucking press conference.

300
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,900
I can tell you this cynical Bill's
going to ruin the pay per view for you.

301
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,770
Those press conferences are
gonna be better than the fight.

302
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,060
You know and the fucking people that are
gonna order that goddamn fight are the

303
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:08,170
same fucking people that slow down on
the highway to watch somebody change of

304
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:11,880
fuckin tire
day.

305
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,540
It's like it's just beyond
it's beyond a spectacle.

306
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,850
I mean people go like you know I know
it's a spectacle but you know it didn't

307
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,580
just a word to fucking work.

308
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,380
Yeah I know getting fucked in the ass
but I want to see what it feels like.

309
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,020
Though that pay per
view can go fuck itself.

310
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,900
Do they ride in on the same
plane over the fucking London.

311
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,690
Get the fuck out of here and all
this shit McGregor gives Mayweather.

312
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,570
There's one topic he completely avoids
because it would fuck with ticket sales

313
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,500
which kind of makes him part of the
fucking bullshit of that whole thing.

314
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,200
You know what I mean it's
just get the fuck out.

315
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,250
I dunno I forget that I've given that guy
enough fucking goddamn money given him

316
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:59,110
enough fucking money.
I've gotten fucked enough

317
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,210
I've got fucked enough by that guy way
like it's professional boxers can't lay a

318
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:06,620
fucking hand on him and
I'm fucking not enough.

319
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,330
By the eighth round as he'd poo poo
poo poo point him to fucking death

320
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,580
now he's going to fight a guy who's
not even a bot who used to box.

321
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,760
I love they used to box. Yeah there's
a lot of people used to do stand up.

322
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,570
You want to see them do an HBO special.

323
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,310
Here's the bottom line if they ever met
each other in a bar and started swinging

324
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,220
McGregor would fucking kill him he'd
take him to the ground and then the

325
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,930
Mayweather would know what to do.

326
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,000
So they've eliminated all of that we know
Bill you've said that so I don't know.

327
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,500
Anyways. Maybe McGregor's
I mean Mayweather is ego
maybe tries to knock him out.

328
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,080
I'm just not I'm not going to
fucking watch it. I'm really not.

329
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,890
I think what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to get out on the highway when the fuckin

330
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:54,430
fight is on and just cruise
down the highway doing 90
miles an hour just looking

331
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:56,050
around going like this is
what it should be like.

332
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,470
Like if I was running shit this would
be the level of people that were in the

333
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:00,304
world.

334
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,070
I was joking on my own this weekend in
Grand Rapids saying you know what I would

335
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:11,071
do if I was running shit on the night
of the Mayweather McGregor fight I would

336
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,810
turn all the buffalo wild
wings into gas chambers.

337
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,880
All those fuckin mouth breathing morons
that were jerseys you know with other

338
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:23,560
men's names on the back all day all day.

339
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,320
So I call it.

340
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,360
All of those guys just just gone all of
them gone and you'd watch I bet I bet

341
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,120
the mean the level of meanness on
on on the Internet would go down.

342
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,820
You know these five by the way these
fucking people now who just sit there and

343
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:47,620
they watch CNN or Fox all day long and
then they show up to you and they just

344
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:52,030
start vomiting out all this fucking
fearful shit that they just watched.

345
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,980
And then after they do that and get you
all stirred up they don't even have the

346
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,170
decency to offer a fucking solution.

347
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,150
All these fucking morons it's just like
why would you sit there and watch Fox

348
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:06,040
News all day.
That's all you're gonna do.

349
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Watch a little CNN balance out you
fucking lies keep yourself level

350
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,480
fucking what's his face.

351
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,970
My buddy was telling me this weekend you
know it's going global warming is going

352
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,490
to get so hot you know they're saying
they're not gonna be able to fly planes

353
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:20,324
onto LaGuardia

354
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,620
and I'm not I mean I'm thinking like
how the fuck am I going to be a comedian

355
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:28,040
anyway. And then that was it. He
didn't offer any fuckin solutions.

356
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,370
He just let me know. Like in the
future you know we will do your job.

357
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,020
Then I'm starting to fucking think about
you know me my family living out in the

358
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:40,710
street all I want to do is just say
he's going to play the last rites.

359
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,330
You know if you don't have
a fuckin solution don't
bring up the goddamn problem

360
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,530
okay. Like I brought the economy
Gregor Mayweather. All right.

361
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,980
I said it's a fuckin problem.
I gave you your solution.

362
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,960
You drive on a highway 90 miles an hour
and you turn the Buffalo Wild Wings into

363
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,070
a gas chamber.
See that.

364
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,780
See that I'm a good guy.

365
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,780
Everybody else is an idiot. In my world
I'm the smartest person in the room.

366
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,380
Sorry. Well we went for the
fuck do you want for me.

367
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,680
You know watching my kid all day today.

368
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,930
I waste fucking tired.

369
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,110
I can't take my goddamn pass where I'm
not watching now obviously while I'm doing

370
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,230
the podcast but that's only
because I curse so much.

371
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,520
I'm trying not to do that in front of
her which I know I'm gonna fail fuckin

372
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:29,354
miserably.

373
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,990
It takes up to being it
being a dad is this shit. It
really is. I fucking love it.

374
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,840
You know it's the best thing
about it is watching kids shows.

375
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,460
I don't know that I'm a fucking moron
or whatever but I am legitimately

376
00:23:43,461 --> 00:23:47,450
entertained. We started watching
cars this morning. It's tremendous.

377
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,080
I mean you know it is I watch
cartoons it's so fucking long.

378
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,950
It's like the level of animation
on those things is crazy.

379
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,010
Like I think I saw one of those
toy stories one or two of them.

380
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,490
But you know when you when you don't have
a kid it's like you know why would you

381
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:09,491
go see one of those lets you smoke weed
like hey man let's get high and go see

382
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,690
fucking toys.

383
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,183
All right.

384
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,700
Or you know you're dating a woman they
always like seeing those they're cute.

385
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,920
I like to make foods and you end up
go in there and you just sit in there.

386
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,260
I just fucking I remember I saw one of
those toy stories like they were going

387
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:27,920
down something and they were all this
conveyor belt they went into a pit of

388
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:32,450
flames and the level of fucking anxiety
that it brought me I got like angry at

389
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:37,040
the movie like this is a fucking kid's
movie I shouldn't be feeling this way why

390
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,020
do I care so much about
these goddamn toys.

391
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,690
Which is one of the reasons why I
don't watch movies because I I take the

392
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,524
fucking ride.

393
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,510
When people watch scary movies
they go to that movie and scare me.

394
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,510
They all scare the fuck out of me
because I just I I take the fucking ride.

395
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,170
I never just I never
fucking pulled myself out.

396
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,940
Look around the theater
going and it's just a movie.

397
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,100
There's no reason I get this
fucking upset this is stupid.

398
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,080
That's just an actor and when he
takes they did. I don't do that.

399
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,680
I get sucked in and it's
fucking over it's fucking over.

400
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,310
And then I end up getting freaked
out and I walked to my car.

401
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,260
You know and I'm thinking of the
fuckin Blair witch is gonna get me

402
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,210
all right.

403
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,210
I think I think I
babbled long enough here.

404
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,790
Let's let's do a little bit of let's do
some advertising let's get to actually

405
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,490
the funniest part of the podcast
me trying to read out loud.

406
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,020
All right frame bridge everybody.

407
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,620
Oh you know what frame bridge evidently
is the easiest way to custom frame your

408
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:38,460
favorite art in photos is it.
We can't.

409
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,630
You know you're not the easiest
ways to give it to your partner.

410
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,580
Could you do me a huge favor and handle
this big pain in the ass fucking job.

411
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,230
But if you're actually cool and you don't
want to do that to your wife or your

412
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:52,200
husband or your fuckin transgendered
person whatever I'm trying to be

413
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:54,150
politically correct or whatever
the fuck you're living with.

414
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,800
Maybe you're a Gore phobic in
a sexual split personality.

415
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,160
Don't do it to the other person in you.

Useless cell phone pics.

He took a screenshot of something because
you needed to remember a phone number

455
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,030
and then like months later
you're scrolling back trying
to find that picture you

456
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:27,320
when you got on the hang glider in one
of the photos you got to scroll past the

457
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,700
fucking 1 800 number for
the Smokey Robinson C.D..

458

00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,930
You know and all of a sudden fucking
two laps to go his fucking tire goes up

570
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:31,350
front left one right and then all the
towns you like me all right fuckin vandals

571
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,350
all got damn pissed.

572
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,450
I think I have a I think I know who my
favorite fuckin driver is though I like

573
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,610
that. How have you seen
its first name Black Belt.

574
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Val Terry Botha's that guy that guy can
fucking drive he went from ninth place

575
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,340
all the way to second place.

576
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,220
I know I've talked about Lewis Hamilton
and these guys going from fucking you

577
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:56,820
know night to like what's his face
yesterday the Australian fucker do they're

578
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,470
the happiest guy in fucking Formula One.

579
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,540
Jesus Christ babe I swear to God if
another fucking names in front of me know

580
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,670
what is that reckoning.

581
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,760
There's too many hours there's too
many fucking like crazy fuckin.

582
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,770
The nerve of these people to be put from
other cultures. It was a day is it Dave.

583
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,930
Dave. Fucking Jesus.

584
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,810
I only met the fucking guy. I've only
been rooting for him. Daniel Ricardo.

585
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,723
There we go.

586
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,620
The fuck would pop back into my head as
much as those guys have gone from like

587
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:32,510
19th to fucking you know 7th
grade the 15th to whatever it is.

588
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,040
I think it's harder to go from 9th all
the way up to 2nd because you get into

589
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:41,050
like the best of the best drivers to
fucking go past driver number five four

590
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,620
three to get all the way up to that start
where as far back as he did with the

591
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,400
Mercedes.

592
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Once again having a gearbox issue that's
what happens with Mercedes stay forever

593
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,510
gearbox issue and they get a five spot
fucking penalty and evidently I don't

594
00:36:56,511 --> 00:37:00,290
know who the fuck it is that's supposed
to be working on that fucking shock

595
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:04,000
absorber on the front left hand side of
the car or the fin or the fucking tire

596
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,090
whatever the fuck it is one of those guys
wearing the underarms with the helmet

597
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:08,730
on in the pit.

598
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,100
Somebody back there is getting a fucking
is get no pastor this week on the

599
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:13,934
Ferrari team.

600
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,330
So
what's his face.

601
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,060
Vettel was up by like I don't
know how many fuckin points

602
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,310
I forget what place he came in I think
he got like six or eight points and he

603
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:30,400
was up by like he was up by 20
points before the race started.

604
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,220
I can do the math here and by the end of
the race he was only up by 1 so like a

605
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:36,090
fucking math test.

606
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,930
So Lewis Hamilton got twenty five points
so he outscored in by fucking twenty

607
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,134
four.

608
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,540
So he come in tenth place he got one point

609
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,800
now they'll be twenty four he got four
points all right so he came in he came in

610
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:57,830
like eighth right and he came in eighth
All right whatever but why the fuck

611
00:37:57,831 --> 00:38:00,890
would you care so they got one more
race before they take the break in the

612
00:38:00,891 --> 00:38:05,260
summertime like they would like their
lives aren't fucking great enough they're

613
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:09,020
part of like like literally 20 people
who could do this in the fucking universe

614
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,200
all right they get to take
the fucking summer off.

615
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,410
I'm like these poor bastards I played
fuckin baseball who's going to pay like

616
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:19,160
fuckin six to seven games a goddamn week.
You know.

617
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,180
These guys get to take the summer off.
Granted they have to still diet you know.

618
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,710
But you know if they have like a shake
then they can they can fucking get rid of

619
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:33,100
it bang bangin a supermodel you
know fuck sweat it out of them.

620
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,540
I mean their lives are unbelievable.

621
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,770
Lewis Hamilton and fucking
what's his face. Both

622
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,330
times they both live in Monaco.

623
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,010
It's like it's not enough to get you
know he's got a private jet like these

624
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:49,020
fucking guys lives are unbelievable.
It's fucking tremendous. God bless him.

625
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,830
Hey what's going on with the fucking the
other Red Bull team that's not Red Bull

626
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,560
the blue ones the fuckin

627
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,240
with the hell and what the weather is
that the Totoro Rosa fucking team whatever

628
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:04,010
the fuck they're called.
Jesus Christ.

629
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,390
They were doing their impression of the
Force India team fucking slamming into

630
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:10,390
each other. I love when
that happens. I love that.

631
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Reminds me that fuckin movie stepbrothers
they do doing like the Formula One

632
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:19,150
version of putting their balls
on Will Ferrell's drum kit.

633
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,570
No he put it on the other guy's drum
kit. That's right. I don't know.

634
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,820
Anyways let's get to the
fucking question this week.

635
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,420
Oh by the way all things comedy's own
Irish affairs new double Netflix special

636
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:33,470
airs Tuesday

637
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,700
July 18th.

638
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,570
Both double negative.

639
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,690
Both are both double negative
children and double negative.

640
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,340
Adulthood will be
available in 190 countries.

641
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,170
It's incredible how the reach
the sheer reach of Netflix.

642
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,550
All right feminism everybody.

643
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,330
Let's do some fucking reads here
for the goddamn week shall we.

644
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,570
I got 20 minutes left here
in this fucking podcast.

645
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,420
All right feminism Bill.

646
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,350
On a recent podcast when discussing
stewardesses and air travel you mentioned

647
00:40:10,351 --> 00:40:15,351
that you sometimes thing the image they
think feminism is a way for ugly women

648
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:21,840
to get jobs that attractive
women used to have. I said that.

649
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,660
Why do you guys take anything I
say seriously. You understand.

650
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm just riffing for a fucking hour and
I'm trying to make you laugh by saying

651
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:30,840
ridiculously over-the-top things.
So he's gonna write me in a few weeks.

652
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,860
Hey Bill a few weeks ago on your podcast
you suggested turning Buffalo Wild

653
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:39,861
Wings into gas chambers on the night of
the Mayweather McGregor fight just to

654
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,970
let you know I am a parent.

655
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,060
I am not a fight fan but I do enjoy the
fucking Halo Pino balls whatever the

656
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:49,344
fuck they're called

657
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,700
at Buffalo Wild Wings and
what if I was there anyways.

658
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:01,770
I wonder if you knew Ivan Emily I said
that feminism is a way for ugly women to

659
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:06,570
get jobs that attractive women used
to have. That's fucking hilarious.

660
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,210
I don't necessarily believe that but
there is an element of truth to that.

661
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,200
Like you know when they are
always bitching like you
know Hollywood creates this

662
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:17,010
impossible image of beauty.
It's like no you can't you can't.

663
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,370
Your fear of fucking ego maniac.

664
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,420
I don't think when I look at a Brad
Pitt whoever the fucking guy is now Brad

665
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:27,060
Pitt's like in his 50s now.
So we have the fucking shredded.

666
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,210
Who's the guy from Saved By The Bell.
Mario Lopez.

667
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,080
You know when I don't when I look at
him with his pigment and his fucking abs

668
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:39,000
and all that. I don't fucking go like
this is an impossible fucking town. Jesus.

669
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:44,810
This is an impossible standard for me to
talk standard for me to hold up to and

670
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,090
therefore Mario Lopez should
be on fucking TV anymore.

671
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,000
I just understand that. Yeah. You
know what on a good day maybe I'm a 6.

672
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:00,570
Okay. That's what I am. Not everybody
can bat cleanup in the order.

673
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,620
Okay if you're fucking bad Nate
quit your crying and get on base.

674
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,023
That's it.

675
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,360
Maybe I do believe that on some level.

676
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Anyways I wonder if you know that this
is actually Rush Limbaugh's undeniable

677
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:14,570
truth of life.

678
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Number 24 specifically that feminism was
established so as to allow unattractive

679
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:24,830
women to access access to
the mainstream of society.

680
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:33,620
Here's the thing I'd say in this
shit I'm like 90 percent joking.

681
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,550
There's always like an element of truth
that guy as far as I can tell because I

682
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:38,630
don't know what his act is.

683
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,730
It might all just be an act you know
so he can eat because he is in show

684
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:43,130
business.

685
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,420
So I have no idea it could just be an act
but if you actually truly believe that

686
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,190
I don't listen I don't believe that.

687
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,823
OK.

688
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:57,050
Feminism came about because men were not
allowing women to pursue their dreams.

689
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,640
OK but like any cause any cause for
whatever reason along the way a lot of the

690
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:07,210
times you end up becoming what
the fuck you were fighting. OK.

691
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,780
And that's not this unique thought.

692
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,360
I realize that's a hacky
thought but it's fucking true.

693
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,690
The level of bullying that goes on on
the internet and trying to get people to

694
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:22,811
get fired and trying to create firestorms
and trying to trying to show the power

695
00:43:23,361 --> 00:43:28,361
of women by a lot of times attacking
people who you're deliberately and

696
00:43:29,121 --> 00:43:33,140
knowingly taking what they said out of
context and causing them to not have a

697
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:36,670
fucking job is fucking reprehensible.
All right.

698
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,770
And they in a lot of ways
do the same reptilian.

699
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,170
If the ends justify the means corporate
fucking mentality just some of this shit

700
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,430
that that is set out there.
Yeah.

701
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:55,860
Look I don't think that it's actually
that but sometimes I think it's that you

702
00:43:55,861 --> 00:43:58,630
know there are jobs that you should
only get if you're good looking.

703
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:05,490
You know I really believe that like like
when you get you know the first person

704
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:11,161
that they're going to fucking walk in
the top of your order you got to go with

705
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:14,620
Ricky Henderson. You know you gotta
get somebody who's gonna get on base.

706
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,310
You gotta put the fucking picture up.

707
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,950
You know and I feel like I can say this
because of how I look like if I ran a

708
00:44:26,351 --> 00:44:26,860
company.

709
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,160
I'm not putting me on the front desk like
I'm the first person you're gonna say.

710
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,000
Why would you do that.
We're trying to make money here.

711
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,400
You know I know that high
schools over look in the mirror.

712
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,340
Love yourself but have a
sense of humor about yourself.

713
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,500
Know that you're not perfect
and just know that it's OK.

714
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,450
And you know what a lot of times if
you stare into that shit and you have a

715
00:44:50,451 --> 00:44:53,600
sense of humor about yourself
you're fun to be around.

716
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:58,760
How many times I call myself a
pasty bald freckled fucking jackass

717
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,160
telling me you fucking stare into
it and you fucking age gracefully.

718
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,810
All right you start to lose your fucking
here. You just shave your fucking head.

719
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,520
Just be that guy and everybody's like
what the fuck and then. But you know what.

720
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,373
You deal with it.

721
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,700
Then people thought they respect you.

722
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,390
This guy came down the pike he didn't
even try to shake it off he took the pitch

723
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:21,080
right to the side and had
everybody stand it on first base.

724
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,710
Good for you you ugly bald son of
a bitch right. This is the thing.

725
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,870
So I know that they need ugly bald son
of a bitch as in movies and I'll just

726
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:32,390
audition for that at the end of
the fucking day I'm in a movie.

727
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,980
Am I really gonna complain.
You know I feel fucking.

728
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,640
Fucking bald freckled redhead should
be starring in more movies it's like oh

729
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,080
yeah you want to put your money
put your money where your mouth is.

730
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,320
You go finance that fuckin movie
yeah.

731
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,800
And a lot of ways.

732
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,600
That's one of those things which
everybody should get like a ribbon.

733
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:01,340
I mean I don't know what the solution
is but you like competition is a good

734
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,174
thing.

735
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,380
Okay.

736
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:08,380
And the best you know the
best should should win right.

737
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,710
Mike I'm I'm all with it
as far as everybody should
have the same opportunity.

738
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,280
But after that go fuck yourself.
Whoever's the best gets it.

739
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:20,840
You know.

740
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,680
Now like well we have enough of these
people are enough of those now who are the

741
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:25,660
fucking best.
Okay.

742
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,810
When we have to keep doing that because
at some point if the aliens aren't

743
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:33,800
already here they're coming here and we
need to have an all star fucking team

744
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,120
not a team that makes everybody feel
represented. All right. There we go.

745
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,530
I hope I explained myself or you know
I'll I'll know if I'm right if I don't get

746
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:45,140
a call from the Rush Limbaugh Show
asking me if I want to be a guest.

747
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,590
All right brother X feminine.

748
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,670
Dear Billy Boy boyo relative
relatively new fan here.

749
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,210
I loved Uma too. Love your material
help to see life one day. Thank you.

750
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:03,890
Before I start I want to say that
I don't care if my brother is gay.

751
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,690
To each his own is my motto. Okay
now for the back story. There you go.

752
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,470
That's what I do.

753
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,680
You've established you've given yourself
credibility because you said that

754
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:16,550
you're a good person. All right. I'm
17 about to be a senior in high school.

755
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,940
My brother is eleven and is
about to start middle school.

756
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,330
I feel like other kids will view him as
an easy target for a few reasons first.

757
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:28,640
He doesn't have many guy friends and he
hangs out with a lot of ladies second.

758
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:29,690
I do.

759
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:34,550
I try to do masculine things with them
I play baseball so I always ask him to

760
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:39,020
play catch with me and I even offered
to teach him how to place the sport.

761
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:43,450
He usually says no when I try to do
any sort of physical activity with him.

762
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:46,670
He rejects my requests and
just does his own thing.

763
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,310
Third his body language is quite feminine.

764
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,360
He sits like a girl talks like a
girl and moves his hands like a girl.

765
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,800
You know what I'm saying.

766
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,150
And the thing that ladies and
gay guys do with their hands.

767
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,630
You know I'm saying the thing that ladies
and gay guys do with their hands when

768
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:03,440
they talk.

769
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,520
My gut tells me to sit down and have a
talk with him but I don't want to come

770
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:11,780
off too blunt and hurt his feelings.
Then again that could be what he needs.

771
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,610
I think if I tell him what I'm thinking
he'll just blow it off just like me.

772
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,660
He's very hotheaded.
Sorry about the hyphen.

773
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:25,430
I personally blame his behavior on the
pacification of society over the past few

774
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:29,600
years and the very progressive
environment of modern day schooling.

775
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,380
He's a good kid and he's got a good
head on his shoulders so I'm not worried

776
00:48:33,381 --> 00:48:35,420
about anything else.
I'm just looking out for him.

777
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,550
I don't want to dickheads
messing with him.

778
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,690
I used to get bullied so I know
how it feels. What do you think's.

779
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,800
Thanks for your help. Go
fuck yourself. All right.

780
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,110
I think you're 17 and I think you love
your brother and you're trying to protect

781
00:48:48,111 --> 00:48:48,944
him.

782
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,453
Here's the deal dude.

783
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,440
I mean your brother is who your
brother is. You got to accept that.

784
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,593
And

785
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,170
I don't know how you handle the bullying
thing which is what I really think is

786
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:12,890
what you see when you look
at your brothers like this
kid's gonna get the shit

787
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:13,724
kicked out of them.

788
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,880
Which is you know sad to say.

789
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,840
You know hopefully not as
much as when I was coming up.

790
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,920
But yeah that is it.
That is it's a legit concern.

791
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,703
But

792
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,610
I don't think you listen people
are born how they're born.

793
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,490
OK. I don't know if this kid's
gay or not. I don't know what.

794
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,920
But if he does want to play catch
he doesn't want to play catch.

795
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,790
And if he's hardheaded you know e sound.

796
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:47,550
He said he's a smart kid he's hot
headed he knows what he wants.

797
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,350
So just let him be himself.

798
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,390
And you support him and there's no
reason why this kid he doesn't like to do

799
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,730
physical shit.
I wouldn't say take him down to a dojo.

800
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,290
Teach him how to fuck somebody up.

801
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,010
And the fact that he is effeminate.

802
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,280
If he goes and fucks somebody up that's
going to be humiliating for the other

803
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:08,080
person and then nobody else is going to
want to fuck with them because they want

804
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,610
to get beat up by Bruce Lee
used to do that Bruce Lee used.

805
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:14,100
I read this book used to walk around he
would act all effeminate and then these

806
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:17,430
guys would come up and fuck with him and
then he would kick the shit out of him.

807
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,490
People ask him well why would you do
that he said well if I just walked up.

808
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,320
Like a regular dude you know they got
their ass kicked they could get over it

809
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:29,160
but if they thought they got their ass
kicked by a sissy you know it stays with

810
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:29,460
them.

811
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:34,460
And unfortunately that is something with
guys if you know if people were more

812
00:50:35,551 --> 00:50:39,180
progressive or whatever the fucking word
is they wouldn't think that and they'd

813
00:50:39,181 --> 00:50:42,080
just be like well it doesn't
make a difference if you're
effeminate or masculine

814
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,680
if he can fucking throw hands
over there with a couple of feces.

815
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:48,450
I can I can accept the loss.

816
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,720
I listen I would just if anything I would
try to have a closer relationship with

817
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:57,880
my younger brother and

818
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,110
and I would ask him how his days are
going and I would just really ask him Is

819
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:05,340
anybody at school fucking
with you or whatever.

820
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,820
And if they are I don't know.

821
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,090
I would go down and have a fucking
talk I don't know if he could do that.

822
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,070
I don't know what to do. I don't
know what to do but that would do it.

823
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,250
As an older brother that would kill me
knowing that somebody could be fucking

824
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:21,170
with my younger brother. So I think you
come from a good place. Your ideas of

825
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,750
you know how to cure him of that are
understandable because you're 17.

826
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,610
I don't think it's society's fault.

827
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,350
I just think that's just how he's born.

828
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,440
And I think if you accept it he will
accept it and he'll keep a good feeling

829
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:39,434
about himself.

830
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,790
But unfortunately the bullying is going
to come and he's gonna have to learn how

831
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:46,130
to stick up for himself.
I mean that's just the truth of it.

832
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:47,803
And

833
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,150
there's all kinds of things that you could
do that I'm not allowed to say on the

834
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,020
podcast.

835
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,550
As far as what he could do in those
moments because somehow I become this

836
00:51:58,551 --> 00:51:59,570
fucking bad person.

837
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:05,430
But I'm just going to
tell a random story here.

838
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,770
I remember the late Charlie
Murphy rest his soul.

839
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,700
He told me to do what to do if
you ever go to jail. And I just.

840
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,130
It was like you know not
that I could still survive.

841
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,250
He was like Yo this is what you do.

842
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:23,730
He goes the first motherfucker
that steps to you.

843
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,990
He goes you just turn into a wild animal
frothing at the mouth and you just

844
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:32,991
fucking swing for the fences and everybody
you know what I'm oversimplifying

845
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:34,950
what the fuck he said.

846
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:40,040
And
you know that's just a story he told me.

847
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:43,700
That has nothing to do with
what I just fuckin read.

848
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,370
Okay I want to do that
so I stay free and clear.

849
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,410
I don't know what to tell you buddy.
All right. Let him be who he is.

850
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,870
And you know I would watch some MDMA
events with them and maybe he'll want to

851
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,100
learn how to fucking do it.
I don't know.

852
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:59,600
I don't know because I've watched some
some cool videos of some kids that were

853
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:01,380
way out of their own weight class.

854
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,740
It's one fucking kid fucked his kid up
jumped up put him in a fucking arm by

855
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:07,110
this kid.

856
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,060
And what the fuck they do.

857
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,280
Maybe you can help him out with that but
yeah I would let go of all that other

858
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:18,350
shit that you're going to
fucking do I mean if like

859
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,530
you are being who you are.

860
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,560
I mean if somebody when you go out in the
driveway and it's to learn how to talk

861
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:27,670
a little bit time you just would still be
you but you'd know how to toilet baton.

862
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:32,270
I don't think it would change
how you walked or behaved
or who you hung out with.

863
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,580
You're wired how you wired. All right.
Girlfriend wants to move back to her home.

864
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,670
That's like those fucking people that you
know that would try to cure gay people

865
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:42,550
you know.

866
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,390
They think that they like it's like
they have the mumps or something.

867
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,400
Girlfriend wants to move
back to her home country.

868
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,563
All right.

869
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,500
Hey Bill Hill. If the guy took the woman's
last name in marriage. That's funny.

870
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:02,190
All right. Longtime listener first
time advice seeker I live in London.

871
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,660
I met my girlfriend online
a year and a half ago.

872
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,810
She's 25 and I'm 24.
She's from Switzerland.

873
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,870
See this what happens now to
all these fucking dating apps.

874
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,430
Fun fact about Switzerland.

875
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,660
They have enough nuclear bunkers to
accommodate their entire population.

876
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,190
Yeah that's because they're
so close to fucking Germany.

877
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:27,020
They moved here a few
years ago to get a music.

878
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,930
She moved here a few years ago to get
a music degree and graduated graduate.

879
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,880
Last year she was going to move in with
a friend a few months ago but her best

880
00:54:34,881 --> 00:54:36,770
friend did a 180 at the last second.

881
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,220
So we decided to move in together
as we enjoy each other's company.

882
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,800
Here's the shit part.

883
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,320
She always said that she misses her
family and her friends a lot which is of

884
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:48,980
course understandable but recently she's
been mentioning that she wants to move

885
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:51,440
back to Switzerland once
our lease is up next year.

886
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,810
I completely get why she
would want to do this.

887
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,690
She doesn't have many friends here.

888
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:01,480
As many of her college
friends have moved back home.

889
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,870
The thing is I have established
an established career
here and I don't want to

890
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:08,920
leave my friends a job behind to go move
to a country where I don't speak the

891
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:09,730
language.

892
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:14,230
I've tried but there are hardly
any courses for Swiss slash German

893
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,830
and the market for my
skills is much smaller

894
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,430
I'm a magician an academic tutor.

895
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,890
Jesus is a fucking combo.

896
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:30,970
Whenever she brings it up I answer with
very variations of well we'll cross that

897
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:35,150
bridge when we come to it but I'm pretty
sure I'm never going to come around to

898
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:35,984
the idea.

899
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,220
She has made the point a couple of
times that this would be me choosing my

900
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:43,880
career and friends over her which
makes it sound worse than it is.

901
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:44,900
What should I tell her.

902
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,920
Thanks and go fuck yourself while she's
choosing her country and her family over

903
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:49,754
you.

904
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,730
So I would say nicely listen.

905
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,450
You keep saying that this
is me choosing my career

906
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:02,030
and you know what just when
she's saying my friends over her.

907
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:07,910
Do you know that feeling you have
when you live here in London.

908
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,940
That's what I'm going to feel
like when I'm in Switzerland.

909
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:15,960
Do you want me to feel that. No. Well
good. I don't want to feel that either.

910
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,620
So one of us has to make a sacrifice here.

911
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,270
Are you willing to live here.

912
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:25,780
And if she says no.
Then you have to be willing to live there.

913
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,450
And if you're not willing to do
that then you guys need to break up.

914
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,650
It's simple as that
simple as that.

915
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,470
I would I would fucking say
Do you know you got a fucking

916
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,130
goddamn kids today and fucking
swipe and left the next scene.

917
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:46,420
Oh yeah.

918
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,340
My girlfriend lives in fucking Bangladesh
and she's really missing some of the

919
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:55,720
food over there and I you know I fucking
you know whatever the fuck I do over

920
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:55,930
here.

921
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:59,110
I mean these are these are like modern
day relationship fuckin problems.

922
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:03,140
Yeah that's it. One of you guys has
to move but don't let her guilt you.

923
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,070
She's not choosing her friends
you're doing what she's doing.

924
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,210
You're living where you want to live
next to the people you love and you can't

925
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:13,600
get mad at her for wanting to do the
exact same thing all right but you know

926
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,910
she's trying to mind fuck you know for
me I feel like you're choosing this go

927
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:19,744
fuck yourself.

928
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,490
All right well go back home and send me
some chocolates will bang every once in

929
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:28,980
a while we'll meet in Paris summit that.
It that I want to tell you.

930
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,710
My girlfriend. You came to my
place not the other way around.

931
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,990
Girlfriends belly hangs past her tits.
Jesus

932
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,570
Hey there Bill.
Hey there billy will you freckled cheeks.

933
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,960
Love the podcast especially when you and
Nia do the podcast so that I know and I

934
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:48,660
gotta get her on here more but it's just
like when I do what she has to watch

935
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,260
secured and the other way around.
All right.

936
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,030
I've got a problem then I'm hoping you
and Neha may be able to help me with.

937
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:57,390
I love my wife of seven years dearly.
We have fun together.

938
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,940
Make each other laugh etc..
She's my best friend.

939
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:04,650
We're in an early thirties have no
children in our very affluent crushing it

940
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:08,970
except for the sex. The sex is bad
because we have become fatty fat Fats.

941
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:14,450
We've been together for a decade and
this has only become a problem over the

942
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:18,870
past six months. I'm 5 11 and to 40
with a lot of muscle and a lot of fat.

943
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,380
She's five four and two
hundred and has no muscle mass.

944
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:26,340
I'm ashamed to say that even though
I love her fiercely she's no longer

945
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:29,070
physically attractive to
me. Why me. What the fuck.

946
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,390
I'm just being honest.

947
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:34,950
I'm sure you're not as attracted to
her although you did give yourself some

948
00:58:34,951 --> 00:58:38,040
props for having a little bit of muscle
you didn't quite say you was as big a

949
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:42,130
mess. I'm ashamed to say that.
Okay. She probably feels the same.

950
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,680
He said that she feels the same.

951
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,270
She used to be 140 tops and was
curvy in all the right places.

952
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,540
I used to be cut like a Greek
god our sex life was amazing.

953
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,500
She'd have one to three orgasms.

954
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:59,270
Jesus Christ every time we had sex one
two three times four weeks and now maybe

955
00:58:59,271 --> 00:59:02,990
we have sex once a month. She can't
climax anymore because she gets too tired.

956
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:08,060
Jesus over the past six weeks I've cut
10 pounds and exercise six times a week.

957
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,650
I'm trying but I have a long way to go.

958
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:13,220
She isn't trying to eat right and is
not interested in exercising with me.

959
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:17,180
I know sex tends to dwindle over time
but I'd like for us to be in good enough

960
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:22,181
shape that we don't need a nitroglycerin
pill every time we try to do the dirt.

961
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,760
Any advice would be much appreciated.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

962
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,850
You have to sit down and have
an honest conversation with her.

963
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:32,200
OK I would leave the sex life out of it.

964
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:34,090
It's just like she's
not going to live long.

965
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:40,770
All right it five for two hundred pounds
maybe you can start by going for quote

966
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:47,200
romantic walks and you hold her hand
and need you try to pick up the pace and

967
00:59:47,201 --> 00:59:48,034
drag along.

968
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:53,000
I would just yeah I would talk to her
about it.

969
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,940
And if she chooses not to get in shape
then I I would not alter what you're

970
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:01,400
doing.

971
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,400
I would go back to being the Greek god
that you were and if she doesn't want to

972
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:10,880
get in shape then you know
what are you supposed to do.

973
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,370
Watch her eat herself into
an early fuckin grave.

974
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:17,410
You supposed to be with somebody that
you're not sexually attracted to anymore.

975
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:21,420
I mean that that's fair man.
If somebody puts on almost like.

976
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,870
She put on almost half her body weight

977
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,450
I mean that's not that's not fair.

978
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,910
It's not fair to yourself and it's
not fair to the person you're in.

979
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:32,670
You've got to be making an
effort to to still look good.

980
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:36,570
You know and people have a tendency men
and women to do that to become you know

981
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,500
you know just walking around fucking
shitty looking clothes just being a tub of

982
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:46,970
shit and it's just like that whole you
should accept me for whatever I am that

983
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:49,340
means I'm going to be the
least of who I could be.

984
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,720
Nobody ever says that when they're the
best. Yeah. I'd like to accept you.

985
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:57,170
Fucking going to the goddamn gym the same
way you'd like me to not fucking have

986
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:59,180
my belly hanging down past my junk.

987
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,160
Yeah I'd have a conversation with her.
Just sit down.

988
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:07,730
You know what maybe.
My beautiful daughter is asleep.

989
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,570
Maybe you could come in and help.
Hang on a second me a pause here.

990
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,210
She can't do it. She can't do it. Sorry.

991
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,320
Sorry to get your goddamn
hopes up so just know that

992
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,510
that you just got advice from a guy.

993
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:27,540
So what I would do is I would ask a woman
in your life not her advice on how to

994
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:30,790
how to drop in okay.

995
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,100
Cause this is one of these
relationship conversations.

996
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:37,630
It's like when a spaceship is re-entering
the atmosphere the space shuttle that

997
01:01:37,631 --> 01:01:42,631
if it wasn't at the right fuckin angle
you know where you lost a couple of those

998
01:01:43,031 --> 01:01:47,140
fucking shingles on the bottom you
could fucking burn up on reentry.

999
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,080
All right that I really have to bring
up that tragedy to make my point.

1000
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:54,010
I don't know. Maybe I didn't. All
right. Girlfriend has severe halitosis.

1001
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,810
Jesus Christ the women
are getting destroyed.

1002
01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:00,770
Ladies ladies you gotta write in next
week okay. You got to write it next week.

1003
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,660
OK stop being sweethearts and tell me
what the problem is with the guys this is

1004
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,900
this is not fair and
balanced like Fox News.

1005
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,473
Or CNN.

1006
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,600
I love that chick that cried on CNN the
one with the Mary Lou Retton haircut

1007
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:19,270
when Trump got elected it's just like
there was one of those unprofessional

1008
01:02:19,271 --> 01:02:21,580
journalistic moments I've
ever seen in my fucking life.

1009
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:26,020
How did we go from Walter Cronkite to
that. I literally know who you voted for.

1010
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:29,770
You're not a journalist all right.
Hey there op ed piece. All right.

1011
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,750
Girlfriend has severe halitosis.

1012
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,280
Dear Billy Batts I saw you perform
and hilarity is in the land.

1013
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,230
The worst fucking nickname

1014
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,140
the land the land of what

1015
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,630
Jesus Christ that's so fucking
bad and you had me in stitches.

1016
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:51,650
Please come back the land their T-shirts
back there defend the land do you know

1017
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:57,720
for half a second in Boston they split
they lose. People call it the bean.

1018
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,580
Don't do that Beantown was bad enough.

1019
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,500
We don't make beans there anymore anymore
than Port Chester still makes fucking

1020
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:10,530
lifesavers. Although Grand
Rapids still makes furniture

1021
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,640
anyways.

1022
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:18,090
I'm 23 year old man and recently began
dating a girl I met on a dating app.

1023
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,610
We've been on two dates and
she has bad breath dumper.

1024
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,380
Jesus Christ over.

1025
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,840
The fuck do you care.
It's not your problem.

1026
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,160
Anyways you've been on two dates so
far and they both went great. We went.

1027
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,350
To a couple of museums for how far away
we are standard from were you standing

1028
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:36,070
there going in.

1029
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,750
Is that her breadth of the artifacts.

1030
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,780
Is that her breath of that fucking woolly
mammoth statue that they dug out of

1031
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:51,740
the fucking ice two thousand years ago
and it was actually woolly mammoth from

1032
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,870
fucking 4 billion B.C. go fuck yourself.
Right.

1033
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:58,180
We have a good conversation in this great
chemistry overall but when she smiles

1034
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:02,080
the sight and smell indicates
years of not brushing or flossing.

1035
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:05,740
Dude I don't see any you know the
fact that you need advice on this.

1036
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:11,670
There is thick dark yellow build up along
our gum line. Oh my God I'm gonna puke.

1037
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,650
And she talks loud so her
breath travels a long way.

1038
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,480
Kissing is difficult to enjoy.

1039
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:23,120
Oh my God this is gross.

1040
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,780
I almost just gag order.

1041
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:34,120
I always just gag there. What kind of
fucking low self-esteem do you have.

1042
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,170
What is my advice.

1043
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:40,300
Either break up with her or take her to
one of those self power washes car wash

1044
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:44,170
things and tell her to smile and fucking
blaster right in the fucking grill.

1045
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:49,840
Jesus fucking Christ.
That's the most disgusting visual.

1046
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,453
Oh my God.

1047
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:56,590
What the fuck.

1048
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,270
What is my advice.

1049
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,690
I don't know what you know what my advice
is they say they should make a stamp

1050
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,450
for you because you were a goddamn saint

1051
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:09,190
Oh my God.

1052
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,590
Kissing is difficult.

1053
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,230
Oh my God.

1054
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,540
I think I gotta walk this one off buddy

1055
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:23,420
does plenty of fucking
fish in the fucking sea.

1056
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:27,540
Jesus Christ my God.
That's like heaven.

1057
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:31,500
Speaking of fish it's like having a
goddamn eel going along your goddamn gum

1058
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:34,700
lines. I'm sorry guys. I don't know
why you do it. I would just. That's it.

1059
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,530
It's over there.

1060
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:36,560
There should be no no

1061
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,030
I mean how are you going to
hang in there with this one.

1062
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,000
What the fuck do you say.

1063
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,440
Hey what you doing Thursday night.
Nothing. You wanna go to the dentist.

1064
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,360
Let's get his or her cleanings

1065
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:04,780
Oh my God dude if if
if that looks like that.

1066
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:07,140
What is what is the fucking
basement going to look like dude.

1067
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:08,973
Oh my God.

1068
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,320
Oh my God.
God bless you.

1069
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:16,360
Yeah I get it to a dentist however the
fuck you bring that up I don't know.

1070
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:21,460
Some questions are beyond me all right.
Jesus Christ. All right. That's the.

1071
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,780
I've never had to stop
reading an e-mail before.

1072
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,680
I haven't done that.

1073
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:34,990
I haven't them come that close to puking
since Opie and Anthony the baby bird

1074
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,890
when I was in that fuckin room and I
still to this day can not tell that story

1075
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:43,340
without fucking gagging and coughing and
if you puke easily do not fuck and go

1076
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:48,310
look up Opie and Anthony baby bird. All
right that's it. That's the podcast.

1077
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,880
Go fuck yourselves.
I will check in on you on Thursday.

1078
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,530
I am back to watch it a little bit of
baseball I did miss the Yankees though I

1079
01:06:56,531 --> 01:06:59,740
was working the whole weekend I think the
Yankees got the better of us I know we

1080
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:00,574
did win one game.

1081
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:05,470
Yankees are in third and the fucking
devil rays are moving up there only half a

1082
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:08,500
game out so I would try to watch we're
playing the fucking Toronto Blue Jays.

1083
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:13,860
Bam bam bam bam bam bam fucking Toronto
Blue Jays there was my reference to

1084
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,770
whatever their fucking song is by Rush.

1085
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,750
That is the Morse code.

1086
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,890
Y y z for Toronto's airport.

1087
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,290
Somehow they came up with a
guitar riff for that. All right.

1088
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:29,680
That's something Kevin Murphy would
try to do on efforts for family.

1089
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,230
Harp season 2 on Netflix.

1090
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:36,220
Look at that coming out of that disgusting
story promoting his show telling you

1091
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:39,230
to go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
