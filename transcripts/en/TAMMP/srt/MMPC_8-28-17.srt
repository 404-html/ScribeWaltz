1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,790
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:08,020
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday. What is it?

3
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:12,730
August 28th, 2017 what's
going on out? Why?

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,910
What's up? Sorry. It was obnoxious.
I understand. I understand,

5
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:22,760
but I got to make the lady shut
it off first, right? Oh my God.

6
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,230
Who is this guy yelling?

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,040
Why would you want to listen to that and
when you could just see when you could

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,980
just sit and watch reality
television with myself.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,750
Let's do a bunch of broads fucking
yelling at each other. It's unreal.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,000
It's unreal. My wife Watches that shit
all the time. All the fucking time.

11
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,640
You come home and it's just like,
it's like they live with us.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,060
You know what I mean? Me and my wife,
we get a, we get along great, you know,

13
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:51,180
but you wouldn't know it. Walking up
the fucking front walk to the house.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,210
You hear like five women's
screaming at each other. You know?

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,380
It's just like, Whoa, how are we hosting
the Jerry Springer show? What's going on?

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,180
And you open the door and she's
watching the real housewives of a,

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,550
who gives a fuck the real
housewives of Trenton,

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,570
the real housewives of Dayton,
Ohio. Wherever the hell they are,

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,720
wherever they are, whatever city
they're in, the real housewives,

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,230
they got fake tits.
They got big ass fucking,

21
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:23,400
they got ass injection lips.
They got the fucking botox

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,980
jumble it. No matter where they are.
Real housewives, grand rapids. He's like,

23
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:32,860
there's not going to be some
Hollywood shit guy. And there it is.

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,410
Why is everybody walking around acting
like there is some aging actress?

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,210
You know what I mean? And they somehow
they have to look good for what the,

26
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:45,160
what the fuck are you looking?
If you ever 50 year old mom,

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,700
okay,

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,780
just be your mom. Relax. It's over.
You landed a guy, he knocked job.

29
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,210
All the laws are in your favor.
For God's sakes.

30
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:56,900
Go have a fucking piece of
pie and go smoke a camel.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,650
I don't understand what the fuck these
fucking spaghetti strapped women,

32
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,210
you know the the stupidest still wearing
the tank tops. You know what I mean?

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,940
Okay.

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,320
Jesus Christ with the fucking tired
skin show. And what are you doing?

35
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,430
Trying to compete with your data.
What are you doing?

36
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,300
Okay,

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,620
good. Lola, take take a page out of my
book. Just fucking just given to it.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Here's starts falling out.
Fucking shaving.

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,430
Your legs are too white.
Put some pants on.

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,030
Okay.

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,930
You fucking guts getting to big
start wearing sport coats on stage.

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,020
These are the, this, this,
that's the classy way.

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,540
That's the classy way to just gracefully,
you know,

44
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,860
go from being young NT.
You're middle aged and to just be an old,

45
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:54,570
this what you do. Then you get an old man
hat, right? You start pottering around,

46
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,200
you make funny little jokes.
Everybody. Lao, we look at them,

47
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,330
look at that guy still making jokes.
That's what you do.

48
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:03,780
Yeah.

49
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,260
You don't get chemical shot and
your fucking face, you know,

50
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:09,780
and enhance your fucking tits. Like
what? What are you trying to do?

51
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,930
You're trying to give some
60 year old a hard on.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,440
I don't understand what these
women are doing and it was funny,

53
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,450
I didn't even want to talk
about this shit. I just,

54
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:21,030
I don't know why that just came
out. It just did. All right.

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,820
I had a wonderful show last night,
a wonderful show.

56
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,780
I was at the Cape Cod melody,
Melody Tent, if I can say it,

57
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,610
which is a such a special place for me
to do stand up because the one and only

58
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,860
time I ever saw it,

59
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,310
the Great George Carlin live was that
the cape cod melody tent and I am

60
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:43,170
embarrassed to say I saw him in 1988
and me and this other guy went to go see

61
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:48,171
them to laugh at him because my buddy
had me convinced that he had stopped

62
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:51,630
writing and that he was
still doing 20 year old bits.

63
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,920
So we were going to go see him as a joke.
If you complicit, how fucking stupid.

64
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:59,760
I was one of the most prolific
comedians of all fucking time.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,430
So we show up to laugh at this guy
and within two seconds we were,

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,490
we were just on the fucking floor
laughing and the guy hit his brand new 90

67
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:11,910
fucking minutes and we
were driving home like he,

68
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,500
he wasn't doing more stuff. He wasn't
doing fucking like, that's how dumb I was.

69
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,250
Um,
I did a lot of dumb shit back then.

70
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:23,850
I went to some comedy shows and I was
literally the person in the crowd I wasn't

71
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,070
hackle in or anything,
you know what I mean?

72
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,670
Although one time I did Haeckel Don
Rickles just cause I wanted to have an

73
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:34,140
interaction with them and I knew that
I wasn't going to meet him. You know,

74
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,630
I saw him at a casino about four years ago

75
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,363
and um,

76
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,130
I waited till his encore and it came out
in the encore and he was just doing his

77
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:47,190
jokes, doing his jokes and I was way in
the back. He's playing this giant room.

78
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:52,050
I was waiting in the back and I just
went, hey, it didn't say anything.

79
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,820
He kept doing his jokes,
kept doing it as jokes.

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,930
I waited like another three minutes and
I went dark and he just looked out to

81
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,080
where I was sitting. He goes, yeah, I know
my name made that fucking Rickles face.

82
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,500
And I was with Bart, nick and
he fucking elbow. He goes,
he heard you, he heard you.

83
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:05,334
And that was it.

84
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,141
You know,

85
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:13,380
I broke a major rule of engagement there
with fucking as a standup comedian.

86
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:16,680
I shouldn't have done it, but I couldn't
help myself. I couldn't help myself.

87
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:20,430
You know what? Let's be honest.
Why don't we just be honest? Okay.

88
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,550
Now that that's stupid,
fucking fight is over.

89
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:27,150
Can we all just be honest with
ourselves here? I'm a selfish person

90
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,520
in rather than accepting the fact that I
wasn't going to get an interaction with

91
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:36,410
them, I had to do that because
I'm a selfish cunt. Okay. And, uh,

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,170
you know, now can we all be honest
about what went on Saturday night?

93
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,240
I gotta be honest with you.
I have not even seen highlights of it.

94
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:45,410
I didn't fucking watch it. I
actually came home and, uh,

95
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,860
I was staying with some relatives here
in Boston who also didn't get the fight,

96
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,310
cause they're saying people feel
like, yeah, it's just, you know,

97
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,450
he's Floyd's gonna carry him for a couple
of rounds that he's going to finish

98
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,890
them and then they both, you know,
they're not going to really each other up.

99
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,240
They're both going to leave
with a buttload of money.

100
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,220
Isn't that what's going on here?
Yeah.

101
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,330
Isn't there some Guy Alvarez who's
actually a fucking modern day champion or

102
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,730
some shit like that coming up anyway,
we'll spend the money on that.

103
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,210
We'll spend the money on that fucking
thing. Whatever that boxing match.

104
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,320
I don't know shit about boxing,

105
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,520
but I do know lousy auto versus
Mohammed Ali when I fucking see it.

106
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,020
So I mean a better version of it,
I should say. But anyways, um,

107
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,250
okay.

108
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,560
We actually watched a wicked tuna.

109
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,610
I have such mixed emotions when I
watched those fishing shows, you know,

110
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,510
I got this love of animals,
but I also love tuna. You know,

111
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,810
I am of an environmentalist
who loves crab, you know,

112
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,410
King Crab. Who the fuck doesn't love
that? I mean, that's just fucking,

113
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,780
it's tremendous.
So when they,

114
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:51,320
they're sitting and talking about how
it's all fished out and they can't find

115
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:55,670
any and that type of stuff, you know,
it's not that we should stop crabbing.

116
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:58,730
They should just be less fucking people
that they have to find it for, you know,

117
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,470
so,
um,

118
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,963
you know,

119
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,410
I dunno, I always have all these
fucking ideas of how to, you know,

120
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,040
okay,

121
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,700
trim down the population. And of course
I'm never part of the problem. Right.

122
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,210
As us as most mass murdering maniacs,

123
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,130
you're never part of
the problem like Hitler.

124
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,310
I'm sure when he looked in the window,
the window looked in the mirror,

125
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,380
right and was brushing his fucking teeth.
Right.

126
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,790
I'm sure that he saw a blonde
haired blue eyed person

127
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,700
instead of seeing what he truly was,
which was the runt of the litter.

128
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,090
You know what I mean?
But the guy had heart,

129
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:43,010
any fucking overcame what
the fuck he looked like to
achieve his dream. You know,

130
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,320
granted he was out of his fucking mind,
but I mean,

131
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,900
that alone should have just see, should
have been, if he wasn't so crazy,

132
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:48,920
it would have been, well, look at me.

133
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,350
I'm fucking ugly as Shit
and look what I've achieved.

134
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,343
You know

135
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,710
what, if somebody who looks like
me actually had a good heart,

136
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,600
imagine what they would achieve. Isn't
that what we'll have fucking Luna ticket.

137
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,340
Well, how was y'all fucking
loaded ticket? Is that okay?

138
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,440
Okay.

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,011
They're like,
you know,

140
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:09,520
my dream came true and I played the
Cape Cod melody tent telling jokes.

141
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:13,780
His dream came true and fucking, you
know, tens of millions of people died.

142
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,820
That was literally his dream.

143
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,163
You know,

144
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,500
like imagine if he never did his shit
right and he just lived a regular life and

145
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:27,260
then all of a sudden God for why
came say God forbid it's him.

146
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,250
I just naturally say, God forbid when I
talk about terminal disease, Adolf Hitler,

147
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:35,570
right? Doesn't fucking, you know, somebody
bought his paintings or some shit, right?

148
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:40,340
So he just doesn't go down that
fucking road. Now he's just, you know,

149
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:44,450
some regular guy and a,
and then he has like,

150
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:48,380
he gets some terminal illness and for
some reason make a wishes back then and

151
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:52,070
they'd go, what is your drink?
What is your wish? And then he's,

152
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,000
and then he g rarely you're going to
make my wish true. This is what we do.

153
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:00,750
Eight off. We make sure you
die with a smile on your face.

154
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,270
What is your dream? And he
would have led the, you know,

155
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,940
telling the guy to come a little
bit closer. What do you want to do?

156
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:11,590
I want to exterminate all of the Jews.
That's what he would've sent.

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,700
I want a fucking quagmire that
make a wish would've been,

158
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,430
they would've had to have, they
would have to, hey, hang on a second.

159
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:23,630
They'd have to step out in the hall
going, I, what do we do here? I mean, uh,

160
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,960
you know, we, we, we,

161
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,020
we just kind of made a broad statement
that we make dreams come true. We,

162
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,990
we didn't clarify it. Like, what do you
want me to stand out here long enough?

163
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:36,470
Maybe he'll fucking die of the disease. I
mean, our are, reputation's on the line,

164
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:40,250
right? And then all of a sudden
make a wish gets dragged into it,

165
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,880
gets dragged into the madness of this man
and then no longer looked upon as this

166
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:49,520
wonderful organization that they are,
right.

167
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,950
Which takes in millions and
millions of dollars, right?

168
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,420
And God knows what the fuck they do.
Who knows?

169
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,680
You never know what those charities,

170
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,283
right?

171
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,770
Are they helping people out?

172
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,640
Are they helping themselves to a
classic Camaro with some t types?

173
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,850
When we return, we'll be
taken some college. Sorry,

174
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,610
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about today. Um, so anyways, yeah,

175
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:13,270
everybody thought I was going to cave.
I have not caved on two fronts.

176
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,890
I have not drank in 11 days and I
feel this is it dude. I go 11 days.

177
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:21,010
I could go a year,
I could go a fucking year.

178
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,300
I feel fucking fantastic.
And I just used the word fantastic.

179
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:30,070
I never is fantastic. You know, I'm
doing cardio like I've always been doing,

180
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,420
but I'm not negating it at night with
the fucking three or four home pours over

181
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:37,800
there with the giant ice cube.
Um,

182
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,360
and it's actually, the sober life is
fucking great. It just sucks at night.

183
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,420
It's the only thing at night.
It's sucks at night, you know,

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,120
because it's like, what the fuck
do I do? Um, I'm like, yeah,

185
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,040
like I'm a habit guy,
so this is the time of night.

186
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,860
I fucking do this and then I'm not doing
it. I'm like, well, now what do I do?

187
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,580
What do I do? So you know what I did? I
started playing guitar again. Anything,

188
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,970
you know, I suck. What do you want?
I mean, it just, I go in there,

189
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,020
I fucking play a little bit,

190
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:12,340
and during that time then it gets late
and then I literally feel my body just

191
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:13,830
going to come on and do
it. Go Paul, go there.

192
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,910
It's right over there and look at
the bottom to look at the bottle.

193
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,940
It's right there just by
yourself. One. And I just,

194
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,130
all I have to do is just go
downstairs to my bedroom.

195
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,220
And then the fact that I'm an old
man takes over. Like, God, dude,

196
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:27,020
I am not fucking going all the way back
up there. He's in. I'm like, he's it.

197
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,330
Even as I'm laying there,

198
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,953
you know,

199
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,520
I go downstairs and my angel of a wife
is laying in bed watching five women.

200
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:42,310
She doesn't know, screaming at each
other and say horrible things. You know,

201
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,900
they're really big on attacking like a,
if a woman's never had a child,

202
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,490
they're really big on attacking
that file, man. That fucking mean.

203
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,580
Just God damn fucking main people,
you know,

204
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,780
it's dumb. These guys are the way we
solve shit with violence. I just think,

205
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:02,051
you know,

206
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:07,051
just punching somebody in the
face is way more civil than say,

207
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,640
well that's why you're bearing and
you can't have a child. It's like,

208
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:17,050
really? Do me a favor next time. Just
punched me in the nose when that just be,

209
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,000
can we just,
can we just leave it at that?

210
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,450
So there's something to salvage
afterwards. Jesus Christ, um,

211
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,890
20 but now that I've gone 11
days, now it's, it's, it's
just starts to fade. Like,

212
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:33,730
I don't even know. I walked by
my, my fucking, I told you 19,

213
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:37,450
27 Yankees lineup worth of fucking
booze and I'm telling you like,

214
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,770
I don't even see it anymore.

215
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,360
Yeah.

216
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Like, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't,

217
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,900
I get murderer's row murderer's row,
the shit that I drink.

218
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,510
Um, you know, and then they're all, I have
the batting order. You know what I mean?

219
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:53,261
Top of the order,

220
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:57,670
right through cleanup is the
top of the shelf top shelf shit.

221
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,090
You know that Shit pappies
I say,

222
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,700
okay, here we go. Let's go with
booze. So what would you align up? B?

223
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,300
Who's hitting lead off?
Who's getting on base? Right?

224
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,610
Who's your fucking Rickey Henderson?

225
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,850
That's gonna fucking possibly hit a solo
shot and the next guys don't even have

226
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:19,920
to knock them in. You know what
I'm going to say? I'm going to go.

227
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,240
Okay.

228
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,030
My Rickey Henderson is
Johnnie Walker blue.

229
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,383
Okay.

230
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,530
Oh, this is going to be hard. I
got too many cleanup hitters. Dan.

231
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:35,520
I would say baton second is grant patrol.

232
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,960
All right.
I'm not a big Tequila guy,

233
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,990
so I'm not getting into that fucking a
Gavi shit. Where the fuck they put in it?

234
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:46,550
Yeah, Dan. I would say,
uh, this is a hard one.

235
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,730
I would say maybe some pappy
van winkles is going third.

236
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,610
Then bat and up in my world,

237
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,350
I would say is a McCallum rare cask.

238
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,310
Right now we're getting to
the middle of the order.

239
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,070
This is a,
you know,

240
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,420
it's not a special occasion. I just
want to get fucked up. All right.

241
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,700
These are the guys hitting to 70 to
80 then you get in the middle already.

242
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:21,400
You got Johnny Walker Black is baton fifth

243
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,950
I'd say no. Fifth is patroned
silver. Johnnie Walker black.

244
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,870
Yeah,

245
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,180
his bat and six baton.
Seventh, eighth and ninth.

246
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:40,440
Now you're talking companies coming over.
You like these people, but they don't,

247
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
they don't like appreciate good boots.

248
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,140
So you just got to hit him
with some basic shit, right?

249
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,560
That's when you have to go maker's mark.

250
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,660
Jack Daniels
batting ninth

251
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,930
batting ninth. If someone wants to mix
it, I'll give you, this is the fuck this.

252
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,520
This is the national league. When
the pitcher bads. Johnnie Walker.

253
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:07,540
Red Label.

254
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,460
There you go. That's my guy. You know
what? Send me in your booze lineups

255
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,290
probably should have had a you.
I could do the bear one

256
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,550
lead off Scott to be Budweiser. You know
that? Thanks. Getting on fucking base,

257
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,053
right?

258
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,751
Batten's second.

259
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:33,290
I would have a Miller
high life baton third.

260
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,780
No, no. Let me see. I'm going to be a
fucked, I got the lead off cores light.

261
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,270
No, but we put doing best beer all the way
down. Not On, oh, what am I doing here?

262
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,160
What am I doing here?
All right.

263
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,180
Okay.

264
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,840
I am. I am. I am white trash
when it comes to beer. Okay.

265
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,820
The fanciest, I mean Alco, I would say

266
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,360
our Eggo Budweiser,
then Miller

267
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,723
highlife.

268
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,550
Then I'd say a third baton third and beer.

269
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,460
Yeah,

270
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,720
that's a tough one. You start wanting
to people clear the basis a little bit.

271
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:17,600
I'll go a little snobby
and I will say Blue Moon.

272
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,850
I don't mind the orange slice. I
don't mind it like I, if I want,

273
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:25,300
if I'm just fucking thirsty, I'll have
one of those bat and cleanup is Guinness.

274
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,310
All right.

275
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,140
Then I'd have a black and Tan and fifth.

276
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,810
Six. Now you just get it. Now
you want to get fucked up, right?

277
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,120
But you don't want to get your
fucking going to become a fat fuck.

278
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:42,390
So I would say cores, light, light, beer.

279
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:46,050
Famila now eight.
Nine.

280
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,420
Okay.

281
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,120
Eight and nine. This is
four when some, you know,

282
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,590
some older people are coming over with
their kids and you just get a fun,

283
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,840
I dunno, for whatever fucking
reason, you got to have an IPA.

284
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,360
And when I was others, like a
Sierra Nevada or some shit, I would,

285
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,240
something like that. I
don't drink, but I mean,

286
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,230
okay,

287
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,020
I'd leave that alone. This isn't,
this is stupid. It's congress.

288
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:13,250
I'm literally fucking sober and I'm
making booze. Batting lineups. All right.

289
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,160
If you're a beer drinker or if
you're a hard liquor, you know,

290
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,680
I want to hear your lineups.
Okay, let's get ready, man.

291
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:22,820
Up The fucking pennant races
are heating up. All right.

292
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,430
I want to, I want to see
what you line up. Sorry.

293
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:28,010
You come walking up to the bar with you,
a little pulling your mate,

294
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,240
you fucking lineup card out
of your back pocket. Um,

295
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,170
okay.

296
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,130
By the way, that Blue Moon eyes is signed
to like a one year contract. You know,

297
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:38,401
you don't,

298
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:43,050
you just pick up a fucking big bat at the
end of the fucking season and like, he,

299
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:47,250
you know, he's not, he's not a
true red sock. Um, all right.

300
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,550
So anyways, by the way,
somebody tweeted at me,

301
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:55,260
that's stupid company out there and
fucking Wisconsin microchipping they're

302
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,290
fucking employees and these fucking
idiots are doing it. And you know,

303
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,940
and I'm like,
why would they do that?

304
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:04,941
And then all you have to do is look
at their faces and you look at them,

305
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,690
they, I have this childlike
innocence. They are believers.

306
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,340
That's all it is.

307
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,710
They grew up in a great state of Wisconsin
where you're sheltered. All right.

308
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,120
You're in the Midwest,

309
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:22,380
you're in the hat or the country that
fed fucking weasel and North Korea,

310
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,700
his missiles, even if it makes it that
far, he's not shooting it at Wisconsin.

311
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,143
Right.

312
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,500
The Green Bay packers did
they like owned by the fans?

313
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:36,240
It's fucking everybody's making cheese.
It's Mayberry. You ever been to Wisconsin?

314
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,540
It's fucking tremendous.
The air is fresh.

315
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,690
The water is fucking clean.
At least it looks that way.

316
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:47,890
When I drive by at 80 miles an hour and
a way to some God forsaken fucking place,

317
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:48,730
I'm going to perform it

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,833
right.

319
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,850
It's tremendous. Fuck
these people, they believe,

320
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,243
well,
I,

321
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,540
they all ordered the fight.

322
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,650
Okay.

323
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,670
They think he's gonna make it great again.
They Jace, they believe. You know why?

324
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,190
Because they're fucking
good people out there.

325
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,290
So they walk into the workday, hey
guys, this is the new thing, and they,

326
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:17,520
and they sit there, look at
GI. Don't know. This seems
a little bit creepy, right?

327
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,820
But how did they get them and how do you,

328
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,180
how do you get the general masses?
How do you get them all right?

329
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,970
There's two ways to get the general
masses fear and free tee shirts.

330
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,460
Yeah.

331
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,510
One or the other.

332
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,760
Yeah.

333
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,830
You scared the shit out of them.
They're fucking onboard.

334
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,460
You tell him the boogie
man under their bed,

335
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,460
whatever the fuck you tell them they
need to do, they got to fucking do it.

336
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,580
If you don't want to fucking waste your
time coming up some fucking boogeyman

337
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,460
story, just make a free fucking tee shirt.
And that's what they did in Wisconsin.

338
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,060
They had these fucking tee
shirts that said, I got chipped.

339
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,430
That was it. That was, that was
the tipping point. Wait a minute.

340
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,720
If I put that foreign object in
me that I have no idea what it is,

341
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,060
no idea what it's capabilities are.

342
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,980
No idea what it really does other
than what you tell me you evil cunt,

343
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,750
you'll give me that free tee shirt and
you know, they got to be extra soft once.

344
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,810
Oh my God, dude, my, I tell
you right now, my favorite,

345
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:24,590
my favorite go to t shirt is my,
I got chipped.

346
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,010
It's so soft,
you know?

347
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,610
Then as much as I'm making fun of them,

348
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,480
I see the writing on the wall
because there's way more people.

349
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,870
There's way more believers out there, you
know, believing in the invisible lines,

350
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:41,950
believing in the teams believe
in and all that fucking bullshit,

351
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,100
right?
Believing that they're evil,

352
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,030
but these people are saints or vice
versa, right? These people are either,

353
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,850
they do it,
they do it all over the world.

354
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,140
Okay?

355
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,990
God loves us, Baz. These people are
infidels. These people are fucking days.

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
These people are fucking that.

357
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,990
It's the thing is the common thread
with human beings is that this fucking

358
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,620
lunatics at the top.

359
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:06,750
Okay,

360
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,130
okay. And then you have nice people at
the bottom, you know, Wisconsin people,

361
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,260
people give the shirt off
your fucking back, you know,

362
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:17,270
provided you not to 10 let's,
let's not,

363
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:19,820
let's not overly romanticize these
white people. At the end of the day,

364
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:23,030
they are wiping, okay? And I'm
not shitting on my own people,

365
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,460
but just in a position, it's a
society and we were, you know,

366
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:29,630
nobody's watching us so we get
to go full fucking, you know,

367
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:33,770
full fucking frontal nudity with
their fucking brains. There's nobody,

368
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,030
there's nobody in our way, right? That's
why we go is where we go fucking crazy.

369
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,390
You need some sort of hand on,
maybe that's what the microchip is for.

370
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,900
I have no idea. I just know at the
end of the fucking trail, who is it?

371
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,640
Think of some of the people that run shit.
Look at Bill Clinton.

372
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,140
The man could not keep his dick in
his pants. He shoving cigars up,

373
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,960
women's vaginas half his fucking age.
That fucking guy that,

374
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:03,950
that's one of the guys run shit or someone
of his fucking ill keep you gonna let

375
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:07,440
that guy put a fucking microchip. What
do I get? A free shirt? Yes. Shit,

376
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:10,100
don't skippy. I write,
I'm in. And that's it.

377
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,380
And this is the thing they don't need.
They don't need thinking people to buy in.

378
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,470
All they need is the free tee shirt
people and the free t shirt people.

379
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,370
You get enough of them,

380
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,040
it becomes a tipping point and
then they can start changing.

381
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,940
You know what I mean? It's like the
toll booths, right? Everybody easy pass.

382
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:28,490
I'm not getting that. You're not gonna
fucking track where I'm going. All right.

383
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:30,020
And that was just one easy pass lane.

384
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,650
10 fucking lanes where you
throw your change in her
fucking went to a guy, right?

385
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,030
And then it became eight,
seven, six, five, four, three,
two, one. Go Fuck Yourself.

386
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,010
Well, you don't have to, you can
use the fucking surface roads.

387
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:45,280
You don't have to use the highways,
but your taxes did pay for them.

388
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,240
Then you like, fuck. That's what
happens. And they'll get all of us.

389
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,343
Do you know what?

390
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:51,810
Okay.

391
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,040
You know what I love about life though?

392
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,200
They can never stop you from
drinking yourself to death.

393
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,600
Okay?

394
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,690
And that's one to grow on. All right.
With that, let's, uh, I'm sorry.

395
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,410
They've got really fucking dark.
Um,

396
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,870
all right. What are we doing
here? Uh, live reads. Okay.

397
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,620
I'm reading off my phone here because I
have no internet where I'm at right now.

398
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,210
I'm gonna have to go drive down to
a fucking coffee shop. You know,

399
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,960
there's nothing in a coffee shop that I
want other than their internet. You know,

400
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,290
I don't drink coffee.
You're your little pastries.

401
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,950
Are they like eating a fucking bathroom
tile? They're always fucking up.

402
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,383
They just suck.

403
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,700
Everything in Starbucks fucking sucks.
I don't, I don't have the coffee.

404
00:23:34,701 --> 00:23:36,980
I know the coffees that heroin.
All right,

405
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,070
but you have to go into a bodega
that's really selling fucking drugs.

406
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,250
You know what I mean? You know, like
oldest cereal is, that's what that's like.

407
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:47,130
What fucking
like a Starbucks is?

408
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,350
It's like a drug deal in Bodega.

409
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,330
Okay.

410
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,340
Do you know what I mean? And
like the only thing that, that,

411
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,450
that is good in there that is,
that is not passed,

412
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:58,780
it's fucking date of freshness is
the fucking drugs at this selling.

413
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:01,600
And what Starbucks. It's the coffee.
Everything else in this sucks.

414
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,870
That's why you've got to
love Dunkin donuts, you know?

415
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,480
Okay.

416
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,270
The copy of a dental needs out of this
fucking world, but they also make,

417
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:12,360
they make these quite done. It's
all right. Draftkings everybody

418
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,200
okay?

419
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
A fantasy for all shit.
Draftkings is back.

420
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,080
I love these guys because they finally
admitted what the fuck they were doing.

421
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,070
All right. All right. She fucking
degenerate. Gamblers. Hey, you go,

422
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,330
you're in a loveless marriage.

423
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,310
Let's add to the pain draft kings fantasy
football season is almost here and

424
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:34,000
there's no better way to get closer
to the game you love than to put your

425
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,290
fucking paycheck on it.

426
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:40,291
With draft kings one week fantasy
football draft kings is hosting a $100,000

427
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,310
contest that is totally free to enter.

428
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,420
All you have to do is put your
paycheck down and if, yeah,

429
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,320
and if you don't draft the perfect lineup,
you can what?

430
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,480
And if you drafted the perfect lineup,

431
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:58,480
you can win $1 billion.

432
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,240
Okay?

433
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,340

I love that they're back in the ring.

450
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,290

I want to see that movie get made.

451
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,530
Okay.

452
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,340
How they came about,
how quickly they grew,

453
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,730
and now quickly at the state and federal
level, they're like, wait a minute,

454
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:17,320
this is a national dry eye gambling ring
and we're not getting any fucking money

455
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:17,890
out of this.

456
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,030
How many beaks did you have to
fucking wet to get back into the game?

457
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:23,900
Yeah.

458
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,780
Geez. I bet they went to one of
those. Bilderberg makes all right.

459
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,110
He like started a, he looks
at me with Alex. I don't know
what the fuck this is. A,

460
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:32,930
you're your unique. Oh, you're
a special person, aren't you?

461
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:36,290
You don't walk like everyone else.
Talk like everyone else. Sure.

462
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,650
Chat or anything that anyone
else has sleep like anyone else.

463
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:43,350
So why the fuck is your mattress?
One size fits all?

464
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,880
I don't know. Cause there's a
basic shape to everybody. Um,

465
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,730
because a truly customized mattress
will cost you five to 10,000 bucks. Oh,

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,530
there's the answer right
there. Until now, go to helix,

leading irrigant comics that biomechanics

470

experts, Jesus Christ. What
a sentence. The result,

471
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,920
the most comfortable mattress
you've ever slept on.

472
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,870
Helix customers report a 30% improvement
in overall sleep quality and for

473
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:22,290
couples, they customize each
side of the mattress. I, yes,

474
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,030
the beginning of the
end of the relationship,

475
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,860
you're a mattress arrives at your door in
about a week and shipping is 100% free.

476
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,670
I like buying to be like this.
Yeah, I like it to be like that.

477
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,300
I'd rather fuck this guy. I don't give
a shit. I'm already paying in her.

478
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,920
He likes sleep.

479
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,800
That's why everyone from Gq magazine to
Forbes are all talking about headaches.

480
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,200
Sleep. You have 100 nights to try
it out and if you don't love it,

481
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:50,730
they'll pick it up for free,
gross and give you a 100% refund.

482
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:54,560
No questions asked to be funny. If they
asked you what was the problem? Well,

483
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:56,970
I mean sleeping was okay,
but when I went to Bang my wife,

484
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,650
I kept getting this pain in my left knee.
Yeah, you know, I played sports, but I,

485
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:04,500
you know, I never had
pain in that one. Look,

486
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:08,130
my fucking knee hurts when I banged my
wife. I don't have to tell you. All right,

487
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:09,520
I'll sign there. All right, go to hell.

488
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,450
[inaudible] sleep.com/burr
and get $50 off your order.

489
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:15,210

491
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,720
E. L. I. X. O. Jesus. Look who's back
movement watches. Everyone hang in there.

492
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:29,580
I got two more here. Movement watches.
You guys know movement, right?

493
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,390
They reinvented the watch business
by selling directly to you.

494
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:38,390
With over 1 million watches
sold to date. Well, goddammit,

495
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,440
these bastards did it again except
this time with sunglasses, right?

496
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,500
You thought they were done with watches.
Now they're going to keep going.

497
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,370
They just shove one right across
the bow of every designer.

498
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:54,030
Fucking sunglass boat out there.
They were tired of having to pay.

499
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,630
They were tired of having to pay for
cheaply made throwaway shades are

500
00:28:57,631 --> 00:29:02,400
overpriced designer glasses. So they said,
fuck it. They actually wrote, screw it.

501
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:04,500
They said fuck it. You know, that's
what they said in the meeting.

502
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,410
We'll make our own starting at just 70
bucks movement sunglasses start at just

503
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:13,740
$70 with the option to
upgrade to polarized

504
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,210
with over. What the fuck
does that mean? Polarized.

505
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,490
You stop agreeing with people
the second length you fucking,

506
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,590
he's a polarizing character. Um,
those overpriced designer brands will,

507
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,140
will run you upwards of 200 bucks.

508
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,290
Movement figured out by selling online.

509
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,410
They were able to cut out the middleman
and retail markup providing the best

510
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:36,750
possible prices. They figured this
out with watches. They like, hey,

511
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:40,110
why not do it with John? Glad
did, I hope they keep going.

512
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:46,080
We've done it again. We've cut out
the middle man with fucking Dildos,

513
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,350
uh, where they are. High quality premium.

514
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,290
Okay.

515
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,790
I don't know how to say it's a c e t.
A T a state.

516
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:54,850
Okay.

Just get to the fucking point.
Wink,

532
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,190
W I N C for some reason pronounced wink.

533
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,670
Uh,
when you have a great glass of wine,

534
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,660
it enhances the moment whether
you're reflecting on, I, you know,

535
00:30:57,661 --> 00:30:59,280
if I had to make a wine lineup,

536
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,250
okay,

537
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,061
this is what it would be.

538
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:05,370
Who's leading off you got to
get lead off with a cat eye

539
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,960
man. You fucking, uh, bottom of the order.

540
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:14,961
I don't know who the fuck all I know is
a Barolos battened cleanup for me and I

541
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:19,290
don't give a fuck about anything
else about why. You know what I mean?

542
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,740
I take on the whole wine world, but
just the two of those nice fucking cab.

543
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,420
But I want to get shit face Barolo if I
don't know if I did something that day.

544
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,680
All right? Uh, when you have a great
glass of wine, it enhances the moment.

545
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,220
Whether you're reflecting on the
day or with someone you love.

546
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,870
Wink understands this.
It's why they started their company.

547
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,670
I mean how many times we have to tell
you this is why they fucking did it.

use it. What if I wasn't on the wagon?

550
00:31:51,261 --> 00:31:53,110
I do say shit cause I,

551
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,120
cause if you can't put together a nine
fucking bottle list of booze bear or why,

552
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,500
yeah,

553
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,870
I guess liquor I should say then,
then you know,

554
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:03,870

you're really doing your liver a
disservice. Just try winc.com t r y,

556
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,021
W,

557
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:14,021
I n c.com take a brief palate profile
quiz and somehow that'll end up on

558
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,570
somebody's microchip in their
fucking hand in Wisconsin and Winkle.

559
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:21,950
Recommend distinct and interesting wines
actually customized to your pallet to

00:32:21,951 --> 00:32:25,460
be shipped directly to your door every
month. None of your time is what?

561
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:28,130
You'd be funny if he committed a murder
years later and you left the fucking

562
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:30,620
wine glass and they went back
to this information. Well,

563
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:34,520
it says here that that wine
glass was part of your profile.

564
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,960
Is that not true?

565
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,800
Yeah,

566
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,090
it's part of your palate.
Then you get all nervous.

567
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:45,260
She just confessed to it on the stand.
Right? Like they could sit 1950s cop show.

568
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,980
They were tired of having to pay
for cheaply. Made throwaway wait,

569
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,870
that's the shades were like,
what did I do here?

570
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,930
Or none of your time is wasted fitting

584
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,780
You don't. One thing I do like about
tech technology, I like docusign.

585
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,760
I really enjoy that shit makes it nice and
fucking easy. Oh, by the way, I have to,

586
00:33:58,761 --> 00:34:00,980
I have to hide this gig
because they don't do a lot of,

587
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,580
they don't do a lot of standup
at this venue. Now at this point,

588
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:06,200
if you listen to the podcast for a while,

589
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:10,940
now you realize that you know as much
as old freckles goes on stage telling

590
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:14,300
jokes, he's actually a
frustrated musician. You know,

591
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,930
I wish I was good at guitar,
was show as good at trumps.

592
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,470
I have a tremendous amount
of respect for musicians.

593
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,540
Speaking of which Queens of the Stone Age,

594
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:28,010
one of my favorite bands of all time
put out their brand new album this week.

595
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,480
I'm going to be listening to it and
I'll give you my own review of it on

596
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:35,390
Thursday. Just kidding. I
fucking hate when people do that.

597
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,610
That comes supposed to listen to
you. Who the fuck are you? You know,

598
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,760
fucking listen to you. I'll listen
to it myself and make up my own mind.

599
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:48,200
How about that? How about that? All there
youtube person, youtube person. Anyways,

600
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:52,250
I'm going to be a November 2nd.
I'm going to be in clear lake,

601
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,900
Iowa at the surf ballroom.
Now the surf ballroom is the,

602
00:34:56,901 --> 00:35:00,800
that's the last place buddy Holly,
the big Bopper, Ritchie Valens.

603
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:01,970
All of those guys played.

604
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,110
Waylon Jennings was there that night and
he went on the bus and everything. Um,

605
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,640
just being a music fan, I dunno if
it's slightly morbid to play there,

606
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,500
but I'm going to play
there and I'm flying in.

607
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,360
I'm landing at the fucking airport. They
took off from every everyday a killer.

608
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:16,430
Angie fucking nervous.

609
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,120
They crashed because there was
no de sync technology back then.

610
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,810
They had too much weight on their wings,
which changed the shape of the air foil.

611
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,570
They were overweight.
They could fucking produce enough lift.

612
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:27,510
They crashed and they die.

613
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,950
That's not going to happen in 2017 so I'm
going to be there. Won't happen to me.

614
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:35,590
It won't happen to you. If you want
to check out this legendary venue, uh,

615
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,090
November 2nd clear lake,
Iowa surf ballroom.

616
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,480
I'm going to be there with Dean del Rey
who was actually born the same day that

617
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:47,830
they all died. Not the same year, but
the same day. So it's going to be,

618
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,850
there's going to be tremendously
freaky fucking night. Um,

619
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,620
I got a brand new hour and last night I,

620
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,110
I it could not have gone better and
I left out half of my fucking jokes.

621
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:59,950
I was having so much fun, uh,
down at the Cape Cod Melody Tent.

622
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,500
So please get you tickets to
November 2nd clear lake, Iowa,

623
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,750
the surf ballroom and I will be tweeting
out and Facebooking out a link because

624
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:12,720
I am an old man. I'm not on Photoshop,
I'm not on Instagram. It's not Photoshop.

625
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,150
What's the other one is Instagram. And
then there's the other one. Snapchat.

626
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:21,400
I need to get on those, right? Is
that what I need to do a, by the way,

627
00:36:21,401 --> 00:36:23,290
I'm thinking of putting
together a college tour,

628
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,570
a tour of colleges in the
beginning of next year, um,

629
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,690
to help promote F is for family
and bringing a bunch of swag to,

630
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,960
uh, you know, free merchandise
free f is for family merchandise.

631
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,070
This is what I want to do by get
enough interest from certain schools,

632
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:44,680
especially the University of Kansas,

633
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:47,830
when the Jay Hawks have
a home basketball game.

634
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,300
So I can go to that legendary arena.
That would be tremendous.

635
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,840
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

636
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,060
I was actually thinking of doing that
once a year, right in every like,

637
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,760
you know, college fucking,
um, division. You know,

638
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,500
like one year I'll do a big 10 fucking f
is for family tour. I'll do an SCC one,

639
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:14,970
I'll do a pack 12, whatever the fuck
they're called now. Um, the whack,

640
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,850
right. Do something
like that. I don't know.

641
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,950
I'm always thinking of fucking
idea like that shit, but uh,

642
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:24,710
just to help promote it and um,
may cause that's my fucking job.

643
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:27,450
I got to sell the goddamn shoving. They'll
get mad at me. All right. All right,

644
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:30,540
37 minutes in. Here we go. Here
we go. All right, let's uh,

645
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,700
let's read some of your questions here
for this week. I'm up up, up, up, up, up,

646
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:39,380
up a bone. The nineties.
Dear Billy temple pilot,

647
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,210
I'm feeling a bit nostalgic for the 90s.
I was 12 and 1990.

648
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,610
I'm 10 years older than you.

649
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:48,980
You have bested and had no
stress or responsibilities.

650
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,120
I get how that influences this,
but it was a good time.

651
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,770
I'm happy with technology
now in our society. Is more
conscious of social issues,

652
00:37:57,771 --> 00:37:59,600
but everything is so loud now.

653
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,720
Do you ever get into style
check for the 90s if so,

654
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:07,160
what part of the nineties can you have
your podcast guy use the friends theme

655
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,850
song for the Thursday podcast?
That's a question mark there or anything.

656
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:14,810
Awesome from the 90s uh, thanks
for reading this. If you do,

657
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,070
life is pretty boring these days
and if I could you use something?

658
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,510
Yeah,

659
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,780
to brighten my day as a pet store manager.
All right sir.

660
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,780
Here's what's happening to you is you're
slipping into your life and you don't

661
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:35,380
like what's going on. So rather than
fixing the, now you're going back in time,

662
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,900
that's not, I mean that's,
that's a temporary fix. Okay.

663
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,150
If you don't want to manage a pet store,

664
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,920
asked yourself what you really want to
do and start slowly walking towards that,

665
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:49,120
taking a half a step,

666
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,570
a quarter step every day in one point
you're going to look up and God damn it,

667
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:53,404
there it is.

668
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,120
Just like Indiana Jones and then you
grab it and all of a sudden a giant ball

669
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:02,200
starts rolling FDA and you got to fucking
run out of there and that's you after

670
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:05,020
you make it, then trying
to stay there. All right.

671
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:09,070
But that's way more exciting than
managing this pet store that, you know,

672
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,520
you're saying brighten your
day as a pet store manager.

673
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,530
You one of these guys who
actually doesn't like animals.

674
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,260
You probably don't like the people.
Right? Coming in there, whatever.

675
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:19,960
I don't know what it is but it's,
but I will answer your question.

676
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,880
My favorite part of the 90s

677
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,800
was the month before nevermind came
out and I was listening to the skid row

678
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:33,790
slave to the grind and I thought hair
metal and all night when the hair metal,

679
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:38,791
but metal was never going to end because
that was what you love was the end of

680
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:44,131
my youth because I was 22 in 1990 so
that was the end of the end of it for me.

681
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,660
So like think about 2000 for you.
You're getting out of college,

682
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,260
all this new music is coming out. You're
starting to not be able to, you know,

683
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:54,940
the next few years,
you can't keep up with it.

684
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:58,060
What the fuck are they listening to?
And then that's what happens.

685
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,250
And then you start driving around it.

686
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,270
But I'm not going to lie to you do the
shit that I say. I still listened to 'em

687
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:03,930
okay.

688
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,960
You know, I try to listen to newer shit
like you know, it's a new band to me,

689
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:10,380
like Cold War kids and I'm
like guy, I saw them, you know,

690
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:12,780
recently they were on TV, I'll download
some of this stuff. And I'm like,

691
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:13,860
oh I remember that song.

692
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,290
Okay

693
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,390
that fucking ball. Bam
My pant, that Song Ben

694
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,290
fucking soon. The guys singing way,
the really high voice, amazing voice.

695
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,783
And um,

696
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,170
I was looking at dance like that fucking
album came out 2006 or something.

697
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:35,340
So I'm way behind the curve but
uh, I try to stay up on, all right,

698
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:36,480
you want to hear something embarrassing?

699
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:40,650
I'm going to fucking tell you all
my latest, my latest downloads.

700
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,280
I downloaded dream weaver by Gary Wright,

701
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:46,440
that album tremendously,

702
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,600
tremendously fucking uh,
underrated album.

703
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,050
All right.
Cause everybody thinks of a,

704
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,740
they think of that song,

705
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,310
we'll, we'll, we'll dream weaver.

706
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,110
Right? And everybody laughs at
that song, you know, they use it.

707
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:07,770
And these ironic history hipster
fucking ways. I gotta tell you, man,

708
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,310
that fucking album is the shit.

709
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:16,870
And um, this stuff is some
poppy shit on that. But, um,

710
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,820
all these years of me talking about
loving to play drums and all this stuff,

711
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:25,090
why did nobody tell me about Andy Newmark?
Jesus Christ.

712
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,080
That guy's one of the best fucking
drummers I've ever heard he plays on this

713
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:30,600
album. And uh, you know,

714
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:33,150
you don't have to get it for fucking
dream weaver or any of that shit.

715
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,600
Like a love is alive.

716
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,960
The longest time I thought that
sounded like Clapton to me.

717
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:42,260
Singing or maybe like one of
those, uh, Steve Winwood bands.

718
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,043
MMM.

719
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,500
Just listen to how tasty
the fucking drums are.

720
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:51,490
And I'll actually post a video this week
of him fucking playing with like Rod

721
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,510
Stewart and these guys just fucking
Waylon. All right. So he downloaded that.

722
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:59,470
Then I downloaded Cold War kids,
Robertson cowards.

723
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:04,120
I'm downloading the new
queens of the stone age today.
And then here's, oh Jesus,

724
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,830
by his in defense of me,

725
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:09,890
I lost a lot of my music when I dropped
my last phone into the toilet. Um,

726
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:14,470
it was actually in my back pocket
and I stood up from taking,

727
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:18,880
taking a dump, right? No, no I didn't.
I didn't, I was fucking hammered.

728
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,690
I remember this guy was saying there
was something about standing up when you

729
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:27,050
take a Piss, some fucking health reasons.
So I sat down like a lady, right?

730
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,880
And I had my phone in my back pocket
when I stood up at fucking fell into the

731
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,530
toilet. Fucking brutal. Like I
was going to go get that. Nah,

732
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,170
it ain't happen. And so I don't
use the cloud and everything.

733
00:42:38,171 --> 00:42:42,730
Just I lost everything. So I downloaded
ACDC. If you want blood, you got it.

734
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:47,731
Live ACDC for those about to rock a c
d c high voltage than I had to get my

735
00:42:48,581 --> 00:42:52,630
vintage Aerosmith and there I
downloaded get your wings, rocks,

736
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,130
toys in the attic.

737
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,450
Then I downloaded the new fucking mute
math while I'm on weight and I'm still

738
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,490
waiting for the rest of that album.
Come out to play dead.

739
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,930
I downloaded Glen Campbell rhinestone
cowboy cause I've been singing that with

740
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:09,820
the advertising LACOE Rad stone ball bag.
Uh,

741
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,590
Peter Frampton, Frampton
comes alive. All js,

742
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,390
all j a this is all yours.
Marvin gay sexual healing download.

743
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:23,230
What a fucking tremendous song that is.
The new royal blood album.

744
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,093
MMM

745
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,690
Anthony Hamilton.

746
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,430
Then I downloaded like three prints
albums not to have them sign of the times

747
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,280
and then a dirty mind.
The first sound garden album,

748
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,770
the prince album for you.

749
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,420
Then Dave Brubeck live at Carnegie Hall,

750
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,410
then a bunch of miles Davis. That's what
I've done in the last couple of months.

751
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,260
Stamen with miles working with miles
round about midnight, relaxing with miles,

752
00:43:57,261 --> 00:44:00,860
cooking with miles.
And there you go.

753
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,310
That's what the fuck I've
been downloading. What
else do I get here, Wayne?

754
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:05,144
Shorter.

755
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:06,800
Okay.

756
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,410
The idiot king. Attention
deficits. I think that's it.

757
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:16,430
Oh, that's what's his face? Tim Alexander
on drums on that. The brown album.

758
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,740
Bad Motor finger. Temple of the dog. Oh,

759
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,290
that was right when
I'm Chris Cornell died.

760
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,670
I had to get all that fucking music
back on my phone. John Coltrane,

761
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:32,460
Sonny Rollins, Tesla skid, they go,

762
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,420
Marilyn Manson, prime primers, primers,

763
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:41,490
animals should not act like people.
Pork, Soda and sailing the seas. Cheese.

764
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,000
You're not Derosa just sent
me a new fucking, they're new.

765
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,420
Their latest fucking track. It's
the shit. I absolutely loved it.

766
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,530
Primus has a new one coming out with
the fuck is it called? Let me see here.

767
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,750
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
In my phone. In my phone and my phone.

768
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,830
All right. What do I have
him underneath? You know,

769
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,020
everybody says Joe has no shoulders.
That's not true.

770
00:45:03,021 --> 00:45:06,950
He lacks the meat that is between
your neck and your shoulders.

771
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,810
Basically his trip. He's, he's, he
was born without it. Um, all right.

772
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:15,050
Prime is the seven. Check
that out this week. All right.

773
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,570
Enough with his old man telling
you the music that he likes.

774
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:21,800
Let's get back to your young people
questions here, shall we? So, um, yeah,

775
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,080
when grunge came in, I got
up. I didn't like the first,

776
00:45:24,081 --> 00:45:27,830
like when Pearl jam first came
out and Nirvana first came out,

777
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,610
I didn't like those bands because they
knocked all my bands off the top 10.

778
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:37,010
You know, I was like, this isn't a
good band. What about Brittany Fox?

779
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:41,540
What about winger? A man. What about
warrant? Um, and yeah, I listened.

780
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:43,250
I didn't necessarily buy all those albums,

781
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:45,320
but I didn't think any of that
was bad music. I was young,

782
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:46,830
I didn't fucking know any
better, you know, lease.

783
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:50,180
Those guys could fucking play under these
cons today with a fucking laptop and a

784
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:53,570
God damn Christmas tree in their head.
Um,

785
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:58,670
so it took me a long time to admit that
nirvana pearl jam were great bands,

786
00:45:58,671 --> 00:46:02,510
but like Soundgarden and fucking Allison
chains had like fucking that anger in

787
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:07,400
there. Um, and just the
sound of the lead singers,

788
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:10,430
man, I just, I really liked
their front men and uh,

789
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,430
okay.

790
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,110
Now of course, you know, I love Pearl
Jam. I love Nirvana and all that shit,

791
00:46:14,111 --> 00:46:18,130
but I was a bit of a baby when their
music came out. I was, I was too young.

792
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,250
This is the first time I was seeing my
music go away so I wasn't mature enough

793
00:46:21,251 --> 00:46:25,570
to be like, you know what, you know,
I have to accept that, uh, you know,

794
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,670
my time has come and gone and that this
is what the fucking music is now and I

795
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:33,850
should listen to him. It took me a good
20 years to be able to do that. All right.

796
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,420
Hey there, Billy Clinton. Uh, did
you, did you hear that she had,

797
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:42,450
the court ruled that the head of the
Democratic National Convention Debit

798
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:44,261
Wasserman,
that's her name.

799
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:49,261
Dib B I t Sholtz rig the
primaries against Bernie Sanders.

800
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,540
The court what court.

801
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:59,400
So this woman under the influence of
Hillary Clinton's camp tampered in the u s

802
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,970
election process,
but none of the Democrats are celebrity.

803
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:07,971
Do rights are going to be outraged
because there's sanctimonious ass hats.

804
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:14,370
And for the record, I was a registered
Democrat and stop fucking saying that.

805
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:16,510
If it's a fact, it's a
fact. I don't need to know.

806
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,350
I used to be or this or I
actually voted for Obama.

807
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:22,200
I don't give a fuck what you did.
If what you're saying is factual,

808
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:23,730
I don't need to know what the fuck he did.

809
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,600
I was a registered Democrat
until about 2010 by Blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

810
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:31,960
blah, blah. With the exception of
Bush and Gerald Ford. Uh, anyways,

811
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:36,010
the hypocrisy is just so insane
to me to not be mad at this,

812
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:39,550
especially as a democrat. I think you
have to have clinical issues. Yeah. Well,

813
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:43,090
I heard like Bernie Sanders was drawn
a bunch of people and they just didn't

814
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:46,570
even cover it. All right. Now where
does this coming from? This is the, uh,

815
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,000
the observer.com.

816
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:50,830
Okay.

817
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,290
June,
2016,

818
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:56,430
a class action suit was filed against
the Democratic National Committee and the

819
00:47:56,431 --> 00:48:01,290
former Democratic national, uh, was Debbie
Debbie Wasserman Schultz for violating,

820
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,081
uh,

821
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:08,081
the DNC charter by rigging the Democratic
presidential primaries for Hillary

822
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,940
Clinton against Bernie Sanders.
How hilarious would be this big?

823
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,670
It's actually doubly sad if this is true.

824
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:21,030
Even former Senate minority leader
Harry Reid admitted in July,

825
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,730
2016 I knew everybody knew
that this was not a fair deal.

826
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,630
He added that Debbie Wasserman Schultz
should have resigned much sooner than she

827
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:29,230
did.

828
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,980
The lawsuit was filed to
push the Democratic National
Convention to admit their

829
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:37,200
wrongdoing and provide Bernie Sanders
supporters who supported him financially

830
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,890
millions of dollars in
campaign contributions with
restitution for being cheated

831
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,050
on August 25th, 2017 federal judge
Williams shy is this all true,

832
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:51,100
dismissed the lawsuit after several
months of litigation during which the

833
00:48:51,101 --> 00:48:55,240
Democratic national conventions attorneys
argued that the DNC would be with,

834
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:59,500
well within their rights to rig primaries
and select their own candidates.

835
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,080
That was their argument.
So they weren't denying it.

836
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,740
And evaluating plaintiff's claims that
this, you know what I'm going to do?

837
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:10,520
I'm going to send this to Jimmy door
and I want him to cause he, you know,

838
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:12,980
I'm too stupid to be able
to debunk this or say that.

839
00:49:12,981 --> 00:49:16,250
It's actually fucking trope.
I want to know.

840
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,230
I want to know what love is.

841
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:20,930
Yeah,

842
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,540
I mean, this wouldn't surprise
me. You know what I mean?

843
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,840
I would actually love if this got some
fucking attention just to truly shut up

844
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:34,700
all these fucking dopes in Hollywood. You
don't, you know, back in the day. Yeah.

845
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,100
I mean, I guess I, I mean I think
that, I mean it was getting, no,

846
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,910
I'm not trying to be the spokesperson
for fucking Wesson oil or whatever the

847
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,730
fuck people are trying to do out there,
but like,

848
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,390
I try to like evenly trash everybody
and I'm totally into conspiracy theory.

849
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,910
Like none of this is shocking to me.

850
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,483
You know?

851
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,890
I just, I just think we're just inherently
flawed and I base that on myself

852
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,690
as I fucking, you know, I as
like just fuck up all the time,

853
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:13,060
which is what, just inherently
flawed people. All right, Jimmy door.

854
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,720
There we go.
This is how dumb I am.

855
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:21,440
I'm going to send this to him and
I'm just going to text. Is this true?

856
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,573
Okay.

857
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,530
You know, and he loves me
enough to actually reply this.

858
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,540
I know part of him is going to
feel sad that I'm as dumb as I am.

859
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:33,920
Yeah.

860
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,120
And then I have his phone
number. Um, yeah. I mean,

861
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,240
okay.

862
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,520
None of that surprises me.
I mean it was,

863
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:46,610
he kind of felt that Bernie was
getting boxed out and I guess maybe the

864
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,203
Democratic National
Committee does have the,

865
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:52,500
I guess does have the right to do it
the same way the NFL had the right to

866
00:50:52,501 --> 00:50:56,430
suspend Tom Brady, whether he
did anything or not. I mean,

867
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,500
when they took it to court,
they go, yeah, this is bullshit.

868
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:00,180
You don't have enough fucking
evidence. And they're like, well,

869
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:03,700
we're a cooperation. Right.
It doesn't cooperate and have
a right, this is planned.

870
00:51:03,701 --> 00:51:06,900
It's employee. Yes, you dealt
well Tom Brady's our employee,

871
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,420
therefore he suspended.
Um,

872
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,390
that's Kinda like what they did
to Bernie Sanders and yes, I did.

873
00:51:12,391 --> 00:51:16,020
Just compare him to Tom Brady.
I think they have a lot in common.

874
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm living in a retirement
community at 33 years of age.

875
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,990
What's up freckled ball bag.
Um,

876
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,220
a friend recently turned me onto your
podcast. It's hilarious. Well thank you.

877
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,970
Thank you for preventing me from killing
myself with my one hour commute to work.

878
00:51:32,971 --> 00:51:35,640
Well, that's great. I like
to, I like to do what I can,

879
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,600
although I am into population. Maybe I
should take a control population control.

880
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:42,030
Maybe we should take a couple
of weeks off. Uh, my wife,

881
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:46,170
28 and I 33 finally had enough
money to buy our first home to what?

882
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:50,160
You guys are crushing it. So he purchased
a nice little townhouse in Connecticut.

883
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,480
We didn't know at the time,

884
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:55,860
but we were moving into a community that
is potentially the evil offspring of a

885
00:51:55,861 --> 00:52:00,420
retirement village and the house of wax.
Oh yeah.

886
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:03,090
Well that's what happens when you
buy your first house. You so excited.

887
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:07,680
You don't drive around. You don't know
the questions to ask. Now, you know,

888
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:12,570
are the people oldest shit around here?
Just out of curiosity,

889
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,590
is this a drug filled the neighborhood?

890
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:17,950
Okay.

891
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,460
Is there any chemical
fucking shit in the water?

892
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,640
What are the schools like? You know,
all those questions you have to ask.

893
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:28,270
All right, we are nice,
courteous people. And so we think

894
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,850
or so we think he's a, so don't take
the anger in this email out of context.

895
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,420
Um, well he had a little
perspective that we used to.

896
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:40,210
If you said we're a nice courtesy people,
courteous people,

897
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,170
but the fact that you actually have
the intelligence to say or so we think

898
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:48,610
understanding that there is
another perspective in life
other than your own. Uh,

899
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,460
we've helped some of our old ass
neighbors carry shit, you know,

900
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:54,970
because they can't,
with the osteoporosis and everything,

901
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,780
we wave and chat with them when walking
our dog and we even hold the charity

902
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:03,781
beer pong tournament in New York City
every year to raise money for ms uh,

903
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:06,850
unrelated to our community, but
shows we care. Question Mark,

904
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:11,590
I guess question Mark
Anyhoo enough about us. Uh,

905
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:16,591
this past weekend we had my brother
and sister in law in town and invited

906
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:19,450
another couple over on Saturday,
Saturday.

907
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,900
I'm sorry if I blew your eardrums out.
I tried to pull it away enough. Uh,

908
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,670
I don't think I took it
away in time. Sorry. Uh,

909
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,360
we went to hang out at school
at our, at our pool, sorry.

910
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,380
We took a float snacks,
a couple of beers and a speaker.

911
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:39,330
There were five to seven other people
at the pool, all in their hundreds.

912
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,310
It did not look like the pool
scene from caddy shack. Uh,

913
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:45,061
we hung out,

914
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:50,061
chatted symptom beer and listened on
low to Jack Johnson or some other mellow

915
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,360
soft shit.

916
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:56,790
Monday morning at 10:00 AM the entire
community got this email residents,

917
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:01,140
it was reported to the board and the
management that over this past weekend

918
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:04,770
there was some owners and guests
who behaved inappropriately,

919
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,260
loud and shouting conversations,

920
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:12,261
foul language and may have partaken in
alcoholic beverages prior to or while

921
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:13,470
visiting the pool.

922
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:18,770
None of these things are acceptable and
are also violation of the pool rules of

923
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:21,240
the old fucks court.

924
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:25,680
Obviously you added that if [inaudible]
if set individuals we're seeing behaving

925
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:27,450
in such a manner going forward,

926
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,830
the police may be called
and said individuals will
not be permitted to use the

927
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:36,540
facilities and may also be subject to
a hearing in front of the board whereby

928
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,430
fines may be imposed.

929
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,960
The pool facility is for the peaceful
enjoyment of all residents and we hope to

930
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:44,430
keep it that way.
Thank you.

931
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:50,160
Signed the old ass board of directors,
Jesus Christ,

932
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:55,161
to what the f you didn't realize your
fucking bought a house in a retirement

933
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:58,710
community says first off,

934
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:01,230
let me say I've had,

935
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:05,640
I had nothing against the elderly.
I love my grandparents. It's,

936
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,740
you don't have to stop
establishing credibility.

937
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:12,360
You bought a fucking house is a bunny
in it and it's like the movie cocoon.

938
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:16,970
But if you jump in the pool, you're
still fucking old. I get it. Um,

939
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,230
anyways,
I called the once a week.

940
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:23,520
I enjoy quiet night in the couch with
some scotch or an old fashion and shit.

941
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:28,860
I still use hotmail.
Yes, we're a part of Hoa.

942
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:33,210
And then rules above above about
alcohol drinks at the pool.

943
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:37,440
You can only have two guests
per household. Oh Shit.
We violated the covenant.

944
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:41,310
But this email from the board is still
absurd, right? No, it's not absurd.

945
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:44,400
You just didn't do your homework.
You didn't do your homework.

946
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:46,943
That's what happened.

947
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,370
You didn't do your homework and they just
fucking rip the spread here with that

948
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:54,850
pen in the back pocket waiting on
my mother's fucking quilt here. Um,

949
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,610
I'm on the fuck am I here? I got to
go back to this year. By the way,

950
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:03,420
everybody thinks every sound on my podcast
is a fart now cause I hold this thing

951
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:05,610
to my chest and he's fucking
sound that's made though.

952
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:10,470
You're fucking ripped ass last
week. Uh, I mean, maybe I did.

953
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:14,820
I don't think, I mean I don't feel that
I am. Maybe I am. I don't know. Um,

954
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,210
but it's, I'm mean, I mean my house,
you know, I have to Fart. I let it go.

955
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:21,300
You can't fucking smell
it. Deal with it. Um,

956
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,440
no dude is all on you.
This is just, and he said,

957
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:28,240
but loud conversations.
What?

958
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:31,870
Drinking alcoholic beverages prior to
visiting the pool area. You kidding me?

959
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:36,400
The police may be called
get an f in life to do.

960
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:40,000
This is their life. This is the end
of their life. And they want quiet.

961
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,750
Okay. Half of them probably
fought and fucking wars.

962
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:47,740
The last thing I need is you with
your new fangled fucking Elvis' music.

963
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:49,330
That is Jack Johnson to them.

964
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,300
Yeah,

965
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,660
look at this is the deal.
You guys fucked up.

966
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,793
Okay.

967
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:02,580
You guys fucked up. All right. And this
is part of buying your first house. Okay.

968
00:57:02,581 --> 00:57:05,130
I bought my first house back in 2011

969
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,063
mmm.

970
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,340
And you know what I was like,
wow is a great old house.

971
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:12,840
It has a lot of character and you know,

972
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:17,100
you know what my fucking old people at
the pool was galvanized pipes in the

973
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:21,330
walls. Cloth wiring, a gas leak flashing.

974
00:57:21,331 --> 00:57:25,350
When I turned on the lights to possibly
ignite the gas underneath my fucking

975
00:57:25,351 --> 00:57:29,130
house, a wood rot, termites,

976
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,530
non permitted fucking building shy,
just you fucking name it.

977
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,520
Put a new roof on it. The Guy fucked
up. He didn't reattach the thing.

978
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:42,270
The water came through. They blamed me. I
just said fuck it. I paid for it myself.

979
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,990
This is part of it, dude. I'm really
sorry that you're going through this.

980
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,560
I'm sure there's somebody else old
that will buy your fucking house.

981
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,133
MMM.

982
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:56,640
Other than that, I would just,
you are in a communal area.

983
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,110
I would be quiet when you
go down to the pool, I mean,

984
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,610
I try to look at the bright side.

985
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:06,390
At least nobody's going to be listening
to loud fucking Benny Goodman music all

986
00:58:06,391 --> 00:58:08,550
the way into the night because old people,
you know,

987
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,970
they fall asleep like nine times a day.
So,

988
00:58:11,971 --> 00:58:14,520
and even if he don't like your neighbor,
they're going to die soon.

989
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:16,890
There's a lot of positive ways
to look at it and you can also,

990
00:58:16,891 --> 00:58:21,270
you can always sell. So I would make
the best of it. You can always Uber.

991
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,351
I would Uber,

992
00:58:22,351 --> 00:58:25,530
I would go out and go get fucking
hammered and be loud and the young part of

993
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:27,240
town and then come back.

994
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,960
Just make sure you get some
sort of electric car to
crucially up real quietly to

995
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:33,660
your fucking front door.
I'm sorry you're going through that.

996
00:58:33,661 --> 00:58:37,290
But what you learned is you have to
fucking check out your neighborhood before

997
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:40,980
you, uh, you know, you
got to read everything,

998
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:46,410
you know, so that's the deal. All
right. I hope it works out for you.

999
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,350
All right.
Oh guess who just texts me back?

1000
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:55,010
This is why Jimmy doors to shit cause
I just read shit and Jimmy gets to the

1001
00:58:55,021 --> 00:58:59,340
bottom. But this is what Jimmy just sent
me back. Basically. Yes, the judge left,

1002
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,400
opened the door for the lawyers to,

1003
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:04,470
to refile in a way that
would be more successful.

1004
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:08,700
The important thing in this case is that
the lawsuit forced the DNC lawyer to

1005
00:59:08,701 --> 00:59:13,350
admit in court that they don't have to
run a fair primary and that they can pick

1006
00:59:13,351 --> 00:59:17,880
and choose whoever, whoever they
want and can ignore the voters.

1007
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,010
Uh, they can ignore the
voters, will if they to do so.

1008
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:27,020
The wiki leaks emails revealed that
the DNC was colluding with the Clinton

1009
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,870
campaign and gave her an unfair advantage,

1010
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:34,550
which is why Wasserman Schultz resigned
before the DNC convention last summer.

1011
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,440
The judge dismissed the case.

1012
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:41,150
It appears to me based on the fact that
plaintiff did not have stand standing to

1013
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:44,810
sue and the federal court did not
have jurisdiction in this case.

1014
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,200
I am interviewing the lawyer
who filed this case today,

1015
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:53,030
so hopefully lots will be cleared up
in that interview. So there you go.

1016
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:57,350
Search Jimmy Dore. Um,
I'll send out a link to,

1017
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,260
that's a comedian that's,
that's an informed guide.

1018
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:02,570
Here are that thing was written.
You hear on eloquent. That was,

1019
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:07,250
I actually sounded smart while
rating that. Um, check that out.

1020
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,490
Oh Man. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1021
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,330
All those women who cried over fucking
Hillary Clinton and she's just as fucking

1022
01:00:15,331 --> 01:00:19,140
filthy as this guy. Can you believe this?
Trump. Can you fucking believe this?

1023
01:00:19,141 --> 01:00:19,501
Trump.

1024
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:23,580
That's all you hear out in fucking
Hollywood land where I live and it's just

1025
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:25,920
like I want to,
I hope it's true so I can be like,

1026
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,330
well what do you think about that?

1027
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,160
And watch them completely dismiss it
the same way to go back to Tom Brady.

1028
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,460
Well I'll be all right. So He lets a
cons. Hair, what they are out of a ball.

1029
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,180
What about when you guys did this and
that the other people root for the law?

1030
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,760
That was no fucking big
deal cause our team did it.

1031
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:47,480
I fucking love it. I love it. Oh
Jesus Christ. Do I love it? Okay.

1032
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:50,870
Boss, racist, racist,
racist. Question Mark.

1033
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:56,860
Hey Billy. Booze bag. Ah, Bill. You
know, fun. 11 days motherfucker.

1034
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,190
Ah, shut up. I know you're not
drinking. Oh, he got me. Look at that.

1035
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,510
I'm any more, it's all I could come
up with. All right. Bill recently,

1036
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:09,410
our company at an event where we give
a tour to possible clients who will

1037
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:11,450
partner with us in the
future during this event,

1038
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:13,640
our boss who was outgoing and funny,

1039
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:18,820
was ironing white sheets and thought
it'd be funny to poke fun at the KKK by

1040
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:23,210
placing a white sheet over his head
and saying, black lives matter.

1041
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:24,291
Uh,

1042
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:27,500
he immediately recognized the situation
and took it off his head and address the

1043
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:28,730
whole company in the next day.

1044
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,380
He apologized and made our counselors
available to the company for whatever was

1045
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:38,240
affected and offended Jesus fucking
Christ. You got to go through all of that.

1046
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:39,500
Okay.

1047
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,600
I just love these people
that are just so fucking,

1048
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,840
I don't know where the fuck they live
that they feel like I can do this and

1049
01:01:44,841 --> 01:01:48,770
they're not going to have a problem,
but then everybody's like so fucking hurt.

1050
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,150
They need to be counseled.

1051
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,810
Why don't you just trying to get
out of your job for a couple hours?

1052
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,020
Just walk up to the guy and say,
you're a fucking asshole.

1053
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,190
And then if you want the guy fired,

1054
01:01:58,191 --> 01:02:02,260
just say that someone's got to
sit there and hold your hand. I'm,

1055
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:07,270
the only problem was that he left out the
black lives mattered part in the first

1056
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:11,990
meeting and simply said,
oh, wait a minute. So when
I would, he's saying, okay,

1057
01:02:11,991 --> 01:02:12,824
wait a second.

1058
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,280
Yeah.

1059
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,650
The only problem was that he left out
the black life lives matter part in the

1060
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:23,790
first meeting and simply said,
he placed the sheet over his head,

1061
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,820
which is where the outrage came from.

1062
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,200
Yeah.

1063
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,080
You know, dude, that's one of the
most important part information,

1064
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,000
most important information
in this fucking story.

1065
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:34,560
And you left out some words here.

1066
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:35,480
Okay.

1067
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,980
The only problem was that he left out the
black lives mattered part in the first

1068
01:02:39,981 --> 01:02:42,740
meeting and simply said,
he plays

1069
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:45,740
the sheet over his head,

1070
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:50,710
which is where we're wdre
worthy outrage came from to,

1071
01:02:50,711 --> 01:02:53,950
what am I supposed to do with this?
And the counselor meeting with everyone.

1072
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,110
I couldn't help but notice only,

1073
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,220
okay,

1074
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:01,870
white middle aged women were
trashing the guy. They were crying,

1075
01:03:01,871 --> 01:03:02,704
et cetera.

1076
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,950
Okay.

1077
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,130
Not One minority in that
room said they were affected.

1078
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:12,430
It pissed me off because it was almost
insulting to minorities watching this.

1079
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:13,903
What if,

1080
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:14,520
yeah,

1081
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,210
there was actually a minority who was
actually racially discriminate against and

1082
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,340
went to court and wasn't listened to too.

1083
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,020
I don't know what you're
talking about right now.

1084
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,440
I'm 90% sure these women
were just looking for money.

1085
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,320
It's not like our boss tried
to hide or make excuses,

1086
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:32,560
so the white women got offended.
What else?

1087
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:36,640
This is like a fucking beat sheet
for a script that isn't written yet.

1088
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,780
What white middle aged
women were trashing the guy,

1089
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,950
they were crying,
et cetera.

1090
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,430
That fucking sentence ended.

1091
01:03:52,431 --> 01:03:55,130
Then he began a new paragraph with that
and then start to talking about the

1092
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,440
minority women there. I don't, I don't
know what you're talking about here, sir.

1093
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:03,090
Okay, so, okay, so you're
asking me what, okay,

1094
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:07,860
what am I opinions you think these women
are just looking for an opportunity to

1095
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:10,170
sue sue,
s e w

1096
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:17,050
so for money or do you think they actually
believe these ladies were offended?

1097
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:21,070
Thanks bill. I don't know what you're
talking about here sir. I have no idea.

1098
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:22,720
I have no idea.

1099
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,350
I mean I'm I making fun of white women
for acting like they were offended and

1100
01:04:26,351 --> 01:04:30,090
crying
cause you think I have no idea.

1101
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,020
I don't know what Sir proofread. Okay. I'm
not a good speller either, but you know,

1102
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,800
I do know where the spell check is and
I hit the button and it erases all my

1103
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:43,050
impurities. Alright. My fiance
is an into fucking other men.

1104
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,990
Okay. He says, I feel are, she said,
I don't know what the fuck this is,

1105
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,280
what gender this is.
He said,

1106
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:53,970
I feel like this is a slightly different
yet amusing take on relationship issues

1107
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:58,380
and we'd love to hear your tackle. You
tackle this in a podcast. Basically.

1108
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:00,750
I really like watching my girl.
Fuck other men.

1109
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,760
It's not a cuckold thing because I'll
fucker right after and it's always the

1110
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:10,370
best sex we ever had.
Right after

1111
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:17,890
you don't have her shower first sir.
Right after. Okay, thank you know,

1112
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:20,470
I don't judge. Whatever you want to
do, if that's what you guys are in.

1113
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,480
My issue is that our sex is already great
and I'm well above average in size and

1114
01:05:25,481 --> 01:05:26,171
stamina.

1115
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:30,760
So it's hard for her to find another
guy she's actually interested in,

1116
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,500
oh Jesus Christ.

1117
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:33,550
Okay.

1118
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,340
Jesus Christ,
you started all the way to the left.

1119
01:05:36,341 --> 01:05:41,200
Now we're all the way to the
right. Oh Wow. Yeah. This
guy, this fucking guy here.

1120
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,050
You know, I don't mind. I don't
mind her fucking other guys.

1121
01:05:44,051 --> 01:05:47,020
I can handle it cause at the
end of the day, my GIC show big.

1122
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:51,520
Nobody can follow me. Um, okay,

1123
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,620
now I'm judging the guy.

1124
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,680
I don't know why I'm doing this
is just all over the fucking map.

1125
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,890
I don't push the issue because
I'm confident in my abilities.

1126
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:01,180
Evidently so confident.

1127
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:05,290
You've got to fucking write an email
about it and don't want her to have a bad

1128
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:09,280
time simply for my pleasure. But I wanted
to know your opinion on the subject.

1129
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,120
We have threesomes with other women.

1130
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,450
God bless you and I
can't even get into them,

1131
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,900
so I can't judge her.
I love her and are amazing.

1132
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:23,410
Sex has been a driving factor
after almost four years. Yet.

1133
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:27,850
There's something about fucking her after
she's been with another man that is so

1134
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:28,684
hot to me,

1135
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:33,750
I can't act accurately explain it and
she just doesn't seem into it because as

1136
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:37,090
she puts it,
I do it better.

1137
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:42,560
This is one of the greatest email. I hope
he, if even if you just made this up,

1138
01:06:42,561 --> 01:06:45,890
I would really appreciate your opinion
on this weird kind of relationship where

1139
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:50,690
the issue for me is that I can't get off
because the girl as incredible as she

1140
01:06:50,691 --> 01:06:51,830
is,
is too perfect.

1141
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:52,780
Okay.

1142
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,613
What,

1143
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,600
where the issue for me is that
I can't get off because the girl

1144
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,170
as incredible as she is,
is too perfect.

1145
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:05,460
Okay.

1146
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:10,290
So the way her to make her not perfect as
to have you watch her fuck another guy.

1147
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,063
Okay.

1148
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:18,610
She got a giant Dick and you enjoy it
and you kind of like want to show like

1149
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:25,400
that is the only way I can look at it.
This is like,

1150
01:07:25,401 --> 01:07:28,880
you're like the head like
the best comedian in the
fucking country. All right?

1151
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:33,560
But there's still some level of insecurity
you have that you have to go on on

1152
01:07:33,561 --> 01:07:34,190
these,
these,

1153
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:38,420
these shows where the comics aren't at
your level and you have to go on last and

1154
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:42,710
you have to fucking kill harder and kill
longer than anybody else to prove that

1155
01:07:42,711 --> 01:07:45,650
you are the best comedian in the
fucking country, if not the world,

1156
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:47,690
if not the fucking universe.
Right?

1157
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:48,710
Yeah.

1158
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:49,820
Is that what it is?

1159
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:50,620
Okay.

1160
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:54,100
Is it the fact that you know, that you
fucking nail it or better than these,

1161
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:55,450
these other fucking guys,

1162
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:59,800
they come out with their average decks
and their little fucking dicks and she's

1163
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:01,000
bored shitless.

1164
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:01,960
Okay.

1165
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,440
Do you make the other people watch?
You know what I mean? Like, yeah,

1166
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:07,010
helping out their golf swing.

1167
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:08,910
Okay.

1168
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:10,510
It, Oh, you keep lifting your head.

1169
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:15,440
You've got to fucking keep your head down
as you follow through. Do, I don't know.

1170
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,870
I don't have the problems. You have surf.
All right. I am very followup. Will,

1171
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:26,850
um, I have no idea. Um,

1172
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,520
I, I do what I, I have
no idea that is like,

1173
01:08:30,521 --> 01:08:35,521
I would send that into a can
you please go on Doctor Phil?

1174
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:41,640
Cause I just want to watch him and see
what goes on in his eyes when he listens

1175
01:08:41,641 --> 01:08:43,800
to this story where he just goes like,
so

1176
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,920
you need to have another man have sex
with your woman where the penile device

1177
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:55,730
that is smaller than yours
in order for you to get off.

1178
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:57,140
Glad Swerte you're saying,

1179
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,000
okay. And you know, Doctor Phil's got
some giant x Cop Dick, right? You know,

1180
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:05,850
he's got some fucking huge Hogan.
That's what you do.

1181
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:10,080
That's the end of the episode is you go
in the back and you watch doctor Phil.

1182
01:09:10,081 --> 01:09:11,070
Fuck your wife

1183
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,630
with the sweat pouring off his fucking
head and you're just sitting there

1184
01:09:18,631 --> 01:09:23,470
relaxed and confident. Right? You be
funny. Probably by winning get naked.

1185
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:26,560
He just dropped his pants down.
He'd still have his fucking wing tips on.

1186
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,730
MMM. You know what he do to try to beat
you? A, B and inner ear and the fucking,

1187
01:09:32,731 --> 01:09:35,460

how much fucking money he's worth.

1188
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:38,020
He want to go to opens
tonight, honey. One good.

1189
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:42,710
Do you want to go to old tonight?
I can make it happen

1190
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,790

is a fucked up podcasts, but I didn't,

1191
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,140
I didn't, I wasn't the one that
took it into that area. All right.

1192
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:56,010
Other people did a, that was really
weird. That was a really weird visual.

1193
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,740
The whole thing was weird. And
who knew? Who the fuck knew?

1194
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,970
Who the fuck knew that this podcast
would start as innocently as it did?

1195
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:08,150
Talking about Hitler getting his make a
wish and what ends so fucked up with a,

1196
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:13,760
whenever the fuck it is. I was just
describing. All right, that's the podcast.
