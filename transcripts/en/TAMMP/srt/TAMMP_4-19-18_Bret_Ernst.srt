That's a in route my
CIOs. Yeah. Wow. May 2nd.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,830
Yeah, it was pretty cool, man.
Uh, yeah, the, the guys, uh,

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,420
I actually had him on the podcast, uh,
yesterday, uh, that executive produced,

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,340
um, hot tub time machine.
They did a Harold and Kumar,
and they're doing this too,

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,650
and they're doing this. Do you know
what's going to be quality? Yeah,

18
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:04,750
it's pretty cool man. And, and uh, uh,

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,570
basically it just picks
up with Johnny and, uh,

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,610
and Daniel when they're 15.
And if the FTC had Daniel Daniel runs a,

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,870
a car dealership in the valley and
Johnny's just down on his luck.

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,260
I'm fucking in now. Do they have the, uh,

23
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:26,190
what was the name of the actor who
played the Billy's app? William's ATPCO.

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,440
Is he in it? Yeah, he's in it. Fuck

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,700
yeah. Johnny's in it. And uh, it's,
it's pretty cool cause it's, uh,

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,751
they're given the,

27
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:37,550
they're screening the first two episodes
and theaters like across the country,

28
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:42,230
but like select theaters. But,
um, it just, it got into Tribeca,

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,880
which a Tuesday this

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,480
thing, you know, sometimes when they
reboot something, I'm just like, why? Um,

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,350
I'll just pay that. That's kind of weird.
I thought they kind of completed it. Um,

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:53,770
and you know,

33
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,720
there's some instances
where they literally have to
bring characters back from

34
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:00,560
the dead. Yeah. But we don't
have any CGI Miyagi in the, yeah,

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,711
but this one here,

36
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:08,200
what I like is they're not like hiding
the f the time that went by and that,

37
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:12,700
okay. Picks them up. They're in their 50s.
And I think that's a really, uh, you know,

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,700
interesting thing just as far as being
finally in a writer's room after all

39
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,850
these years on a show that I do is,

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,900
is just getting to write to that and
you get to fill in all of this cool like

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,380
backs

42
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,110
story. What happened if you
learn more about Johnny?

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Like nobody ever really touched on,
you know,

44
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:32,240
cause people forget he was still a kid
in high school, you know what I mean?

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,890
But now, um, you learn a little bit
more about him, you know, and then, uh,

46
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,760
I play,
actually,

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,570
I don't want you to give
anything away, but he was, he
was a kid of divorce, right?

48
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,580
Yeah. His Dad wasn't around that, which
was perfect because that eliminated,

49
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,414
why wouldn't your dad,

50
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,520
she had a fight. They got rid of that
all. I mean, he had this, uh, what, 16,

51
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:57,130
17 year old kid with this, you
know, horrible Sensei and all that.

52
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,390
That was so impressionable on
them. But, um, it's pretty cool.

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,430
I'm talking to,
I don't know the character's name.

54
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,000
I thought you were talking about
the crime after you taught.

55
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,580
Ralph Machio is not named Johnny.
Johnny. Johnny. Johnny is a bed. Well,

56
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,210
I mean it's pretty,
I think a decorative,

57
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,670
I guess at that time where
I was a latch key kid.

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,150
Everybody had single moms and yeah.
Well Daniel's both your Penn.

59
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:23,500
Both my parents worked. So
we all had, we all had keys.

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,740
And I remember it had all the names of
the kids right by the door and we would

61
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,020
all grab our keys and then,
yeah,

62
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:33,610
you'd come home and whoever was the
oldest was running shit. Yeah. And uh,

63
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,421
could tell,
you know,

64
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:38,230
just had total fucking authority
could tell you to go to bed.

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,510
Like my older brother would tell
me to go to bed and I had to do it.

66
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:44,850
And if I did, he'd beat the shit out
of me. Yeah. The, you're like, dude,

67
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,320
you're only a year older than me.
Two years older than me.

68
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,010
But I started fighting back. So then
what he understood was like, all right,

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,540
I'll keep him under my wing.

70
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,150
And now I got a four year of
buffer between the next kid.

71
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,640
And then that's when his power
was solidified and I sold out.

72
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,180
I sold out all my younger siblings just
so I could stay up and watch fucking

73
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:04,810
deputy dog. Now. I was
the middle man, but, um,

74
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,590
my older brother had all the authority.
You and I would come home and you know,

75
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:13,090
he was like the man of the House at 1208,
nine 10.

76
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,130
I was a c sky was four years old.

77
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,600
Oh eight was a three or five. Five. Yeah.

78
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,213
So,
you know,

79
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,420
that lasts a pretty much most
of my taught you about power.

80
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:29,110
How quickly can become corrupt somebody,
how most people can't handle it. I said,

81
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:31,930
I'm really fascinated about the, so
Johnny is the Cobra Kai guy. I'm sorry,

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,320
but you're both, you're
right on both ends. Um,

83
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,070
I do think Johnny's father wasn't
around either, but Daniel, yeah,

84
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,030
Daniel had to learn from the
fucking maintenance because

85
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,150
he's got no father who better
than the guy that fixes the sink.

86
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,680
I think this is a, that's a
really brilliant way to go. And,

87
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:03,340
uh, I, I this, this seems like
a cool youtube thing cause I,

88
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:08,020
I feel if this was on a more major
network, they will be like, yeah,

89
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:10,780
but who are we gonna root for
and Blah, blah, blah. Like let's,

90
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:14,710
let's stab at based around the Ralph
Machio character. Well apparently,

91
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:18,130
I mean the, there was a lot of, you
know, there was a lot of offers for this.

92
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,680
I think, you know, the,
the Netflix of the world,

93
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:25,000
maybe even including Netflix that they
kind of bid on it and youtube red got got,

94
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,950
you know, they got the nod. So, uh,
Jesus, they, well they were telling us,

95
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,250
because I was asking them yesterday on
the podcast, the producers, I'm like,

96
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:33,461
you know,

97
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:36,220
through the process and everything and
they said they went into youtube red and

98
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:39,790
just figured, all right, this would be
like the practice pitch. And, but as,

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,610
as you know,

100
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,800
as they sat on it some more and saw the
interest in what they were going to be

101
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,100
able to do and it just became
more appealing and they went with,

102
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,820
I'm a big believer in that. I'm a
big believer in not taking the money.

103
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:55,330
If somebody else will give you more yeah.
What you want to do.

104
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,980
Cause then he goes down swinging
with what you want to do. And I,

105
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,610
I also, you'll get, you'll get
more control. You get more of a,

106
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,000
I saw this great thing one time,
uh,

107
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,020
this heavy metal band that
never made it and it just,

108
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,490
I forget what the name
of the documentary was,

109
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,070
but it just took them through
their whole career and uh,

110
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,200
how they just stayed together and
stayed together and stayed with that.

111
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,720
And Phil Hill just kind
of knows everything. He's
like Google. Oh, thank you.

112
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,850
Aaron and Aaron in the corner.
Um, Advil and this guy,

113
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,480
he just set this thing. He said
at the end of the day, he goes,

114
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:31,481
you'll better to own 100% of something
and sell 20,000 copies then to own

115
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:34,190
nothing and sell 20 million.

116
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,170
Like that's how bad you get fucked with
like all of the expenses and all of that

117
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:39,651
type of shit.

118
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:43,130
That was my thought process and giving a
special away for free is that, you know,

119
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:47,480
I put my own money into it and you know,
it wasn't cheap. I mean for me at least,

120
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,710
you know, as a comic, you know,
you're always check the check. So, um,

121
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,660
it basically like, I think
my next special, I'll try
and shop it, but excuse me.

122
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,560
Well, don't ever give up
ownership. No. Well, I, well the,

123
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,380
the thing for me was that this was
kind of a personal thing for me.

124
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:08,030
Like it's kind of like a one man show
in a standup format, but I only had one.

125
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,600
I only had enough money for one take.
I did it in a colony fitter in Burbank,

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,730
but the concept was basically I want to
own it because I found that dare you.

127
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,920
Well, all my other, that's
how, how dare you, well, the,
the thing that, that kind of,

128
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,220
there should be worried about exposure.
You're going to pay you an exposure.

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,120
Well the thing is too is that like all
this stuff that I did before on comedy

130
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,150
central show, I didn't own any of
it. I wasn't even able to share it,

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,860
you know what I mean?
On Facebook.

132
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,280
So I released it for free@brettcomedy.com
and you could go there and,

133
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,760
but the thing is you could just watch it.
You don't have to,

134
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,750
I mean you can give me your email if you
want. If you want to donate or I mean,

135
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,300
or own it,
download it for $5 or buy a tee shirt.

136
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:53,150
You get to download if you want to,
but you don't have to do anything.

137
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,820
I just want you to watch it.
And if you like it, you like it.

138
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,730
If you don't put your head on the desk,
you know what I mean?

139
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,630
We'll move on. It's fun. It's fucking
free. I remember early on I had a, uh,

140
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,840
I made a CD. I just stand up CD, that's
how long I've been like, you know,

141
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,250
way back in the day. And uh, I,
you know, put all my money up,

142
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,050
paid to have a recorded,
edited the thing,

143
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:19,490
the thing was done and then these
big guys came around and uh,

144
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,170
they were going to get it into stores.

145
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,300
This is 2006 right before every virgin
closed. And I was such an old school guy.

146
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:29,640
I was like, I want my CD and r
records store, you know, and,

147
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,370
and with the power of these guys feel get
me under the display towards the front

148
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,440
of the store. Right. And uh,

149
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,100
but I knew enough that I wanted to
retain ownership and they just kept,

150
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:44,630
they kept trying to get to own it and
it was like, I don't need you to own it.

151
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,720
It's done. I don't need any
money on this thing. I just,

152
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,200
I just need you to distribute it. And
this guy goes to me, he goes, well,

153
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,260
ownership shouldn't be that
big a deal to you, which it,

154
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:59,240
it cause what you should be concerned
about is exposure. So I said to him,

155
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,350
I go, all right, fair enough.

156
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:03,290
But if ownership shouldn't be
that much of a big deal for me,

157
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,470
why is it such a big deal for you? And
my manager was in the room and he goes,

158
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:11,471
great fucking question and this
guy stammered for about 15 seconds.

159
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:13,850
And then basically said, well, you know,

160
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,510
we got in business with these other comics
to make cds and their CDs bombed and

161
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,160
we have to make up the
money. It's just like, well,

162
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,480
it's not my fault that you got into
business with those fucking guys.

163
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,480
And the greatest thing I ever
did was retained ownership.

164
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:29,000
I ended up getting in business with
somebody else and that was like, you know,

165
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,650
hey, you get 60% we get 40% I'm like,
hey, that sounds like a good deal.

166
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:37,010
And then all the expenses come
out of my end. Yeah. And they get,

167
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,270
they get 40 off the gross.

168
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,880
I got 60 off the net and they end
up making more money than I did.

169
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,760
And to this day they tried to tell me that
that was a good deal. It's like, dude,

170
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:45,350
this thing came.
It's like we,

171
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,700
you always think like we're getting in
business together to make money off them.

172
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:53,060
And that's not how they do it. Of
course, like we're getting an, yeah,

173
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,320
they're going to fuck the people and
you and all the one he's going to go to

174
00:09:57,321 --> 00:09:57,561
them.

175
00:09:57,561 --> 00:10:00,860
My favorite thing is I get in business
with somebody else and all the money goes

176
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:04,880
to them and then when I get my cut their
names on my check and it's just like,

177
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,180
so how the fuck do I know what came in?
And then if you audit them,

178
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,710
then you get labeled as difficult to work.
It's like difficult to work with,

179
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:16,250
a difficult to steal from. And that like
I hadn't done one of these deals I had,

180
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,300
it was like,
um,

181
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,840
it's one of the DVD companies if I was
to audit them and they were off less than

182
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:27,590
like 8% than I had to pay for the audit.
And it's like what?

183
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:31,880
You just gave them a license to
steal seven and a half percent. Yeah.

184
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,500
And it's just like I'm telling you

185
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,630
the number one commandment of the 10
commandments that's fucking, uh, that's,

186
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:42,440
that's, uh, broken. May I've, maybe it's
line, but what I've seen is stealing,

187
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,160
like all of these fucking idiots who
are out there who are stealing on the

188
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:49,040
illegal side of stealing,
selling drugs. I mean,

189
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,820
anybody who's in the mob who
was smart eventually went legit.

190
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,160
So you could steal on the legal side.

191
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,790
Then you didn't have to hide your fucking
money and you could drive down the

192
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,230
street and you're fucking Bentley.

193
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,930
Well, I've never look, I
love our business. I love
the people in our business,

194
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,800
you know, but there's a good amount
of them that are just fucking garbage.

195
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,680
And I don't even know if the
garbage is just the weight, the,

196
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,860
it's like the way it was set up. Well,
when you first way it was set up,

197
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,530
you fit just clay in the game.
Like when you first come in,

198
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,090
this is why I love this era
of comedy and where we're at,

199
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:24,990
especially with the digital and the
Internet and stuff. Like, I always say,

200
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:28,650
I only need 1% of American a like
me and I'm good. That's it. Yeah.

201
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,180
That's then you know, even if, uh, even
if I can say a joke on stage, you know,

202
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,760
in a room full of fucking
adults and somebody's like, oh,

203
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,370
I don't fucking, somebody just
sent, somebody just sent me this,

204
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,900
this fucking article.
Somebody just sent me,

205
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,100
sorry article like this, I can't eat,
I can't even fucking read this. Uh,

206
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,980
but there are some scumbags,

207
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,340
every guy checks himself a little New
York comedy clubs adjust to me too.

208
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,900
And it's just like,
this is just like such like a,

209
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:04,470
you didn't even stick your head in the
comedy clubs, I'm seeing the opposite.

210
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:04,950
Yeah.

211
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,480
This like this backlash and there's
this time now to be more irreverent than

212
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:14,130
ever because you know, not all
feminists a bad, but these extreme ones,

213
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:17,610
like what they're doing now with these
articles is like the way we left Vietnam

214
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,910
where we go, hey, we won and they're
leaving. That's what this saying. Like,

215
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,760
I'm finding myself,
I'm saying shit on stage now.

216
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,020
I never would have gone that far. But
it's just like, cause you have to,

217
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,260
I mean we're all co you would have to
agree that we're contrarians by nature.

218
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,710
Yeah. Which would be funny
if you disagree, but I'm just
saying no, no, no, I don't.

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,890
He totally loved it over and
I missed it. No. Um, uh, but,

220
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,290
uh, even some of the women
are going the other way too.

221
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,770
Like I've been noticing a lot of comp,
a female comics doing jokes, you know,

222
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:51,640
where they wished, you know,
like in other words, now they're,

223
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:55,030
now they're not getting any action,
you know, and, and, but it's just

224
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,910
becomes inevitable where it just one
thing just gets it get, becomes exhausted.

225
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,320
Like it's all been said, we get
it. And then it's just like,

226
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:06,690
how many times can you keep
reiterating the same point?

227
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,170
I really believe that if con comics,
you know,

228
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,940
we're such a great think tank because
we really don't, I mean good comics,

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,910
you know, uh, cause you could sit around
and you have no real skin in the game.

230
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,620
It's more about the joke or the
perspective or, you know what I mean?

231
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:22,454
Anytime anybody

232
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,330
tries to fucking do that thing
where they go like, uh, you know,

233
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:28,880
like where they try to put
too much weight on a joke.

234
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,270
I always just gotten out to, no, it's
this, this is what I always say to them.

235
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,210
Like if they sit there like what you're
saying does influence people, blah, blah.

236
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:39,620
I just say to them, I say,
look, are you homophobic? And
they of course say, no. I go,

237
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:43,580
okay.
And during a 60 minute set that I do,

238
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:46,430
what Joe could I tell that
would then make you homophobic?

239
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,660
How could I undo everything that you
were taught in 60 what, how many,

240
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:54,770
how many of those jokes where I
have to do so my point of that is,

241
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,420
is is people come in, I'm so sick of
talking about this too. People come in,

242
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,360
okay, they're, they're, they're adults.

243
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,270
Their brains are fully formed and they
have their ideas and you amount of times

244
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:10,271
I say shit and it's just like people
take it a completely different way is one

245
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:14,090
of the cool things about like somebody
listening to the music comedy or anything.

246
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:16,760
It's, it goes into your brain and your
experience and how you interpret it.

247
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:20,030
But like it's not my
responsibility to babysit you.

248
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,540
And if you take it in some really bad
fucking way, you walked in with that shit.

249
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,990
Cause if I had the power to undo your
26 years of experience with a couple of

250
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:32,120
fucking jokes than standup,
comedy would not be legal.

251
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,630
They wouldn't let a fucking
moron like me go on stage.

252
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,740
Hey, I haven't read about shit.
You know what I think about Syria?

253
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,680
I mean I always not disarm myself,
but I always, I am a jerk off.

254
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:48,760
I know I'm a jerk off. I'm not, I'm not
like, you know what I mean? Like I don't,

255
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,950
I don't take myself seriously. I have
the high school transcript to prove it.

256
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,850
You can always go and get it,
dude. You're, you're, you're,

257
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,800
you're not as dumb as you
say. I was like, yeah, I am. I
am. I, I'm good. You're just,

258
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,330
you're watching the one
thing that I'm good at,

259
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,290
which is basically acting like a
fucking idiot. But if you got me on, uh,

260
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,450
and I could do like a, like
basic jobs, you know what I mean?

261
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:11,230
Like I was a fucking like,
workhorse.

262
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,120
If you told me to go over there and pick
up all those boxes and stick them over

263
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,860
there,
I would fucking crush that.

264
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,580
But if you wanted me to come up with
a machine that could fucking make that

265
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,060
easier to do that, yeah.
I'm out. I'm like, well,

266
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,590
fucking lunch pail Louie.
I'm a moron.

267
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,870
What makes me laugh too is that even
the comics that take themselves so

268
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,260
seriously in a sense is like, dude, like,

269
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,440
you know that the exact game that we were
on as take themselves seriously hacks,

270
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,660
think they're fucking change in the
world because they're too fucking,

271
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,990
we're just realized they stink here.
I realize.

272
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:46,210
So I was on a plane that
we had to emergency land.
Okay. And um, was always fun.

273
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,180
Some do, try to kill another two next
to him started choking him and shit.

274
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,310
Like we were literally five minutes in
the air and, and I'm like, fuck, cause I,

275
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,850
I was going to miss my gig that night,
you know, that's all I care about. Oh,

276
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:03,110
we not crashing now I will. Why are
we going? I gotta I gotta make my Gig.

277
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:05,450
You know, he tried to kill the
gun and he starts choking to dude.

278
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,800
So a then the guy who had proceeded
it was all way in the back.

279
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,840
I think the guy just flipped on him.
It was like some dude that wasn't,

280
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,450
I'm going to go with the armrest.
There's an armrest fight guy.

281
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,520
So, uh, anyways, long story boring. The
guys obviously playing it up now that he,

282
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:26,960
you know, so they start now else in the
back, don't know what's going on. Okay.

283
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,710
So the, the stewardess
runs back. So we do,

284
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,780
is there anybody here in the
medical profession, you know, in,

285
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,640
in the medical field,
a couple people get up.

286
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,860
I see a guy that was a cop get up, a guy
who was a fireman. She should've said it.

287
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:42,670
Attention everyone. There's nothing wrong
with the plane. Well, they made that day.

288
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,320
Say they came back, it came back to us. I
mean, this is after they were asking for,

289
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:47,450
for everybody.
That would have been the back.

290
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:49,300
How the fuck is a cop
going to fly the plane?

291
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,350
But the point being is that they said
all these people started getting up,

292
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,670
and that's when you realize that your
job is just so fucking useless. Oh yeah.

293
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,590
It's like I, in any I, I'm not
even, I just need to watch and may,

294
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,910
you know, unless they're like, hey,

295
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:08,180
can you come up and do five minutes
to cheer everybody other than that,

296
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,010
what the fuck? All these people have a
real purpose. And I'm not saying we don't,

297
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,480
but you know, if you're doing the Maslow's
hierarchy thing, comics are not like,

298
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:20,990
we're like junk food. Absolutely. You
know what I mean? Is this a comfort food?

299
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,910
Kind of fuck it. That's what we are.
We're Mcdonald's not nutrition. Yeah. So,

300
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,980
well, I would say you're
going to be hungry again for
knowledge 10 minutes after

301
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:34,190
watching my act. Yeah. Like, if
you're, if you're learning from me,

302
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:38,450
that's there's some off. It's sad.
And if anybody ever said that to me,

303
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:42,710
I'd be like, oh no, no, sorry to pointed
towards the library or something.

304
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:45,230
Like all these comics
think they're Carlin, but,

305
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,450
and I don't think there's a lot of that
though. There's a lot of political,

306
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,010
I was going to say,
especially in like the

307
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,400
open mics where,
and even not,

308
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,020
there's a couple of younger comics that
were talking to me that they coined a

309
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:59,340
term called clap there. What is that like?
These college has all, they don't laugh.

310
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,790
Well, they just, Larry just makeup, make
a statement and everybody's like, yeah,

311
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,090
you know,
like I used to call that was the Oprah.

312
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,180
You do need to get a job. Just
started. Fucking clapped her.

313
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,880
Well, I think, uh, you know, if, if
you're online all the time and like,

314
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:21,930
you just get stuck into that
fucking swirl, a rabbit hole of,

315
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,200
of that shit where it's
just like, uh, you know,

316
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:29,040
when people just start posting these,
this information that you need to know,

317
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,860
it's like, where did you get this?
Who the fuck are you? And uh, uh,

318
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,260
there's a couple, two words I hate the
most on the as curating and algorithm.

319
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,520
If I see that anywhere, I just fucking,
I just, cause I gotta be honest with you,

320
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,030
like even like I, as much as I love
Netflix and everything like that,

321
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:48,120
it's like you watch one season of Narcos,

322
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,340
your whole fucking thing is just now
going to be all drudge or dealers behind

323
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:57,300
many scenes of prisons in San
Quentin. The real, the real fucking,

324
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,460
it's just like, you know, you
almost get offended. Like,

325
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:04,410
you know this more to me than just that.
So I actually looked at it, but like,

326
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,330
um, when my, when I did my last special,

327
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:09,570
when I went in there and they showed
me how the algorithm worked, I mean,

328
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:13,020
I was fucking blown away, but like,
so maybe it isn't their fault.

329
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:16,560
Maybe I'm such a fucking moron that I
watched too many. They're just like,

330
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:19,470
we give up on this guy, let's just,
well, I'll share one with my wife.

331
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,290
And she's always like,
oh, I watched Carter

332
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,830
serious. She's like, what? He fucking 12.

333
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,990
You know, I would love them
to bring back as Johnny quest.

334
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,550
Johnny quest was all right. I wasn't,
yeah, I gotta be honest with you, man.

335
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:35,880
It wasn't a big fan of that.
You know what I loved about Johnny Quest?

336
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:40,410
If you fell off a cliff, you'd died.
And that blew my mind. He got shot.

337
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,130
You fucking died. Like people were
dying. You were used to bugs bunny where,

338
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:47,880
but just came back. Yeah. Wiley
Coyote turn into a fucking accordion,

339
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,910
gave you a look like, well that didn't
work and then it comes back totally fine.

340
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,930
It should have been in a
fucking wheelchair. Um, let's
get back to, let's get a,

341
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:58,850
by the way, I saw a meme talking about
the Facebook shit real quick. Um,

342
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,850
I was dying laughing. It was a
general and it says, uh, well, we,

343
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,680
we bombed Syria. Let me go into
Facebook and see what the experts

344
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,920
need to know what our next move is.

345
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,420
I go to Facebook and find out
what all the experts say. Yeah.

346
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,680
I'd be honest with you. I don't understand
that whole part of the world. I,

347
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,330
the people that were
fighting and all that.

348
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,010
But I also know that I
haven't read up on it,

349
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,800
but I just look at it like the people
finding don't have a plane or a boat,

350
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,370
I just don't get how they're going
to get us. I know nine 11 happened,

351
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:32,130
but they caught us with their pants down.
So all you have to do is just,

352
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:35,760
what does Israel do? Israeli hasn't had
a hijacker unit of a plane and like,

353
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:39,180
I don't know how many years in the front
and then when they watch the planes all

354
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,720
night so it's not even a fucking option
and they're sitting right in the middle

355
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:46,920
of that Hornet's nest over there and
they're able to survive it. So, uh,

356
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,830
I dunno, I might host, I'm just
worried about us financially.

357
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,720
Just I feel like those,

358
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,640
these fucking jerk offs that dragging
us into the deep water here and uh,

359
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,690
you know,
the whole,

360
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,360
there's more than one way to skin a
cat and it's just because, you know,

361
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,430
realistically,
why would you ever try to fight us?

362
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,760
We could literally blow up the whole
fucking thing with one push of a button if

363
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:10,660
we wanted to. But um, I dunno. Maybe
somebody over there as good at math.

364
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,700
I can and knows it better than I do,

365
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:16,630
but I just sit there like this
debt debt wakes me up at night.

366
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,440
That's why I tried not to. I try
to like, uh, keep all of my shit.

367
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,850
I'm not good with it. So like anytime
I see a store channel that stuff, no,

368
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,170
no, I do. I am a fucking
onestop operation.

369
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,820
I handled the whole fucking thing.

370
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,500
Oh, it's a couple of days later and
now I'm doing the advertising. Oh,

371
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:43,880

mouth. No one cares about your ar 15,

376
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:05,630

uh, uh, if you were to say you had one

410
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,910
of those, uh, the popular
three that comedians have,

411
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,590
the add a check. Oh, CD don't have that.

412
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,030
Um, depression. I had a, I
didn't have the chemical one.

413
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,340
I was just walking around
bummed out for a long time.

414
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:04,970
I didn't realize it cause I was always
like that. Well there's depression,

415
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:07,030
throw intelligence, you know,
like, like in other words,

416
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:11,800
and not saying you're intelligent but
not saying like you,

417
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:17,050
you see all these patterns and you just
see like what the fuck is wrong with

418
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:22,130
people. Like, you know, uh, and it
just gets to you because that used to,

419
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:26,360
but I know how to, I know how to talk my
way out of that. I got, as I got older,

420
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:30,860
I co I just see, oh two we
used to get into it. You and
I was just sports. I mean,

421
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:35,300
and that's what, no sugar,
sports politics. So we get
into a politics solitude.

422
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,670
We would, we would just have
her eyebrows all the way up.

423
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,060
I thought we were on the same page with
that. I think it was mostly sports.

424
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:44,520
I think the one time
we got into it as I do,

425
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I remember I had to like literally tell
myself the next time you and Brett get

426
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,790
going,
you have to be the guy that taps out.

427
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,120
And I started tapping out
and we have, we've been good
ever since. Well I said no,

428
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,770
it never got ugly, but we would, it would
be like Unitus. We both agreed on Johnny.

429
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,280
It was something important.
Like that was,

430
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,410
I think he wanted to kill me at the time
cause I think I said Elway over Brady.

431
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,200
I went, I went Montana La Brady
and you went, what do you know?

432
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:14,490
I don't know problem with that.
No.

433
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,330
At the time he did know I did it because
now I do remember I hit you. Oh No.

434
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:17,661
You know what?

435
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,800
It was some different cause I was
always the guy people going like Brady's

436
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,660
better than Montana. Once he
got four rings, I said, Dude,

437
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,100
Montana needed four tries to get
four rinks. Brady needed six.

438
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,700
And then once he got his
fifth I said, okay, now we got
his faith. But my holistic,

439
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:34,910
my whole list has changed now because
the, the year that they, that, uh,

440
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:39,860
Denver went is when I texted you and
I said this this year Brady, really,

441
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,260
not that it matters that he impressed me,
but I'm like,

442
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:45,650
this year I was really impressed with
what he had to deal with. And you're like,

443
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:49,210
yeah, but it was always over sports. I
mean, the, the politics stuff, I don't,

444
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,130
I think we were on the same page
when a lot of it, if I can recall,

445
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:56,210
there was some huge fucking, Oh, who
cares? Football logging. I can't remember.

446
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,400
All right. I didn't know. I
forgot you played drums too.

447
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,470
You said you do on your podcast.
Like, I mean, I'm, I'm, I
am, I used to have a set,

448
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:08,200
a trap set. I played for years and then,
uh, my grandmother salted, but you know,

449
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,090
every once in a while I'll go into the
guitar center and, and start, you know,

450
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:15,110
playing on the, Oh, you got it. But when
I opened free, get those Fucking v drums.

451
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,950
No, you got again, you get those fucking
things, man. I'm telling you like, uh,

452
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,470
you know, um, and like when I lived
in an apartment in New York, I,

453
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,000
I just put like this, I forget, it was
some sort of foam rubber thing down.

454
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:32,630
And then I built like a little riser on
top of that and then foam rubber on that.

455
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,620
And then I put the kid down or something
like that. And what I want to know, wait,

456
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,260
it had to be solid so that things
would stand out. I don't know.

457
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,320
It was a home run to that,
but I,

458
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,070
and then I went downstairs to the
guy below me and say, hey listen,

459
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,230
I played drums as a hobby

460
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,220
and he's looking at me like
you motherfucker. I said,
no, here's my phone number.

461
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,580
I go, I work at night. You
work during the day? Yeah, go.

462
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:54,850
I'll only play between 11
and two during the day.

463
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,610
If for whatever reason you take a day off,
you have a day off,

464
00:26:57,611 --> 00:27:00,970
call me the second you call me,
pick up the phone, Sam downstairs,

465
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:04,900
I will immediately stop. I mean, how
could you have a problem with that?

466
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,490
And you know what?
This fucking asshole did.

467
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,050
Fucking three months later I'm playing
like two in the afternoon and my phone

468
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:14,900
rings and I go, hello. And he
goes, we can knock it off. Yeah.

469
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,230
The first time I said,
hey buddy, I got you. Fuck

470
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,350
fucking saying that. Like you said
it to me 20 times. Go Fuck Yourself.

471
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,380
And I hung up. I never talked to
him again and he never called again.

472
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:25,950
But I still only played during the day
and I wouldn't play weekends either.

473
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,850
Now if he's watching Conan or something,

474
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:31,420
he's like this tight desta drummer
guy that lived upstairs from me.

475
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,200
He must've switched careers. The thing
cause he sucked it drums. It was terrible.

476
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,930
You said you do on your a,
you're on the list podcast.

477
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:41,050
You do a lot of top 10 stuff. Yeah,
we just list shit. I mean again it's,

478
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:43,960
it's arguing with your friends over
dumb things, which is all right.

479
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:47,230
You got one for me. Well let's start it.
Let's try to get the fires going to get,

480
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,590
we can do fine. We can do top five.
I mean this is more your opinion.

481
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,070
I might show him, you know, it's not so
much me sometimes. Although a, I've, I've,

482
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,570
I've gotten a little hot hot
headed like over dumb shit.

483
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,270
Hockey I keep for over rocky three, you
know, stupid shit. That's important.

484
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,490
It is very important in the
scheme of what matters to you.

485
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:10,840
You're living your truth. You should start
a blog about it. Um, I was gonna say,

486
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:15,160
did you want to discuss who
and who the top athletes,

487
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,690
Boston athletes are of all time?
Like would you take Brady over bird,

488
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,090
do you think he's number one.
Oh,

489
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,170
and then the next one could have been top
top. We don't have to do 10. We can do,

490
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,110
he can't get rid of Larry.
Larry's like in that,

491
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,720
especially now looking back 30 years and
his stuff is still amazing and I know

492
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,570
Brady is going to be amazing
too, obviously, but uh,

493
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,410
and I know he's won two
more than Larry One. Uh,

494
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,110
my thing about Larry was
if I could go back in time,

495
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,260
the second he started to do the blacktop
on the driveway, I'd be like, Larry,

496
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:48,210
let me, let me do that. Let me do that.

497
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,480
There is such like a fucking call
a guy and cheap. Well, the, the,

498
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,410
you remember those when you blacktop or
driving that little fucking brush they'd

499
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:58,560
give you? Yeah. Yeah. That was not
made for a six foot nine, six foot,

500
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:01,290
10 inch guy and he blacktop
his own fucking driveway.

501
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,550
Rather than paying somebody that whole
blue collar, I'll do this myself.

502
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,660
And he fucked up his back. It was
never, it was never the same after that.

503
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,110
I was going to say, uh, uh, or I tell
them if we're doing, if smoke coke,

504
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,630
if we're doing a, if, yeah, if we're,
if we're doing championships, I mean,

505
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,710
then you gotta you gotta
Throw Bill Russell obviously
no bill Russell's the top.

506
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,500
Yeah, it would be bill Russell is
the same and he's got 11. Right.

507
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,180
So a lot of people leave him out.
I put them in my top five and then,

508
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:31,020
then you got Ted Williams and then you've
got Bobby Orr who totally changed the

509
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:35,100
game. Bobby Orr was, Wayne Gretzky
says, that's the Guy Wayne Gretzky goes,

510
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:38,040
that's the guy. So, um, you
know what it is at this point.

511
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:41,740
There's so many people at Boston
now. Well, I just love arrogant. Now

512
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,190
we're off and, and you're, you don't
have to go that far back last. No,

513
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:50,670
you don't have to know and don't.
And uh,

514
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,610
and that was going to say two or why I
would put my top 10 in Boston athletes

515
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:59,650
cause he's my, he's, he would be your don
Mattingly was wade Boggs. I like books.

516
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,880
I used to like, wait. Yeah, no. And I
might throw Andre tip it in there as well.

517
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,430
Andre tip though also there's a, there's
all a lot of great guys that never got,

518
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,110
uh, I mean, I mean Jim Rice, we had to,

519
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:17,550
we had rice, Fred Lynn call your strengths
ski. We just had all straps, keys.

520
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,530
Yeah. All of these great guys that,
uh, you know, and I always hated that.

521
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,310
Um, I always make fun a day. I don't
hate people. I hate dance show and see,

522
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:29,370
I just like breaking his boss.
Um, but like he wrote that book,

523
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,520
the curse of the baby and it was just
such a cop out where you just don't even

524
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:39,270
address, granted, I never read the book,

525
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:43,110
but I just looked at the title and I
judged a book by its cover and, um,

526
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,170
it's just, was such a cop out. It's just,

527
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,730
I thought that we were just
a really bad franchise.

528
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,010
We were a bad franchise and we would
like the flyers with the flyers,

529
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,140
got two one, two cups by beating the fuck
out of the league. And they were like,

530
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,960
that's what works and that's
what the fuck we're going to do.

531
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,340
And now they're finally coming out of it.

532
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,410
But do they had like a 30 40 year
fucking hangover of trying to continue to

533
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:07,840
debate.

534
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,700
The third is more fair that
that trajectory bullies
a doc is fucking amazing.

535
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,660
Incredible. Yeah. But they were so
successful winning back to back.

536
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:16,171
You've got to stand.

537
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:19,560
They will only in the league since
67 and they won that first cup. It's,

538
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,190
they went back to back 74 75 they're
seventh and eighth year in the league.

539
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:28,030
And everybody's like, this is the future.
And that almost destroyed hockey. And um,

540
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,280
they just continued.

541
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:32,280
It was okay during the 80s cause it was
still a lot of that left. But in the 90s,

542
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,730
early eighties,
it was still,

543
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,520
I remember going to Brendan Byrne Arena
and watched the devils and flyers go.

544
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,280
And it, we, we just went just for that.

545
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,330
For the fights. Yeah.
Dude, it was, it was crazy.

546
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,670
The first like nine
Bruins games I went to,

547
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:46,190
I would only go if they
played the Canadians cause
I knew there was going to be

548
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:49,370
a bunch of fights. And there's a
classic one on Youtube where, uh,

549
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,280
there's a bench clearing brawl back
when the benches facing each other,

550
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,130
the old Boston Garden and I,

551
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,070
Chris Island was walking off the ice
and according to him somebody threw

552
00:31:58,071 --> 00:31:59,300
something at him.
I don't know what happened.

553
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:01,970
He pushed Ken Lindeman and
then a little Ken Lindemann,

554
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:05,910
the rat goes down after this heavyweight
Niland and all of a sudden to those

555
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:08,780
like cops involved in that, the bench
is cleared. And I was at that game.

556
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,900
See, the thing was sports to me now and
again, man, I know the athletes are,

557
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,810
you know, better, but the uh,
no, that's, that's what it,

558
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,870
Papi, I got to put pickpocket
again in the 10. Yeah,

559
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,430
he might even be five. That's what
we were arguing. And he turned,

560
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,310
I remember when Ramirez
know that Jerry Rice thing,

561
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:31,710
that he was faster than lightning and
you were like, how the fuck is a facet?

562
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:36,700
And I said, I saw this sports. That's what
it was. And like how the fuck is that?

563
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,710
Yeah, you can't be. But it
was a sports that I saw.

564
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,910
But getting back to the athletes
today are not a scientist thing.

565
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,690
What's more document or you moved your
hands around? It's a sports thing.

566
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,860
Like be like, hey, we're
wizards. No, uh, uh,

567
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,950
but we saw m o w o get back and believe
I and I wasted a good 40 minutes of my,

568
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:01,040
almost a headlining set, which is
technically 45 minutes, 45 minutes.

569
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,940
This argument. Do you though that? I
mean there's a part of me that enjoys it,

570
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,550
especially with people that are,
uh,

571
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,740
I mean not when you get worked
up over stupid shit, but I mean,

572
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:12,800
but that's just inevitable.
Maybe the cause the German in us.

573
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:16,870
Maybe that's what it is. But I do like
that the mental, the mental chatter.

574
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,630
It's like, like the, the point for
point. Because, you know, I don't,

575
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,460
I don't really do, you don't really
get that a lot. That's why exactly.

576
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,580
We're comics like regular civilians.
I hate going. I haven't done it.

577
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:30,230
Have you ever done it? And
you're, and you're in it. Yeah.

578
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:32,720
Having a great time and all of a sudden
you look around at the other people's

579
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:37,070
faces just walking away
or worse laughing at you.

580
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,870
What are they arguing? But comics
get it. I like, I, I don't,

581
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,550
I don't do well with civilians.

582
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,310
That's like when we go out to
dinner with like some random couple,

583
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,560
I'm just so fucking bored,
man.

584
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,890
Care about your kids and oh no,

585
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,250
no conversations on idol the whole night.

586
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,910
You got to act on my kid and the kid
playing soccer, I blah, blah, blah, blah.

587
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,950
That's great. That's wonderful. Yeah.

588
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:05,951
And you try to re thinking about going
to Mexico and all of a sudden they have,

589
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,350
or what do you think of Trump's okay.
Shift policy.

590
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,830
And my wife just starts kicking me and you
know, like, we need something here now.

591
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,000
You can't, yeah, you can't do that.

592
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:17,060
And I started telling you about some
fucking w winery that you can visit and

593
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:19,100
it's good for the kids because
they have a little zoo,

594
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,090
he can feed pigeons and there's
a fucking horrible, I know.

595
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,460
And then the worst and they see
you and just like, I just haven't,

596
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,460
it's on my face. I can't do it. Like
I need to stop doing this to me.

597
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:35,720
But like there was this time,

598
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:40,721
every time we would go to a fucking
party afterwards on the drive home,

599
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,190
I would get like this whole breakdown.

600
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,190
Well I guess I do actually I'm a bit
where I talked about the report card. Oh,

601
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:49,460
is that what I needed to
tell you that before we get
into it? Oh yeah, no, no, no,

602
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:51,350
no, no, no, no. They all do it.

603
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:54,520
You get this fucking report and you think
he had to go, what is your report? Yeah,

604
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:58,100
I know I had a good game,
but, and then they're like,

605
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:01,070
you think and then they break out this
fucking report card and you're like,

606
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:04,300
what the fuck can you think documented?
Here's the thing,

607
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,990
can you fucking imagine the hell
fire if you ever did it to them?

608
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,940
You can't. You can't. You can't. It's so
funny. My, my wife tells me what to wear.

609
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:15,720
Sometimes. You look, why
are you always dressed?

610
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,870
She always tells me that you're
dressed like a bouncer. Cause I just

611
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,370
know it's the thing about women,

612
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:26,380
they will step up your fucking wardrobe
as I'm dressed like a complete book was

613
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,270
I was going to wear my Adidas tracksuit
and I said, if I come in with this,

614
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:33,520
he's going to fucking murder me. No,
no, no. You're and your record with, no,

615
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,630
I'm wearing this because I'm doing one
of those all things, comedy, poker thing.

616
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,150
So I'm like a fucking, I was
born, but I had an Adidas one day.

617
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,190
No. Um, but you know,
it was funny. We were,

618
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:48,470
I Sebastian's a party,
remember, uh, for the,

619
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,470
for the baby. And uh, you were
fucking hammered and, and we were,

620
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:55,110
we were hanging out in town, you know,
I was 22. I went to go take a picture.

621
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,750
I was by his pool and
somebody backed into my hand,

622
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,410
like barely touched my hand and I dropped
a full whiskey into his fucking pool.

623
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,580
I was so empowered. It's a bad school
now, dude. It's fine. It's fine.

624
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,150
Was I had hammered? No, it wasn't. No,
I always, I'm seeing that a good way.

625
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,430
Cause we were all, we were all
drinking and it wasn't a lot of drink.

626
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,440
I was watching our wives and they just
look at us from a distance and my wife's

627
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:22,620
nervous. I can tell when we were
having a great time, I like, dude,

628
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,040
we're going to run a fucking
yacht in the Mediterranean. We go,

629
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:30,240
all of us that we made, we made the
plan guys, it'd be 300 bucks a piece.

630
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:33,760
We have an a great tire. We'll get the
fucking NFL network. We'll film it. Yeah.

631
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,940
And I'm just like, you're
special. You are like, yeah,

632
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:40,170
we were having a great time and I'm
watching my wise and they're just nervous.

633
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:42,480
They're just watching going,
what the fuck is going to happen?

634
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,040
I really don't think women
get our relationships. Uh,
like I, I find that men, we,

635
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,350
I mean, at least me and my friends, we
bond through conflict in a sense. Like,

636
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,510
like if I know you're an eagles fan
and you know, I'm a cowboys fan,

637
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm expecting you to go on
your soup, you know, uh, uh,

638
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,510
it's weird to say like watching
them argue on real housewives. Well,

639
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,060
they loved the drug when we act like real
housewives over sports for some reason

640
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:10,590
that this is the thing they, uh, I've,
I've been really, uh, I've been trying,

641
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,563
uh,

642
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,290
I guess the most accurate way to describe
this as I've really been trying not to

643
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,690
be me in my relationship.

644
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,790
It's so fucking hard as I like, I'm
starting to feel like that is the problem.

645
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,480
Like, no, we get along
great, but when there's,

646
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,100
when there's work to be done in the
relationship, it's, it's always now,

647
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:36,560
Bill, you're this, this and this. And
like one time I was hanging out with this,

648
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,460
this, uh, we were treading on hard hit.
What trend? We got to be careful at this,

649
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,900
at this party. And I don't give a shit,
but like my wife's cool. She'll fucking,

650
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,510
she doesn't listen to me anyways. She
has, I forget what the other way might.

651
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,690
My wife hasn't been to a stand up
show of mine like three fucking,

652
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:54,900
she doesn't need her. She lives with me.
Shit. My wife is sick of it. Yeah. I mean,

653
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:59,740
and it's not conducive for what? Like,
you know, it is for like, you know, that,

654
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,320
can you imagine having to watch your wife
talk for an hour? Can you imagine two?

655
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,660
Why would you do that? Why would you do
that? That the person is same thing, ah,

656
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,760
over it. Why would you put
them through that? I have,

657
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,440
I have total fucking empathy for
my work when it comes to that shit.

658
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,720
It's just knows. So what other
stuff? That's why I do the dishes.

659
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,450
What I also found that I got to get
something in the good and the good side of

660
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:23,160
the ledger. On the scorecard.
Yeah. Something. I, I,

661
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:27,030
uh, I, um, I've found that
my wife, uh, you know, when,

662
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,690
when the one thing I've found attractive
about her is that she was not laughing

663
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:35,660
at some of the Shit I was saying. And
I'm like, okay, this girl's, yeah,

664
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,210
like in my Robin Shit when I was
younger and stuff and you know,

665
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,590
cause I was kind of a bad kid and a bad
early adult and you know, and she's like,

666
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:49,120
you know, I, I don't find that, you know,
I mean, I get why people think it's funny,

667
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,830
but, and I'm just like, all right,

668
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:54,510
this is a normal person because
I grew up in so much dysfunction.

669
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,170
You have morals, it's this,
this, this is new. I said,

670
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,190
I grew up in so much dysfunction that I
didn't realize I grew up in dysfunction.

671
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:06,730
Like you think your shit's normal
until you meet normal people and then,

672
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:10,890
and then you're like, you
know, like, oh, you know, you
have a dad saying to you, you,

673
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:15,190
you meet dialed down people. Yeah. They're
not normal because eventually you just,

674
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:18,070
you realize that on some level
they're out of their fucking mind.

675
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:22,720
It's just not the kind of automated mine
that's going to get you arrested. Well,

676
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:27,160
like nobody in my wife's family knows
anybody that's been to jail and I know

677
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:31,210
like 15 people, you know, and tell me
what you know, circle. So I don't know.

678
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:32,950
But I'm saying to me and my friends,
you know,

679
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:35,230
you think that shit's normal and then,

680
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,030
but it's not like I've met people.
Those are like the tips you're getting.

681
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:43,270
Like how to survive in jail as a part of,
it's supposed to.

682
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:46,720
You need two years of a language and
I have a couple of extra curricular

683
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:48,500
activities so you can get
into a good school though.

684
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:49,540
There are people that are around it,

685
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,490
people that are in it and
people that are about it.

686
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,390
I was just around it and I kind of dip
my toe in it and I, and I actually, uh,

687
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,920
again, not to preface it by saying
on stage that, uh, I'm, I'm, I just,

688
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:03,880
because I committed crimes as a mean,
I'm a criminal and yes it does. No,

689
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:06,430
it doesn't. Millennial Shit.
No, it's not. If you ever,

690
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:10,180
if you ever hang out with a
fucking criminal, it's just
a whole different breed.

691
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,670
And when you're like saying,
I played high school football,

692
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:17,110
I'm not a football player. Yes you are.
You're not a pro. What do you got to kill?

693
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:21,730
Somebody says why? We argue. I'm
saying is that like, yeah, okay,

694
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:25,110
you commit crimes, you know, you know,

695
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,960
but when you're younger it's not,
you're not a, there's a certain type of,

696
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,510
all right, how about this Joe? Bob,

697
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,790
you don't get a fucking party.
Doesn't make you a comic. Okay.

698
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,940
But it makes you funny. Oh,
worked. If it worked this,

699
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,950
I just want a picture and you want like
the, you know, the draft day for the NFL,

700
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,880
it's for the mob and you're waiting to
get that call and it's like the seventh,

701
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:52,990
eighth round. He just didn't get it. You
got on the taxi squad that League folded.

702
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,990
Yeah. You got on the taxi squad
and everything and you would never,

703
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,570
you just weren't, uh, you
didn't quite make it to the mop.

704
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:01,300
So you weren't like you were in
a career criminal. But a few,

705
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,110
I just like my wife and she's normal
and her families, uh, you know, norm,

706
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,400
that was the point you were trying to
turn into a big argument. Okay. No,

707
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:12,580
but I get what you're saying.
I'm not trying to sugarcoat and it just,

708
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:17,400
it is what it is. What, say you,
Erin, what would you say? It's the,

709
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,840
because there's different levels.
Cause there's, there's a punk,

710
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,790
there's a dirt bag,

711
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,780
and then there's a criminal and then
as a career criminal and then there's a

712
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:28,960
psycho. Where would you say
he, he's on that spectrum.

713
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,010
It's like he was a punk.
He, he grew out of it.

714
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,990
Know that was a juvenile delinquent.
Yeah. James Fairness to him.

715
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:37,220
He never said what he did.

716
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,270
But I have to figure if somebody said I
committed crimes that's beyond, you know,

717
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:43,580
writing, just stealing, shit, stealing.

718
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:47,520
Like I stole a car in middle
school and then that's a
felony. I know. And then, um,

719
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,470
me and my brother, we on a car is he
like, you'll go to jail for that. But my,

720
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,190
I just rode shotgun and
laugh. The whole kind of car.

721
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,900
I don't even remember. It was like
an 85 80 I tried to steal a car.

722
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,350
She was actually a truck. We've tried
to steal a truck. Did you? This,

723
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,030
we got in it and then we were looking for
keys on the visor and we couldn't find

724
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:10,610
it. So then we just pushed it
down the hill into a river.

725
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,580
And I see now that's just being dumb.
And you know what I mean? That's not,

726
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,200
you're not a criminal.
I remember,

727
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,860
I remember we were pushing all the
wheels were like locked and then when

728
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:22,880
something snapped and it was going, I
remember pushing it and laughing so hard,

729
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:25,550
I couldn't feel my legs and we almost,
we will,

730
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,970
we was shit faced and trying to
run back to the car drunk laughing.

731
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,510
It just what you did.

732
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:36,200
And then I remember we all had to get
ruined some but then we all had to get the

733
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:39,080
fuck out of there. God, I haven't
thought about that in tribe.

734
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,310
We all have to get the fuck out. And I
remember the next day my buddy going,

735
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,040
I feel like we got cheated out of that
laugh cause we all had to fucking just

736
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,460
will you the funniest side of
your friends during the day too?

737
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,170
Well I've got broad daylight and
you were drunk and we were drunk.

738
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,340
Was it summer or some shit?
Nah somebody somehow that was the winner.

739
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,480
It was the weekend and somebody somehow
had got a case of beer and you know one

740
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:04,940
of the steels you just start drinking
like in, you know I got an idea.

741
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,750
Well you know how like you're uh,

742
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,070
like the way you drink when you first
drink is like give me that shit about like

743
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:13,190
it's way worse to like if
there's a poisonous snake
its way worse to get bitten

744
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,750
by a baby one than a,

745
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,830
an adult because the adult knows it'll
give you just enough to fuck you up.

746
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,000
But the baby, just a baby just like
both barrels. That's how you drink.

747
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,970
Like when you're an adult and you drink,
you're a gentleman, you sip and shit,

748
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,300
you know, you like Gleason in the
fucking the hustler. Right. But Nike,

749
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,770
when you're a kid,
you're fast Eddie,

750
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:33,860
and you're sucking it down your fucking
mess. That's the way we were drinking.

751
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,710
And we ended up, you know,
and we were under age.

752
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:39,560
So you end up in a
parking lot of the woods.

753
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,710
Now here's when we were in a parking lot.
Here's the difference. To my point now,

754
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:45,710
let's just say that I'm, I'm
with my friends and there's
one kid that's like, hey,

755
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:50,570
I have an idea. Let's break
into this dude's apartment.
Okay. And then you're like,

756
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,870
okay, cause it'll be fun to
break in somebody's apartment.

757
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,290
But this guy has got other motives.
Like he's like, he's like, Nana,

758
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,820
I know we're going to take the credit
cards, I'm going to take the keys.

759
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,870
Like he's got it planned out, but I'm
in it just because I think it's fun.

760
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,340
You're in it for the story.
Yeah. And the last, yeah, the
story. Absolutely. You know,

761
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:12,800
when you're a young dude and you're
trying to get a rep, you know, and,

762
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,740
and you're just so,
that's when you commit the crime.

763
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:18,560
But then there's the guy
that's like, no, no, no. Oh,

764
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:22,880
he sees a future like he's when he's
like here's what you're going to need to

765
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,750
put a house on this. Yeah. And then this
other guy's going to have to pay for.

766
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,850
Absolutely. It's a different city.
We're never going to get caught.

767
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,950
That would be a huge,
that would be the difference between like,

768
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:35,820
cause when when my buddy pulled up with
the car I jumped in the car and we just

769
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:38,550
went cruising and then we ended
up wrecking it. It was four of us.

770
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:42,690
I would love to tell this story one time
about that night cause it was four of

771
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:43,231
us,
me and my,

772
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:46,500
well you should tell it on your podcast
if you're on the list and I won't do it

773
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:50,040
now. Yeah. Is that a
passive aggressive way?

774
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,000
Is Asia it shut the fuck up with
the story or is that it like,

775
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,220
cause it seemed like he didn't want to
tell it now if you want to tell it now,

776
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:58,020
I will say no,
it's not even that long.

777
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:01,080
I'm just saying like if I could ever
write a short film or something. Oh,

778
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,440
it was just an interesting night
that the two of us, the four of us,

779
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:06,090
two of us got pinched
in the other two didn't,

780
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,770
and they didn't rat you out or anything?
No. Did you ever, I'm the only time we,

781
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,180
we still a case of beer out of a,

782
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:14,700
out of a fucking liquor store
and the whole thing was like a,

783
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,220
as soon as the deal. So we
came up with this idea of, oh,

784
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,800
I can't tell this story because we just
don't use names because we're, we're,

785
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,630
we're, we're doing some of it, uh,
on a project that I'm working on,

786
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:30,990
so I can't, I can't give this away, but
we bet we're fucking, we're given these,

787
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,040
these people like blue ball story,
blue blow, Paul's here. Um, you know,

788
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:39,840
the deal says basically you fucking walk
in the oldest guy looking kid and you

789
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:42,210
just fucking, you walk in,
you stay online, you know,

790
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:45,060
you act like you're going to pay and
it'll last second. You fucking run out.

791
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,110
And uh, yeah, it was one of those things.
You're going to grocery stores when I,

792
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:54,090
I mean, I had no money, man. And, um, I'm
like 19. I was washing dishes at Hooters.

793
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,840
I had like three, I was bouncing at a
nightclub, washing dishes at Hooters.

794
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,730
I was trying to do something with my life.

795
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:02,820
I was going to have to clean the
grease trap. That's the fucking worst.

796
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,790
I mean we don't do it every
night cause cause that's not bad.

797
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,160
Ours was every three months.
It be three months.

798
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:10,320
Agree to clean the fucking fryers,
man.

799
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,480
That was a pain in the empty all the
oil out. I was a prep cook. I robbed,

800
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,360
I robbed every place I worked
for. Man. That's how I ate.
I used to kangaroo pouch,

801
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:22,290
my apron. And then when I was like
prepping food, I would put it in my apron.

802
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:26,040
I had a few. Fuck you mean that's
how you ate? Uh, well I was,

803
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,960
I was pretty much on my own.
I mean I was,

804
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,900
I was one of those losers that
went away to community college.

805
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,790
I'd never heard of that. You
know, I never even went to, no,

806
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,610
it does it. That's the point. I'm
crashing at some other dude's apartment.

807
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,480
And then, um, I was trying to go to school
and just try and get my life going, man.

808
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:46,710
And, and um, when I worked there,

809
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:50,730
I just used to stack up on food out of
cooler and the trunk. Oh, you will bro.

810
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,150
Okay. Okay. All right. But
I've told this story before.

811
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:57,000
I was working in this restaurant and
there was this guy who worked there and he

812
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:57,834
fucking,

813
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,980
he lost his license for drinking and
driving so many times that there was no

814
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:04,620
date that he was going
to get his license back.

815
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,110
And this was the 80s and he had lost it.

816
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:09,150
This is right when mothers against
drinking or driving came out.

817
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:11,280
Like he did the level of fuck up.
You had to be,

818
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,410
and he was about 34,
35 and he already had the gin.

819
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:20,400
Blossom knows, he looked like
he looked like WC fields. Yeah.

820
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:24,510
And he was 34, 35. Right. And, uh,

821
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,940
so he used to ride this moped to work.

822
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,010
I was living in North
Carolina and he survived this

823
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,390
moped to work and he lived in a
trailer park. So this fucking moped,

824
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:37,270
he didn't have a driver's license.
This was it. This was it for this guy.

825
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,730
Like this was his motive.
Fucking transportation.

826
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,100
I remember he taking like
an on cold winter days,

827
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:44,540
he would come to work and he would
always be drunk and hungover,

828
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,670
see which shower late.

829
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,680
And he would come to work and
his hair would still be wedding.

830
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:50,830
Even had frost on his hair. He was
like fucking Grandpa Munster. Right?

831
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,280
So time he parked it back there and
this other kid who was Emma was into

832
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,020
Metallica, classic burnout
teenager. He had like,

833
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,650
he like never shaved his upper lip.

834
00:48:00,651 --> 00:48:02,980
So we had that awful prepubescent
and fucking mustache.

835
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,600
That little looked like somebody
said a little tip on those. Yeah.

836
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,020
It's always blonde. No matter what
color you got. Jet Black. Hey,

837
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:09,160
that little blonde mustache,
right?

838
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:14,320
So we thought it'd be funny if we took
his moped and hid the thing and he thinks

839
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:16,650
that it was stolen. Watch them
freak out and be like, oh yeah,

840
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,510
we'll tell you what it is.
So just to freak this guy out.

841
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:20,830
And this guy had like nothing,
right?

842
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,150
So he was in waiting tables and we took
his moped and behind the restaurant was

843
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:28,140
this, this little shed
built into a hill that we,

844
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,130
they kept all the extra kegs
of beer and all that stuff.

845
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:33,940
So we wheeled it around and put it up on
the roof cause you could just walk out

846
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:35,020
and it was like a driveway.

847
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:38,290
You went up and we just stuck it up on
the fucking roof and just left it there.

848
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,830
And he came out and he saw it
and he was fucking freaking out.

849
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:44,380
I remember pretending to wash dishes and
my shoulders were shaking watching this

850
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:46,270
guy. I mean, this was like
his fucking hope diamond.

851
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,930
And then finally we couldn't stop and
we just all started laughing. He's like,

852
00:48:49,931 --> 00:48:52,380
you fucking assholes. And we'd go, yeah,
it's up on the roof. When we walked out,

853
00:48:52,381 --> 00:48:54,430
we went up on the roof and it was gone.
Somebody still,

854
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,110
that's so fucking awful.
No, it gets better.

855
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,060
So he reported it stolen.

856
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,140
They ended up catching the kid like
two days later and the kid had tried to

857
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:07,030
paint it,
I'll never forget it was a silver one.

858
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:08,640
And he sprayed all this black on it,

859
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:10,750
did a shit job and it
looked like fucking shit.

860
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,100
And I remember like three days later the
Guy Riding Back to work with Frost and

861
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:19,030
his mustache and this horrible silver and
like fucked up black paint all over it.

862
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,060
I actually really felt bad.
I felt bad about that.

863
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:25,230
Do you remember the kid growing up at
the minibike that kid was always going to

864
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,240
equal scumbag like he did
you guys make many bikes?

865
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,670
I have that kid that had the
mini bike without the lawnmower.

866
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,130
I remember while my parents were like,
you're not riding those fucking things.

867
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:35,740
They both in the medical field.
So uh,

868
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,000
one of my brothers bought one and
had it hid by was another shed.

869
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,320
It was always a shed
when I was growing up.

870
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:45,670
He wasn't sh he had it hid behind there
and just the pressure of it cause he had

871
00:49:45,671 --> 00:49:47,890
to keep it away from us and he
thought I was going to wrap it up.

872
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,310
Did he buy it from a kid that made it
or was it like a legit don't always a

873
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:54,730
moped and he bought it. It wasn't a,
it wasn't a dirt bike, but my, uh,

874
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,470
my parents were like,
you know,

875
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:58,240
in the medical field so
matter what you wanted to do.

876
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:00,410
If it was remotely dangerous,
my dad's thing was Christ.

877
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,470
They had it paste in the other day. It's
riding a moped, a blah, blah, blah, blah,

878
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:07,360
and he's gone. He was always dead. No
matter what the fuck you wanted to do.

879
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,000
He had a patient in the end of the day,
you know, and it's just like [inaudible].

880
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,510
It was just so fucking,
well, what a coincidence dad.

881
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,480
Every fucking thing I want to do,
it's like one of those,

882
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:20,050
they always play that worst possible
scenario game. Ladies. The thing,

883
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,330
now that I've got a kid, I
totally get it. I told you that.

884
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:26,820
They tell you that like once you have
a kid, you'll understand. No, no.

885
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:31,310
My parents were great thing about them
is they let you figure out as much as

886
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:35,510
they stayed on you on the big shit.
Don't do drugs and all of that. And uh,

887
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:40,490
stressed education, they let you
figure out a lot of shit. Um,

888
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:42,980
and I think that that's why,
you know,

889
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:47,810
people in my family are
like self sufficient and
have that fucking, you know,

890
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,320
you don't stand around looking
at the Rock, you're like, oh,

891
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:54,690
I guess I have to push this fucking thing
or it's not going to move. Yeah. Uh,

892
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:59,900
I remember like, like the life lessons,
remember, uh, I, this piece of shit,

893
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:04,520
pickup truck I bought and it was
my first car and it broke down.

894
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:08,180
So I got on the pay phone so long ago,
this wasn't,

895
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:09,950
I fucking called my mom like mom,

896
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,250
but talkers and stored and Uber
with the whole fucking scenario.

897
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:16,470
When I got to be a workable bunch, she
listened. The whole fucking thing was,

898
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,850
is saying anything. And then I
finished that. She goes, well,

899
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,530
what would you have me do? And I was
like, Oh shit. And I looked down,

900
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,330
there was a phone book right
there and I was, you know,

901
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,580
somebody fucking ripped all the
pages on. And I said, all right,

902
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:32,420
I guess I got to call a tow truck.
I mean,

903
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,490
she was one step away from
calling me a pussy and my mom.

904
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,240
Yeah, like why are you fucking
like, what am I a fucking mechanic?

905
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,410
All of that was in that. You have
a dime. Why didn't you fucking,

906
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,710
it was a dynamic that, why
didn't you fucking call me?
Call the fucking tell what?

907
00:51:48,711 --> 00:51:51,020
Am I going to go down there and pick
the truck up? You fucking moron.

908
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,320
I know you suck at math.
Are you bad at life too?

909
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,990
I heard all of that and I felt stupid.

910
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:01,670
I remember I was mad at her and then,
but was it tough love or was it no,

911
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,030
no, no, no, no, no, no. It
was, it was all planned.

912
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:09,290
It was tough love because it was just
like, this kid's got to learn. Yeah,

913
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,720
because one of these days
you're going to be on your own.

914
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:17,390
And like I saw at Dana Carvey dual
hilarious bit about that, where you know,

915
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:20,000
his kids were calling them up or something
like that because something wasn't

916
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:22,640
working. Rather than calling
the landlord. And I guess,

917
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:25,760
I guess that's a thing with
kids nowadays. Like they, uh,

918
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:30,470
his generation went too far
over correcting because like,

919
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,770
you know, if you watched like his
comedy, you know, the old guy,

920
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,860
I had a game called stare
at the sun, you know, like,

921
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:39,980
I think his was so tough that then
there was maybe like a bit of an

922
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:42,980
overcorrection, but I remember when
he was doing that bit, it's, uh,

923
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:45,680
I'm not going to try to Redo it.
It was fucking hilarious,

924
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,430
but it reminded me of that story
and that they can like, once again,

925
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:53,240
how right my mother was being like,
all right,

926
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:57,170
well you have a fucking brain
use it. The, the thing that, uh,

927
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:58,370
I found the difference,

928
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,380
like the way our parents were raised
and the way they raised us is like,

929
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,010
my mom, when she was younger, you know,
you stay outside, kids played outside,

930
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,320
you come home when the lights
came on. I mean, you're, you're,

931
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:11,390
you're a little older than me.
Um,

932
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:14,630
and where I grew up is also was a little
different too in North Jersey at the

933
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:18,980
time, you know, it wasn't, our
parents raised me the US the same way,

934
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:21,950
but the outside wasn't safe,
if that makes any sense.

935
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,330
When they were younger it was safe.

936
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,520
But then like come home when the
lights are on. Right. You're like,

937
00:53:25,521 --> 00:53:29,080
okay and I'm Ryan, bye bye
fucking crack heads. And you know,

938
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:33,920
because to them they were raised that way
and then I think our parents saw a lot

939
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:35,600
of shit they shouldn't
have seen at a young age.

940
00:53:35,601 --> 00:53:40,160
People our age and now there
are over protective. Yeah.

941
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:44,990
I don't know how to like, I think
it's like kids like your kid your age.

942
00:53:44,991 --> 00:53:48,230
I know you guys are going to be a happy
medium. You don't really fucked me up.

943
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:51,320
Was you know that remember
that to catch a predator? Yeah.

944
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,440
Like class that like makes it seem that
there's a fucking creep behind every

945
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:00,830
tree.
And I dunno if back in the day,

946
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:03,890
cause back in the day you just say he's
a dirty old man, stay away from him.

947
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:08,720
But I think that there's
a, with the Internet, yeah.

948
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And the ability for people to act on stuff
and feed shit and watch all this porn

949
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:21,110
and all of this type of stuff. And I
think it draws these fucking people. Well,

950
00:54:21,111 --> 00:54:24,980
the Internet is like the one big
fucking neighborhood and, and,

951
00:54:24,981 --> 00:54:28,130
and there is no really securing,
I mean,

952
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:29,870
there's shit that I see
in my feet and I'm like,

953
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:34,140
what the fuck are you kind of
getting away from kind of getting,

954
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:37,820
but the thing about it is, so the Internet
is fucking incredible too. If you,

955
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,700
if you try to learn shit,
they'll write shit. Like, dude,

956
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:44,900
if you want to get that Fucking v drums,
if you want to learn a bunch of Shit, uh,

957
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,180
you know, there's some, there's everybody,

958
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:48,650
there's always somebody
doing a drum cover.

959
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,080
We'll break down something that
you can't fucking figure out.

960
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:55,900
And now there's like some monster
fucking teachers out there. Uh, uh,

961
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,980
Mike Johnston, uh, uh, the guy
take lessons with Dave Ilitch,

962
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,650
just started doing shit.
And these guys are like,

963
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:05,390
these guys are like legit fucking,
like, they know what they're doing. Uh,

964
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:10,610
and, and like, so if you stay in
those areas, learning how to cook,

965
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:11,660
you're good.
You're good.

966
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,740
The Internet is, it is an exact, uh,
what's the word I'm looking at it,

967
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:19,770
it's just an exact replica
of human nature. Is that
like, you know, first of all,

968
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:22,500
the idea that we're going to build this
information highway working to connect

969
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:23,400
people all over the world.

970
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:26,670
We're going to learn from each
other and like 80% of it is poor.

971
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,270
And then click bait.

972
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,910
He got these fucking scumbag
people and these fake articles and

973
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:44,060
that's human nature man. And it's an
exact replica of, I've kind of been,

974
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,130
I've been awake, I'm, I'm trying to be
vice lists here in April. They're like,

975
00:55:49,131 --> 00:55:52,820
no, no. Poor, no cigars, no
booze. I fucked up the other day.

976
00:55:52,821 --> 00:55:56,930
I took a couple hits a week cause I
jerked off to side while smoking a cigar.

977
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,220
Um, dude, I haven't had a drink since
new year's man. Oh, you don't to do it.

978
00:56:01,221 --> 00:56:02,800
I think what we're going over here before,
uh,

979
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,890
before I just saw in the next podcast
guy look into here, um, before I, uh,

980
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,810
get out of here,
I do have to address the fact that the uh,

981
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,450
congratulations to the maple leafs.

982
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:15,730
You guys finally fucking showed up
and played a hell of a game. Uh,

983
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,690
but I feel good,
but this is going to come out Thursday.

984
00:56:17,691 --> 00:56:21,560
I feel good about our chances
Thursday considering, uh, you know,

985
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:25,600
I just don't see us getting 40
shots on goal again and losing.

986
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,000
So all we got to do is when this
next one went up three games to one,

987
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:32,890
but it was a phenomenal game and that
was the first game in this series that

988
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:36,190
felt like playoff hockey where, uh, both
teams will fucking out there killing it.

989
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:39,910
So I look forward to tonight's
game for a Brett Arts.
