1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,280
Hey, what's going on? It's,
hey, what's going on? Sorry.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,430
Didn't know if this thing was on or not.

3
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:09,390
It's bill burn his time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday, January seven,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,540
2018 what's going on? How, wow. Yeah. Um,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,330
it's fucking three 32
in the morning and uh,

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,890
I slept a little bit,

7
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:24,891
but just been having a motherfucker of a
time with this jet lagged over here and

8
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:28,160
you know why it is.
It's cause I'm not booze.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,670
Okay. This one's for all
you alcoholics out there.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,350
I'm fucking with you.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,860
People keep telling me to go get Melatonin
and send natural way to get tired.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,540
Um, all I know is the unnatural way
to get tired, tired, which was, uh,

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,010
what I always did was just the first
night I tried to stay up and then I'd go

14
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,270
out and I would just go get,

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,720
I'd go booze and I'd have four fucking
stiff drinks and just come home and pass

16
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:04,410
out. And then I'd start to
get acclimated to their time.

17
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,120
I'd have to do that about three nights
in a row and that I was fine. Um,

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,440
so whatever.
I just been,

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,830
so I got to do this fucking
podcast because today I'm
getting on a plane and I'm

20
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:20,820
flying to a stonier to
do one show tonight.

21
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm very excited about it. I
googled some pictures, first of all,

22
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:28,380
Astonia Jesus Christ.
What a bad ass flag.

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,430
That's one of those things that I collect.
I don't buy a lot of touristy shit,

24
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,870
so I just get those little flags.

25
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:37,620
So I gotta make sure I get the time
to go down and pick one of those up.

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,920
Then I got love for you the next day.

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,240
This is the part of the tour where I
start going to all these places I've never

28
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:48,120
been to as far as countries goes. But, um,

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,370
the last two nights I started in
Cologne. I had been there before. Um,

30
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,670
we did Munich on Saturday and
yesterday we did often back often buck.

31
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,400
And um, it's just been a fucking great
time being over here with the burrows.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,180
Sorry, my voice is
going through, you know,

33
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,460
I'm trying to make sure I have
good shows and I don't know.

34
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,270
I don't know what the
fuck I did to it, but, uh,

35
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,990
yesterday I should say Saturday and Sunday
we had two shows Munich to and often

36
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:26,520
buck. And the first fucking
show was like at 3:30 PM.

37
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,890
This is what kills me.

38
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,150
I've never in my career that I can really
remember ever gone on stage like that.

39
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,750
I mean at that time,

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,520
I think maybe one time I was doing
hilarious and Cleveland and I did an

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,000
afternoon show, but I think that was
at like four or five, I don't know,

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,570
just three 30. It was fucking
weird, but I got to tell you,

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,460
the crowd was unbelievable.
Munich crowds were fucking ridiculous.

44
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,040
I mean, they've all been great, but they
were just like, we were in like this,

45
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,150
I swear to God that fall it goes
on like a little barn and um,

46
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,520
it was like snowing out and I had to walk
from the green room back outside into

47
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:10,030
the snow and then back into
the venue and I was just like,

48
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,710
these motherfuckers are
trying to get me sick.

49
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,700
So my coat on their big stupid palm
palm hat that I got in Finland,

50
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:19,670
where back in the day, which has been
saving my ass, that the vitamin C pack,

51
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:22,090
it's in a bowl shows.

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,480
The crowds were just crazy good.
And uh,

53
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,840
in between shows I ran around
trying to find my daughter's,

54
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:35,230
some sneakers, some cool sneakers. I
have found this store called early,

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,160
somebody told me about.
And uh,

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,330
we drove over there and I bought
a couple pairs of sneakers.

57
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,080
I go to the forest Gump once, you
know, the classic Nike Cortez.

58
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,790
And I made sure that I got the,
uh,

59
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:50,080
the Velcro straps so she can get a little
fat fucking Tyler feet and they're,

60
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,670
you know,
um,

61
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,770
but it was pretty fucking cool because
in the middle of the city they had this

62
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:01,750
giant, giant wall going on, you know,
and it couldn't see how it could,

63
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:05,080
we just literally drove by and it
was the original wall of the city,

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,820
um, for like back in the day
when there was just like,

65
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,910
you know,
it was a free for all.

66
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,660
He just sat in your village and all of a
sudden some fucking assholes would just

67
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:20,860
show up and just start murdering the man
and rape and the women in and shit on

68
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,670
fire. And it was just like, like
that's what people did back then.

69
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,800
Like that was like a fucking like
something that someone has spired too.

70
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,170
They aspired to rape and pillage
and he just fucking lunatic shit.

71
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,210
So these people you know,
wanted to survive.

72
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:45,130
So they would build these giant walls,
I guess around their fucking villages.

73
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,160
Then someone's trying to tell me a teller.

74
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:53,140
The Hud used to save the bodies from the
previous village and then he'd sneak up

75
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,460
on a village,
he'd late,

76
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:59,080
the body's on fire and then with like a
catapult would start shooting them into

77
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,200
the fucking village he wanted to attack.

78
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,700
Like you just sitting there chilling out,

79
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:08,290
enjoying yourself and like all the sudden,

80
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,790
you know,
I dunno what was the job back then?

81
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,130
Some fucking copper Smith comes through
the top of your fucking little hut.

82
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:22,990
They're on fire and lands on
your God damn dinner table.

83
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,823
And that that was,

84
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,480
that was the first sign that your life
was going to fucking change. I mean,

85
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,010
Jesus fucking Christ. It's crazy. And I,

86
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:36,011
I don't know what it is about Europe
maybe cause I watched all this shit about

87
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:40,150
World War II and it, you know, and a
lot of, you know, American history,

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,790
they don't give a fuck about,
um,

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,100
you know, the whole curriculum was
designed by white descendants from Europe.

90
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,690
So that's all we fucking talked about.

91
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,970
So you just know certain
shit and of course they, you,

92
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,980
they dance around a lot of shit. Um,
but as I've been over here, like we,

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,920
when we took the train from fucking
Munich up to often Bach, uh,

94
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,170
they will like next stop like Nuremberg.

95
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,020
And I'm like Norenberg
like Nuremberg trials.

96
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:15,290
For some reason I thought that that was,
those trials were in France.

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,060
And now that I'm getting exposed a little
more of the German language, I'm like,

98
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:23,280
well, obviously that's not
a fucking French city. Um,

99
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,620
okay.

100
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,290
So I'm on the train and I'm
texting version to be like, dude,

101
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:31,190
this is where they fucking try it. All the
Nazis, the SS and the Gestapo and shit.

102
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,420
After World War II when they like, they'd
like fucking put him to death and shit,

103
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,880
hanging them and everything. And uh,
I'm texting him and he can't fucking,

104
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,810
yeah, he's not getting service. So Mike
Versie Versie he looks up, you know,

105
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:49,280
he's a couple seats away, you know, but
out of the respect for German people,

106
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,270
I don't want to be like,
hey,

107
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:53,870
this is where they fucking killed all the
Nazis have to function. World War Two.

108
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,300
I walked over to him and I started to
say it, but because I'm speaking English,

109
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:02,510
people just look at you like, oh, these
are fucking American. What's judge him?

110
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,350
Is he fat? Is he breathing through
his mouth? You know, is he loud?

111
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,720
So I just literally had
to show him the text. Um,

112
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,220
and I'm sitting there, you know,
like when you go to fucking Berlin,

113
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:18,540
that's where Hitler killed himself
in part of his bunker. Still exist.

114
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:23,150
I know they, they fucking destroyed
most of it. The Soviet state.

115
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,190
And then they build just like an
apartment building around it. You know,

116
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,110
it's like Los Angeles.
How they do that shit.

117
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,370
They just knocked shit down and they
don't give a fuck what happened.

118
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:35,940
And I get it. Cause the guy was so fucking
evil. But like, I'm just like, wow,

119
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:40,710
it's so fucking crazy that peep the German
people just walk amongst all of this

120
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,260
shit. And then I was like, wait a minute.

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,550
I live in the United States of America.
I go down south all the time.

122
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,430
I can't imagine what the fuck happened.

123
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Right where I'm sitting when I'm
sitting in a fucking waffle house.

124
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Like if that used to be like a plantation
or some slave was running away and

125
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,400
they got caught and God
knows what the fuck happened.

126
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,510
Forget about the native Americans.
So I was like, well, why the fuck

127
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,190
okay.

128
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,360
Do I only think about that shit you
don't like every time I go to Paris,

129
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:15,480
like when I look at this, Sean's
Elisa, that fucking street,

130
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:18,780
I just pictured when the Nazis
fucking paraded up the damn thing.

131
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,400
Uh, when the occupied their
country and when the allied forces,

132
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,160
when they took it back.
Um,

133
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,190
I mean all the French ladies banged
a bunch of Americans of identity. Um,

134
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,150
how come I don't think of that shit,
my own country.

135
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:36,690
It's just cause cause I grew up there,
it's fucked.

136
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,400
I almost thought that
would be like a weird,

137
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:39,870
yeah.

138
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,820
When those Saifai fucking movie
slash horror movies that um,

139
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,080
I don't know if you just, if you, I
get them because they kind of do it.

140
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,700
They do it on like light shit.

141
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,540
Like if you move into a house and someone
got murdered there in the 20s, right?

142
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,610
Like let me tell something.
She,

143
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,370
I'm going to just let you from
fucking history here. Right.

144
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,440
Then all of a sudden
that place is haunted,

145
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,000
but they don't like maybe American horror
story did it. I don't fucking know.

146
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:09,620
I watch sports, but um, anyway,

147
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,443
um,

148
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,330
okay.

149
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,163
And then,

150
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,040
then I'm reading all of this shit and
it's like about the Nuremberg trial when

151
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,970
I'm on the fucking train and making sure
nobody's looking over my shoulder and

152
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:25,140
I'm seeing how like they had to decide
how they were going to go sort of the

153
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:27,600
first time I think of World War One,
they tried to do it,

154
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,540
but this is the first time
they were trying to make
people pay for their fucking

155
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,390
war crimes.
So you know,

156
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,720
FDR and fucking Churchill and all
these guys are trying to figure out how

157
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:37,830
they're going to go about doing it.

158
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,070
And FDR balked at something and then
he died and then Truman came in and was

159
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:44,940
just like,
well wait a minute.

160
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,430
Okay,

161
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,030
yeah. Truman came in and was like,
no, we're going to do that shit.

162
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,820
So he must have still
been at war with Japan.

163
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:56,540
And then he goes and he drops to fucking
nuclear weapons on fucking Japan.

164
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,550
Like it was, it's like they were
all fucking world war criminals.

165
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,770
We sitting there firebombing
Dresden and shit.

166
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,710
It's like women and children down
there. It's, it's cell. I don't know.

167
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,230
That's why I always say like,
to this day,

168
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:13,280
I can't believe that like
war is still a legal,

169
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,050
you know, slash like glorified. And uh,

170
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,170
I mean, I understand defending
your country and shit like that.

171
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:26,070
If there's a fucking lunatic out there,
but like, you know who's kidding,

172
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,990
who you know a lot. You know,

173
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,010
there's been a lot of iffy decisions
made out there for, you know, it's just,

174
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,060
it's a fucking land grab you going
after oil, you know, you, you want,

175
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,390
you know what that land, because it's,
it's got some water around it. I mean,

176
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,900
that's why people go to fucking war most
of the time it seems nowadays. Anyways.

177
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,850
Um, but anyways, I dunno,

178
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,550
some of that leads to me to talking
about fucking thin privilege.

179
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,600
I follow this guy, Yannis Pappas
on the Instagram. He's like,

180
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,250
fucking genius does all these characters
and stuff. So I'm always watching him.

181
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,250
Kyle done again. Jeff Richards,
they're like my favorite,

182
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:14,490
like the fucking characters. They
do the fucking geniuses, right?

183
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,120
So I was watching his and he posted
something about it. So I'm going,

184
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:22,590
what the fuck is thin privilege? I
already know. I have white privilege,

185
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:26,700
evidently I have been privileged to like
if it was like monopoly and there was a

186
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,850
stretch, a little properties that
were the privileged properties.

187
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,030
Like I feel like I got some of those
little green houses on a lot of them.

188
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,550
So evidently it's a privilege.

189
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,700
Yeah.

190
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,700
To be thin rather than a reward
for having the discipline.

191
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,820
To push yourself away from the
fucking table. You know? And I'm not,

193
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,650
I'm not talking about when
you were a kid and you just,

194
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,700
some people have baby felt like I had
baby fat. I was a fat fucking kid.

195
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,220
I was like 10 pounds. You
know, when I was born,

196
00:11:56,221 --> 00:12:00,810
I was a big fucking read Charlie Brown.
Look at fucking baby.

197
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,280
There's not one to picture of me till
I'm like three in my head was literally

198
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,590
almost the size it is right
now when I was at adult.

199
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:12,450
Like I literally from day one look like
I could fuck up a Lego city. Right.

200
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,843
And um,

201
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,230
okay.

202
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,150
You know,
if I just use that to my advantage,

203
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,700
that'd be on the playground and people
be fucking with me cause my orange hair

204
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,590
and I just lean on him, you know, like a,

205
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,160
like a boxer that just wearing
them out in the early rounds.

206
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,750
And then I just fucking,
you know,

207
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,790
bunch of body shots and it would be over
me with my big flabby freckled arms.

208
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,980
And then somewhere in like junior high,

209
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:46,330
I just sort of leaned out like all of
a sudden I grew a little bit and uh,

210
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:49,480
and then I stopped growing and
then I was just a small skinny kid.

211
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:52,510
I kind of had it all, you know,
when it comes to the bullying,

212
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:57,400
I was a fat kid when I was
really young that I was, uh,

213
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,960
but I was big and then I became small
and I was skinny and you throw it all in

214
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:03,190
there.
I had orange hair,

215
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,190
so it was kind of inevitable that I was
going to end up being some sort of a

216
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:10,930
fucking comedian or something.
I Dunno what, but um, anyways,

217
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,370
this then privileged shit.
It's like,

218
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,170
they're like people who are thin need
to fucking acknowledge. You know,

219
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,340
it's up to you to realize how
privileged you are that, you know,

220
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,050
people don't judge you when you eat a
cookie in public and above about and all

221
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:26,920
this shit.
This ain't well golf.

222
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,380
Do they fucking judge me when
I put on a pair of shorts,

223
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,210
I look at how fucking white my legs
are. You know, these fucking people.

224
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:39,120
You know what kills me about Shit
like that? All right, I get it.

225
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:42,030
Where you shouldn't tease fad people
and make them feel bad and all that,

226
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,110
you know, it's fucking immature
and it's me, I get it. Right?

227
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,800
But on the other side,
it's like there's no,

228
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,030
there is no burden of responsibility.

229
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,300
It's something that's
totally fucking curable.

230
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:00,060
And I know some people literally have
like food addictions and like it's a

231
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:04,410
psychological thing or whatever. But
you know, for most people who are fat,

232
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:08,600
it's just, you've just eaten
too much fucking food. You know?

233
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,690
And considering most of the
goddamn world is starving,

234
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,420
you know,
it's just like,

235
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,370
can you understood leave
with this train of thought.

236
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,630
Fat White people in a first world nation
can literally walk around and call

237
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:30,420
themselves victims. Well, you know,

238
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,150
I don't know all of these
fucking fatties I swear to God,

239
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,820
that's why I did that bid
on it at my last special.

240
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,450
You need to go to some countries where
the people are really have some problems.

241
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:43,770
I mean, you can even go to score on
the fucking Internet and read about it.

242
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,570
He could fill a hell of a lot fucking
better about yourself. You know,

243
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,790
I was sitting there, uh, you know, I was
getting frustrated with being fucking, uh,

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,900
jet lagged and ship and these three 30
in the afternoon show is, I was like,

245
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,550
fuck man,
now I can't fucking sleep.

246
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:05,210
And I was like feeling like I was a Zombie
and I was getting all grumpy and shit

247
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,450
and then I could go on the Internet
and I'm like, wait a minute. Okay.

248
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:11,630
So if Nuremberg is here, where was
Auswitch us? I can only say it right?

249
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,320
The concentration camp police,
right.

250
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,470
And it turns out it's in Poland and I
was like, well I don't have the time,

251
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,880
it's going to be too far away.

252
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,060
So I kind of googled some
fucking pictures of it and shit.

253
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:26,210
And I looked at it and I was like, oh
my God, I could never fucking go there.

254
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,530
I mean literally like you're fucking
blood runs cold, like looking at the shit.

255
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,640
And then they had like,
you know,

256
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,900
pictures of like piles of
like kids shoes and shit.

257
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:38,220
And I'm literally buying shoes for
my kid and I'm just like going,

258
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,240
am I really bitching that I
have a three 30 fucking show?

259
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,030
Kind of a fucking asshole.
Am I right?

260
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,700
I think people eating
fucking hot fudge Sundaes.

261
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:49,550
I'd do that every once in a while.
You know what I mean?

262
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,830
They got to look up a bunch of starve and
fucking kids in the middle of nowhere.

263
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,330
Not even in the middle of nowhere,

264
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:01,331
in the middle of where the world for
whatever reason considers nowhere before

265
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:06,170
you sit there and try to like figure
out a new way to try and fuck up.

266
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,690
Some of these career cause
that's going to be another thing.

267
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,460
This is such a weird fucking time of so
many God damn people like they just keep

268
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:20,630
trying to like,
I keep looking at it like a bike race.

269
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,260
Like they try to get behind somebody
who has like a legitimate complaint.

270
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,700
Like I gotta be honest with you,

271
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,590
the fact that white women can fucking
use the term white male privilege and

272
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,900
they're like a white woman,
the United States of America.

273
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:37,340
The fact that they can somehow hop on
the other side of the fence as some sort

274
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:42,260
of like, you know, um, underprivileged
group. And I'm not saying that,

275
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:45,380
you know, they don't get less than
white males, but it's just like,

276
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,900
should I really be listening
to your complaints next?

277
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,760
Are you really going to be first in line?

278
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,020
You actually have white privilege when
it comes to complaining because people

279
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:57,500
are going to pay attention to your shit
first even though you're suffering the

280
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:02,240
least. Right. As far as my
complete lack of research goes,

281
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,590
as far as me babbling here, fucking
foreign the goddamn morning in our real,

282
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:11,870
I hope I'm that weekend,
somebody up mumbling here. Um,

283
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,043
anyways,

284
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,430
so I guess that's the latest thing
that can get you to not fucking,

285
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,100
I dunno, sell some tickets on
the road or a fucking, you know,

286
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:29,210
host an awards show, like
whatever the fuck we're going
to do. You know, you know,

287
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:32,390
it blows my mind about that
whole ward show scandal is,

288
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:37,391
I just love how whatever was said was
said around 2011 and all these adults who

289
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:42,230
were well old enough,
well old enough,

290
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,430
we're plenty old enough to have gotten
offended back then and made a big stink.

291
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,950
And for some reason it
doesn't fucking come out.

292
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,000
It's almost like they get you on
something that like, all right,

293
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,850
hold onto that card.
You know what I mean?

294
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,410
Like they playing grantee fucking
water and then they wait till you get

295
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,860
something big enough that's going to
shine a light in their cars and then they

296
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:07,160
come back and they fucking train,
slam it down on the fucking table. Um,

297
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,950
I was out of the country,
but as far as what I read,

298
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:16,610
Ellen degenerates as cool in my book for
the rest of the fucking time, you know,

299
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,700
and I thought whatever she was trying
to do as a pho is the way to go about

300
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,480
stuff like that where you
just don't try to fucking

301
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,390
destroy somebody. You try
to get them, see your point,

302
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,930
try to get people on your side to be,
hey, give this person another chance.

303
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,610
You have it.
Be Open like that.

304
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:40,600
You open it up to a discussion and then
people just watch it and learn some shit

305
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,780
rather than just being like,
this person said this,

306
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,820
now they can't have that now let's watch
them fucking, you know, lose something.

307
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,690
You know who she's just sitting there
watching for the fucking entertainment

308
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:56,790
value. Um, this is one of my
favorite things to do by the way,

309
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:01,791
is to get out of my fucking high horse
here and preach at a quarter to four in

310
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:06,220
the fucking morning, whatever fucking
time it is here. Um, all right,

311
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,100
let's talk a NFL playoffs.
I missed most of them.

312
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:13,090
I was able to watch a little bit
of that eagles bears game, um,

313
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:19,240
in German, which was pretty cool. Um,
cause he kept enough of the English words

314
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,520
that I was able to, you know, kind of know
what the fuck they were talking about.

315
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,840
And uh, I know everybody's going
to get on the bears kicker,

316
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:32,320
but can somebody please explain to me
why the fuck you go for a two point

317
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,720
conversion.
When the bears did that,

318
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,620
why not just fucking kicked the goddamn
thing and then you end up losing by one?

319
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,000
John Madden my entire fucking
life said he'd take the points.

320
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,370
You'd take the points,
you'd take the points,

321
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,670
those extra points come back to hot
yet I know this guy, I missed that.

322
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:52,240
I guess he hit a number
of fucking gold posting.

323
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,070
He hit the CROC goalposts
and the crossbar.

324
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:55,480
And the last one I watched the highlights,

325
00:19:55,481 --> 00:20:00,400
but why the fuck are you going for
two points there? Makes it just,

326
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,710
you know,
well choose you only up by two.

327
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,040
You're acting like it's the end of the
game with the fucking two minutes to go.

328
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,380
There's a whole bunch of time left
and I forget when it happened,

329
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,240
the end of the third quarter,
beginning of fourth quarter,

330
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:15,310
but there was plenty of fucking time.
We're just a complete non factor.

331
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,290
Just take that extra fucking point.

332
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,060
Just take the fucking thing and then
see where the fuck you are with the last

333
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:26,280
five minutes.
Then you start playing that game.

334
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,850
You know everybody's going like Patrick,

335
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:33,300
one l like pulling the fucking goalie
with like 10 minutes left in the game,

336
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,310
which for some reason actually worked
for him. So congratulations to uh,

337
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,750
to the eagles, to Nick's falls,
man. But by the way though,

338
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,260
that matched her bisky
man had a brisk is acs.

339
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,020
Then we had a fucking break game
two for over hundred yards. Um,

340
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,790
I thought he was like really accurate and
he was dealing with like the defending

341
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:58,680
Superbowl champions. I thought it
was great to next falls is that gate,

342
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,220
you know, like I just
fucking delivers. Um,

343
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,650
okay.

344
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,620
Oh my God. Pete Carroll, Jesus
Christ, the poor fucking bastard.

345
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,080
The poor fucking bastard man.
He's getting a ton of shit in Seattle.

346
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,190
I guess they thought he ran the ball too
much and uh, I don't know what happened.

347
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,890
That field goal kicker get fucking hurts
and then they add their punch puncher

348
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:20,990
there and he has to do an onside kick.

349
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,270
Like why didn't he just
do what they all do?

350
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:27,380
Just stick it on the tee and then you
kick the ball in a downward motion on the

351
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:32,150
upper third of the fucking ball. So
it pops up in the air. The guy just,

352
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,230
he fucking just fucking basically
lobbed it down the field that you know

353
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:40,614
something.

354
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,460
Okay.

355
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,460
If Pete Carroll never won a Superbowl
and they were going to make a statue of

356
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:49,180
him,

357
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,130
it would be him with his hands on his
fucking knees just looking down at the

358
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:55,240
ground in pain.

359
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,750
He sorta the urban Meyer of a NFL coaches,

360
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,660
you know, and that they both won,
but they just have that fucking,

361
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,240
they just said that, that's soul crushing.
Whenever I see him do that. You don't,

362
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:15,180
it reminds me of, it reminds me
of Carl Yastrzemski when he back,

363
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:16,340
who's backing up to the wall?

364
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:20,030
When Bucky dent hit that three run homer
and you just saw his legs buckle. Okay.

365
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,450
It just reminds me of that every time
I see that shit. So, um, I dunno,

366
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,140
my condolences. I don't usually
have condolences to Seattle fans,

367
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:34,460
but I dunno if the rivalries kind of died
down. You football fans, I feel for you.

368
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,900
I've been there and all that shit.
Um,

369
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,970
congratulates the San Diego chargers
and I forget who played the last game.

370
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,750
All the colts, I guess the colts
look good and Andrew luck is back,

371
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,440
which is great.
Um,

372
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,850
other than that, I haven't been
fucking doing anything here.

373
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,470
I should probably do
some of these reeds here.

374
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,070
It's a podcast might be a little
short because I have to get up,

375
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,990
go to the airport. I'm already
up. All right. Oh, look
who's here. I can't do this.

376
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:06,470
Read justice everybody.
I apologize. It's old zip

377
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,373

ziprecruiter.com/berta Heiner
the right fucking people.

382
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,450
Unlike other jobs. I wonder if now
when you go to hire the right people,

383
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:35,310
they should add to zip recruiter.
It also goes through all your,

384
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,440
you're always a tweets you've ever sent
out to make sure someone's not going to

385
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:42,620
be like, you know, I wanted to
rent a car from this person.

386
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,090
And then they'd said this
tweet in thousand nine,

387
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,070
making fun of people with ugly feet.
I have feet that are,

388
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,750
they wouldn't say ugly.
How would they say it?

389
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,303
I Dunno.

390
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,370
Visually challenged. Um,
unlike other job sites,

391
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,090
zip recruiter finds qualified
candidates for you. It's powerful.

393
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:09,390

the German guard and every movie Zip

406
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,100
recruiter, the smartest way to
hire. All right. Policy genius.

407
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,260
Um,

408
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,590
getting life insurance is one of the more
intimidating parts of becoming a full

409
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,770
fledged adult.
It's not that bad if you have kids.

410
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,450
It's weird if you get it and you
just have your wife, you know,

411
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,370
cause then you're like,
is this bitch you going to kill me

412
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,340
once you have the kid you like how
I want them to be. All right. Sorry.

413
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:30,270
I watch a lot of those fucking first 48,
uh, it, it always comes down, you know,

414
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:34,310
first time murderers. So much of it
comes down to life insurance. Uh,

415
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,950
am I not selling this right?
Well right now I don't think I am.

416
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,680
There's so many options.
It's hard to know where to start,

417
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,120
but making sure your family is financially
protected is too important to avoid.

418
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:45,980
This is what you do once
you get life insurance.

419
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,300
He just sort of monitor your wife's laptop
or your husbands if they're checking

420
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:50,541
out,

421
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:55,010
like you know how to dispose of a body
or the check it out when the tides go in

422
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,540
and out.
That I think you might want to

423
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,260
put a little addendum to your policy.

424
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,920
So policy genius creates a website that
makes it easy for you to compare quotes

425
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:07,130
and get advice and get covered
without extra fees or commission.

426
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,070
A sales agent motivate your audience.

427

Read justice with my voice here, honey.

448
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,850
Um,
you probably heard me talk about honey,

449
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,300
the free browser extension that
automatically helps me save money on,

450
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:26,430
oh my favorite sites.
But did you do that?

451
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:31,220
Honey even makes Amazon
better with Millie and dude.

452
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,580
Fuck Amazon. Who's fucking
cons? Those assholes.

453
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,770
They throw it over the fence.
They consider it delivered.

454
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,760
There is no return address. You never can
figure out who the fuck sent it to you.

455
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,630
It's a fucking nightmare with millions
of sellers on Amazon offering the same

456
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,550
products. How do you know if you're
really getting the best price?

457
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:53,910
How the fuck do you know if it was
delivered? There's no fucking phone call.

458
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,060
You got to bring it back down to a shop
and they're just little little flows.

459
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:01,680
We can tell it was delivered.
We could formed it. Uh,
that's where honey comes in.

460
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,600
What? Cause the fucking
driver said it was confirmed.

461
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,760
Honey automatically goes to wear to work.
Whenever I shop on Amazon,

462
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,070
I ordered this other shit on Amazon.
It's fucking, and I never got it.

463
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,160
I didn't know what the fuck is.
It compares the PR.

464
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,470
This is like the worst
advertising read ever.

465
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,400
It compares the prices of every seller
that carries the item. I want honey,

466
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,630
even factors in shipping,

467
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:28,260
sales tax and Amazon prime status to
make sure I'm getting the lowest price.

468
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:33,480
It shows me the best delivery
time, even if Amazon doesn't. Um,

469
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,300
it's like having my very own personal
shopping assistant. Of course,

470
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:38,610
Amazon does it.
He can't fucking get anybody on the phone.

471
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,420
More than 10 million people
are using honey to save money.

472
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,530
Honey is so has over a hundred
thousand five star reviews on Google.

473
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:50,330
Maybe I need honey, so Amazon
will work better for me. Um,

474
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,350
the five star reviews on the Google
Chrome store at Time magazine says it's

475
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:58,850
basically free money. So the next time
you're in the world's biggest marketplace,

upgrade that makes Amazon better.

479
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:09,630
Bird that's joint honey.com/.
Bar. That's hilarious.

480
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:12,600
I'm making fun of Amazon and
everything that they don't do well,

481
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,700
honey actually fixes it.

482
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:18,420
So in a way I was selling it because God
knows where I'll still gonna use Amazon,

509
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:53,020
this fucking hotel,
I can't figure out.

510
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,200
I can't figure out how to turn on
the fucking heat, you know, but I,

511
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,230
one of the things,

512
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,230
the only thing I hate more than not being
able to turn it on on the fucking heat

513
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,240
is having to call down to the front desk
and then they got to send somebody up.

514
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,480
I just, I, I, I'd rather
sit here and get sick.

515
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,200
There we go. A little bit of
fucking often buck bottled water.

516
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Maybe I can get seltzers on my podcast
to advertise a little fine with see

517
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,650
packet here.
This is how you do with,

518
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,620
hey, did anybody else on Twitter see
that? Hilarious little, I don't know.

519
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,790
Is it a Gif? Is that, is that a picture?
I don't know what the fuck you call it.

520
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,120
You Know Bell Biv devoe somebody made one
that was Belbin and Willem defoe so it

521
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,370
was belt before default.

522
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,160
And that's the kind of shit that's the
kind of shit that I fucking love it.

523
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,180
I love that silly shift.
Um, all right, there we go.

524
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,980
Christ bills, stirring it with
your finger. You're fucking animal.

525
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,410
What is wrong with you? Um, all
right, down the hatch. Here we go.

526
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,030
Um, all right. So anyways, yes,

527
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,170
we ordered room service
as far as I can tell.

528
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:23,280
The top three things on room
service in Germany are, uh,

529
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:27,200
I hamburger diener Schnitzel or spaghetti.

530
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,330
And I actually, when I was in
Munich I got some dean or Schnitzel,

531
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:34,040
which I always thought was
like a fucking hot dog,

532
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,870
but I saw pork cutlet that's breaded.

533
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,980
It was fucking delicious.
Um,

534
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,890
that's what's killing me about being
here in Germany as I haven't had time to

535
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:50,690
get like a proper German meal. Uh,
just been traveling so much and uh,

536
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,300
you know, I, I'm never
going to do ancestry.com,

537
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:57,630
but as far as the names of my family tree,
I know I am mostly German.

538
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,663
MMM.

539
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,840
I love this shit. I was fucking
sausages and fucking beer and all that.

540
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,930
It kills me. I'll tell you the
next time I come here to Germany,

541
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:11,240
which I'm definitely going to do
because it's been so much fun.

542
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,710
I am going to be beyond off the wagon
and I'm trying all these fucking be,

543
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,840
I'm going to book myself
out here in October fest.

544
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,130
I wouldn't buy a little beyond October
fest outfit outfit and I'm going to

545
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:26,560
fucking drink my ass off,
but not on this tour.

546
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,620
Oh, Billy. No Fun. It's coming up on 50
days. It just being a fucking douchebag.

547
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,430
Um, anyways, so let's plow ahead here.

548
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,830
Let's read some of these
fucking thanks for the week. Uh,

549
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,680
just another one about Poland.
All right.

550
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,900
Very excited to go to Poland to very
excited. They've got a bottle, Berlin.

551
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:50,910
All it like all the rest of this tour
is just going to be just a bunch of bar.

552
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:53,970
Yeah.

553
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,320
It's just a bunch of Shit I've never seen.

554
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,470
I would speaking to that guest who
came out to the show last night,

555
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,880
guess who the fuck showed up?
One of my favorite drummers,

556
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:05,190
one of the greatest drummers in the world,
Benny grab

557
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,320
showed up with his lovely girlfriend.
I hate naming names and everything,

558
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:11,960
but everybody knows who the
fuck he has, right? Yeah.

559
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,323
MMM.

560
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,670
He fuck, I couldn't vote. You know,
I, it's just, it's unbelievable. Um,

561
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:23,830
if you're a drummer out there and you
want to see somebody who possesses one of

562
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:25,510
the rare things in drumming,

563
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,900
which is incredible feel passion,

564
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,980
playing from the heart
combined with ridiculous chops.

565
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,910
And the thing that I've found with,

566
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,750
with drumming is when
you get those chops guys,

567
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,320
a lot of times when they play
there between their ears,

568
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,380
like they're in their head and they have
all this really intricate shit but it

569
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,200
disconnected to who they are as a person.

570
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,340
And then if you have like a group player,
you know,

571
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,570
if they go to take a solo,
if they even do, it's uh,

572
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,880
you know, it's still good because it's
still grows, but it's not like the crazy,

573
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:07,840
uh, I dunno, I'm just saying those guys
that have those fucking insane shops,

574
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,450
we would think even buddy
rich will be going like, dude,

575
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:12,760
what the fuck are you
doing there nowadays?

576
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,950
How far drumming has come because
everybody, the Internet's,

577
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
but basically everybody's
watching everybody.

578
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:21,920
Everybody's jamming and
learning from each other. Uh,

579
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,860
it's just so rare to meet a guide that
has his chops and plays the way he does.

580
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:29,870
So he does clinics all
around the world and uh,

581
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,840
he's got some DVDs out there at all and
there's no fucking way that you won't be

582
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,410
tremendously changed for the better if,
if you start watching his videos.

583
00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:43,270
So it's Benny, Benny, Greg, B.
E n n y, g. R, e B I believe.

584
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,690
I'm not sure if this too,
I can't fucking spell anything.

585
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,610
Just check them out if you
can. All right. Anyways,

586
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,630
just another one about Poland.
Uh,

587
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,020
Dear Mc run from the sun.

588
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,780
I like that one.
Uh,

589
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,150
I am honestly thrilled then in a few
days you're going to show up in my not so

590
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:07,710
beautiful city of Warsaw.
Don't tell me that. Well,

591
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,780
I live in a not so beautiful
city of La and I love it.

592
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,390
I like how it's gritty and grimy
and all that Shit, you know? Sorry,

593
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,250
drinking, modified. Ever see

595
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:27,280

It might not so beautiful city of Warsaw,

596
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,550
mainly because I'm selling my house and
you are so white that you're rising the

597
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:37,150
property value whenever you arrive.
Sky's hilarious.

598
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,980
Or Lady, let's be fair. Um,

599
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,320
I don't want to fin shame
anybody or whatever the fuck
you were talking about it.

600
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:49,630
Um, but since you're kind enough to do
one of those pussy ass shows of yours,

602
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,810
you, you are going to
love Poland as Yossef.

603
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,220
Polenski used to say it's a great nation.

604
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,780
Only people are constantly,
Whoa, wait a minute,

605
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,510
dude.
Is everybody is funny as you wouldn't,

606
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:15,050
Poland is just going to be another fucking
country I go to where I'm just like,

607
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:17,360
oh my God, these guys remind
me that people I grew up with,

608
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,310
I felt that an Ireland, I felt it
in Scotland. I felt that in India.

609
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,260
Just that, that busted shops ball
break and fucking thing is Mike.

610
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:30,470
It's my favorite thing in
the world. Um, anyways,

611
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,430
as for the city of Warsaw,
well she's not the prettiest of Gals,

612
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,260
but let's be fair. That bitch, that
bitch went through some shit. Uh,

613
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,810
we are watching American show,

614
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:43,490
so don't worry about making
your pop culture references.

615
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,450
We're currently watching Alf,

616
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,480
and once we figure out why
those jokes are funny, uh,

617
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:53,120
we're gonna move on to Frazier.
Dude,

618
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,460
can you please start doing
standup or something?

619
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,710
This is just all of this has just
written really fucking funny. Uh,

620
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:05,660
you could also consider
renting a helicopter here
since it's much cheaper than

621
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:10,600
the u s although Polish helicopter, it's
just a horse wearing a windmill hat. Ah,

622
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,620
right.
You had one fucking Polish joke day.

623

Best wishes to your family and break
your pasty leg on this tour. Ps,

624
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,300
if you're interested
in Soviet bloc history,

625
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,650
God knows I didn't learn about that when
I was growing up. Then you should check.

626
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,130
Okay.

627

A comedian freeze love.

service in Berlin during the cold.

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,273

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,120
I will definitely check that out and
I'll send out a link to this, uh,

631
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,970
podcast episode here. Um,
Oh, speaking of which,

632
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:49,580
I've been having the best time
with mercy, right? At first. He,

633
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:53,630
the one thing I love about Versie
is [inaudible] is [inaudible] okay?

634
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,020
The way man was going to be
Maddie pullovers these rosy,

635
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:59,450
he's over here wearing his Jordans.
You know,

636
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:04,190
he's got his fucking Nike track suit
on and we were in Cologne, Germany. Uh,

637
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,120
did I tell you this yet?

638
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,840
I've told them on stage so many times we
were walking over this fucking bridge,

639
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:09,674
right?

640
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,260
Okay.

641
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,640
Any Cologne, Germany, as I mentioned,

642
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,710
was one of the most bomb
cities in World War II.

643
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:18,460
So there's not a lot of old stuff
there because it just got destroyed.

644
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,840
But they have this one beautiful church,
right? So we're walking over the bridge.

645
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,460
At first he is going like to
look at that building, man. God,

646
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,770
it's a beautiful building.
It's that building. Beautiful.

647
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,520
And I'm looking at is these cluster of
whatever buildings and in the middle of

648
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:37,120
it is this amazing church.
So I'm looking at the build is going,

649
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,140
what in the fuck is this guy
saying? Like, well, what building?

650
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:41,380
Because that building right there,
look, it's fucking the architecture.

651
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,570
It's beauty. It finally
figured out, I was like, dude,

652
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:45,370
are you talking about the fucking church?

653
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,040
Okay.

654
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,450
And he's like, yeah, that data.
Oh No, I already told this story,

655
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:52,300
told this story on Thursday.
I'm still giving him shit about that.

656
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,600
It's a great building.
Um,

657
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:03,640
all right. Oh, by the way, Versie
Versie two Sicilian in Greek.

658
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:07,960
He loved the vendors that sell too.
And he's actually really enjoying, uh,

659
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,230
Germany too, which made me happy. Cause
sometimes there's Mediterranean guys,

660
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:12,040
you know,

661
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,490
they get all fucking upset about the
food and this is no sunshine and Shit,

662
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:19,030
you know? But he's been having a great
time. All right. Gypsies. Hey there,

663
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:24,010
Billy bloated brotts uh,
I go to Romania.

664
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,330
Oh,
this is what I was talking about.

665
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,760
We're learning that Gypsy
is considered a racial slur.

666
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:29,820
Yeah.

667
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,510
All right. Listen to this
first sentence. He goes,

668
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:36,460
I go to Romania frequently for work and
I'm quite versed in Gypsies and why it

669
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:37,570
is a racial slur.

670
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,080
Okay.

671
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,230
Uh, in order to live about that
was he still used the word gypsy.

672
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,590
That's like if I was in
America being like a,

673
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,490
hey everybody, uh, for when
you traveled to America,

674
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:54,491
I've been to east St Louis and I'm
quite versed and Edwards and why it's a

675
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:58,680
racial slur. Like I wouldn't do that.
That's kind of what he just did there. Uh,

676
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,800
first Rome, Romanians are
Gypsies. Roman people.

677
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:08,090
Romanian people are descendants of Romans.
I didn't know that.

678
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,110
Gypsies are people that came from Egypt.
Uh,

679
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,620
if you want to insult a Romanian
person called them a gypsy,

680
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,020
okay.

681
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,250
Gypsy stick to themselves and rob.
Slash steal from outsiders.

682
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,820
They will fight at the drop of a hat.
I saw two old lady,

683
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:29,110
Gypsies fighting over which corner they
were selling flowers on in the old city

684
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,080
in Bucharest.
I hope this clears it up a little.

685
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,350
Now it that didn't clear anything up.

686
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,313
Um,

687
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,420
now I know that Romanians are Roman
and Gypsies are people are from Egypt.

688
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,320
I do know that.

689
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:49,370
And then you went on to fucking trash him
in a way that I'm sure they were upset

690
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:53,990
about. I Dunno. Jesus Christ. Did I just
get in trouble just by fucking reading it.

691
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,940
So they got a lot of fight
them. All right. What are
you gonna do? I mean, we've,

692
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,830
I've seen these videos of two San people
dressed up like Santa Claus beating the

693
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:07,700
fuck out of each other in
my country. Uh, all right.

694
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:11,390
But I didn't realize that Romanians,
but almost it says Roman in there.

695
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,703
Okay.

696
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,830
Did Not know that. All right. I'll have
to look a lot of that up. Double check,

697
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:21,890
which means I'm not going to do it.
I'll forget about it.

698
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,330
And then the information you just told me,

699
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:25,340
we'll be in my head and one
day I'm going to spew it out,

700
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:29,270
but I'm probably gonna get in trouble. All
right. Recent breakup. Am I the asshole?

701
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,100
Well, firstly, first of all, first dilly.

702
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,820
What two words did I just,
first of all,

703
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,740
it's certainly, I don't know
what the fuck up though. Anyways,

704
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:47,370
my girlfriend of three years
broke up with me over something.

705
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:50,820
Me and my family thinks is stupid.
All right,

706
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:55,560
so right now I'm a little nervous here.
You know if families back in you,

707
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,390
you know,

708
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,840
or you're not one of those fucking young
kids that can do no wrong you anyways.

709
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:05,040
We are both 20 and since last February
we've been so what generation are you,

710
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,360
is that generation z?

711
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,050
We are about 20 and since last February
we've been arguing since we invited her

712
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:18,110
to my birthday dinner and she got upset
because she was expected to pay for her

713
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:22,530
own meal. All right. Who?
Who am I? Who's, who's her?

714
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:27,490
Is that your girlfriend?
Okay.

715
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,870
I didn't tell my parents until months
later because they didn't want to start

716
00:43:31,871 --> 00:43:34,000
anything. Anyway, around early December,

717
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:37,030
my family asked me to invite
her to come up with us too.

718
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,740
My Dad's parents home or the 29th
because that's when we could celebrate

719
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:44,800
Christmas with them. When
I texted her, she said,

720
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,620
am I going to have to pay for my own gas?

721
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,150
I have a s d I don't know what that means,

722
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,730
so I assumed I was missing something.

723
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,140
So I do. Do you have like a
d to the point that you have?

724
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:06,070
Don't have the fucking time to write,
add Reynaga to look up fucking eight ASD,

725
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,780
all saints disease,
a s d

726
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,680
you are not connected to them.
You are not a winner. All right?

727
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:20,290
I don't know what the fuck that is.
I don't give a shit.

728
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:24,700
I'll learn about it later. Um, I have
ASD, so I assumed I was missing something.

729
00:44:24,701 --> 00:44:26,950
So I asked my dad and he said,
of course

730
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,980
she flipped out about it.
I was that Berger's disease.

731
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:38,560
Would that be a B, d or is that
antilock brakes? I don't fucking know.

732
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,550
Uh, that's ABS. She flipped
out about it became,

733
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,970
and it became the new thing we could
argue about her mom and her sister agree

734
00:44:45,971 --> 00:44:50,380
with her that it's Shitty to not pay
for someone's gas when you invite them

735
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,460
someplace. But my dad's parents
didn't pay for our guests.

736
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:55,940
Okay.

737
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,760
But no one we know asked for that.

738
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,930
And all of our family members,
we invite to be day dinners.

739
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:04,850
Never complained about
paying their own bill.

740
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,700
Should I put pun not intended?
I'd appreciate your advice, sir.

741
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,600
And I'm a big fan. You seem pretty
good with your response in most cases.

742
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,980
I should note that after
breaking up with me on New Year's

743
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,260
despite, all right. That's how we ended
it. I don't understand what's going on.

744
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:29,010
And you guys sound like a bunch of cheap
fucking assholes, green, honest with you.

745
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,130
If you take somebody out
for their fucking birthday,

746
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:36,270
you make them pay for their birthday
dinner. That's fucking terrible.

747
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,690
It's so terrible. It's
like, it's hilarious.

748
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,860
And I'm sorry she didn't give
a fuck about paying for gas.

749
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,810
She's probably alluding to the fact.
Did you,

750
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:51,470
did you wait or pay for her own fucking
birthday? That's fucking hilarious.

751
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:53,563
Okay.

752
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,110
Dan, in a lot of ways is Sanger did
going out to dinner by yourself for your

753
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:00,630
birthday,
cause at least nobody there.

754
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:02,640
It's a restaurant knows
that your birthday now,

755
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:05,760
you sitting there with a table full of
people that know it's your birthday and

756
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:08,850
now you got to kick in. Wow, man. Yeah.

757
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:12,390
I should probably stop short of calling
you and your whole family a bunch of

758
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:16,230
cheap fucks. But let's just say you're
a little rough around the edges. Uh,

759
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:17,980
okay.

760
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,620
But whatever.
That's water under the bridge.

761
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,120
I guess you need to find your soul mate.

762
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,700
The kind of woman that doesn't mind
paying for own birthday dinner. We don't,

763
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,470
maybe you're a feminist,
you know,

764
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,150
cause most guys who we pay for
our own shit on our birthdays,

765
00:46:33,151 --> 00:46:37,020
we have to go out and go buy the big
fucking fancy gift on Valentine's Day.

766
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,250
I Dunno, I can't figure that one out. And
the fact that you stopped mid sentence,

767
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:46,050
like she fucking showed up your place
and club you to death and then hit send.

768
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,190
So the forensics couldn't figure
out what time you died. Well,

769
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:55,140
he did send it email. Alright.
Lesbian dating with no spark.

770
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,470
All right,
well whatever the fuck you're dating,

771
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:02,410
if there's no spark and out of it, uh, he
built, I was wondering if you wouldn't,

772
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:05,040
dia could give me some dating
advice to a lady listener. Well,

773
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:06,570
unfortunately he is not here,

774
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,000
so you're going to have to deal with
my dumb fucking ideas. Uh, I've been,

775
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,060
I've got out odd seven really good
dates with a wonderful woman who was

776
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:22,110
essentially everything I've ever looked
for in a partner. She's Hilarious,

777
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,240
witty, playful, beautiful,

778
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:29,080
smart and motivated and
good, kindhearted person. Um,

779
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:34,030
are you fucking my wife? Sorry.
Uh, the way we have ridiculous,

780
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:37,150
Witty Banter reminds me of how you
are near or on the podcast. Well,

781
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:39,370
that's what reminded me when you said it.
Uh,

782
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,080
it turns out we even want all the same
things in life in terms of a long term

783
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,120
relationship for how does this go left?

784
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,780
Did you finally get her naked and
she had a dick? I mean, what is,

785
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:52,210
what is going on here?
Uh, wanting a family,

786
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:57,030
living close to parents and siblings
in the same area we grew up. However,

787
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:00,880
the past few days she's grown
a little distant. Uh, Jesus.

788
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,550
Yeah.

789
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,690
When I asked her why,

790
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,530
she explained that although she really
enjoys spending time with me and that

791
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:12,420
I've done nothing wrong, she's never felt
strong, passionate feelings toward me.

792
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,200
Uh, okay. This is how you got to
walk somebody through their feelings.

793
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,120
I'll go ahead.
This is never fun.

794
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,780
I responded honestly that
I have not necessarily felt
that huge passenger spark.

795
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,650
Oh, wait a minute. I read it right.

796
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:29,883
Oh,

797
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,470
she said she never felt strong,
passionate feelings toward me.

798
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,740
Oh, I thought you meant
she's never felt that before.

799
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:39,960
And she was scared that she loves you.
So she's saying like,

800
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:41,280
you're cool but I'm not failing.

801
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,040
I responded honestly that I have not
necessarily Sara's Sara Lee felt that huge

802
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:50,010
pastoring spark with her
eating well congratulations.

803
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:54,570
What you guys have on your hands
is, is your your fuck buddies? Okay.

804
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,600
And now when you're in an area of limbo
and we don't really know where to go

805
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:00,534
from here,

806
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:05,640
I think it's clear that we are attracted
to each other and very compatible,

807
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,840
but there is a lack of clear
chemistry between us. Uh,

808
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,860
she has an a celebrated online
class for the next two weeks.

809
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:18,690
So we decided to cool things down and
meet again after that is finished.

810
00:49:18,691 --> 00:49:21,330
I think that's very wise.
My question is,

811
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,240
if you consider an emotional,

812
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:29,930
passionate drive necessarily necessary
for two people to beat together

813
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:34,470
successfully long term and
how it was with you when Nia,

814
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:39,850
I am personally a believer in longterm
love growing over time and that put

815
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,880
passionate love and my
experience generally follows
the Newtonian rule of what

816
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:51,660
comes up must always come down.
Lovely wishes to you,

817
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,470
Nia and the your little one
and go fuck yourself. Um,

818
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,480
I think that the fact that you guys both
had that really mature conversation,

819
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:05,680
neither one of you is feeling
a spark. It's just like,
you know, in the beginning,

820
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,480
if there's the spark,
there's that,

821
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:12,340
that's that euphoria that you kind of
chase for the rest of your relationship

822
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:16,960
because you know, you just get
used to each other. And then

823
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,170
when the love comes out,

824
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:25,171
it's usually if vacation holiday or if
you've been through something together

825
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:29,150
and you survived it,
it brings you closer together.

826
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,070
And then you have like these memories.

827
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,983
MMM.

828
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,740
You know, like I've gone
through rough periods, you know,

829
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:42,550
with my wife and like having a kid
just upsets the whole apple cart.

830
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,470
And,
uh,

831
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:49,000
you're focusing so much on the kid that
you can kind of like forget to check in

832
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:51,910
with each other and um,

833
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,390
okay.

834
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:53,721
You know,

835
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:56,630
so what I've learned with her as we
have to take like these little weekend

836
00:50:56,631 --> 00:51:01,400
vacations, you know, in town, just
go to a hotel and it's hilarious.

837
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,740
And then we are instantly
fall back in love again.

838
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,160
And then spent the rest of the time
looking at pictures of our daughter,

839
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,680
seeing how we miss her and stuff.
So um,

840
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,540
I dunno,
I think because you guys have,

841
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,490
you guys seem like you should
be really good friends,

842
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,270
but the weirdest thing is you
already bagged or whatever.

843
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,910
So I don't know how that
works in the lesbian world,

844
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,190
but I know in the a Hetero
world that can get weird

845
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,360
and it's kind of 50, 50,
sometimes the guy gets weird,

846
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:38,990
sometimes the woman gets weird.
It's just kind of weird. So I dunno.

847
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,450
I think it's probably a good thing that
you guys aren't going to see each other

848
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:44,960
for a couple of weeks and he
can kind of be like, you know,

849
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,870
cause it's early on. Just see where the
fuck you are after two weeks. But, um,

850
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,010
I dunno,
I think you're doing it right.

851
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,770
Like I don't want to think
about that shit, you know,

852
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,040
which is why he probably
asked me to chime in too.

853
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,471
To be honest with you.

854
00:52:05,471 --> 00:52:10,330
The only way that it's
going to fuck at work is a

855
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,283
yeah.

856
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:12,691
Is it,

857
00:52:12,691 --> 00:52:15,990
you do have that spark in the beginning
because that sparks is what's gonna make

858
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:16,824
you stay.

859
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,860
Cause if you don't have that spark and
he'd get married for the fucking reasons

860
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:22,620
or whatever, that it's just
like, you know, you see it,

861
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:24,960
people marry for money and they're
sitting on a fucking yacht and they're

862
00:52:24,961 --> 00:52:29,670
miserable. Uh, all right. Grown
man's sitting while piercing.

863
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:33,840
Oh Jesus Christ. It's one of the
worst images I've ever heard.

864
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,440
Dear old Billy blue hills.
Um,

865
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:41,460
I'm a 40 year old man
with three young children.

866
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,990
I realized the other day that over the
past couple of years I've been sitting

867
00:52:45,991 --> 00:52:50,991
down when I piss more off the they're
not all right now this is funny cause if

868
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:54,060
you're doing it because you're tired,
it's just fucking hilarious.

869
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,500
I was worried that you were going to,

870
00:52:55,501 --> 00:52:59,820
this is going to be some other
progressive thing that, you know,

871
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,950
standing, Piss, privileged, whatever the
fuck they going to come up with next. Um,

872
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,410
it all started when the kids were babies.

873
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,250
My wife would wake up to feed and I would
head down to the kid like a Zombie to

874
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:14,850
piss and I was too damn tired.
Just standard AME.

875
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:19,170
Now the kids are a little older and I'm
still fucking exhausted most of the time

876
00:53:19,171 --> 00:53:22,680
at home that I find myself
sitting down to piss all the time.

877
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,020
I think I'm just tired as fuck.

878
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,950
Am I crazy to assume this is common
among thing among men my age with young

879
00:53:29,951 --> 00:53:34,660
children now that you are 50, do you do
the same? I can't be the only one. Right.

880
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,540
Thanks. Love the podcast and go
fuck yourself. No, I don't do that.

881
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,000
The only time I ever do that is if,

882
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,270
okay.

883
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:44,870
My wife's sleeping and when we
lived in smaller apartments,

884
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,180
I didn't want to wake her up. When I
was taking a piss out of consideration,

885
00:53:50,181 --> 00:53:53,450
I would sit down and that
would always make me laugh.

886
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,620
And I would always picture
all of my friends making
fun of me that I was sitting

887
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:00,200
down. Well, well, uh,

888
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,010
I think the fact that you still
say pissing rather than paying,

889
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,610
which is one of my major pet peeves,
uh,

890
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,030
I can meet with a guy says
I have to go pee. It's just,

891
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:15,950
I can't even tell you my body like
microscopic leap, like could torts.

892
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,083
MMM.

893
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,840
Oh by the way, somebody told
me it's anyway and not anyways.

894
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,530
And I have to tell you, I don't
give a shit. I like say it anyways.

895
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,530
I say it in a plural sense.

896
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:30,873
MMM.

897
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,140
No,
you probably not the only one who does it.

898
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,993
Uh,

899
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,940
but I will tell you that.

900
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,590
Okay.

901
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:44,850
What I have learned just having one
kid is how important it is to get eight

902
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:46,350
hours of really good sleep.

903
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,890
And you should watch TV and
be on your fucking phone.

904
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:53,820
I've actually gone back to reading. If you
consider reading sports books, reading,

905
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:55,830
I try to read,
but my wife,

906
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:00,860
she always watches the fucking real
housewives or that tattoo parlor show it,

907
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,480
you know,
any show that involves people.

908
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:06,270
She doesn't care about screaming
at each other for some reason.

909
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:09,660
She loves to watch that
before she goes to bed. Um,

910
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:16,020
so I just put on these, the fucking same
headphones I wear when I fly in a plane,

911
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,310
so I can't hear people and I
just read the fucking book.

912
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:21,933
Uh,

913
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,500
but anyways, I think maybe if you
get eight hours sleep, you know,

914
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,620
you hit the gym a little
bit if you have time. But I,

915
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:30,260
I know how tired I am with one kid.

916
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:35,261
I can't imagine with like three at a
good friend of my life told me one time

917
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,800
when he was talking about being a parent.
His kids are older,

918
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:45,100
he's got like two or three kids
and three kids and he said,

919
00:55:45,231 --> 00:55:49,280
uh, he goes, dude, he goes,
I've been tired since the 90s.

920
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,340
So I think that's just what it is.

921
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,413
Uh,

922
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,070
that's just what it is.
And you know what it is.

923
00:56:00,071 --> 00:56:02,620
Cause once you kids get older and they
can kind of take care of themselves,

924
00:56:02,621 --> 00:56:05,980
meaning they can wake up, brush their
teeth, get ready for school at all,

925
00:56:05,981 --> 00:56:09,700
that you feel like you're
not going to be tired.

926
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,350
But I think the thing that makes you
tired is the worry because you constantly

927
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:18,340
fucking worried that something's going
to happen to him. But whatever. Um,

928
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,390
all right, that's the podcast. Apologize
for the low volume of talking here.

929
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,270
I really want to thank everybody that's
come out to my shows here in Germany.

930
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:29,920
I could not have had a better
time. Uh, it was fucking awesome.

931
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,030
And uh, I will definitely be back the next
time. Hopefully when I get a new hour,

932
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,330
you guys still want to come to see me?
I will definitely be back.

933
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:41,080
I think I'll come during the summer
months, next time or October fest.

934
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,720
One or the other.
All right.

935
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,290
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
