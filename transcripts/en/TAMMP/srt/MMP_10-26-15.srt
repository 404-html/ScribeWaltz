1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,330
Hey, what's going on? It's Phil Burn.

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:07,290
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, October 26,

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:09,540
2015 what's going on?

4
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:14,010
How is everything good with you?
Did she have a good weekend?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,270
Oh God bless you God. Play everything.
Go with the family. All got pleasure.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,790
Um,
I am in beautiful downtown Detroit,

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,890
Michigan.
Um,

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,880
I know some of you probably laughed cause
you fear all that fucking shit about

9
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:33,810
Detroit. All Times fucking
cities. Awesome. Um, can be scary.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,681
I'm not going to lie to you,

11
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:38,670
but every time I come here it
gets a little bit better. And um,

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,300
you know, it's kind of a fucking
exciting thing. You know,

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,730
it's one of our great cities here,
sits there right by the lake, right?

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,360
Lake Erie,
you know,

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,560
beautiful Goddamn city.
You know,

16
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:59,520
I like when you go through Detroit is
you always see a bunch of Cadillacs,

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
Buicks. Even though those
fucking cops left this place.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,470
I swear to God, man, you know, I don't
know who's at fault for that shit.

19
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:13,820
If it really is just a corporate greed
or if the unions became just such

20
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,590
constant was it was cheaper.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,710
I always go with the corporate guys
being assholes because you know,

22
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,250
basically if you didn't have the unions,

23
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:26,900
we'd have sweatshop labor in this
country. Right? So then they just went on,

24
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:28,740
but then the unions became,
oh my God,

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,370
the unions have horrible reputation,
which is well earned, isn't it?

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,100
Oh, it always starts out with a good
idea, does it, you know, some theaters,

27
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,600
I go to a union,
some art,

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,430
and sometimes the unions are cool
and sometimes they're not. You know,

29
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,820
fucking guy's just sitting there on
a chair, you know? It's like, dude,

30
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,370
why would you do that?
Just go on the back and play cards.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,430
I'm sitting there looking,
knowing that I'm fucking paying you.

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,190
You're not doing anything.
I Dunno. Look at me.

33
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,770
I'm all over the map right now.
Anyways,

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,100
that's one of the worst fucking
things we ever did was a,

35
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,940
I dunno, we allowed all of that
fucking industry to lead this country.

36
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:17,170
So fucking stupid. We should still
be here making those cars right.

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,310
And you can feel good about it.

38
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,990
You know what I saw more goddamn Buick
Regal [inaudible] he brought that car

39
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:27,400
back, you know, and it
looks fucking cool, right?

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,380
Bewkes always had cool front
grills, but you, yeah. You know,

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,230
just grossly under powered.
That'd be a great car to fucking to Redo.

42
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,390
Just pull the whole fucking drive,

43
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,640
train out and put a new
suspension and it just, you know,

44
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,840
have you self a fucking sweat.
Right.

45
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,940
Keep those granny looking
fucking tires and rims. Um,

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,970
just like that.
What's that movie?

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,290
What's that movie Ryan Gosling was in
and he would pause 30 seconds to deliver

48
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,890
his line. He had that, that Mona Lisa
smile he always has. It was at Mona Lisa.

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,630
It's much soda regard. Right?

50
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,910
I always started ricotta cheese.
I guess we got,

51
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,430
I'm learning all this shift from fucking
Versie and Joe Barnick that to half

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Italian set or on the fucking
bus listening to Italians
talking about food is

53
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,060
the one of the funniest
fucking things ever.

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,740
But then after about like 15 minutes,
they, it's as annoying is, listen to this.

55
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:27,730
Somebody who's talking about their
kid that you don't give a fuck about.

56
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,420
You know what I mean? Like, oh, you
can't believe so then little joke,

57
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,380
he came in raw 80 Edital slippers on.

58
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,460
He was so cute. And I said,
Joey t know what time it is?

59
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,500
A said it was 14 o'clock.
Hey, isn't that funny?

60
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,040
That doesn't exist.
You just got to sit there and be like,

61
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,920
I don't give a shit about that
little snot nose kid. Right.

62
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,760
Then you get fucking Barnick and Barney.
Conversely,

63
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:59,350
when we were in Pittsburgh
and we played Heinz Hall, um,

64
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,800
they went to some fucking Italian Deli
in the morning and came back with all

65
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:07,360
these cheeses and uh, they
came back with this, uh,

66
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,070
was a Kappa Cold Capicola Aka Gaba,
Google,

67
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,420
which was fucking unreal. I guess it
comes from the, the neck of the pig.

68
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,320
You would think that would be any good.
They came back with spicy gobble,

69
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:23,350
Google the,
and um,

70
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,930
it was finished. It was fucking
amazing. But they wouldn't shut up.

71
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,480
I guess it comes from the shoulder
and the neck, I should say.

72
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,730
They wouldn't shut up about it.
They're going to bill.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,260
And then the core Dan Oho section,
it was just cheeses.

74
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,030
They pull whole load,
Mozzarella,

75
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,300
a Vogel fucking go and on and on at k
and then we're standing in and then Joe,

76
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,770
I pull out this piece of bread bill and
I handed to Joe and he squeezes it and

77
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:00,550
it, he nodded at me, dude. It
was like a mafia hit man. Talent.

78
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,860
Somebody was going to get whacked. All
right, and then you think it's over.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And then we go over the US and
they had all these all in day,

80
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:14,281
it's spicy olives they had
all is with garlic in it.

81
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,790
And I was like, I'm getting the
spicy one and a Joe's like, oh,

82
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,730
I'm getting the fucking garlic

83
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,520
and then and all these, why'd you like,
all right, I get it. Jesus Christ.

84
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,700
Fucking get it. I see it.
It's right here. Try that.

85
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,580
Try it to try it. Sharp
provolone. Go ahead and take
a piece of that and I'm not,

86
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,780
I'll put it on a bread, put it on the
bread, pull little Gabo go one day

87
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,690
I'm fucking around it.
It's actually hilarious.

88
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,490
But they just wouldn't
shut up about the place.

89
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:52,030
And the food was unbelievably
delicious. That fucking great. Okay.

90
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:55,000
But you can understand, I'm German, Irish.
All right. We just put shit in a pot.

91
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:59,830
You boil it and then you
think about either or, uh,
eliminating a race of people.

92
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,450
That's, that's, that's the family
tree that I come from. Right?

93
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,920
There's nothing about food.

94
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,443
MMM.

95
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,770
It's probably just all jealousy, man.
The fucking food was unreal. You know,

96
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:13,220
it was funny.

97
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,600
Versing made me a plate or on the bus
ride and he makes me a plate and I can

98
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:21,430
tell he's got his back to me and I can
tell just the way he's laying it out.

99
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:26,170
He's so fucking excited. He wants me
to love it as much as he loves it.

100
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:29,470
Right? So I fucking,
uh, I, he gives to me,

101
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:31,300
I started eating and
it's fucking delicious.

102
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,170
And I didn't realize he's waiting for me
to say it's delicious cause I'm so busy

103
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,630
eating because it's delicious.
And then he just sort of like,

104
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,330
just was looking at me. He goes,
how is it to cook? And I just,

105
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,070
I spit, take bursted out,
fucking laughing. It's like,
yeah, dude, it's delicious.

106
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,900
He was like, I could good.
Like he was almost like,

107
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,203
I don't know

108
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,930
why do it? Why don't we Italians give
a fuck that much about food and every,

109
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,680
everybody else doesn't.
They pretend to nobody gives a fuck.

110
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,020
Okay.

111
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,080
That's why they, food is so fucking, I
believe it's the best food on the planet,

112
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,490
you know? Fucking it. Yeah. I,

113
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,960
you start to make a meal and it's an
Italian person in the fucking room.

114
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,660
If you start fucking it up,
they'll get emotional. Like, oh no,

115
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:19,930
what do what you did? No, no.
You want to put the fucking here,

116
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:24,070
but go was your job to do a uni? He
just like, don't just, you just do it.

117
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,600
You just get over here.
You know what I mean?

118
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,500
It'd be like if I started playing
drums in a black guy, walked in a big,

119
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,940
all right, do it hit here's a
statute. You just do it. You just,

120
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,220
I don't know why you're just better.

121
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,260
So anyways, I never heard a
capicola before. You know,

122
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,300
I heard a cabbage,
you know,

123
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,350
bratwursts and sausages and all of that
fucking shit. You know, it's funny.

124
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,420
As much as I love Italian food,
I would love to,

125
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:55,870
I'd love some fucking some
German food right now.

126
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,130
So krauts fucking giant God beer Stein
dress like I'm going to walk out of a

127
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:04,720
cuckoo clock. You know what I mean?
You would think about Germany is,

128
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:07,030
is we're never going to shake
off that world war two shit.

129
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,200
We're just never going to do it. You know
what I mean? We went too hard. You know,

130
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,960
it's over how you, there's no way.
There's certain things that you do.

131
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,110
There's no comeback from, I don't
give a fuck how good a car you make.

132
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,200
You know what I mean?
I don't give a shit how good your beer is.

133
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:23,410
I don't give a fuck how good the
watches you make. You know what I mean?

134
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,750
Okay.

135
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,520
You pick one wrong guy

136
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,640
and he ruins it then just fucking real.
How fucking long, you know what I mean?

137
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,360
What about Attila the Hun? Where
was he from? That's what happened.

138
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,460
He was from some fucking, I dunno.
Empire, right? Who was that guy from?

139
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:48,140
Was He from Jersey? Let me look at this
guy. Who was the guy that the fucking guy,

140
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,910
the impaler. Vlad Vladimir. The impaler.
What the fuck was that maniac from?

141
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:53,744
You don't know.

142
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,370
Or wherever the fuck he's from doesn't
exist anymore so people can move on flat

143
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,980
and mayor, the impaler saw that
the who they based like Dracula od.

144
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,790
Where is the battle? Vladimir.
The impaler. Here we go.

145
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,330
Okay.

146
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,660
Oh Jesus Christ. I gotta
tell you something right now.
This fucker Detroit. Why?

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,650
But believe something to be desired.
You know what is exciting about fucking?

148
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,530
Yeah. It's not going to come up. Let's do
one. That stupid pinwheel speeding. We,

149
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,340
Tony Brown

150
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,120
given me no internet.

151
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:34,550
You fucking try to read about the dude.

152
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:38,730
She was stuck. Would [inaudible]
got no. All right. Vladimir,

153
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:43,080
the impaler was a member
of the House of Dracula,

154
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:46,980
lest some shit. Yeah, this is all. Do
they base track it? Where was he from?

155
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,650
Okay.

156
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,690
What street?
What country was this guy from?

157
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,210
Transylvanian noble woman.
That was his wife

158
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,210
House. House of Jackie. The father.
I don't give a shit about his dad.

159
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,044
Where they from?

160
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,680
Yeah.

161
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,650
Bluster. Vladimir. They have
a fucking bus to this guy.

162
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,650
Okay.

163
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,320
You know what I mean? You go to Germany,
they don't have a bus to Hitler. Do they

164
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,400
buy all damage down out.

165
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,130
Don't bust a move.
Right.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,890
Fucking have a little hologram.
A fucking Caitlin doing the running man.

167
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,020
You know the thing about it is,
is every other cunt, you know,

168
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:34,540
wherever the fuck they are from,
it doesn't exist anymore.

169
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,600
Okay.

170
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,980
Book imprisonment and hungry.
All right, so there's a country.

171
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:41,590
Okay.

172
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,200
They put that guy in jail.
They didn't fucking impale him.

173
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,010
Did you ever hear about like
in PA I didn't pay it. I'm
not going to go through.

174
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:51,530
I'll go through a really quickly.
They basically split you up your backside.

175
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,940
Alright.
Grease up a fucking stake.

176
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,660
Yeah.

177
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,660
And basically use your body weight
to have it go in through the outdoor.

178
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,770
Sometimes it pay,
eventually your body weight,

179
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:08,000
their pairs that shoot through your gut.

180
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,700
Sometimes it would come all the way
up to the person's fucking mouth.

181
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,700
Take like fucking, I dunno, 12
hours to days to die that way.

182
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,170
And he used to do it all fucking time.

183
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:21,230
He had like a whole fucking field of
people there and he'd be sitting there

184
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:25,390
eating some Gaba. Google with
the vogue in gs and Musu rep. Um,

185
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,760
no one knows where he is. Where's
he from? Romania. You know,

186
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:33,170
they were able to shake it off.
Can you say, Hey, oh, I'm Romanian.

187
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:33,650
What did they think?

188
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,780
They think you're a gypsy stealing a
fucking wallet in fucking Rome. That's,

189
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,890
that's all they think. You know
what I mean? You say you're German.

190
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,950
Do they think about the bear?
They think about the cars? No.

191
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,130
So he's like, what do you a Nazi?
Uh, no I'm not. I'm not, I'm a drunk.

192
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,880
I don't know how to make a car
anyways.

193
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,910
I don't know what I'm talking about
here. Um, let's get back to Detroit.

194
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,360
So I guess the owner of
the Cavaliers Isam, shit,

195
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,820
I probably should have got the guy's
fucking name he bought like fucking, like,

196
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:09,030
since like 70 buildings out here and
he's giving major companies breaks,

197
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,100
um, to come in here. I guess
Google has some offices,

198
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,880
Twitter or something like that and it's
starting to build back up again now

199
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:20,970
whether he did it for
financial reasons or one,

200
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:24,540
it's the most patriotic thing that's been
going on here in a long fucking time.

201
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,730
And um, and other cool things. When
I went to Cleveland, Cleveland,

202
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:32,010
like every time I go there,
every two years it looks,

203
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,880
it's making a major comeback.
I was joking when I was on stage,

204
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:40,500
they had like flowers going right down
the center of the road and one of the

205
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,800
roads that was unheard of 10 fucking
years ago when I was out there,

206
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,730
I told you I used to get an escort
from the fuck and I don't meet a hula.

207
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,930
I had like a cop have to walk me over at
the end of the night from the club over

208
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:57,970
to the hotel to make sure I wouldn't
get jumped. And hilarity was the only a,

209
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,670
I was the only,
you know,

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,460
only show in town right there and
now that whole fucking street,

211
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:07,050
it looks like the Vegas Strip.
And I'm telling you,

212
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,760
everybody out there,
if you make it some money,

213
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:11,670
don't sleep on the so called rust belt.
It's coming back.

214
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,130
You could make you fortune there.

215
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,953
MMM.

216
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,410
It'd be cool if there was a way to
fucking do it and not displace the people

217
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:22,420
that already lived there.
You know,

218
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,750
if he could somehow by a fucking building,

219
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,200
fixed the fucking thing up and then
help out the people that were in it.

220
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:32,590
But it never works out that way. It does
it, it's gotta be a way to do it. Right.

221
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,040
If you're dead it yet, it
ended up on Oprah. Right.

222
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,490
And she'd say your name.

223
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,263
Uh,

224
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,890
I don't even want, I'm talking about here.
So we've been rolling through here. Um,

225
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,960
I am on a fucking bender. Alright.
I every fucking show I go,

226
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:55,410
I'm not drinking afterwards.
And um,

227
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,420
and then it just happened to me. I'm
just, I have to break this fucking habit.

228
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,000
It's heavy.
You know what I got into on this trip,

229
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:06,610
I got into light beer from mill.
I was never a Miller lite guy.

230
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,560
It fucking hated it.

231
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,430
But they brought back the old school
bottles that they used to have those short

232
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:14,760
squat ones. And when I was coming
back from the Notre Dame game,

233
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:17,850
we had them in this fucking ice
chest and they was so god damn cold,

234
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,740
so fucking delicious. It just turned
something on. Now I'm like craving it.

235
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:24,570
Last night I was just like,
all right guys,

236
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,110
I just want to go home and I'm fucking
right outside the Fox theater by the way,

237
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,860
which is one of the top three theaters
I think I've ever played in my life.

238
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,073
Um,

239
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,470
I probably say Carnegie Hall,
Chicago Theater,

240
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,430
and the Fox Theater in Detroit. Uh,
but the tabernacle and Atlanta is cool.

241
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,300
There's so many cool ones. But
this one was, um, you know,

242
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:47,860
we got to the show a little bit late,

243
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,200
so I didn't have time to go out and like
look at it before the crowd came in.

244
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:54,920
But when I came walking out with the
lights down was reminded me of like Royal

245
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,600
Albert halls, like fucking gigantic. It's
one of the biggest places I ever played.

246
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,770
And, uh, the crowd was amazing
and afterwards we embark nick,

247
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,500
we're hanging out in the lobby part in
excel and a CD and I was taking some

248
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,950
pictures and shit talking to
the people down there. And um,

249
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,510
so, you know, we were all talking
about how we're going to be good boys.

250
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:17,350
We're not going to go out and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. Then, you know,

251
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,910
I get very easy, low key starts fucking
laughing and next thing you know,

252
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:25,130
you know bad around the place.

253
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,310
They had a place to get tacos and they
had another place to get fucking, uh,

254
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,530
drinks and shit. But I was like, no,
no, no man, let's get in the car.

255
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:36,440
Let's just go back to the fucking hotel.
All right. They a little hotel bar.

256
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:37,610
They ever get one quick one,

257
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,180
we'll watch the end of the panthers
fucking eagles game. We'll go to bed,

258
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:44,300
we'll call it a night. He said, then
we show up, we sit down at the bar,

259
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:49,250
there's some guys sitting there and it
looks like he just sat down in a four top,

260
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:53,870
just left at the bar. Um, and I found
out all of the drinks was hit were his,

261
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:58,820
and he was a chef and he was trying every
drink that this place had was sampling

262
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:01,700
them or something. This guy
Manny. So next thing you know,

263
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:05,870
we start doing what he's doing
and uh, Eh, it was stupid.

264
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,950
I just remember verse, he would, you
know, you don't mix liquor, right?

265
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,100
And we're doing it just because we'll
laugh and cause we know it's stupid.

266
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,750
And I remember we'd drag this fucking,

267
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,870
it's coffee flavored Tequila and as
versus bringing it up to his lips,

268
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:23,900
he goes off, I'm definitely puke it
tonight. And then he just throws it down.

269
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,400
So the weird thing was I was so many
different kinds of liquors in me head,

270
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:35,180
a Moscow mule.
I had some patrol,

271
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,240
I had some like this fucking that coffee
flavor patroned I had one light beer

272
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:45,260
from Miller then add this other shit that
had like an orange in it with bourbon

273
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,094
in it.

274
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,020
And the funny thing was is I didn't even
feel drunk and I'm going to VRC like,

275
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:53,570
I think this shit's water down.
He goes, yeah, it's a good point.

276
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:54,800
I don't really feel drunk either.

277
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,020
And then I went upstairs
and got on facetime and I
got into a big fight with my

278
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:04,070
wife and I woke up this morning and I
was like, yeah, I guess that was drunk.

279
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,870
I was just being mean for no reason. And
I'm not a mean drunk, I'm a happy drunk.

280
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:13,480
But when you fucking, you know, cross
pollinate and all of those things, I was,

281
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,940
I was, I wasn't mean. I was, I was surly.
She was like, you, you went drinking.

282
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:22,070
I was like, no, it's painted
asshole. You know, it's funny,

283
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,300
she's such a sweetheart.

284
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:27,950
She hung up on me and she apologized
to me so I got to wait til she wakes up

285
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,720
cause I'm still on east coast
time and I'm going to fuck,

286
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm going to apologize to her.
I'm sorry honey. I'm sorry.

287
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,910
So sorry that I drank 50 different kinds
of booze and then I called you and I

288
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,420
was a red cunt.

289
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,010
Can you ever forgive me lady?
Um,

290
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,020

291
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,630

from that tour that I did up the

292
00:17:56,631 --> 00:18:01,190
northwest, the tour where I got the
inner tube standing in the dry river bed.

293
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:05,330
That one. Um, they will go on sale
tomorrow morning. That's Tuesday morning,

294
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,540
October 27th,

295
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,570
2015 cause God knows you
might be listening to this
five years into the future.

296
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:17,780
How's California doing?
Person in 2020 is it still exist?

297
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,020
All right. Very limited
northwest posters less than 50.

298
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,530
Also there will be 75 Bible
belt posters available.

299
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:27,650
They're all autographed and um,

300
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,720
you can get them a off of the merge page
on [inaudible] dot com. All right. Now

301
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,500
what did I want to do here?
There was something I was going for.

302
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,700
Well that's right. I got to read a little
bit of advertising here. Yeah. All right.

303
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,490
Oh, okay. Here we go. We're
starting right out of the gate.

304
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,950
Oh.

305
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:50,540
Bodo boat boat me ids beyond
these GI got switched up there.

306
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:54,710
They're fucking soft as felts. Boo
Doo doot, doot me undies, v and D,

307
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,100
put them on with a belt and walk around
like you're superhero and get fucking

308
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:02,810
arrested for taking out your deck.

309
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,340
But your boss will feel nice and good
when you sitting in that holding cell next

310
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:12,310
to a rapist. Get yourself some
soft underwears me undies.

311
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,400
We all know how sexy confidence can be.
I don't know what it is.

312
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,060
And that confidence comes
from being comfortable.

313
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,990
You can't be comfortable when your balls
are for rubbing up against some sand

314
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:24,824
paper there.

315
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,420
But how great can you feel if your own
words wrinkling and riding up me undies

316
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:28,821
gets it.

317
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:32,210
And that's why they've created the
world's most comfortable underwear for a

318
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:36,290
daily dose of confidence.
A dose of confidence stowed.

319
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:40,250
It's up against your balls all day.
That's a heaping helping of confidence.

320
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,380
You can be walking around like that guy.

321
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,910
Remember that guy that you know they
were singing the whistle and song, right?

322
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,380
Dad, Dad, dad at at, at, at
data. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

323
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,380
I remember the Guy Cause
he's Dick finally worked.

324
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,091
And then you know what's funny?

325
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:59,180
I ended up seeing the guy who made
that product on American greed.

326
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,450
It never worked,
but me undies works and so does the copy,

327
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,300
so I'm going to keep reading it.
You wear underwear every day.

328
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,710
You need to be extraordinary without
an insane price tag beyond these

329
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:12,710
understands this and that's why they've
created the world's most comfortable

330
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,250
underwear. Luxury at half the
retail price you find anywhere else.

331
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,300
When you look good, you feel great. It's
a cliche because it's true. God dammit we,

332
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,180
Andy's understands this and that's why
they designed underwear that makes you

333
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:26,450
look and feel fantastic.
All right?

334
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,370
Yeah.

335
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:33,370
Beyond these is made from modal bowed
out a fabric for the life of me.

336
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:37,220
I don't know why you go. It's pronounced
and you're right. It all in lowercase

337
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,300
either the front or the second
first syllabo. Second syllable is,

338
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:48,250
is accented.
Can you help me out here model?

339
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,333
All right.

340
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,570
Mandy just made from model or medallion
promote Al got to go to booze.

341
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,930
A fabric that's twice as soft,
softest cotton.

342
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,440
That's twice as soft as whatever
underwear you're wearing right now.

343
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,680
Unless she got on a pier me undies

344
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,480

346
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:14,980
design every month. Um, I wear
whatever free period they give me.

347
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,510
My balls have never complained.

348
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,410
My balls never shut the fuck up before
I got this underwear. Now they're happy,

349
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:22,600
his health, you know, it's
like shutting up. You'll lady.

shipping sucks. So me, and he says,

351
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:28,270

All orders in the U S and Canada
shipped for free me. And he says,

360
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,080
Trunk Club Shock.
It's too many hard consonants here.

361
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,230
Trunk Club shopping is awful.

362
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,190
Who has the patience for crowded stores
or the time to try on 10 pairs of pants

363
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,540
that don't even fit? Well, you know,

364
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,500
standing behind some do with that really
wide pants and are unbelievably flat

365
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,040
ass. You know what I mean? You can
literally put a billboard on its, see,

366
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,200
can't walk around them.
By the time he get fucking,

367
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,440
you get around the
circumference of the person,

368
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,930
he's already walking in the doorway,
then you're behind him again.

369
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,040
Then you exhale really loudly
and he turns his head right.

370
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,000
You see that neck fat, the Gaba, uh,

371
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,040
shopping is awful.

372
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Whereas the patients for crowded stores
and the time to try on 10 pairs of pants

373
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:47,020
that don't even fit well. Well, if you
knew you, I hear, we hate that line.

374
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,970
If you knew your fucking size,
you wouldn't have to.

375
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,720
And if even remotely knew what color
pair Pa and I tried on 10 pairs,

376
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,690
we know the mall sucks. All
right, but here's the problem.

377
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,980
You still want to look great.

378
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,310
And with Trunk Club you never get to set
foot and you never have to sit and set

379
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,090
foot in the mall again.

380
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,020
Trunk Club takes the hassle man out of
shopping by shipping you a trunk full of

381

402
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,560
24 minutes. It's 9:54 AM all
right, this is gonna work out good.

403
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,370
I've gotta be on the bus it fucking

404
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,280
11:00 AM. And then tonight we're,
we're a in grand rapids, Michigan.

405
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,150
And I got some relatives coming
out to that. As I mentioned, I got,

406
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,140
I got relatives in
Indiana, Ohio, Michigan.

407
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm from out these here parts.
And uh, oh. So I got my,

408
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,850
I got speaking to underwears.
Yeah, Trunk Club and me undies.

409
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,750
I actually did my laundry or had
somebody do it for me, you know.

410
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,660
Uh, I walked like a mile and a half
through downtown Detroit yesterday.

411
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,640
Uh,
which is a scary thing for anybody to do.

412
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:08,690
Forget about when you look like
a sickly Ron Howard. And um,

413
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,340
I went down and, uh, founded laundry mat.

414
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,300
This is like the greatest fucking feeling
when you're on tour is when you get

415
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:21,050
your laundry done. You know what I mean?
Is it starting to pile up in your bag?

416
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,640
You know, you got it all fucking twisted
up and you, you fucking grocery bag,

417
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,590
you know, and all of a sudden
you look in any and you,

418
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:33,470
your suitcases getting all empty looking
cause everything's fucking dirty.

419
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,020
I mean, I went over there and gave him
every fucking thing that was dirty and uh,

420
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,380
a laid it down. So that's going to
get me through the rest of the tour.

421
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:45,010
But when I get to Chicago,
I'm going to get my, uh,

422
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,470
my laundry done again is I hate having
a dirty laundry in my fucking luggage.

423
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,580
It's just fucking gross, you know, and
you just pay somebody else to do it.

424
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:59,620
Don't be a cheap content. All right.
I went down there, it was minute,

425
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:04,490
it was a dollar 50 a pound minimum
10 pound thing, and I went down.

426
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:07,260
They would just my fucking me undies,
me undies and Mike,

427
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:11,420
one of the fucking socks. Right?
That's all I brought down there, right?

428
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,080
Because they're going to dry
everything on high, you know,

429
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,761
they get dry.

430
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:19,220
Everything on high c can't give him
anything that's going to fucking shrink.

431
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:20,750
So you don't give a fuck
about you underway. Sucks.

432
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,180
So I'm just bringing that shit down there.
I mean,

433
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,870
it probably weighed two pounds and they
still charged me $12 and 50 cents to do

434
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:30,440
it. And you know what? I don't
give a fuck. I would have
given him 20 bucks to do,

435
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:35,220
to pay another person to do your
laundry. I mean, Jesus, Craig,

436
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,040
you're living like a king. They
got it all folded, you know,

437
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,880
washed my compression socks.
I wear compression socks now.

438
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,320
It's really helping us.

439
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:49,350
I'm getting this fucking varicose
vein treated in my left leg.

440
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:51,780
It's really helping it out. The Guy
told me to get them. It's like, dude,

441
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:53,310
I'm not wearing those fucking socks.

442
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,740
I might as well get soc
guard is at that point.

443
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,940
It's basically like the Allen Iverson
sleeve that he wore for the last three

444
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:04,140
quarters of his career,
except it's on your legs. Um,

445
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,010
and it feels weird at first,
but I got to admit on a cold day,

446
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,620
it's kind of Nice to have socks
that go up to your kneecaps,

447
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,620
but when you put them on and you're
standing in your underwear and you've got

448
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:20,670
them on, like last night I had the
old man once, like I went to a,

449
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:23,250
I bought some from Nike that
were actually that kind of Nice,

450
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,560
but I bought the old man
of ones from the fucking,

451
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:29,970
like the rite aid of the fucking cvs and
they'd just jet black and they went up

452
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:33,120
to my knees and I was standing there and
my fucking underwear and I just burst

453
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:33,954
out laughing.

454
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,300
I look like dead fucking 50 year old
married white guide that gets busted,

455
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,010
you know, get an thinks he's getting
no hooker and it's some undercover cop.

456
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,960
And then I just start crying.

457
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,370
Well, I thought it was always
just trying to talk to her poop,

458
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,260
right. Being that guy. Um, by the way,

459
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:56,120
I apologize for putting
that image in your head,

460
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,430
but it was just too fucking
funny not to share it with you.

461
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,233
MMM.

462
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,200
So anyway, so I went on a
nice walk this morning. Uh,

463
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,200
it was a nice mile and a
half walk there and back.

464
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:11,870
And then I did it again this morning.
And, um, you know, it's cool.

465
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,930
It's cool to be in downtown Detroit and
as people come in and work down here,

466
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,160
excuse me, hiccups here, uh,
people coming down to work. Uh,

467
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,880
it's great to see Cleveland comment
back and all this. I swear to God, man,

468
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,560
I've got to buy something out here. I
think it's a smart move and it's really a,

469
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:31,700
I think it's a patriotic thing to do,
to invest in a fucking city.

470
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,410
That was the shit and it should be the
shit to try. It should be the shit.

471
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,560
It really should. Cleveland should be the
shit, all of these fucking places. So, uh,

472
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,760
he can bama be the like, don't wanna beat
the real estate agent for these fees.

473
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:48,470
Fucking cities and a, and I won't take
a commission. How about that? Yeah,

474
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,060
you can buy something for nothing,

475
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,603
you know,

476
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,780
and he can help his fucking place come
back. I mean, I don't know. You figure,

477
00:28:56,781 --> 00:29:00,170
you know, you start buying up buildings
and then they legalize weed, right?

478
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,710
And then somebody buys the old Packard
fucking factory and he just start making

479
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:07,370
weed in there. There you
go. That's the fucking move.

480
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,990
You come back to Detroit and all those,
you know,

481
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,600
grandsons and granddaughters of the great
auto workers in this country, right?

482
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,620
They go back to work in the same factory,
except you're growing weed.

483
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,180
Come on, man. That's like that Michael
Keaton movie from way back in the day,

484
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:30,530
except you got weed in
it, right? I Dunno. There,

485
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,750
these are just ideas. I'm just
throwing it out there. All right,

486
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:34,070
let's talk some sports here.

487
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,550
Let's stock some sports and we'll start
with the greatest fucking sport that's

488
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:39,530
ever been created.
Nhl Hockey,

489
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,590
God damn motherfucking cock
sucking Frenchie sons of bitches.

490
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,350
The fucking,
I can't even shit on him at this point.

491
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,170
The God Canadians are nine
and eight. Oh nine, eight. Oh

492
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,490
have won 18 out of a possible 18 points.

493
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,810
And for the longest time nobody in the
east look like they could fuck with

494
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:05,260
anybody in the west. And uh, I dunno,

495
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,090
it's looked at me. Well, the
best record out in, uh, out
in the West, who do we got?

496
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,340
Los Angeles is,
is five and three after a slow stat,

497
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,130
the turn it it on Nashville.

498
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:21,290
Six and one Dallas thousands looking good.
Huh?

499
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,250
Six and two when a pig, you
know what it is. So they have,

500
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,310
don't have a tough guy.

501
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,530
I don't know if that's because we
got rid of Lou Cheech or whatever.

502
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,590
From what I heard, I was talking to
a Canadiens fan last night. Actually,

503
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,340
Ted took a picture with them too, you
know, she's like, and I actually made his,

504
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,340
his girlfriend or wife standing
between us because it's too,

505
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,040
I can't put my arm around you
with that fucking shirt on. Um,

506
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,240
but he was saying that,
uh, they, they don't have,

507
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,140
they don't have a tough guy
anymore. And, um, so I dunno,

508
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,730
I think that might come
back to haunt you if he,

509
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:55,270
if he ended up playing whoever the fuck
makes it to the finals out there. Right.

510
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,390
Kings a tough Winnipeg's tough Chicago.
You never fuck with the Blackhawks,

511
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,470
right? I Dunno who the
fuck knows. But anyways,

512
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,690
congratulations to those cons.
I mean,

513
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,480
you gotta you gotta you gotta give
respect to that night and it was fucking

514
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:13,510
insane. But the Bruins playing in
on, right? They're doing all right.

515
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:17,740
Three one and one that's a winning
record. I think the, uh, the tie there,

516
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,620
we fucking blew it
against the filthy flyers.

517
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,550
And then we came back and we beat
the islanders. You know, Craig,

518
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:28,420
he's having a fucking career year
that he's leading the Leed points.

519
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,710
I don't know. I'm psych and um, you
always can be great. When I get back,

520
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:34,390
even at the games that we lose,
I don't give a shit.

521
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:35,980
And we have all these games on my DVR.

522
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,670
I'm going to sit down and watch all of
them. I get to watch a game at night,

523
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,430
you know,
sometimes two games at the Bruins,

524
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,790
half a game and I'm gonna get
all fucking caught up. Um,

525
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,560
and the NFL yesterday to
Patriots beat the jets. Um,

526
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,790
I got to tell you man, jets were
getting 11 points. I loved that fucking,

527
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,500
I love that fucking bet.
The jets getting 11. Um,

528
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:04,501
I was actually thinking that we could
possibly lose to them just because we add,

529
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,140
we have no fucking offensive line and
they got a great defense, you know,

530
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:12,130
Reavis is going to shut down his
whole fucking part of the fields.

531
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,490
And um,
what did we ended up winning by?

532
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:20,440
We ended up winning by seven points,
but uh, Edelman dropped that pass.

533
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,710
Then he always go for the new drug to
appear as, and we build a blue. Yeah.

534
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:26,380
But if he caught it, maybe they would've
done something different. You never know.

535
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,590
So, uh, you know, we beat the green cons.

536
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,340
They're not the green cards anymore
cause rex Ryan isn't there. But uh,

537
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:38,260
I got to admit, it's um, kind
of, uh, this is the German in me.

538
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,460
Was it going to shine? Freud?
Is that what they call it?

539
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,720
Taking pleasure out of somebody else's
suffering. Seeing the bills struggling.

540
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,110
Not because I don't like the bills just
because rex Ryan talks all these shit

541
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:50,850
about what he's going
to do to the Patriots.

542
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,680
It's kind of fun to see the jets be
equality squad with the class act for a

543
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:57,330
coach,
you know?

544
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,160
And to watch him fucking lose into
Jacksonville all the way over there in

545
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:06,660
England. Fucking great. But the
sunbelt rex, I still love the guy.

546
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:08,760
I'm feeling bad for me. It looks
like he's putting on weight again.

547
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:12,540
I think he's stressing, you
know, talked to all that shit.

548
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:15,330
There's always people talking shit.
There was somebody on the jets talk shit.

549
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,770
But what? They were going to come up
and due to the Patriots and saying,

550
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,830
why would you do that?

551
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,490
Why would you give them extra motivation
to help people continue to fucking talk

552
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:27,040
shit. You know what I mean? We
know you think you're going to,

553
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:30,000
when we know you're going up there
to win and we know you're not scared,

554
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,690
you just don't say it. You're
dope. We go up to, we go,

555
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,970
we'll go blue blue. We go there.
Yeah, it's how you're going.

556
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,280
You're gonna go up there and play
football. How about the dolphins?

557
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,291
Jesus Christ.

558
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:47,730
Talk about making your former coach look
like a fucking jerk off they came in

559
00:33:47,731 --> 00:33:52,020
there and absolutely raped
the fucking Texas. You know,

560
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,830
where they went like fucking 97 to two.

561
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,150
Where is it is you can tell I was on a
bus. They barely saw anything. I watched,

562
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,950
I watched the Dallas game and I, uh, and
I watched the Patriots. That's all I saw.

563
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:09,060
And I also saw the end of the panthers.
It's pissing me off that I keep missing,

564
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,750
uh, the panthers play because
I feel like I'm missing a,

565
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,780
the emergence of the next great
quarterback in the league.

566
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,940
And for the life of me,
I can't remember his name,

567
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,000
but he has those Michael Jordan
years where they're really tiny,

568
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:23,550
but they looked like the top just
staple to the side of his head.

569
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,170
And he's also one of those guys
that he yells a lot, you know,

570
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,330
he walks up to the camera
and for some reason

571
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,410
it goes,
ah,

572
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,430
which is really gonna.
It's gonna be difficult for me to enjoy.

573
00:34:36,431 --> 00:34:40,420
What should I just, that's the
generation gap. I for the life of me,

574
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:45,660
I don't fucking understand that Johnny
Unitas through for 41,000 yards in the

575
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,110
fifties and sixties. Keep he beat out the
next guy, but like 15,000 fucking yards.

576
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,920
I don't think there's any footage of him
throwing a touchdown pass and walking

577
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:55,450
up to a camera with this flat top.

578
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,430
Ah,
that's

579
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:01,120
back when you could fucking hit the
quarterback until the end of the play.

580
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,340
You can keep hitting the guy
maybe. And if he ever did that,

581
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:09,880
it was because he was screaming in pain.
I was kidding who?

582
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:12,310
I'm an old fucking white guy.
What do you want from me?

583
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,260
And I want the game to
be the way it used to be.

584
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:17,980
We established the running game
and then you throw the ball. Um,

585
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:24,190
but anyways, um, the fuck did I want
to talk about there was something,

586
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:26,950
I'm all over the map because I'm stressing
because I got to finish this fucking

587
00:35:26,951 --> 00:35:31,951
thing and hopefully this internet won't
suck and I can try and upload it here.

588
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,093
Um,

589
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:36,250
so I figured the next thing of course
people were going to play in our division

590
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:39,700
will be the dolphins and I imagine one
of them is going to talk shit about how,

591
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:44,430
um, you know, they don't think the
Patriots are as good as it used to be.

592
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,600
The fucking sick of is too sick
of that. Did that, did that. Uh,

593
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,740
all I know is a patriots on a collision
course with the New York football giants

594
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:53,880
to be undefeated.

595
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,530
And I said Diversey last night
and my drunken stupor, I go,

596
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,610
can you do me a favor?

597
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,210
Can you just have the giants
beat us during the regular
season this year and not

598
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,230
in a,
not in fucking the,

599
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,000
not the Superbowl.
I Dunno.

600
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,970
I'm really praying for the packages should
to knock off the fucking giants cause

601
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:19,320
I do not want to see them
again. Uh, I don't, I'm good.

602
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,900
I'm fine with just losing to them
twice. I'm, I'm good with that.

603
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,490
Rather than rolling the dice and
risking losing a third time. Um,

604
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,160
even though it'd be great to
come and beat him, you know,

605
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,980
and this is why I don't play professional
football because even as a fan,

606
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,220
I'm a little fucking girl. I don't want
to see them again. They always win.

607
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:40,140
Um, but what was I gonna say? The, uh,

608
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,620
you know, Odell Beckham that they got
and then they got the fucking guy,

609
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,050
just a salsa dance. He's coming back.
That guy's coming back. Then again,

610
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,750
it's going to be a fucking
nightmare. Fucking nightmare. Um,

611
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,750
hopefully we get healthy or
offensive line gets healthy, but uh,

612
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,110
who knows who the fuck knows what's
going to happen. But, uh, anyways,

613
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,330
let me get to some of the reeds
here for this week. Um, all right.

614
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:11,000
Who versus home? People always try to
explain this to me and I'll never get you.

615
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,900
I'll never get it. All right, Bill,

616
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,170
I have the solution to your who versus
whom dilemma that will solve the issue

617
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:23,010
for the rest of your life. Okay, IOP.
Now one of those snake oil salesman.

618
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:25,530
I feel like I'm in your tent right now.
You're starting to religion.

619
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,260
You know when you're fucking
putting your hand on my forehead.

620
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,480
Exercise and the demons. Um, if
the statement could be answer,

621
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,930
if the statement could answer,
answer the question with him or her,

622
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,450
then use whom?
Whom did you say that too?

623
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,190
I sent it to him. I said
it to her. Not he or she.

624
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,420
So it's home example to who told you that?

625
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,650
He told me that. She told me that no
fucking way. It's sad that studies.

626
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:04,190
He who told you that?
She did.

627
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,000
Whom did you say to a certain,
wait a minute. So now using it as

628
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,130
wait. So if I, to whom do
I owe this pleasure too?

629
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,390
Yo tell him children's home.

630
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:30,140
Who fucking did it? He
did it. Jesus Christ.

631
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:34,100
It was that easy. What the fuck were
you 40 years ago when I needed you?

632
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,400
Maybe I could have passed the class.
Got To Notre Dame become a lawyer.

633
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,420
I hope that made sense. It totally makes
sense. I just hope I can remember it.

634
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:43,580
You know what? I'm actually going to
take a picture of that in my phone.

635
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,490
Speaking of which the
phone starts ringing.

636
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,873
Hang on.

637
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,470
Oh Shit. Hold on. Hold on. Huh? Hello?

638
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,200
I thought it said 11.

639
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,633
Okay.

640
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,130
It's, it's, it's, it's Paul
and Joe down there already.

641
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,150
No.

642
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,080
All right, well I'm finishing up
my podcast. I'll be down there 11.

643
00:39:13,081 --> 00:39:13,914
Sorry about that.

644
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,863
Okay.

645
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,030
All right buddy.
See you a fucked up.

646
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,610
I thought I said 11 o'clock.

647
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,390
That was the bus driver going,
just checking.

648
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:29,140
We did say it's fucking hilarious. 10,
10 because we've always been on time,

649
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:33,610
so he knew. Um, so anyways,

650
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,533
um,

651
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,010
yeah,

652
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,560
Goddamn it, you fixed it. You fuck,
I got to take a picture of that.

653
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,180
Whom did you say that to?
Who told you that?

654
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,370
That's all I have to remember.

655
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,030
Yeah.

656
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,100
I wish it was more fucking
sentences and then, you know,

657
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:54,820
you gave me 10 of them and then I had
to try to guess. All right, good fellas.

658
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:59,170
Dean explained. Oh my
God, I feel fucking smart.

659
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,490
You know what to think about whom is
you can't use it without looking like a

660
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:06,820
Douche. The only time you can use
whom as if you write something.

661
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,900
The funny thing is if you, if you
use whom, you know what I mean?

662
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,250
You sound like those, uh, you
know when he stepped on the bull,

663
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:19,450
those guys from fucking trading
places. Um, but if you're,

664
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,950
if you're writing a, you know,
an email or sorry, even tweets,

665
00:40:22,951 --> 00:40:26,080
something people would call you out on
it because if you don't use it then,

666
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,750
then you look like a Douche.
So I think that's the other rule,

667
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,420
you know what I mean? Like,
Hey, who would you say that too?

668
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,020
You can't be in a bar and be like,
hey, whom did you say that too?

669
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,190
I said to him, you fucking dose. Right?
You can't do that, but you're right,

670
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,550
it down everybody, you know,
everybody sees it. You know,

671
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:50,900
they just break your balls. So
there's another roof. All right.

672
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,680
A good fellas seen explained that. Okay.
Last week I thought that the reason why,

673
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,770
um,
Joe pashing the end

674
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,560
Scorsese just brings back
a Tommy's character and he
just pointed the gun at the

675
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:08,910
camera and start shooting was because
that was Tommy from beyond the grave

676
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,900
shooting fucking,
uh,

677
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,830
Henry because he was a rat
and ratted everybody out. Um,

678
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:22,260
so somebody said, Goodfellows x, that was
my theory. Good fellas seen, explained,

679
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:22,980
hey bill,

680
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,730
you mentioned in your recent Thursday
morning podcast your theory on why we see

681
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:31,110
Joe [inaudible], Joe [inaudible],
Joe [inaudible] fire a pistol.

682
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:36,930
Fucking brain is three fucking words
ahead of my mouth at the screen at the end

683
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:37,970
of Goodfellas,

684
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,160
it's actually an old modge or a
homage if you're in a bar, uh,

685
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,290
to the 1906 black and white film as
opposed to the color films back there.

686
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,880
The great train robbery.

687
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,300
It was the first film with a narrative
storyline and at the end there is a shot

688
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,360
of a cowboy looking at the camera
who fires his pistol at the screen,

689
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:02,450
just like in Goodfellas. I
actually watched the clip.
It's pretty fucking cool.

690
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,040
It was very jarring to the film audiences
who had never seen anything like that.

691
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,060
And in many cases,

692
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:13,061
movie goers would duck or a shout
thinking they were actually being shot at.

693
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,600
It's not fucking hilarious because
everybody had a sad iron back then.

694
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Um, just a little film history
from a film nerd to you,

695
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,470
the funniest read to you,

696
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:27,620
the funniest redhead and the plan and keep
up the good work and go fuck yourself.

697
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:32,450
Here's the movie. All right.
I will definitely post that.
Uh, that, uh, that clip.

698
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,640
All right, election bill.
You've been pretty quiet about
the election. Seems like,

699
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,320
uh, they got their start early this year
and people are going to be tired out by

700
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:44,840
February.
If you had to vote today,

701
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,200
do you know who you'd vote for a also,

702
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,950
is there anyone less stable
looking than Hillary Clinton?

703
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,610
She can't be getting any good sleep.
Love you and your wife. Thanks for,

704
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,950
for the weekly laughs. Uh, I thought
Hillary crushed it on that stupid inquiry.

705
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,880
You know, I didn't understand
what the fucking problem was.

706
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,910
She admitted that had happened on her
watch and she took full responsibility for

707
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:13,040
it.
So like what was the fucking problem?

708
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,310
Okay.

709
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,010
You know, that seemed like a, you know,

710
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,270
deflate gate type shit.
I mean, honestly, what,

711
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,080
what are you supposed to do to
stop a terrorist attack? I have,

712
00:43:25,081 --> 00:43:28,530
they've said that forever. Like even
the secret service says, you know,

713
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,290
if somebody doesn't
give a shit about dying,

714
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:33,990
the only thing that they can
share is instantaneous death.

715
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:36,180
After you do whatever the fuck
you're going to attempt to do.

716
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,420
You know what I mean?
Once you take out the fucking,

717
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:42,840
I don't give a shit whether
I live that this, you know,

718
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,313
it's over.

719
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,310
So I mean, what are we going to
do? You know, was an away game.

720
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,370
It's fucking horrific that it
happened, but I'm out. You know,

721
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,570
she should have done this. She should
have done that. The same people say,

722
00:43:56,571 --> 00:44:00,770
and that Saint George Bush kept us safe
after nine 11 but they don't bring up

723
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,430
the fact that nine 11 happened. What?
He was fucking president. Right?

724
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,250
The same people breaking fucking
Hillary's ovaries are fucking rub.

725
00:44:08,251 --> 00:44:11,810
And George Bush has balls and
then vice versa, the same people,

726
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:15,560
Finger Bang and Hillary of fucking
twisted up. What's his face? His nuts.

727
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,480
Rather than giving them
a pair of me undies,

728
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,420
what he's supposed to do when
somebody doesn't give a fuck,

729
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,163
you know,

730
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,320
what are you going to call you up and
tell you what they're going to do?

731
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,390
Yeah.

732
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,880
You know, I don't know.
By the way, we met a,

733
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:35,360
a professional pilot commercial
pilot, by the way. Um,

734
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,690
and uh, he knew some of the
people on those flights, you know,

735
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:42,340
some of the pilots and that type of shit.

736
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:45,460
So all these fucking people that are
trying to say that it didn't happen,

737
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,080
that they were actually fucking these
missiles or something like that that was

738
00:44:50,081 --> 00:44:54,730
shot in there. I mean, um, I
dunno. And that's coming from me.

739
00:44:54,731 --> 00:44:58,570
He was a fucking conspiracy theory. Sorry.
GAVISCON everybody. Hey there. Bilderberg

740
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,670
just checking in on you from
fucking Southie kid. Uh,

741
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:10,470
I listened to your podcast almost every
day in the sea of cubicles. I work in a,

742
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,610
you are the fucking mouth.
Thank you. I appreciate it.

743
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,600
I also saw your comics come home,

744
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:18,580
but Boba last year and there were a
bunch of constant front of me who are

745
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:21,640
getting offended at the things you were
saying and it made it funnier for me and

746
00:45:21,641 --> 00:45:24,190
my girlfriend anyways.
Oh, I remember that.

747
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:26,620
That one was a little bit of a
rough one, you know. Anyways,

748
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,650
I just came across Dan Carlin's hardcore
history podcast and the first one that

749
00:45:32,651 --> 00:45:37,651
is free on iTunes is the wrath of Khan
series on Gangas con and the Mongol

750
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,110
Empire during the Middle Ages.

751
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,130
This dude was one of the greatest men
and conquerors who ever lived and his

752
00:45:45,131 --> 00:45:46,420
story is incredible.

753
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:51,810
The fear and loyalty this man instilled
in people of his day is unparalleled.

754
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:55,960
Although he's responsible
for 20 to 80 million deaths.

755
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:01,690
He completely changed the world and built
the largest empire the world had ever

756
00:46:01,691 --> 00:46:02,380
seen.

757
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,500
And I thought you might be interested
in it because you've talked about other

758
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:07,300
great men who have lived in the past.

759
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:11,730
Arnold Schwartzenegger thanks for a
great show and go fuck yourself. Yeah,

760
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:16,330
see there's another one. You don't even
know what it is. There's no footage

761
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,750
on like Vladi the fucking impaler
and fucking, uh, the g man,

762
00:46:22,751 --> 00:46:25,630
they're fucking gang his card.
So you know,

763
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,320
nobody got where you are
fucking, you know, get that.

764
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:33,730
What do you and not seek think,
you know, I gotta check that out.

765
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:34,780
I gotta I gotta listen to that.

766
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:37,320
I gotta be in the mood to
listen to a fucking podcast.

767
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:40,870
Like I love being on podcasts,
I love doing them, but, um,

768
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,900
I just, uh, my brain is, I can't
handle just sitting still. That lock,

769
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,860
I guess I could have it on
in the background is I was
doing something else maybe

770
00:46:50,861 --> 00:46:55,040
cleaning up or freshening
up before a show. Um,

771
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,120
all right. My roommate is a
pervert. Okay, here we go.

772
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,130
Uh,
but let's go back to yet,

773
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,360
do you realize the work it is
to kill 20 to 80 million people?

774
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,770
I mean, you could do it today with
just a push of a button, but back then,

775
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:12,604
I mean you've,

776
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,750
that's like before they had like the
fucking lawnmowers with the engines in.

777
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,190
I mean, you had to push the fucking
thing. You Self, do you know what?

778
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,750
I'm so old that we actually had
one of those when I was a kid.

779
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:23,770
Okay.

780
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:28,170
Was the fucking worst. And if it
was to gift of grass was too long,

781
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,450
he just,
I just didn't have the strength to do it.

782
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:35,260
So you'd push it forward and then had
to go back and you had to get like a

783
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:37,090
running start,
you know?

784
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,180
Okay.

785
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,800
Oh it was a mess of so hard
to keep it fucking straight.

786
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,250
That's basically like if you had
to look up a push mower that,

787
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:49,490
that didn't have an edge in,
in it,

788
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,520
I would think that you'd have
to like be cutting it every day.

789
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:56,270
Like George Michael did with his beard
and then it'd be like nice and easy.

790
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,080
Right. But she went on
like a bender, you know?

791
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,640
Oh you went away to some place that they
used to vacation back in the day like

792
00:48:04,641 --> 00:48:05,361
Sarasota,

793
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:10,361
Florida or myrtle beach or some of the
classic ones that they used to go to way

794
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:12,620
back in the day.
Reno,

795
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,330
you know those old school places,
Palm Springs,

796
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,210
you know when you came back you fucking
lawn was through the God damn. Well,

797
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:23,480
I guess you do it the wintertime,
right?

798
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,510
All I'm saying is that you
were out there all the time.

799
00:48:26,511 --> 00:48:28,370
That's probably why a lot of
people weren't as fucking fat.

800
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,770
Although you know what the
big thing was back in the day,

801
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:34,340
everybody was scared about was just having
a heart attack because they couldn't

802
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:37,280
do any of those fucking,
I'm gonna send rhinoplasty,

803
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,710
which of course is your nose
gets getting a nose job.

804
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,930
Do you know there's
something called rhinorrhea.

805
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,580
I learned that by ringing about
heroin junkies and shit like that.

806
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,700
That uh, oh, of raw ryo Rhea.
See if I can look it up.

807
00:48:52,701 --> 00:48:55,670
I know you guys think I'm full of Shit.
It's like diarrhea of the nose.

808
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,420
It's just fucking when you,
uh,

809
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,920
one of the symptoms when
you're quitting cold Turkey,

810
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:04,640
Rhino,

811
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,290
see I spelled diary Da da Da.

812
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,210
A r. R. H. E a, something like that. Oh,

813
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:18,230
there it is.
Brian or Maria rhinorrhea.

814
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,100
Rhinorrhea is a condition where the
nasal cavity is filled with a significant

815
00:49:22,101 --> 00:49:23,660
amount of mucus, mucus, fluid.

816
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,520
That condition commonly known as a
runny nose occurs relatively frequently.

817
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,750
Rhinorrhea is a common symptoms of
allergies or certain diseases such as the

818
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:37,100
common cold or Hay fever. Oh, I thought
that test when you were a, I thought you,

819
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,420
I thought you said you were all
right. Spider. Um, I thought,

820
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,560
I can't even say it because
I've done it so many times.

821
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:46,040
I always started imitating fucking spider.

822
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,700
I thought that rhinorrhea was an next
level runny nose that you got when you

823
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:56,770
were kicking heroin. Um, I've kind
of got interested in all that,

824
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,660
like the whole heroin epidemic that's
going on here in this country. Oh,

825
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,610
by the way, I keep forgetting to bring
up to how great the Indianapolis Gig was.

826
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:09,350
First of all, I got to come
back and play this theater. Um,

827
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,930
do you remember that story I told you
guys and I put the video up where, uh,

828
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,620
I was playing a theater upstairs and
downstairs. Was that totally Elmo show?

829
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:22,670
Whatever the fuck it was, keeping up
with the muppets, whatever the fuck,

830
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,990
I don't want to come. You
know? Um, and when I walked

831
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,720
the door of to the backstage of
their theater was open and like all,

832
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:37,190
like the count was sitting there and
Bert was there an Oscar the grouch,

833
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,500
like these actors in these suits and
they were just chilling out, you know,

834
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,100
and they look tired from doing a
bunch of shows. So it was hilarious.

835
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:47,990
So I filmed them and all of a sudden
Bert got up and came walking over and was

836
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:50,360
waving his hands. I thought he
was saying, what's up my God,

837
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,100
look at birthdays coming up here.

838
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,320
And he fucking reached out and slammed
the door. And I was just like, wait,

839
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,910
wow.
He really is a content.

840
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,180
We're real used to happy go lucky one,
I was choking in Indianapolis that, um,

841
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:11,210
that Ernie, Ernie parents six like
it or accepting of his homosexuality,

842
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:14,120
right. We're Burt's weren't like
they kicked him out of the family.

843
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:18,650
So it caused him to be like sad and
bitter. You know what I mean? Um,

844
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:22,930
but thank God he had earning his
life. Right. Cheer him up. Um,

845
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,013
anyways,

846
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:29,060
and then I posted the video
and then sesame street told
me I had to take it down.

847
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,870
The children's television workshop was
like, you got to take it down. That's,

848
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,330
that's not legal footage, which
I think it was. I mean, what,

849
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:38,841
I don't understand.

850
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:41,840
What exactly were they going to do to
me if I didn't take it down? I Dunno.

851
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:44,630
So I took it down and I was like, all
right, whatever, you know, it was,

852
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,210
was they were going through that shit
with the Elmo guy. They said, you know,

853
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,230
fucking it was grab ass. And with some
kid, I have no fucking clue. But anyways,

854
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:56,150
so this time around, I got
to played downstairs where
the Elmo theater was and I,

855
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,630
it's one of the great theories I've ever
played in my life is far as the crowd

856
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:03,650
was just on top of you. They had
like those, those little balconies,

857
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:05,870
things they had like four
of them on each side.

858
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:12,280
It was like an old hockey arena.
It was just fucking awesome. Uh,

859
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:16,300
just been an incredible,
incredible fucking, um,

860
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,960
yeah,

861
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,060
credible fucking a tour here.

862
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,200
And we went to one of the sickest
fucking cigar bars I've ever been to.

863
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:28,640
What's your course? Because I was
fucking idiot. I just walked into it.

864
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,470
I got to look it up right now.

865
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:36,290
Indianapolis cigar bars.
All right, let's see.

866
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:40,160
Let's see.
Blend.

867
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,580
This fucking place might've been the
greatest cigar bar I've ever been to.

868
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,460
It's fucking incredible.
You have to go to it.

869
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:52,920
And they're opening one in
Nashville and Dallas. All right.

870
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,960
Six selection of fucking cigars there.

871
00:52:56,961 --> 00:53:01,610
The Davidoff Davidoff a Nicaraguan,
um,

872
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,360
all these other just amazing cigars.
That's the one that I smoked.

873
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:07,940
And then they had like all these whiskies,

874
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:12,620
limited edition list whiskeys and
bourbons sent. Um, that I thought,

875
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:16,760
I mean, did you know they had
dead Jack Daniels Sinatra?

876
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:20,960
I'd never even heard of that. We had
partnered with like what the fuck is that?

877
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,590
Like that was his drink and I'm like he
just saying Sinatra cause that was his

878
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:26,760
drink to like, no,
that's a limited edition.

879
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,593
MMM.

880
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,950
I'm looking it up right now.
Jack Daniels Sinatra.

881
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,670
Where is it here? Yeah, I know. I
never fucking heard of that shit.

882
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:44,780
And of course they was sold out of it.
Let me do the old Wiki here.

883
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:49,380
Wikipedia, Jack Daniels, Sinatra Wiki.

884
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,920
I hate. What did you mean that of course
I met that. You know what I meant?

885
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,390
That got damaged.

as what it was called anyway,

887
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:08,190

amazing, amazing place. And uh,

888
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,000
don't you ain't these fucking websites

891
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:21,780

the 1893 they won't let,

895
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,630
let's see when they believe in.

896
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:36,490
Okay.

897
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:41,050
1890 how about 1899 do they?
They don't believe anybody's alive.

898
00:54:41,051 --> 00:54:45,970
How about 1900 see that's what it is.
Anything with an 18 go fuck yourself.

899
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,343
Enter

900
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,640
Sinatra's selects bottle of 90 proof
and made with unique Sinatra barrels.

901
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,300
And it sounds like fucking bullshit to me.
Jack Daniels Sinatra.

902
00:54:59,301 --> 00:55:03,650
So what does that Sinatra barrel to
get a fucking to pay on it? Sorry.

903
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,880
Select pays a tribute
to Jack's biggest fan.

904
00:55:07,881 --> 00:55:09,020
Mr. Frank Sinatra.

905
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:13,430
The Sinatra barrels have deep grooves
on the inside of their staves,

906
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,290
which exposes the whiskey to extra
layers of boke a god damn it.

907
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:22,850
Now I got to get a bottle,
but she can't just get a bottle.

908
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,030
They got a video here of
Frank Sinatra porn it.

909
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:30,490
I wonder if his fucking
next akin gets any money.

910
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,900
Do they got a picture here sitting at
the bar of Sinatra laughing while Jackie

911
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,690
Gleason's laughing with Frank Sinatra
and Jackie Gleason. We're close friends.

912
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:47,190
In fact, it was Jack Jackie
Gleason himself who introduced
frank to Jack Daniels.

913
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:48,630
And as the story is told,

914
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:52,620
it was sometime in the 1940s Jackie and
frank was sitting together at a bar in

915
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:57,000
New York City. Frank was for
loan over a woman, probably.

916
00:55:57,001 --> 00:56:00,200
What a great song about it and was
sharing his troubles with Gleason Franken

917
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,750
formed as good friend that he was in
need of some of the serious drink turning

918
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:08,370
to Sinatra Gleason responded Jack Daniels.
That's a good place to start.

919
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:12,090
And then the rest as they
say it was history. Oh,

920
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:15,480
frank said he needed a drink
now. There you go. All right.

921
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:17,460
What the fuck am I talking
about at this point? All right,

922
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:19,090

their way over there. All right,

925
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,820
let's read a couple of fucking advertising
then I'll get the last fucking thing

in there and I'm out, right? All right.

razors. It's gross, man.

928
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,660
Why are you torturing yourself with
gross old blade week after week?

929
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:47,080
Probably cause you don't want to
shell out $20 for a pack of new ones.

930
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,970
Dollar Shave club.com has revolutionized
the way men shave with dollar shave

931
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:52,241
club.

932
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:55,770
You could shave with a fresh blade as
often as she won't because they deliver a

933
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,720
whole sleeve of amazing reasons
for just a few bucks a month.

934
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,660
Their razors are so good.
Millions of guys have joined,

935
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,870
even the billion dollar raise or
corporations are freaking out,

936
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:07,120
but instead of lowering
their bloated prices,

937
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:10,960
they're trying to fool you into milking
the same blade for an entire month and

938
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,960
that's gross.
They'd price gouged us for long enough.

939
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,740
Never got back to squeezing weeks and
weeks of shaves out of a discussing rusty

940
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:21,100
bleed, joined dollar shave club, and
he was a fresh blade whenever you want.

941
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:24,220

the price during the millions of others

00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:55,690
all right. My roommate, my
roommate is a perv, so sir,

986
00:59:55,691 --> 01:00:00,310
billion of Boston. I'm a longtime
listener. Love Your Shit. Anyway,

987
01:00:00,311 --> 01:00:03,550
my roommate just started dating a girl,
a lady,

988
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,700
and they're getting a really,
Copley,

989
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,930
they even talk about having sex
with each other in front of people,

990
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,390
including myself.
I have a girlfriend,

991
01:00:13,391 --> 01:00:18,391
but I try not to be overly [inaudible]
or discuss our sex life in public.

992
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:19,481
Uh,

993
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:24,430
the worst part is that they have taken
to having sex throughout our shared

994
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:27,700
house, including our living
room couch in our kitchen.

995
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,750
I think that their behavior is annoying
at best and disgusting it worse,

996
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,870
but I'm certain,
but I'm uncertain as how I should proceed.

997
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:38,920
Do you have any thoughts? Also go
fuck you. Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah,

998
01:00:38,921 --> 01:00:40,930
I have some thoughts. Why don't
you sit them down and say, Hey,

999
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:45,880
can you guys do me a favor and
not fuck on the sofa? All right.

1000
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:49,120
This isn't your house. This is our
house. I don't need your bodily fluids.

1001
01:00:49,121 --> 01:00:53,710
All crust it up.
You know on the couch?

1002
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,470
Yeah,

1003
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:00,150
I would just do. I would just, you know,
they like openly talking about sex.

1004
01:01:00,151 --> 01:01:02,010
Just say, listen, you
have sex in your bedroom.

1005
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:05,130
Don't have sex on the couch
where we all sit. It's gross.

1006
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:10,480
I would say that and I would just, I would
just stare at them until they talked.

1007
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:12,730
Okay.

1008
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,880
I just don't,
I go agitated.

1009
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,920
Is there a reason why you guys feel it's
okay to have sex all around the house?

1010
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:20,493
I live here too.

1011
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:21,850
Yeah.

1012
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:26,110
You know I make a sandwich on that kitchen
counter. I don't need to know that.

1013
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:29,770
Her ass dripping pussy with fucking
laying on there. You fucking pig.

1014
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:35,320
You guys are both animals. I have no
respect for either one of you. All right.

1015
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:41,350
Go ahead and advocate. It'll be a fucking
who now you don't get to be that mean.

1016
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:43,150
Just be like, listen, I'm
not trying to be a jerk.

1017
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,090
I think it's great that you found
somebody that you can connect it with,

1018
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,350
but could you not have sex on the kitchen,
counter of pleas or in the kitchen?

1019
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:54,010
I eaten there. It's gross. You
see that's so far over there.

1020
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:58,630
I sit there and I watch TV. All right.
I don't need that. See that table?

1021
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:03,130
I eat there. All right. If you
want to fuck all over an apartment,

1022
01:02:03,131 --> 01:02:06,460
you're going to need to get your
own apartment, but until you do,

1023
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,590
this is our apartment and don't.

1024
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:10,170
Yeah,

1025
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,880
fuck anywhere
where it's,

1026
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:17,630
you know where it's hours.
I feel like I could use who or whom here.

1027
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:22,940
Maybe you should out a home. See if
I can do it here. All right. Whom?

1028
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:26,890
Whom did I say that too?
I sent it to him.

1029
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:34,360
Yeah, that's what you say. You come out
of the gate using home to freak them out.

1030
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,150
Yeah,

1031
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:40,040
call, call the guy and be
like, can I cheat? Can I ask
you a question? Be like, sure.

1032
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:46,130
Whom did you fuck on that counter?
He's gotta be a car.

1033
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,263
Okay.

1034
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,990
Or my girlfriend.
What if he says my girlfriend?

1035
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:58,500
You got to say that. I would just be
like, whom did you fuck on the counter?

1036
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:03,630
Whom did you fuck on the table?
And whom did you fuck on the couch?

1037
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,360
That almost sounds like bill Cosby.

1038
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,610
And why would a children die?
You can't bring up bill Cosby,

1039
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:16,620
especially when you're talking
about a woman, right? It
was consensual. Everybody.

1040
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:21,390
All right, that's the podcast for this
week. I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1041
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:25,440
And once again, thanks to everybody that
came out in Indianapolis, Cleveland,

1042
01:03:25,441 --> 01:03:28,410
Detroit, and Pittsburgh, um,

1043
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:33,930
just for fucking great cities, math for
great cities, and it's great to see,

1044
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:37,740
uh,
all of them are having a resurgence.

1045
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,590
Every time I've gone back,
they always get a little bit better.

1046
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:44,400
And I think it's great because like I
said, I love this part of the country.

1047
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,800
I'm not going to lie to you. I like
all the parts of country, you know,

1048
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,260
I'm a patriotic come
when it comes down to it.

1049
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:54,261
So I'd always made me sad to come to
Cleveland and Detroit and Indianapolis and

1050
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:58,560
Cincinnati and that shit at five o'clock
where everybody just screws it goes out

1051
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:02,540
to the suburbs and the fucking place
looks like a Zombie movie at night. Uh,

1052
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,790
it's nice to see some nightlife in that
type of shit. Cause of beautiful cities.

1053
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:10,140
All right. There you go. Legalize
weed. Open the plants again.

1054
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:10,951
Let's grow some weed.

1055
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:14,280
Let's get the world high right then maybe
they'll give us the oil for the price

1056
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:19,140
we want. We don't have to blow people
up. You know what I mean? Alright,

1057
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,330
go fuck yourself.
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
