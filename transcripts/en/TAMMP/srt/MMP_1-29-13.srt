1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,370
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:05,970
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,490
January 28th, 2013. Uh,

4
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:15,491
I apologize for it being a this late
and I'm going to pause for all the truly

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:21,770
angry people out there.
Um,

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,270
let them get that out of this
system moves you through. You know,

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,030
one of the key things you got to figure
out in life is who you're really mad at.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,670
You know, are you really
mad at me? You never met me.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,000
I haven't done nothing to you.
Um,

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,990
I apologize. I had a crazy frigging
weekend. Now last I talked to use,

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,220
unless you're new to the podcast and if
you're new, welcome. Huh? Look at me.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,520
I'd say I'm borderline
jovial at this point.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,120
Welcome to the Monday morning podcast.
Um,

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,840
last I spoke with you,
I was on my way to Hawaii

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,580
and I was going to go to the pro bowl.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,360
Then initially I was going to
stay there for a week, but uh,

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,530
I ended up getting some acting work,
which is great.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,890
So I had to cut it short and tell the
lovely near that I couldn't take her to

19
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:13,310
Hawaii. I'll have to do it next time. And
basically I was going to go out there,

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,910
I was going to do my show through republic
and then I was going to go to the pro

21
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,680
bowl the next day, you know,
then go look at a volcano,

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,760
whatever the fuck I was going to
do when I was going to fly back.

23
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:27,150
But at least I was going to do
that. And um, I ended up, uh,

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,550
getting another acting gig on Monday.
And I know what you're thinking.

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,500
Jesus fell, Eh, you're acting
all over the place, you know,

26
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:40,610
and you know what? No,
I'm not. No, I'm not.

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:42,840
Okay.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,530
I'm not,
it's just this business knows,

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,290
it knows when you, when you're
planning to do something fun. You know,

30
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,640
I don't have any fun plans next month.
No vacations,

31
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,100
not waterskiing. I'm not
taking that, that, uh,

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,680
that needle point class
that I've had my eye on.

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,110
I don't have any fun plans next month.
And you know what I have for acting worth?

34
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,080
I got shit.
I got nothing.

35
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,990
This fucking God damn business. It's
saw it felt it. Felt it in the universe.

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,460
Oh, look at Billy, right face.
Oh, freckle face himself.

37
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,600
He's going to go to the islands.
Go to a game. Ever. Good time, man.

38
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:27,240
I go fuck yourself as a couple
of acting gigs. You go out there,

39
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:30,660
you do just stand up Gig. All right?
You go to bed, you get on a plane,

40
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:35,190
you fucking come right back. Nothing
for you. That's what I did this weekend,

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,750
okay?

42
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,010
I worked Friday night. Saturday. I
got on a fucking plane by myself.

43
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,880
All right. And I'm sitting there
and you know when you fly to Hawaii,

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,230
I've never done this before.

45
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,840
They have like on the monitors
that play in the music,

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,400
they already got the music on where?
Well, well, well, well, well, well,

47
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,970
well who could do bup, bup,
bup, bup, [inaudible], right.

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,580
Whatever the fight, they kept
that shit. You're already,

49
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,160
you already feel like you're in Hawaii
and I'm sitting there like an asshole.

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,850
I'm looking around, everybody's got
their wife or their girlfriend, you know,

51
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,660
or whatever their fantasy football,
fucking hand job, boyfriend,

52
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:12,490
whatever the fuck they got,
whatever the hell it is.

53
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,390
When guys all go on a vacation
and they're not in their twenties,

54
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,060
whatever the fuck that's called the,
we're sick of a fucking wives vacation.

55
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:26,840
I don't know what it is. And I'm
sitting there like an asshole. Right?

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,850
So I fly out there,
crack of dawn,

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,210
fly out there and uh,

58
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,750
I can't even remember the fucking
weekend. Yeah. Nia didn't give me a ride.

59
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,800
So must have been really early. You kind
of have this deal. If it's too early,

60
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:47,460
I just jumped in a cab.
So I took a cab to the airport,

61
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,650
got on the fucking plane, flew
out there, landed and you know,

62
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:55,190
cause I wasn't bringing my girls just
like fuck it. I'll stay at whatever,

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,190
stay at the cheapest place out of the
three that were given to me. Right.

64
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:03,630
So when I show up to this fucking place,
it's like I show up. I'm the only guy,

65
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:06,540
like under the age of like 78 there.

66
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,990
It's just a bunch of fucking
old people and there's an,

67
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:14,850
I hop built into the place and
there's like a fucking homeless guy.

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,930
It just,

69
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,880
I felt like I was staying in like
the Port Authority section of Hawaii.

70
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,320
And what makes it worse is I got there
at 12 noon and my room wasn't ready until

71
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:30,321
three so now I'm sitting there like this
fucking asshole and I'm like adamant,

72
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm not going to the,
I hop they have those on the mainland.

73
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,630
I want to do some island shit
and the fucking 12 hours,

74
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:40,020
then I'm going to be here.
And there was a diner on the corner

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,810
and I went there.

76
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,280
Okay.

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,100
And I, I'm standing, there's like
fucking 12 people online. I'm like,

78
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,430
you gotta be shitting me, right?
This is just a stupid touristy place.

79
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,010
There's fucking candy wrappers on the
ground before you even go in there is the

80
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:59,880
recess wrapper on one side.
There's the cup from the Reese's cup.

81
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,530
Like somebody just fucking just ripped
it open. Like just, it was such forced,

82
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:09,090
the Reese's cup went up in the air. He
fired both fucking parts of the package.

83
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,770
He pardons port and starboard and
then just gulp it down as he ran up,

84
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,810
not paying for it or whatever.
Looked like there was some,

85
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:20,700
so somebody got mugged who had some candy,
you know. So I'm sitting there going,

86
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:23,250
this is a fucking shit hole, but I
don't have a car. And I'm like fuck it,

87
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:27,030
I'm going to stay right. So I go
there and I ordered this thing. Yeah.

88
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:30,150
That evidently was a Hawaiian dish and
just turn out to be a burger patty with

89
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:34,740
some gravy and some eggs and a,
I'm sitting there eating it by myself.

90
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,031
Mind you,

91
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:40,880
I can't go to the pro bowl now cause I
have to fly right the fuck back at, uh,

92
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,920
I was sitting there and I'll send,
this guy taps me on, on my shoulder.

93
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,140
I look over and he goes, hey,
she'll be going, what? What, what?

94
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:49,410
What do you know that that
looks delicious? And I look
at the guy and I'm like,

95
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,630
I know this fucking guy who was this guy?

96
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,680
He looked like a mix between hulk
Hogan and triple h. So I kept thinking,

97
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,060
is this guy a fucking wrestler?

98
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,710
Okay.

99
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,780
And then I, I told him, I go, I don't
know what the name of the dishes,

100
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,320
but it just say hamburger patty with
eggs and gravy and they'll get it to,

101
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,790
and he laughed and he goes, hey, thanks.

102
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,900
And he walked away and I sat there
for five minutes and I was like, fuck,

103
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,040
that was Kevin Greene, former
Pittsburgh Steeler. Swear to God,

104
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,290
I'm 90% sure it was him.

105
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,280
So that was the one cool
thing that happened to me.

106
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,940
Somebody who I think was Kevin
Green asked me what I was eating.

107
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:29,060
I told them I didn't know what the
name of it was. He laughed and he left.

108
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,040
And then I ate that shit. And they go,
do you want dessert? It's like, no,

109
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:34,880
I don't want dessert,

110
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:38,900
but I still have two hours and 15 minutes
to kill before my fucker rumps ready.

111
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,220
So bring it on, lady. What
do you got? What do you got?

112
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:47,180
You got some hooky loud fucking
hookup. Luca. Luca fucking ice cream.

113
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,014
Cause I want it.

114
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,910
I want to do something Hawaiian cause
I'm leaving in fucking 12 hours. Right.

115
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,830
So they got this Hawaiian fried ice
cream. And immediately I'm thinking, well,

116
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,340
isn't that just what, you know, Mexicans
do that right? This is just the same shit.

117
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,730
So what, I never had fried
ice cream before, so go, Yo,
let me get to Friday scream,

118
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,750
fuck it.
And I'm sitting there and I'm sitting now,

119
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,670
there's old ladies looking
like this checklist please.
She looked like, you know,

120
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:18,671
like whenever they interview people who
are still alive that aren't like Alfred

121
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,850
Hitchcock movies, like that chick from
the birds or maybe the chick from psycho.

122
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,880
That's what she looked like. But like
courage. Now she's sitting there,

123
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,270
okay.

124
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,250
Yeah, she's a, you know, an
old red head. And I'm like,

125
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:31,500
is that what I'm going to look like?
Except for like the male version,

126
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,250
this is what I'm thinking
about in paradise, you know,

127
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,680
paradise sitting in
some shit fucking diner.

128
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,140
This is all stuff they don't show
you on the brochure by the way.

129
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,320
Sit into some shit fucking diner.
And uh,

130
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,140
so by the way, the food was
delicious. I got to tell you this,

131
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:52,240
it was delicious, but it was a dump. Um,

132
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,740
okay.

133
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,400
Sweating like 15 minutes go by.
I'm like, it's fucking ice cream.

134
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,630
Okay,

135
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,460
what are you doing? Just scoop it
out of the thing. And I'm like,

136
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:01,890
are they really frying this?
How do you fry it without melting it?

137
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,880
Is the dumbest podcast ever
say. Finally, bring it over.

138
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:10,770
It's this big goop of fucking shit and
it's just surrounded by this moat of whip

139
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:11,604
cream.

140
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,600
Okay.

141
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,433
You know,

142
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,580
and I ate the whole fucking thing out
of sheer be like trying to kill time.

143
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,440
It's probably like 3000 calories.
Plus I had a burger with gravy,

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,560
gravy on it with two eggs over easy.
All of it.

145
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:29,910
Delicious.
All of it.

146
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:33,660
A wonderful thing to eat if
you're fucking 14 years old.

147
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,980
But if you're 44, it's not
a good scene. So anyways,

148
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:42,720
I finally get into the um, the
hotel. Oh, we have a package for you.

149
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,930
Look at the package is the package and
look at the package and it's the fucking

150
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,840
pro bowl tickets that I'm not going to.
And I hand them over to my buddy,

151
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,270
a fucking Rosebowl legend Jason Law head.
He takes him out.

152
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,140
They like glowing that shit and pulp
fiction. And I'm like, and I'm in my head,

153
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,810
I'm like, dude, you've got to put those
things away. I didn't say it. I was like,

154
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,480
Oh yeah, it's great man. I have a great
time. I heard they're great seats.

155
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:08,460
You fucking cook. True. Um, so whatever,

156
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,900
oh, I forgot this part. I
come walking out of the, uh,

157
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,160
the diner and that homeless guy I saw
sitting there who looked like Kenny

158
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:19,621
Rogers,

159
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:24,030
if he never got the plastic surgery
and like lived outside since the Nixon

160
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,700
administration, right? He's
sitting there and when I come out,

161
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:30,900
there's a security guard there,
you know, no gun, no authority.

162
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,770
He's just sent out their baby face.
He's like fucking 21 years old.

163
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,620
And I could see his body language
like God, Jesus Christ, right?

164
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,710
And all I hear is the homeless
guy lie. No, I'm not leaving

165
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,180
Chevy to jail cause I don't want to.

166
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,430
And you see the kid like, dude,
I really don't want to fight.

167
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,660
You think I want to do this job.
Somebody sent me out of here and I'm just,

168
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:57,650
and I just start fucking
laughing to myself because I,

169
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,190
for some reason I didn't think I was
good. You know, I'm going to Hawaii.

170
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,950
I feel like I'm going to paradise.
It's not going to be homeless people here.

171
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:06,770
It's fucking paradise. Right.
And, and it was the same shit,

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,660
the same shit or was an air in an area.

173
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,460
I felt like I was going to get mugged.

174
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,940
I found out later that there's a bunch
of hookers in that area. I was like,

175
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:21,710
we talked about this, a bunch of a
people with kids. They're like, no, no.

176
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:25,400
At night, at night they all come
out. And I was just like, you know,

177
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,060
how did they get out there?
You know,

178
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,190
how many dicks did they
suck to get out there?

179
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:34,790
And like how many fucking a,
I dunno, a spiritual change.

180
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,930
How long were you begging?

181
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,090
So we tried to tell me that cities put
their homeless guys on planes and fly

182
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:45,570
them out there. Like they say, said
they call it the rainbow project.

183
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:49,020
And I didn't believe that for a fucking
second. And I didn't give a shit.

184
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:52,380
If you send me documented proof,
there's no fucking way.

185
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,490
You get a crazy homeless guy and
all his funk on a fucking plane

186
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,200
get out. They can still
refuse your service. No Way.

187
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:06,201
He's coming on there with this fucking
horrific feet and elbows and all the,

188
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,510
you know, there's no way. There's no way.

189
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:12,330
And plus the guy's going to fucking
have a seizure by the time he gets there

190
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,560
from alcohol withdrawal,

191
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,460
you know those amps stells they sell
on the plane are going to help him.

192
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,770
But you know what I think it is.

193
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,010
I think it's just being around
the beach like a beach bum.

194
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,950
There's something about being
around the beach like, yeah,

195
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:30,840
I'll get to it tomorrow.
You know? Yeah, it did.

196
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,900
I did. I pay Red AG. Can't remember nick
scene or you're homeless. The it guy,

197
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:38,640
you know, give a fuck whether it's
nice sleep under a palm tree. You know,

198
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,040
I don't, I wasn't even there long
enough. So I did my show at this place,

199
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,210
the Republic Republic, and it was
the shit crowd was fucking awesome.

200
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,060
Sold out.
Thank you to everybody who came out.

201
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,820
I'm definitely coming back with
some of the best energy. I,

202
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,770
I've had it a show since I can remember
people were so psyched that somebody

203
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:03,580
from the mainland flu,
flu is pastey ass all the way out there.

204
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,990
I ran into one guy, he like flew
over from another island. Um,

205
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,230
and it was like, it was
locals, it wasn't Taurus.

206
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,920
And I found the couple of times
I've performed on islands,

207
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,640
people who live on islands a
fucking cool as hell. You know,

208
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,410
I did a Gig on Nantucket, uh, last
year, you know, and I met up, you know,

209
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,560
fishermen and Pete,

210
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,740
people who are there year round through
all the weather and all that shit.

211
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,440
It's just a, they're good people
man. So I had a great time there. Uh,

212
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,700
finished my show, you
know, whored myself out,

213
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:40,750
sold the DVD, smiling and waving. I
had two beers, went back to the hotel,

214
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,240
slept for four and a half,
five hours,

215
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,500
got on a fucking plane and flew right
back. Oh wait, wait. I bought a magnet

216
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,680
to prove like technically I can't
even say I was there cause I didn't do

217
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:54,041
anything.

218
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,300
I did walk down to the beach for half
a second and took a picture of myself,

219
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,530
whichever deadly is called a selfie.
I learned that on Chelsea.

220
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,840
Peretti is Twitter,
it's called the Selfie.

221
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,470
I took one of those with a mountain in
the background sorta for the bunch of

222
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:12,280
buildings and uh, but
you know, the upside was,

223
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,020
uh, sold out. The crowd was awesome.

224
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,540
I'm definitely gonna come back and,
uh,

225
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,570
I think that there is going to
be another pro bowl because, uh,

226
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,440
I guess the game was, was
you know, a bunch of scoring.

227
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:29,340
They were sort of hitting and I think
the NFL was just sort of threatening the

228
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,460
players. Like, Hey, quit
fucking dog in the entire game.

229
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,130
Cause it's an embarrassment to the league,
you know,

230
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,150
how about a mild concussion?

231
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,850
Can you give that up for the league
just so we can keep this thing going?

232
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:43,460
You know, so it isn't a total fucking
embarrassment what or whatever.

233
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,480
I had a great time when
I was out there. The, uh,

234
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,250
I don't know what the fuck I landed at 12.
I left the next morning at five.

235
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,400
What is that, 17 hours,
you know? [inaudible] um,

236
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,050
yeah,

237
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,100
yeah.
Then I flew back.

238
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:05,180
I did a fucking acting gig where they
put some glued some shit to my face.

239
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,140
Did that this morning,

240
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:11,141
and then I flute fucking back here
and I'll do my podcast and uh,

241
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,230
Neil was giving me shit. You kind
of do the podcast. Oh, you know,

242
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,270
they do that. Like she, I
don't know, women are great.

243
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,750
They just want to hang out if he would,
if you're just doing it with them.

244
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,830
Like she actually does actually reality
show that she's watching right now that

245
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,640
I can watch because it's a
bunch of, I dunno, you know,

246
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:36,240
it's a bunch of morons, but they're morons
that I can relate to. Um, all right.

247
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:39,060
What are we doing here? I'm going to
make sure I do the fucking advertising.

248
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:43,110

week. Um, all right everybody,

Do you know what's coming up this

311
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,100
dude,
who do you like?

312
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,870
This is what I'm doing for the Super Bowl.
All right?

313
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,260
I have to work the day of the
Superbowl. Believe it or not. Alright.

314
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,210
Old twinkle toes. Just
finishing up an acting gay.
Karen. Speaking of acting gigs,

315
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,720
um, I have a movie coming out or
there's a movie coming out that I'm in.

316
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,030
It's not my movie,
it's a movie I'm happy to be in.

317
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,410
It's called standup guys comes
out February 1st. All right.

318
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:56,490
Stars,
Al Pachino,

319
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:01,491
Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin and
old Billy red faces walking by in the

320
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:05,070
background for a couple of scenes.
Do not blink. You will miss me.

321
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,120
But do you remember back in April of
last year when the podcast was late and

322
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,060
everybody was given me a ton
of shit about it and I said,

323
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,820
you wait Nate fucking months.
I'm gonna have the greatest excuse ever.

324
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,850
I was late that day because I was in a
scene with a Al Pachino and Christopher

325
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,920
Walken a right? So go fuck
yourself. That's why it was like,

326
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,610
how do you like that? How do you like
them apples? Huh? I'm a Boston guy.

327
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,260
Can I say that?
I grew up in the suburbs.

328
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,690
You can only say that
if you're from Southie

329
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,580
anyways. Um, I'll be working
on the day of the Superbowl,

330
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:40,780
but I don't give a shit because,
uh,

331
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,230
in my limited wisdom, I think I've, I've,

332
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:48,200
I've figured out how to watch
the super bowl. All right.

333
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,540
Not only do you watch it by yourself,
okay, so most important game of the year,

334
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:57,830
it's for the championship. He's fucking
guys, they're playing a game. Wait,

335
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,140
they're going to die. Oh, by the rugby.

336
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:03,510
People are paying attention to the
level of concussions are right.

337
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:08,250
They are leading with your shoulders and
no pads. Not saying he not tough. Okay.

338
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,910
Okay.

339
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,910
I think this finally proves that American
football is the most psycho fucking

340
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,190
sport there is that psycho sport.
But you know what I mean?

341
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,860
I wouldn't even say it's tougher
than rugby ball sports. A tough,

342
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:25,550
but like the whole thing that English
people, and they always say that, oh,

343
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:27,290
they got helmets on their fucking pussies.

344
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,790
All the helmet does is make you think
that you're protected and you use it as a

345
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:32,420
weapon,

346
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,320
but your fucking brains in there in the
fucking water and it's slam it all over

347
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:39,890
your head. And then when you're 40,
you shoot yourself in the chest,

348
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,641
you know,
so,

349
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:45,230
so the scientists can fucking look at
your brain and figure what's going on in

350
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:49,000
there. The rugby people do
that 40 I don't think you do.

351
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,680
I think he's still running around out on
the pitch with the fucking masking tape

352
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:57,670
around your ears. As far
as my research goes, sorry.

353
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,720
Every once in a while I get to
wake those cuts up. Um, so anyways,

354
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:07,090
this is how I'm going to watch the super
bowl. You got to watch it by yourself.

355
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,220
You got to get away from the
fucking, the, the, the, the I,

356
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,100
all the brides that come over,
including the, the fucking guy broads,

357
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,060
you know the ones who don't watch football
and they just show up for the dip and

358
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:19,450
they're there.

359
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,940
They're there with the fucking
chicks they're trying to get laid in.

360
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:23,770
Your fucking house is
basically what they're doing.

361
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,220
They talked during the game and they shut
up during the commercial and then when

362
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,640
the game comes back on the like, I didn't
like that one. I thought that was good.

363
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:33,310
How much do you make that cost?
Right.

364
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,380
And meanwhile you can't
even watch the fucking game.

365
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,590
And then every fucking year they got
to have some Waylon whore or some agent

366
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:45,901
fucking rockstar with hair plugs come
out there for one last fucking swing at

367
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:50,470
glory.
So this is what you do.

368
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,110
People invite you to the, Hey, wait, what
are you doing for a soup bowl? Eh, ah,

369
00:21:56,111 --> 00:22:00,460
you know what? I'm, I'm mum going,
Nah, I got this thing I got to do.

370
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,630
Ah, yeah, I got to go out in the
woods, come up with something.

371
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,570
Or just just, you know what? Why are you
going to lie? I'm watching it by myself.

372
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,040
Why are you going to do that? Because
I want to watch the game. That's why.

373
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,080
All right, so now you've eliminated
all the clients that are that,

374
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,490
that are going to be in your living room.

375
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,660
Now that's stage one of the cont removal.

376
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,130
Stage two is to get rid of the country
you don't want to see that are on the

377
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,710
television.
And this is the most important part.

378
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,320
You record the fucking game. I know a lot
of people already do this ship of this.

379
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:41,500
People who don't, okay, so just bear
with me. He record the fucking game.

380
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,970
You shut up, you fucking cell
phone. You don't answer your phone.

381
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:49,090
You don't go on your computer,
all right?

382
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,900
And you just as is. The whole rest of
the world is watching somebody lip syncs,

383
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:55,930
some prerecorded.

384
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,540
Hey
Brad,

385
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,770
whatever the fuck they do,
write the fucking Jessica.

386
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,210
Go right over the fucking top.
You know what he did downstairs?

387
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:13,010
Spackle on a wall. Wait for
that red. That pink spackle,

388
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:15,440
the turn white so you can
sand that fucker down. Right?

389
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,750
But a little God damn pain on it.
Nobody knows.

390
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,140
Nobody knows from last year
when you punched the wall,

391
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:25,940
cause that fucking douche wouldn't shut
up during the game and he was double

392
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:28,310
dipping. You fucking put your
hand through. I'll fix that thing.

393
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Patch that hole in the wall is everybody
is watching Huey Lewis and the news

394
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:34,590
went

395
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,440
Bam,
Bam.

396
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,210
Try to fucking kick off the game. Whoever
the fuck they got this year, right?

397
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,233
Okay.

398
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,580
They got Beyonce is going to sing whatever
the hell she's going to do with the

399
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:47,414
whole halftime.

400
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,170
She shouldn't be there unless she's
watching the why is she out there?

401
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,890
What you're going to get y'all out there?
A little glitter hot pants. You know,

402
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,270
I don't want to see that shit. So what
you do is you just let the game go.

403
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,540
Let it go for a good, I don't
know, 90 minutes, two hours.

404
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,790
Then you sit down like you
control the universe. Like you,

405
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,260
Jesus walking on the water,

406
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:14,180
except you sitting in your fucking chair
and you turn that fucker on and you hit

407
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,860
fast forward one, two, three,

408
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:18,440
four and you watch all the talking
heads and then you'd get your fucking,

409
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:21,230
you watch watching fast
Mohsen Adam and the ants,

410
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,850
whoever the fuck they have opened up.

411
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,240
Maybe Metallica sing in
a fucking Tom Petty Song.

412
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,900
Maybe Tom Petty's there with
them and that fucking, uh, uh,

413
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,970
would it hell's his name there?
Lou Reed.

414
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,910
Maybe he's out there singing and who the
fuck knows? That seems to be the thing.

415
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:36,020
You have the old people first,

416
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,240
then he gets some young hottie during
halftime sitting there with her tits

417
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:44,270
hanging out. Isn't that what
you're dealt? That's America. Um,

418
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,590
you fast forward to all that fucking
shit and the beginning and he just get

419
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:52,160
right to the kickoff.
You just watched the game at your leisure,

420
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,500
at your fucking leisure.

421
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:58,040
And then you know what happens after the
first half and they start wheeling that

422
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,410
big dumb fucking stage out there.

423
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,340
And every douche bag we ever had a
fucking dream of dancing is fucking,

424
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:09,341
you just taken up a whole football field
of fucking singers and dancers the most

425
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:13,240
and football fucking thing you
could possibly have. You know,

426
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:16,340
and everybody who talked to her in the
first half, they're all shutting up.

427
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,140
They're sitting there
on their fucking knees,

428
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,380
two feet from your fucking
breathing on your flat screen.

429
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,020
You now like it's the beginning
of the Mickey Mouse Club,

430
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:25,310
and they get their fucking ears on.

431
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,920
You fast forward through all of that shit
and he'd just go right in and then you

432
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:33,860
know what happens is you never
lose the flow of the game

433
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,523
now

434
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,720
before you're not.

435
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,600
Why don't you invite a couple people
over who want to do it that way?

436
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,790
People who want to shut the fuck
up real fence. And I suggest this,

437
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,090
if you want to sound intelligent to the
people that you're going to watch the

438
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:49,630
game with,

439
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,520
I highly recommend buying the sports
illustrated this week that has both of the

440
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:58,870
Har Brother harbor brothers. However, the
fuck you say their names on the cover,

441
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,510
both phenomenal coaches. Obviously they're
there in the Superbowl and Goddamn it,

442
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:07,840
they both of them,
if their teams didn't fuck up,

443
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:10,420
I know it's a big if 49,

444
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:13,330
it's didn't drop three fucking punch
or whatever the hell it did last year.

445
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,741
And uh,
you know,

446
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,540
at the Ravens did what they miss a
fucking extra point or something. I came,

447
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,360
it was like a chip shot, um, that,

448
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:24,950
that would have been back to back
years with them. Who knows them.

449
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,340
They both would've gone and then they
would've partied too much and then they

450
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:29,710
would have sucked this year.
That's what happens. But whatever.

451
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,813
MMM.

452
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,410
Anyways,

453
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,410
so they got this great article where they
break down the game at a level that I

454
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,280
wish I could,
I knew more of.

455
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,130
MMM.
They got

456
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,510
this thing and they
remember, remember one, uh,

457
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:46,800
what the fuck his name was going to say?

458
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:49,380
Hammer Lik been watching
too much fucking hockey.

459
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,680
What's the name of the a cam. Cameron.
The fuck's the name of the quarterback.

460
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,640
Kaepernick. What's his name?
Chris Kaepernick. Chip Kaepernick.

461
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,960
Uh, creepy Kaepernick. Whatever the fuck
his name is. The guy's the shit you don't,

462
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:11,460
when he was running wild like fucking
hulk Hogan against the Green Bay packers.

463
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,140
Basically he was, uh, they were,
they were breaking down that play,

464
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,010
trying to see if they will
be able to run it. And they,

465
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,160
it's called the zone read
and they run it out of the,

466
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,730
the pistol alignment.
How cool is that?

467
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,410
Which is basically the shotgun formation,
but you're closer to the center.

468
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,060
So they call it the pistol alignment.

469
00:27:35,061 --> 00:27:37,520
You've got to tail back right
behind you and this is what happens.

470
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,430
You hiked the ball,
quarterback turns around,

471
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:45,390
he puts the ball right in the
fucking bread basket of the tailback.

472
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,180
And right there.
He does his zone read,

473
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:50,850
which basically means he looks at that
defensive end of the linebacker who's

474
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,160
supposed to seal off the edge and
he basically does a quick read.

475
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,600
If the fucking guy holds his ground,
he just hands,

476
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,230
he continues handing the ball
off to the fucking tail back.

477
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,400
But if the fucking guy on the Ed
bites on it and starts to pension,

478
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,540
you pull it back and you fucking
run around, run around the side.

479
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,753
There you go.

480
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,960
Let's call the zone read from the pistol
alignment and the point where you're

481
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:20,990
holding the ball, almost giving
it to tailback but not really.

482
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,050
But maybe you had Ghana,
that's called the mesh point.

483
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,890
I wish I knew this shit. I really did.
But they have like 10 pages on this shit.

484
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:33,090
Talking about the ravens
defense, their running game, eh,

485
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,440
was absolutely fascinating.

486
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,560
So much better than watching a ESPN and
watching herm Edwards screaming or that

487
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:45,640
guy with the hair and the cold
pizza yelling, you know, you know,

488
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,970
he always sucked in gym class.
He reeks of it, reeks of it.

489
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:53,110
He looks like he's good at like
rich white guys sports like uh,

490
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,020
I'd say Polo but he's so fucking short.

491
00:28:56,021 --> 00:28:58,270
He'd probably fall off the
horse trying to hit that goal.

492
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:01,570
I think maybe my badminton.
There you go. Bad Man.

493
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,780
Maybe he's good at Badman but um,

494
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,450
this is like everything you want to know
without the screaming and yelling and

495
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:10,060
I'm really being a nerd right now
because I'm basically saying the book is

496
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:11,290
better than the movie but uh,

497
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:15,700
I highly recommend reading that shit and
then watching the game by yourself and

498
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:17,560
seeing if he can pick
out the pistol alignment.

499
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,100
Yeah,

500
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,940
the zone read and the pistol
alignment, you know, I dunno.

501
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,410
That type of Shit excites me.

502
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,700
Don't you want to know what the
cover too is for once in your life?

503
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,140
Don't you wish you could watch football?

504
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:33,620
These fucking assholes playing fantasy
football and fucking with their faces two

505
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,840
inches from the God damn screen.
Memorize and stats.

506
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,000
Wouldn't you want to be up in the stands?

507
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,830
Being able to see what each is doing

508
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,800
and how teams are adjusting.
Like last week it was like,

509
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,130
or two weeks ago when the
49 is where all of this,

510
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:51,760
they were down 14 nothing or something
crazy and all of a sudden it just stopped

511
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:55,750
and they came back and every
goal, Kaepernick, Kaepernick,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

512
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,600
I'm reading this fucking
article and the uh,

513
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:03,100
one of the offensive coordinators
or the 49 is like, Nah,
you know, after, you know,

514
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,870
bought a quarter,
quarter and a half,

515
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:09,100
we kind of saw what they were doing and
then we adjusted to it. Then you're like,

516
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,330
oh,
that's what happened.

517
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,870
Okay.

518
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,530
I just stopped the momentum changed
magic. Like I watch it. It's such a,

519
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm a ball watcher. I
hate it. I hate that I am,

520
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,020
I wish I could sit up in the stands. It'd
be like, oh, it's a fucking, you know,

521
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,520
I don't know any other defense other than
cover too. I love when, what's his face?

522
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,580
I actually hate it when Gruten starts
talking about the defenses and stuff.

523
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:32,600
They got eight girls and the books and
they start throwing up this terminology.

524
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:34,730
It's like, why don't you
fucking tell me what it means?

525
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,973
You know,

526
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,150
I dunno. Bill, why don't you utilize
the Internet and fucking look it up?

527
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:44,360
I'm sure there's a youtube video bought
it. Okay, you got me. So anyways,

528
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:49,340
that's how I'm watching the, uh, that's
how I'm watching the Superbowl thoughts.

529
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:53,120
Anyone, anybody, is this even remotely
fucking interesting? I don't, I don't,

530
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:56,600
you know, whatever you, you know my
policy, I always tape in the morning.

531
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,340
I never take on days when
I flew on a fucking plane,

532
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:03,650
but I had no choice because I
had to fly today. All right. Um,

533
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,170
all right, last piece of advertising

534
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,440
he voices what busy professionals
use to save time and to work smarter.

535
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,430

to texts and sends it directly to your

536
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:17,210
cell phone.

537
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,810
No more interrupting your day to check
your voicemail or waiting till after a

538
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:24,320
meeting to find out what's
going on. Uh, with he voice.

542
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,530
You could have literally ended the
NHL lockout with 94 participants.

543
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:44,090
That's gotta be every owner plus, uh,

Back to the podcast here. Uh, what
else did I want to talk about? Oh,

555
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:22,280
I saw a good documentary this week.
This is more me reminiscing about my week.

556
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:23,870
Okay.

557
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,650
Sort of a verbal diary, audio diary. Um,

558
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,660
I saw this a new
documentary on Ginger Baker,

559
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,320
which is funny.
I used to listen to when I was growing up,

560
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,980
Ginger Baker and I thought it was just
a nickname. This is before ginger,

561
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,200
that term jump the ocean
and came over here, uh,

562
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,410
from Ireland, Scotland and
England. He was a red headed dude,

563
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,860
Ginger Baker or whatever. So the
name of this podcast, a podcast,

564
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,870
the made this documentary is beware of
Mr. Baker and I don't care if you play

565
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:01,010
drums or not, there's no way
you're not going to enjoy this.

566
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:04,070
This guy's one of the most interesting
human beings have ever seen in my life.

567
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,420
You guys think I'm a crabby old
fucking man. You got to see this guy.

568
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,040
Yeah.

569
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,280
And He trashes John Bonham.

570
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,350
Okay.

571
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,190
He trashes them and I'm going to say
what he says here in about five seconds.

572
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:22,770
So fast forward if you don't
want me to ruin it. But uh,

573
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,020
for those of you who don't play drums,

574
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,720
nobody trashes John Boehner
unless you just some troll.

575
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,250
I'm trying to Piss people off
on the Internet. It's like he's,

576
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:34,550
he's the fucking king as far
as rock drummers go to guys,
the king, it's, you know,

577
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:38,270
there, there is definitely the WHO's
better Barnum apart and they argue,

578
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:42,260
but nobody ever says that Bonham
sucks if you're just being a Douche.

579
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,150
But Ginger Baker actually,

580
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,960
they asked him what he thought about John
Bonham and I guess people trashed you

581
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,630
on the Internet because
there's so many constant.

582
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,160
But anytime you ever asked a drummer,
a rock drummer about John [inaudible],

583
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,070
they all just in hush
tones speak of the power,

584
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,200
his swing,
his feel,

585
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:07,370
his subtlety is originality
is the triplets,

586
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:09,500
the single bass drum,
the whole fucking thing.

587
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,970
Ed Ginger Baker said John Bonam
couldn't swing a sack of shit.

588
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,370
It was one of the fucking, I,
my jaw was almost on the ground.

589
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:29,210
I couldn't fucking believe it.
And I just burst out laughing.

590
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,250
I've never

591
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,080
do you hear somebody who's considered
a god just dismissed like that.

592
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,960
And then even like Clapton,

593
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,030
he didn't shit on Barna but like
clapped and they were like, you know,

594
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,530
how do you compare bottom to Ginger
Baker? And he was just like, ah Nah, Nah.

595
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:49,610
He's like, you know, it's not even
a, basically it's not even a contest.

596
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,510
Ginger Baker was a fully formed musician,

597
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,990
a composer and [inaudible]
and all this type of stuff.

598
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:58,950
Okay.

599
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,950
I Dunno, it just for me, I don't like,

600
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,810
I mean I've actually looked at
photos online and considered blue,

601
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,320
having them blown up and hanging them in
my house of John Bonham and that's like

602
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:13,830
what I think of them and just
to hear somebody just, you know,

603
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,500
basically he's like my Lance Armstrong,

604
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,400
like you know something like
from my Lance Armstrong moment,

605
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:23,730
you know when those people got all
disappointed, like what do I tell my kids?

606
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,360
My Lance Armstrong moment would be if I
found out that in the studio he actually

607
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:32,460
played a double pedal or
a double bass drum nine.

608
00:35:32,461 --> 00:35:35,310
All lot of you guys are going to show
that picture of him with the double bass

609
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:40,050
drum set up. I know the story that
that was all when he first got the kit,

610
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,500
when,
what's his face hooked him up with it.

611
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,270
This is so fucking inside at this point.

612
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:50,570
You'd have to be a drama to even like
any of this carbon apathy car mine apathy

613
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,350
or a PC of have like 58 different
pronunciations of their last name.

614
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:59,010
He had a deal with Ludwig and I think
bottom initially was playing Slingerlands

615
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,210
and Karma and got him in with Ludwig and
he got the same set up that car might

616
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:05,461
had.

617
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:09,570
So he had the double bass and he brought
it to like one rehearsal and the other

618
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:12,090
guys in the band just kept
taking the other bass drum out.

619
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,560
Just go and you don't need it.
It's cluttering up everything. Um,

620
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,190
I really can't imagine him
playing a double bass drum
set. He would have fucking

621
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,490
drowned out the whole God damn bed.
Um,

622
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,370
but whatever anybody thinks
he doesn't have a fast foot,

623
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:31,850
just watch him at Royal Albert Hall
in 1970 then he can go fuck yourself.

624
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,690
But evidently ginger Baker says
he couldn't swing a sack of shit,

625
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:37,940
which just killed me.
Um,

626
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,750
if you just want to see a fucking
angry redhead playing drums,

627
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,760
because I haven't made any drum videos,
right,

628
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,633
Jeff,

629
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,220
this is the guy. This is the
real deal. Uh, it's called, uh,

630
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,770
beware of Mr. Baker,
um,

631
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,270
underrated listening to ginger
Baker for a fucking hour and a half.

632
00:36:58,271 --> 00:37:00,610
It was awesome.
And then I actually watched some of the,

633
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,200
the comeback shows that they had,

634
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,970
the one at Royal Albert Hall and he was
fucking unbelievable drums just sounded

635
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:11,620
amazing and incredible player. Uh, but
that's just the tip of the iceberg.

636
00:37:11,621 --> 00:37:12,460
It's just how he lives,

637
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:16,990
his life going broke and just
moving on from relationships. Um,

638
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,710
really an amazing documentary.
So anyways, with that,

639
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:22,150
let's get to some of your questions here.

640
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:25,930
I feel like I've been running my mouth
here for fucking almost 40 minutes here.

641
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,210
Um, Bill heard you love drinking.
Hey Man, heard you love to drink.

642
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,550
And I agreed.
Drinkings great.

643
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,700
But I haven't been handling
my liquor too well of late.

644
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,840
I've been getting blackout drunk every
night for a while now except for a week.

645
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:45,430
What did we, you blacked out drunk
when you wrote this? I've been getting,

646
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:49,570
I've been getting blackout drunk every
night for a while now, except for a week,

647
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:52,960
maybe a month here and there. Okay.
There we go. That was on me. Sorry. What?

648
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:56,050
I want to remember things that have
actually happened and not just night

649
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:59,620
terrorists. Any tips on
drinking? Semi responsible.

650
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,630
Um,

651
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:06,340
I really would like to continue to use
it as a social lubricant and overall good

652
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:11,320
time liquid. Thanks for the free
rank, right? Uh, you're welcome. Um,

653
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,160
okay.

654
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,700
I've been getting blackout drunk
every night for a while now. Ah, dude,

655
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:21,380
you sound like a, I'm, I love to
drink, but I don't get blackout drunk.

656
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,510
I get just to the point
where I say something I wish
I didn't say and I don't do

657
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:30,260
it every night.
I'm getting blackout drunk every night.

658
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,640
It depends on your age. I mean, if you're
like, I don't know, seven. Yeah, 18,

659
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,930
18 and you just discovered alcohol
and you, you're fucking, you know,

660
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,240
drinking the way you fuck
90 miles an hour. Um,

661
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,740
that's the only semi scary.
Even that scary, but a, yeah.

662
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:54,480
Do blackout drunk is some serious shit.
Um, I dunno, I would talk to somebody a,

663
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,970
I dunno what I would do if I was getting
blackout drunk every fucking night.

664
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:04,770
I think I would quit for a while.
Well,

665
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:08,300
I get to a point where I just embarrass
myself too much and then I just need to

666
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:12,950
like back off. Um, I've been
really big on bare lately.

667
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:16,400
I go back and forth between Scotch and
beer and I got into beer and I got into

668
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:19,940
the whole fancy fucking beers
now back to beer that I like.

669
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,780
My Dad drank and my friends'
dads drank when I was a kid.

670
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:25,850
So it was basically beer that we stole.

671
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,330
So every once in a while go back to beers
and I drank in high school and I drink

672
00:39:29,331 --> 00:39:33,650
them. And it's this weird sort of like,
you know, I don't want to taste it.

673
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,620
I just think about, I always pictured,
you know, just drinking in the woods.

674
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,920
The cops did the cops coming.
Um, so yeah, that would be,

675
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,180
that would be my, uh, look,
if you're not an alcoholic,

676
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,010
I would just monitor your drinking,

677
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:53,190
but if you're getting blackout drunk
every night, you might have a problem.

678
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,790
So I wouldn't want to tell you how to
drink semi responsibly because if you're

679
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,880
an alcoholic, you're not going to. Um,

680
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:05,060
so I would explore a little more your
level of addiction and when you figure

681
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:08,400
that out,
I would then act accordingly.

682
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,500
And if you figure out
that you're an alcoholic,

683
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:14,580
I would try and quit drinking as soon as
possible because it will ruin your life.

684
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,340
Uh,
believe me,

685
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,380
I said something fucking horrible
this weekend after I did my shows,

686
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:23,940
it was only after like two beers.

687
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,113
Okay.

688
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,380
I'm going to try to figure out how to
tell this story without outing anybody in

689
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:34,170
it. I'm sitting there, I haven't
drank since two girls come up. Ah,

690
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:39,130
you a funny, but blah blah. Hey, thanks
a lot. How long you staying out here? Uh,

691
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:42,580
I got to leave in five hours. What
are you a fucking moron? Yes I am.

692
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,330
That type of shit.
And so they pointed this girl,

693
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:48,970
she's like the girl next door
going, hey, you know what she does?

694
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,220
What do you think she does?
And I was listening. You say,

695
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:53,320
I can get a read and I just
couldn't get a read on this girl.

696
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,780
I don't know what she did.

697
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,960
She looked like she would
just work in customer service,

698
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:00,430
but there was something
different about her,

699
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:05,410
but it was because she looked like
that I couldn't, uh, she just like,

700
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,860
she just get a regular job, you
know, get married, become a mom,

701
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,430
one of those people that just happy so
they don't need to go out and try to

702
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:16,630
achieve some stupid fucking goals so
they can then get trashed on Twitter.

703
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,270
So anyways,
they go,

704
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,360
she actually flies those
giant cargo planes with like
the three tanks in the bag

705
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:31,270
that they drop out with the
fucking parachutes. And I'm
like, are you shitting me?

706
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:35,610
Like that's all right. I'm blown away.

707
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:38,580
And then she points at her friend
and goes, hey, this is my friend. Uh,

708
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,870
she used to be a cheerleader for this
professional football team, right?

709
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,710
They tell me that and now I'm thinking
bullshit. I'm like, all right,

710
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:50,710
you're a fucking pilot. Not saying
the other girl wasn't good looking,

711
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:54,340
but I'm kind of drunk at
this point because I haven't
eaten. Only had two beers.

712
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:56,920
That was the thing, only had two
fucking peers, but even a two beers,

713
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,490
the level of asshole. I am
at stone sober, two beers in,

714
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,930
I say to law head, I go, I just, you
know, kind of whisper to him. I go,

715
00:42:04,931 --> 00:42:08,490
there's no way. She was a
cowboys cheerleader. She,

716
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,350
her rack isn't big enough and
then she just goes clear as day.

717
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,990
Did you just say my rack isn't big enough.

718
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,890
It felt like a fucking ass hole.
Then I'm thinking,

719
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:22,300
I thought I whispered that evidently
I yelled at over the fucking music.

720
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,550
Um, and then I had to try
and talk my way out of that.

721
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:30,610
I wasn't saying she wasn't good looking,
but you know, you watch him on TV,

722
00:42:30,611 --> 00:42:32,650
they make it look like they
all got fucking, you know,

723
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:39,010
fucking very least 34 c all
the way up to d cup titties.

724
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,450
The make look perfect. Most of them are
probably fake. It's like the fake teeth.

725
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,560
I told her, I said, look, every out
there has fake titties and Dallas,

726
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:51,490
this is be flailing trying to get out
of it or trying to, like, I felt bad.

727
00:42:51,491 --> 00:42:54,580
I should just apologize. It wasn't drunk
really. You can't apologize for that.

728
00:42:54,581 --> 00:42:59,200
I said it, she heard it. I'm an
asshole. But when I did say I go,

729
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,730
it's like the fake titty
capitol of the world.

730
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,550
She did give me a high five
and I thought it was fine.

731
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,270
But later on when I walked out, I
walked by, I think it was her husband,

732
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,800
she had a wedding ring on and I walked
by this guy and I thought he was waving

733
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:12,031
to many.

734
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:15,190
He holds up a cell phone and I see that
there's a picture of a Dallas cowboy

735
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:18,190
cheerleader on, on it. So
I think it was his wife,

736
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,120
which means she went over and told him,
and I want to thank that guy.

737
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,390
She told you and you didn't smash a
bottle over my head. I really want to,

738
00:43:25,391 --> 00:43:29,860
I appreciate it. My fault. Uh,
next time I come out there,

739
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:30,840
I'll buy you some

740
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,020
fucking,
I dunno what,

741
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:35,710
whatever the Poo Poo platter or whatever
the fuck they have about their brutal.

742
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,740
So that's why I tried to drink at home.

743
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,750
You know, what am I gonna do?
Say something rude to my dog.

744
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,523
Oh Geez.

745
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,650
I'm really too old to have continued
to have new stories like this. Anyways.

746
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:52,550
All right, Bill, what's my move?

747
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:57,150
I'm a sophomore in college and not very
experienced with relationships. Um,

748
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,620
I met this girl about three weeks ago
in class and she seems pretty cool.

749
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:05,060
We've been hanging out progressively more
often during the last couple of weeks.

750
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,720
I feel like I've been getting signs
from her, but I'm pretty confused now.

751
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:13,940
She comes to my room and we hang out
on the bed lying close to each other.

752
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,870
Oh God, Dude. She's waiting
for you to make a move.
That's what your next move is.

753
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:18,704
Make a move.

754
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,540
We hang out on my bed line close to each
other and do homework or watch a movie

755
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:29,250
or whatever. She also texts me every
day. So yesterday we kissed for the first

756
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,650
hi gay.

757
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,003
Right?

758
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,710
Well they bring in the substitute guy
and all those nerves that keeping scores,

759
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,340
I fucking erasing shit.
You know?

760
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:46,230
Now batting how virgin out
of the boy in Iowa. Um,

761
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,070
anyway, so, so yesterday we kissed
for the first time before she left,

762
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,440
about 20 minutes after I get a text
from her with about six paragraphs

763
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,860
explaining how she kind
of has a boyfriend,

764
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,790
but he treats her like shit.
So it's pretty much over.

765
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:09,190
Ah, Jesus. You know what?
There's always a price to pay.

766
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,590
No matter what you do. It's like that
guy who doesn't want to drink anymore.

767
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,420
I want you to taper it down.

768
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,990
This is a price he's going to pay
and the price he's going to pay is,

769
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:23,260
he's going to be sitting there doing
the right thing, not drinking, wishing

770
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,640
okay.

771
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,250
That he could just sit there
and fucking pound 20 beers,

772
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,483
you know?

773
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,770
But he wants to take control
of his fucking life and
the price he has to pay is,

774
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:36,710
he can't ever do that again.
And then there's the other side.

775
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,410
You drank the 20 fucking beers and
then you know the price you pay.

776
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,280
Look at the price I paid after having
to fucking lightweight, you know,

777
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,940
say you go, you finally
make the move, you kiss her.

778
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:51,800
There's always a fucking price.
So you gotta ask yourself sauna,

779
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:55,100
you willing to pay this
price if you continue,

780
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,290
I'm not going to read the rest of
this cause I could tell you right now,

781
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,560
there is possibly a fucking beat down
slash double murder slash maybe double

782
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:10,380
murder suicide at the end
of this Pussy Rainbow.

783
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:12,623
MMM.

784
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,660
Anyways,
I'll read the rest and he goes,

785
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:18,770
and also she explains how she's
not ready for a relationship,

786
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:23,060
but we can still cuddle. I Dunno
about this. Yeah. Fuck this chick.

787
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,050
Okay.

788
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,930
He goes, I'm trying to get my
dick wet, but she also seems cool.

789
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,120
You're trying to get your dick wet.
This dude's not a virgin.

790
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,350
You speak in that you're speaking the
language. You want to get you a dick way?

791
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:38,340
Yeah, you, we have fucking, this
is a pistol fucking formation.

792
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,540
Okay.

793
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:45,450
All right. You kissed her. That's the mesh
point. You got to do a zone read here.

794
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:50,340
What's going on? What's going on right
here? Oh Two oh two right, right, right.

795
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:56,520
Come on to, you know what the fuck
you got to do right now? You don't,

796
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:59,220
you seem like a guy who got laid,
hasn't got laid for a while. So now,

797
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:02,340
or maybe you really liked this girl.
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

798
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,023
All right.

799
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,540
Let me just read the rest of this fucking
thing. It's like two more sentences.

800
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,470
He says, I just don't want to be in the
same position for the next two months.

801
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,490
Should I give a shit about this girl?
And like getting bullshitty. Yeah,

802
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,150
you getting bullshitted.
She wants to get out of the relationship,

803
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:23,820
but she doesn't want to be lonely.
All right.

804
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,410
This is what you should say to say
look. All right. I think, uh, you know,

805
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:31,160
I don't do, I don't kiss girls who, yeah,

806
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,590
boyfriends. I don't do that
stuff and uh, I don't know.

807
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,440
Hang out with them laying on beds.

808
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:40,790
I would love to lay in a bed and kiss
you if you did not have a boyfriend.

809
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,280
So I think it would be best if a,
when that situation clears up,

810
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,863
you know?

811
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,430
Okay.

812
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,770
Then come by, you know,
but you know, wait awhile.

813
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,360
Give the guy an opportunity to see you
know, if he's going to kill you or not.

814
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,600
So I don't get caught in the crossfire
attic, you know, two, three months.

815
00:47:59,601 --> 00:48:00,530
He doesn't kill you.

816
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,800
I know it's safe and I will
gladly bang you and my,

817
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,720
uh, my fucking bed, my single,

818
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,230
that's how I'd handle it. That's how I
should have handled that at your age.

819
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,100
But there weren't podcasts,
so I just had to listen to my deck.

820
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,740
Ah, fuck there. It was. There it was. It
took me 50 fucking minutes to be funny,

821
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:32,650
but there was all right, fiances, x.
Hey bill, I really appreciate the show.

822
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,820
Keeps me sane in the cubicle farm.
Well,

823
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:39,620
God bless you for fucking fighting the
good fight out there now to the meat of

824
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:41,300
the email.
This guy,

825
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,350
he thanks me in like a sentence
and a half and he gets right to it.

826
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:50,060
This is how you do it. People, this
is textbook. Uh, he goes, my fiance,

827
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:52,160
who I loved dearly,
has an ex boyfriend.

828
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:57,161
She maintains a friendship with
fucking drop this bitch right now.

829
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,530
Okay.

830
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,970
Sorry.
Kneejerk reaction.

831
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,600
Continuing listening without prejudice.

832
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,070
I am of the mindset that men and women
cannot maintain that kind of relationship.

833
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:09,904
Thank you.

834
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,130
Okay.

835
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:11,963
Preach on.

836
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,010
Especially if there was some kind
of dating involved in the past.

837
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,560
Uh,
I am not comfortable with this guy

838
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,740
and I am struggling with this. She
was struggling with this shit. I'm,

839
00:49:27,741 --> 00:49:30,110
should I straight out

840
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,990
tell the con I don't like him being
around or do I take the more painful

841
00:49:33,991 --> 00:49:36,090
approach and pretend everything's cool.

842
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:37,840
Okay.

843
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,150
One other quick question.
I have to make a run to New Mexico,

844
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,990
Mexico soon and wanted to snag the name
of that Italian place you were talking

845
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:48,720
about on the podcast
or so. Back ass. Fuck.

846
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,090
You know what?
It's right next to a Hilton Garden Inn.

847
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,320
Okay.

848
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,010
And it begins with a B like Bueno. Blaina,

849
00:49:58,011 --> 00:50:00,590
something like that. Come on. Somebody
in New Mexico helped this guy out.

850
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,913
MMM.

851
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,450
And send it to me and I'll
read it next week off.

852
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:09,500
I'll figure it out by next
week. All right. That's a
promise. But anyways, yeah,

853
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:13,400
dude, you got it. You got, you got
to, this is, this is not cool at all.

854
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,700
It's not cool at all.
All right.

855
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,040
That's not cool at all,
guys.

856
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:24,910
Do not continue being friends with women.

857
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,140
I think women maybe can do it,
but guys can't do it.

858
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,830
He's trying to east trying to fucking,
just going to try to bang her,

859
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,070
do this. Fuck, this is your fiance.
You can't fucking have that.

860
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,780
You can't have that,
you know,

861
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,700
and uh,

862
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,290
this is what you gotta do you gotta tell
her that and when she gets mad and she

863
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:51,520
gets upset, well, I do know trustee
Blahblahblahblah blue, blue, blue.

864
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:56,320
You have to sit there and
totally maintain your cool.

865
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,490
Do not take the bait. If she starts
calling you names, if she's a name,

866
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,410
call and all that,
do not get upset.

867
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,340
Just say that like that
Shit I did in my act.

868
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,500
We will discuss this later when you calm
down. I don't want to argue about this.

869
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,990
Um, I don't think it's fair. The
position you're putting me in and um,

870
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,310
I would never do that to you.

871
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:21,370
I would never hang out with
an ex girlfriend of mine.

872
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,460
All right.
I don't think that that's cool.

873
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,640
So I would appreciate it if
you would not do that anymore.

874
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:31,110
Okay.

875
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:34,020
And if she continues to do it,
then um,

876
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,660
I would marry somebody else personally,

877
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,853
you know,

878
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:45,100
I'm not cool with that and my
relationship, I've had to deal with that.

879
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:50,220
You know, I have had to deal with that
a couple of times. Well, you know,

880
00:51:50,221 --> 00:51:53,780
it was just kind of as a Frito, we took
an acting class and blah, blah, blah. No,

881
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,593
no.

882
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:00,160
I literally had to explain to you think
he's yes. Yes he is. He is tried to.

883
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,830
He has tried to. Yes, exactly.

884
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,773
You know,

885
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,361
or maybe he's,

886
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:11,130
he's hoping that you have hot friends
that he can try and fuck by. You know,

887
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,830
being the guy who hangs out
with the chicks. You know,

888
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:16,350
maybe he's trying to do that,
but he's trying to fuck something.

889
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,830
And if you're the only thing around,
he's going to try and fuck you. So no,

890
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:20,664
it's not cool.

891
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,773
MMM.

892
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,610
Anyways. All right, next one.

893
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:29,050
This is all fucking guys talking
about the ladies this week. Um,

894
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:32,830
stay with girl or not. All right. Hi,
Bill loved the podcast. Thank you.

895
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,560
In a tough situation.
So I would like to know your thoughts.

896
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:38,620
I've been with a girl for five
months in a few weeks into it.

897
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:41,890
She mentioned she had been in a
relationship for five years and he's still

898
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:45,370
friends with the guy. What
the fuck is this? The same
one? I already answered this.

899
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,570
Yeah.

900
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,580
Who I've met and who in a bad dude.

901
00:52:48,581 --> 00:52:53,581
She used to talk to him a
lot so she seemed not over
him and mentioned that they

902
00:52:53,831 --> 00:52:56,530
were basically fuck
buddies since breaking up,

903
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,480
which I don't mind happening but do mine.
Her thinking it's no biggie to tell me.

904
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,340
All right, let me, let me
try and do the math on that.

905
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,370
She mentioned they were basically
fuck buddies since breaking up,

906
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:17,830
which I don't mind happening, but do mind
her thinking it's no biggie to tell me.

907
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:22,410
So you don't mind if she's fucking this
guy on the side. Just don't bring it up.

908
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,970
Wasn't there an R and B song about that?

909
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,260
Okay.

910
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,670
Thinking about, girl, I don't want to know

911
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,370
something.
I can't fucking remember.

912
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:35,720
Anyways. It seemed like it was a
recent breakup, but when I asked her,

913
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,670
she said in a roundabout way, it was
about two years ago, about two months in,

914
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:44,630
she admitted that she had last slept
with them the week after she met me,

915
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,870
which was actually the night of the
day we met up for the first time.

916
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,660
So after our first date,
this sounds dumb,

917
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,330
but otherwise things are good and she's

918
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,450
okay.

919
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,290
Tone talking about him down
sense and is a good girl.

920
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,760
Different to a lot of

921
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:01,150
okay.

922
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:04,330
Ones in my past,
which is why I stayed with her after that.

923
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,230
This girl is fucking your brains out.
That's what's going on.

924
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:13,630
She likes sex and I guarantee you she
fucked this guy at least one more time

925
00:54:13,631 --> 00:54:14,650
after your first date.

926
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,160
Okay.

927
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,850
That does. That's my instinct.
I'm not saying that's true.
That's just my instinct.

928
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:21,403
Anyways,

929
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:26,090
it says I'm 25 and haven't
had a girlfriend before out
of not wanting to settle

930
00:54:26,091 --> 00:54:29,830
and enjoy being single.
Exactly. There we go. Yeah.

931
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:32,510
Haven't had a girlfriend before so you
don't know how to set up a relationship.

932
00:54:32,511 --> 00:54:35,150
Yeah. Cause you're setting
this one up dude. Come on.

933
00:54:35,151 --> 00:54:38,600
You got to have some self worth
here. Okay. Fuck this shit.

934
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,390
This isn't a muddy kids.
She's got a fuck buddy.

935
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,380
Bangs him one time after your first date.
Obviously she wasn't seeing fireworks.

936
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,380
The fuck is she doing with you?
All right.

937
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:50,990
Let her blow you one more time
and show her the fucking door.

938
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,360
Sorry.
Got Emotional.

939
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,410
I'll let the up all this respect
this and I'll read the rest. Uh,

940
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:01,170
though I was getting sick of the single
life when I got with her and we'd be

941
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:04,890
bummed out with the prospect of getting
laid less than once a month. Yeah.

942
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:08,220
You know something.
You're both using each other.

943
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,840
I, you're five months in. I really
hope you're not in love with this girl.

944
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:19,120
Said I have graduated and want to move
out of our city partly to move in with a

945
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:24,040
really good friend who I miss who lives
in interstate and she still has one year

946
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:26,140
to go and doesn't seem keen on moving.

947
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,243
Okay.

948
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:31,730
In your words based on that one incident.
I think I already told you.

949
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,960
I don't think she's going to be the mother
of my children areas and I'll always

950
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:39,350
think of it when I tell people how we met.

951
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,610
I feel like could be missing out on
advancing my career and being with my best

952
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:46,640
friend as I've grown apart
from my other friends,

953
00:55:46,641 --> 00:55:50,090
as well as getting out of my shitty
small town to you think I should move out

954
00:55:50,091 --> 00:55:50,691
and cut this thing.

955
00:55:50,691 --> 00:55:54,770
Short apps a Fuckin lutely and you know
you should get out of your shitty small

956
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:56,720
town. Fuck this, this girl,

957
00:55:56,721 --> 00:56:00,830
she's going to be in that same bar every
fucking Christmas when you come home to

958
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:03,290
visit your parents.
Okay,

959
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,640
she's going to be there and every year
of face is going to get a little fatter

960
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:11,990
and she might have more ink on her fucking
arm and you are going to be moving on

961
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:13,400
with your life.
All right?

962
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:15,740
And then one day you're not gonna
want to go back to that bar.

963
00:56:15,741 --> 00:56:18,590
You just gonna drive by it and
you're going to be like, I want to,

964
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:21,550
if she's in there and you're not going
to give a fuck because the girl you give

965
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,270
your dreams is going to be in your seat
and you're gonna drive right by on this

966
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:29,050
perfectly fucking snow covered road.
There's a picture for you.

967
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,410
But that's only gonna happen if you dump
this whore and get out of that small,

968
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:36,190
Shitty town. All right.
That was a good one, Huh?

969
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,510
Um, okay. All, all of
garden chronicles, Eh,

970
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:46,270
Billy boy. I am a 24 year old part time
college student working at Olive Garden.

971
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,560
And this new chick here has been
a real flirt towards me. Uh,

972
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:55,140
I see just about all the signs. She
always tells me how delicious I smelled.

973
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:59,170
Gross, how bad she wants
to play with my hair. Okay.

974
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:02,020
One time when I was testing out a drink,
she took the glass,

975
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:05,950
rotate it to the part where my
mouth wasn't drank on it from there.

976
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,620
All right. So you know, she swallows.

977
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,900
Um, so what do you plan on
taking old ass to mouth?

978
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:25,870
Sorry. Uh, for some
reason I found that hot.

979
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:30,810
Ah, this guy's fucking hilarious.
Everything about her was, was, uh,

980
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,620
everything about her
was incredible figure,

981
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:37,621
nice tits and glasses made her look
even sexier with her pinned up hair.

982
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:42,160
One big problem. This is
a game changer. She 17.

983
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:48,430
Oh Gee, dude, she's got major
fucking daddy issues. Come on dude.

984
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,230
Okay.

985
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:54,070
There's plenty of horrors that are of age.
Uh,

986
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,870
do I really need to read the rest of this?

987
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:01,450
We got off at the same time the other
night and just started talking outside.

988
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,720
Oh Dude, if this fucking goes to
some sexual thing, if I read it as I,

989
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,850
my part of the fucking crime
is 17 legal in your state.

990
00:58:09,851 --> 00:58:13,390
Some states it is just the good old boy.
Um,

991
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:17,620
I did the gentleman thing and asked her
if she needed a ride home. Fuck you.

992
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,300
You fucking cunt. Don't lie to me. Huh?

993
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,910
I thought we were friends calling me up.

994
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:28,760
You're asking for advice and then you
fall. You think I'm a fucking moron.

995
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,960
You didn't do the generally thing yet.

996
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:34,330
Deck was fucking pushing through
your zipper and you look good.

997
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,360
You want to ride home,

998
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,550
you want to fucking ruin this girl tried
to do the gentlemen there. You fuck.

999
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,220
You know what I see just for that.
I shouldn't even read the rest of this,

1000
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,620
but I'm too fucking interested.
Um,

1001
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,730
she politely declined and said her sister
wants to pick her up adding that she

1002
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:51,440
doesn't want to use me like that.

1003
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,000
She also said she was afraid that she
might get you used to it and expect it

1004
00:58:56,001 --> 00:59:00,770
every time we work together.
Understandable. It's not understandable.

1005
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,690
She's fucking jerking you around.

1006
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,670
She's putting on a God damn
fucking PG 13 sex show,

1007
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:10,063
you know,

1008
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,570
inside the bar. And then he'd
get outside, hey, there's my car.

1009
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,650
You want to just fucking continue on
with the little show now. That's okay.

1010
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,030
This might be one of these girls
that get Dick fucking, you know,

1011
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:27,500
hard is a fucking rock. And
then just walks away. Just
wants to see you chase it.

1012
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,380
And the only way you're going to get it
as if you just fucking walk away from it

1013
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:33,170
and she'll follow you home like
a lost puppy. But she's 17,

1014
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:36,050
so you don't want that to
happen. Um, anyways, however,

1015
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:39,920
she asked me to stick around and keep
her company until her ride comes.

1016
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,740
She asked me where I
usually hang out. Do, can I,

1017
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,910
am I gonna get in trouble for this shit?
I'm not reading the rest of the,

1018
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:46,200
she's only,
she's okay

1019
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:51,840
tea. Once you call kip winger, he'll tell
you what the fuck to do. I say walk away.

1020
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,553
All right.

1021
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,370
The only question you should be
asking her is when are you turning 18.

1022
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:03,230
And when she says, why say, because,
uh, I'll tell you on your birthday.

1023
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,390
Alrighty. That's a podcast
for this week. Everybody, uh,

1024
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:16,860
bittersweet this week. You
know, uh, Rondo went down,

1025
01:00:16,861 --> 01:00:20,310
tore his ACL. I fucking love
the Celtics. I really do.

1026
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:22,350
And I know there's a lot of
people to hate the Boston Celtics,

1027
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:26,490
but you know something, if I can
appreciate the fact that power was,

1028
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:28,860
solves a great basketball
player and Colby Bryan,

1029
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:33,840
now the got even as a Laker Fan, come on,
you got to, you got it. You have to admit,

1030
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,310
unless you just a straight up con,

1031
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,720
the fucking Celtics got more heart than
any other team in the league. You know,

1032
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:41,700
they do.
You know they do.

1033
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,250
Okay.

1034
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:47,420
I'm telling you, they will fight you
to the end. Even fucking Colby said it.

1035
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,430
He said the Celtics never fucking quit.
And if you guys think that can,

1036
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,150
cause Rondo has gone down,
that this team is going to roll over.

1037
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:58,280
Jurati your fucking mind.
All right.

1038
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,390
The only way this team rolls over as if
Danny Ainge and those guys break it up.

1039
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:05,090
That's the only way.
That's the only fucking way.

1040
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:10,400
And I was flying to God knows fucking
wear and I missed that whole Celtics heat

1041
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:15,020
game. But I have been watching the
Bruins. I watched him come back tonight,

1042
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,970
um, after the hurricanes tied
it up. Hurricanes look good,

1043
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:24,590
man. Great cold tend to in the country
is for checking I've ever seen.

1044
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,430
Uh, but we somehow survived
it, but they're a great team.

1045
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:32,840
We've got the devil's tomorrow night
when they were always great. So, uh,

1046
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:36,080
I can't believe how much I
missed hockey when it came back.

1047
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:37,850
I just absolutely fucking love it.

1048
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:41,510
It's the greatest Goddamn sport and I
love that. Most people think it's sucks.

1049
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:46,560
Please by all means continue
to not watch it. I love this.

1050
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,473
It's great.

1051
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:48,990
Okay.

1052
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,050
Being the fourth most popular sport,
it's great. You know what that's like?

1053
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,930
That's like being like a,
Oh, what's it like being,

1054
01:01:56,931 --> 01:02:00,410
it's like being the bass player in this
fucking awesome band and you're just

1055
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:03,740
collecting checks, but when you walk
off stage, nobody recognizes you.

1056
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:04,700
Nobody gives a fuck.

1057
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:08,660
They're all running all over to the singer
and the lead guitarist and you get to

1058
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:10,580
live a life.
Go down on the beach,

1059
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,520
drink a fucking six pack
with your rock star money.

1060
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:17,030
You know you got enough money to
get a good look and fucking woman.

1061
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:22,040
She would have to deal with the,
what am I talking about?

1062
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:23,720
I can't remember what the fuck,
what was he just talking about?

1063
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,220
Being a hockey fan?
It's great.

1064
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:31,770
I'm sorry guys. I'm fine. I was a,
I've been on four planes in three days.

1065
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:35,070
All right. There's my excuse.
I'm limping home. All right.

1066
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:36,750

committed to a Superbowl party,

1079

if we're already committed, still
taped the game at home. Okay.

1080
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,480
And then just sit down and
watch it and look for that play.

1081
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:24,150
I'm gonna look forward to
the pistol fucking formation.

1082
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,650
Okay.

1083
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,060
I can't even know what
the fuck it's called.

1084
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:28,530
Okay.

1085
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,520
Sheila,
when they said Shit,

1086
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:34,170
it's basically a hot read the fuck
are you talking about John Gruden?

1087
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:38,250
Which come out with a book and explain
it to me. What is the cover? Two defense.

1088
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:40,530
All right, that's it. Go fuck
yourselves. We'll talk to you next week.

1089
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,090
She's, she's a, and this is
not, it doesn't seem like
this is the girl for you.

1090
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:33,310
She might be a little too advanced

1091
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:38,320
alligator arm it. This might not be the
girl for you. She's a little too advanced.

1092
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,360
This woman is a fucking war pig.

1093
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,150
You're not. I'm trying to be
like tender and you know, Nice.

1094
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:48,090
You know what alligator arm means?
You don't watch sports now I don't.

1095
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,231
You know what?

1096
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:52,590
I really don't appreciate when I come
down here and having this conversation

1097
01:05:52,591 --> 01:05:55,440
with you and you want to
throw these little sports
things that me and you always,

1098
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,320
you always say, oh, you don't
watch sports. Oh, you didn't
get the sports they like,

1099
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,920
you'd have to like remind me that I'm
not on the same level as you like,

1100
01:06:01,921 --> 01:06:06,690
so I'm not going to get all your amazing
sports references and terms and phrases

1101
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:11,640
and I don't appreciate that. Can you
guys believe that went in 10 minutes

1102
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:16,980
of just going on this rant about how dumb
I am and how innocent I am with using

1103
01:06:16,981 --> 01:06:20,040
the word fag and I,
I don't even have like an innocent hard,

1104
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:24,360
but you're dumb and you're,
you just respond with rage the whole way.

1105
01:06:24,361 --> 01:06:28,770
You made me this fucking like simpleton.
Yeah. Be doing everything but fucking,

1106
01:06:28,771 --> 01:06:29,604
you know,

1107
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,230
being in a big goof like,
hey, what are you doing?

1108
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:34,750
Look walking down the street like you
don't want accidentally crushed somebody

1109
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:38,200
to death trying to hug them. That's how
you just painted me. You're like, yeah,

1110
01:06:38,201 --> 01:06:41,620
you're like of a, of mice and men.
That's how you're painting me.

1111
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:45,970
Within 10 minutes of this you're Lenny
and of mice and men. That's how you get,

1112
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,650
that's exactly how you described me.

1113
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,290
I was too dumb to know
that fucking reference

1114
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:56,960
cause I, I see alligator arm is okay.
You've seen an alligator, right? Yeah.

1115
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,660
Do they have long arms now?
They do not. They do not. And
it's basically, it's a, uh,

1116
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:01,710
it's a sports term.

1117
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:03,543
MMM.

1118
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,080
Somebody throws you the ball and you
could actually reach out and get it,

1119
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,280
but you don't totally reach out cause
you're worried about getting hit. Okay.

1120
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:14,370
Sort of ally alligator arm it. It's
like Ah, so if you don't catch the ball,

1121
01:07:14,371 --> 01:07:17,130
the guy can't hit you.
Oh okay. I thought so.

1122
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:20,190
I'm saying so your alligator arm
and this and that, you're going,

1123
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:24,630
this girl isn't the girl for you
but blah blah blah. He's in, he's,

1124
01:07:24,631 --> 01:07:26,700
he's in there with the fucking pit viper,

1125
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:29,860
right.
He's the goat and she's the on,

1126
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:35,060
he is the STD free goat and
he is walking into a fucking

1127
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:37,130
Bader of just,
I mean,

1128
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:43,410
I mean this girl probably I want
to get it to still fucking for you.

1129
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:46,260
She's not the girl for you.
That's bad advice.

1130
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:51,030
Why this girl and telling you these
what the fucking HIG and you'd have to

1131
01:07:51,031 --> 01:07:53,370
suppose to do about it.
Tell the whole fucking school,

1132
01:07:53,371 --> 01:07:56,580
I'm just saying she's not the girl for
you. Move on to somebody else's more.

1133
01:07:56,581 --> 01:08:00,720
Your speed. Why is that bad advice?
Because you're acting like, you know,

1134
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,220
she's not into sports,
likes to eat and is a morning person.

1135
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:11,240
He likes sports and staying up. You know
what? This person is like, you know,

1136
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:16,190
this person isn't for you. I meant as
like a foodie. It's like, it's a simple

1137
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:20,370
way of saying that, you know you should
move on. That's, that's all it is. No,

1138
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:24,620
it's like you're sitting there with a
toddler and he's about ready to touch a

1139
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:29,090
hot stove. You gotta be like, they has
to be a sense of urgency here. Like,

1140
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:33,520
like, no, no, no, no, no. This, this
will hurt you. It was, well, you know,

1141
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,900
you make that little fucking can. They
don't even speak English. You're trying to

1142
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,990
fucking, when they can't, they can't
speak yet. You're trying to fuck him.

1143
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,080
I go fuck yourself.

1144
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:46,700
You're, you're sitting there talking
to this person like, um, hey,

1145
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:48,950
try some of this sandwich. Yeah,
I didn't really like that bread.

1146
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,100
Well maybe you'll like this bread like it.
Like it's just like this whimsical,

1147
01:08:52,101 --> 01:08:54,170
there's too many Daisy's. And
what you're saying, this is,

1148
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,750
this is a very dangerous situation.

1149
01:08:56,751 --> 01:09:00,800
This guy should stay away from this girl
on all fucking in all girls like this.

1150
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:06,440
She's got a, she's on her period and
she has no fucking like, like class.

1151
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,480
She has opened so leg,
like what was he supposed to do?

1152
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,500
Pull it out and just go off on it.
There's other ways she suggesting anal.

1153
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:19,130
This girl, it's like if she's a
fucking mess, stay away from this girl.

1154
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:22,070
This girl get pregnant.
This girl will give you a fucking disease.

1155
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:25,310
This girl was steal your laptop
screen is a fucking nightmare.

1156
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:31,330
Knock it off. All right. All
right. Advice for a lady.

1157
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,530
Dear Bill, I've been with my
boyfriend for two years now.

1158
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,390
We're in college together
and he's currently taking a
semester abroad. Oh Jesus.

1159
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,050
Where in Brazil.
Before he left,

1160
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:48,340
we had a running joke that I was going
to need a vibrator when he left as a

1161
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:51,130
surprise party gift.
He got me one.

1162
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:55,810
I have a couple of friends whose
boyfriends bought them sex toys,

1163
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:59,410
so while I was a little surprised
he actually got me a vibrator.

1164
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,950
I also happen to know that
it's a relatively normal,

1165
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,260
it's relatively normal for a
boyfriend and do that. Yeah.

1166
01:10:05,261 --> 01:10:08,860
That's basically like this
era's chastity belt. You know,

1167
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:13,600
you're trying to lock down the pussy.
That's disgusting Ed. Yeah, that,

1168
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:17,470
but that's what he's doing now anyway.
Yeah. But it's done because those things,

1169
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:18,191
you use them too much.

1170
01:10:18,191 --> 01:10:21,190
They numb up your area there and then
the guy can't even remotely try and,

1171
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:22,143
you know,

1172
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:24,450
okay,

1173
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:27,630
do something for it. And then you gotta
be sitting there, Bang, Bang. And I'm,

1174
01:10:27,631 --> 01:10:30,420
as their user are using the thing as,
you know,

1175
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,790
it's like you want an
alien or fucking this girl.

1176
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,150
That's just all dick has no body.
All right, whatever. Let's move on.

1177
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,520
One of the basing it on and
pay some of my fucking life.

1178
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:47,450
I did live a little bit of a life before
I met you. I realize that. All right.

1179
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:52,180
Any way, fast forward to about a
week ago, we were on Skype. Uh,

1180
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:57,170
he asked you to take this thing out. Um,
no, we don't have sex chats. Thank God.

1181
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:01,610
And he casually asked me how his
gifts for me was working out.

1182
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,680
I told them it was
working out pretty well.

1183
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:07,340
He then mentioned that he had
bought something for himself.

1184
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,680
A fleshlight

1185
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:15,990
Joe experience is brought to you
by the fleshlight every week.

1186
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:22,420
He does a very, very weird,
those are very lucky in okay.

1187
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,520
They look like that thing.

1188
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:28,430
Boba Fett I fell into when he died
in one of those space movies. Okay.

1189
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:33,480
Wow. Um, I knew how to be faithful
to right. That's nice. Okay.

1190
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:34,410
He said,
she goes,

1191
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:38,850
I knew what this was because I am an
avid listener of Joe Rogan's podcast.

1192
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:39,973
You go,

1193
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,460
Joe Robbins come up three times on this
podcast who raves about it constantly.

1194
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:49,020
My boyfriend had never had mentioned to
me that he was interested in anything

1195
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:52,860
like that, and I always thought
the idea of it was totally creepy.

1196
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:56,220
I acted like it was totally cool,
but in all honesty,

1197
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:01,550
I really don't want him to beat
fucking a perfect fake wait.

1198
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,050
I got lost in that.

1199
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,380
I actually was thinking as Joe going
to get mad that I'm saying that this is

1200
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:11,730
weird. Okay. I acted like it was
totally cool, but in all honesty,

1201
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:16,080
I really don't want them to be fucking
of perfect fake vagina whenever he wants

1202
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:16,560
to.

1203
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,560
I'm finding myself getting crazy jealous
and angry whenever I think about it.

1204
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:26,100
I know, I know I'm jealous of an
inanimate object, which seems insane.

1205
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:26,934
Let me finish.

1206
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:31,110
I'm really struggling with this because
part of me wants to be completely okay

1207
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:34,380
with it since it's sort of a hypocrite.

1208
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:37,260
It's sort of hypocritical to get
angry when he got me a vibrator.

1209
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:42,870
But now I'm starting to think that maybe
he only bought me a Dildo so I wouldn't

1210
01:12:42,871 --> 01:12:46,960
be able to complete when he
got himself a proxy pussy. Ah,

1211
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,920
Roxy Pussy.
So what do you think?

1212
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:54,180
Do I need to suck it up and get over
this or is my jealousy legitimate?

1213
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:56,220
Thanks and go fuck yourself

1214
01:12:56,290 --> 01:13:01,120
Polaris and go fuck is fake pussy.
As long as he's not faking a real pussy,

1215
01:13:01,121 --> 01:13:05,650
I mean fucking a real pussy and
then you know it's all good.

1216
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:10,450
Plus you, you, it's not just
like the, the pussy that it's,

1217
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,210
that he's missing. He's
also missing like, you know,

1218
01:13:13,211 --> 01:13:16,270
your touch and kissing and the
whole other part of it too.

1219
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,450
And that fake pussy cat. Oh,
am I there? No, he isn't.

1220
01:13:19,451 --> 01:13:23,620
He's getting right to the dessert.
Don't be Jackie.

1221
01:13:23,621 --> 01:13:27,370
Try these Brussels sprouts. Don't
need them. Don't be jealous.

1222
01:13:27,371 --> 01:13:31,180
I bring over the trace late Lecce when
he comes back it will be even better

1223
01:13:31,181 --> 01:13:34,910
because you both have been like doing
it with inanimate objects. And so it's,

1224
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,870
I don't think the rediscovering each
other all over again. I'll be even better.

1225
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:39,850
I don't think. We don't even worry.
I don't think it's a good thing.

1226
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:43,060
Why? Because, uh,

1227
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:48,010
once you start down a path sexually,
you know,

1228
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:52,160
in order to get off that path, you
don't just jump over onto another path.

1229
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,790
You got to walk all the way
back up the path you went down,

1230
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,210
get to the fork where you fucked up
and then head down the other one.

1231
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:05,580
What I'm saying is he might get used to
just doing that and this sensation of

1232
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:11,740
that is what gets him off. And then when
her pussy doesn't feel like fleshlight,

1233
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,660
he'll, you don't feel better. He'll,
he'll build bang her and then,

1234
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:20,070
and then when he needs to
finish, he'll be like, all right,

1235
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,510
and now for me and what
that fucking thing.

1236
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:27,150
Oh, even better if anything
he'll be like, oh my God,

1237
01:14:27,151 --> 01:14:30,900
I forgot what a real woman feels like.
And he'll be done in like two minutes.

1238
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:35,670
That's what your hope. Um, I
don't think she should be jealous.

1239
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:36,720
I'm at though.
They're both,

1240
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:40,170
they're both doing the right thing when
you're in a relationship and you're that

1241
01:14:40,171 --> 01:14:45,171
far apart from each other because I bang
all sorts of Harry European girls and

1242
01:14:45,201 --> 01:14:48,990
no offense to hear European girls,
but I'm just saying, you know, listen,

1243
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:53,270
I watched this thing one time or
listen to it on the radio, uh,

1244
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:58,410
one of those Colin's sex shows
and this guy had a pull away.

1245
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:03,070
He jerked off to see dry hump.
The rug it was causing,

1246
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:04,950
like chafing on is decorative, but it, it,

1247
01:15:04,951 --> 01:15:08,460
it was the only way he could get off
because he wasn't in a relationship for a

1248
01:15:08,461 --> 01:15:12,220
while and he kept doing that and I dunno.
So I'm just saying like,

1249
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:15,280
I would go easy on those. It's like
anything, anything in moderation.

1250
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:19,240
How often is he using this and
how often is she using that?

1251
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:21,730
If you's a vibrate too much,
you numb yourself up down there.

1252
01:15:21,731 --> 01:15:24,310
And then when you guys down there
I that he can't feel anything.

1253
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,500
It's so disgusting. Um, overrated.
Underrated for the week. Overrated.

1254
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:35,260
The Superbowl, underrated rounds one
and two of the NFL playoffs. Bill,

1255
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:37,210
this may be sacrilegious
to say in America,

1256
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:41,750
but I actually enjoy rounds one and two
of the NFL playoffs more than the super

1257
01:15:41,751 --> 01:15:42,400
bowl.

1258
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,690
That is a sector religious because at no
point is beyond say or Brittany Spears

1259
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:52,450
sing before and in the
halftime show there's not a
bunch of douchebags who don't

1260
01:15:52,451 --> 01:15:55,690
like football showing up feeling
like they have to be there.

1261
01:15:56,140 --> 01:16:00,130
You know all the broad why you yeah,
why are you looking at me?

1262
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,890
Cause you go to super bowl parties
every year and you hate football. Yeah.

1263
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:08,970
Well they're fun. They're nice gatherings.
Talk when the game's on. No I don't.

1264
01:16:08,971 --> 01:16:13,390
They run yap.
When the most important game is on,

1265
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:17,950
it's disgusting. If you do it again
this year we're breaking up each week.

1266
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:21,280
You get two games both
on Saturday and Sunday.

1267
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,860
There seems to be that
we can win this thing,

1268
01:16:23,861 --> 01:16:27,580
excitement in the air and I can relax
and watch the games and the comfort of my

1269
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:32,140
home or at a local bar without dozens
of non-fans in the room as is typically

1270
01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:35,620
the case of the Superbowl party Superbowl
and the other hand has become so

1271
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:36,970
pretentious in recent years.

1272
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,690
I don't even really want to get
worked up for it as much as I used to.

1273
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,310
The game takes forever.

1274
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:47,050
85% of the commercial sucks and we're
forced to stare at Madonna's beat up face

1275
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:51,130
for 30 minutes during a halftime show
plus the two week gap in between the

1276
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,970
Superbowl and the conference champion
really takes the air out of the sales.

1277
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,160
What are your thoughts?
I think this is what you do.

1278
01:16:57,161 --> 01:17:02,161
You watch the Superbowl alone and you
tape it and you start watching it.

1279
01:17:02,681 --> 01:17:05,380
You DVR it and you watch,

1280
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:08,470
you let you let you give the
game a 90 minute headstart

1281
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,510
and then then you just sit down,

1282
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:16,550
you watch it by yourself and you plow
through the pregame and you just watched

1283
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:19,520
the fucking game.
And when the halftime show comes,

1284
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:24,140
you fast forward through that and now
you're under the third quarter and third

1285
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,540
quarter and fourth quarter it's
going to be regular time football.

1286
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,120
That's the way to watch the Superbowl.
And you watch it by yourself.

1287
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:33,050
Maybe with another buddy of yours
who that uh, enjoys the game.

1288
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:36,020
That's how I would do it,
you know?

1289
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:40,660
No thoughts on that. No. But
what about the social aspects?

1290
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:41,810
Shut up.

1291
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:46,660
You were going to have brownies
during the old cheese doodles.

1292
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,260
Oh my God. The way the broad talk
to her and that fucking game.

1293
01:17:50,261 --> 01:17:53,110
And then now and then,
and it's true women who like,

1294
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,650
and everybody shuts up to
watch the commercials and then,

1295
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,950
and then the game comes back
on the, I took that one was
late. What did you think?

1296
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:04,450
Well, that's definitely the best one
so far. How much did that cost? Well,

1297
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:07,840
why don't you start going of a
Superbowl parties then, Bill,

1298
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,750
why don't you stop if
you don't like the game,

1299
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,790
I don't do any of that stuff that
you're talking about. I don't,

1300
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:17,740
I don't like needle point. I don't go to
your fucking metapoint parties to late.

1301
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:20,740
They don't do any order.
You do arts and crafts.

1302
01:18:20,741 --> 01:18:24,520
I don't crash the super bowl or those
things and come there and talk when you're

1303
01:18:24,521 --> 01:18:27,970
trying to glue the popsicle sticks
together and then shut the fuck up.

1304
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,770
When a talk throughout the game,

1305
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:33,640
I go in the other room or I hang out
with other people if they're lies. Lies,

1306
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:37,390
lies. Yeah. No lies. Lies. Lies. Okay.

1307
01:18:37,391 --> 01:18:40,810
That's the Monday morning podcast. Oh,
before I get out of here. Huh? That's it.

1308
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:45,550
That's it. We did a nice long one. All
right. There's nothing else. No. Okay.

1309
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,990

1319

1320
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:25,270
girl? And she spreads her leg with the,
the rip cord there. All right. You're the,

out of the cage. See you.
