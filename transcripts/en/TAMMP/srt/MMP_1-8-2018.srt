1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Monday morning podcast.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,020
Monday,

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,890
January 8th,

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,210
2018 that's a lot of age stowed.

5
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:18,170
I should go get a fucking scratch
ticket and play nothing but aids

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,090
do. My number came in. He had it
for fucking seven and a quarter.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,000
We're going to go down to fucking, what
the fuck are those casinos down there?

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,640
Jesus Christ I perform at,
I'm going to go down on Mahican Sun dote,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,390
hit the fucking blackjack table,
split and aces kid, whatever.

10
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm playing with house
money. Um, how are you,

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,530
how was your first weekend of the year
to Jill? Jill? Joy, there's only 51 left,

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,640
um,
or four left.

13
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,350
If he listened to people who are fucking
freaking out about global warming.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,090
I mean, you know, not saying that
I, it doesn't concern me, but uh,

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,140
I just kind of take it day to
day. I look out the window, right?

16
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:07,170
There's no zombies I can turn on.

17
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:10,170
The Faucet is still water k right.
You know,

18
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:14,530
he's got to look for the zombies first.
I like the old zombies,

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,350
you know what I mean?
The ones that walked real slow,

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,990
he had a fucking chance as opposed
to now they're like running around.

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,370
I'll roid it up. Um, roid it up.

22
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:27,570
It's right there on the fucking juice.
All these zombies need to be tested.

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,350
They got to get it out of the
fucking league. All right?

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,380
All those kills that all
those other zombies have.

25
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:38,400
That's why like zombies are killing so
many people now. You know what I mean?

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,291
Of course you don't.

27
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,170
You don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about and neither do I. All right.

28
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,480
If you new to my podcast,
how are you?

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,590
Get ready to listen to some of the
dumbest shit you're going to hear for,

30
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:54,500
you know, for like another 58 minutes,
I think. Yeah. Good call. I mean,

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,690
52 52 into the podcast.
Um,

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,620
I'm going to fucking pat myself on
the back. That's the back of my head.

33
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,180
That's why he was fucking sounded like,
you know,

34
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,880
I'm fucking wedding reno
sucks all winter wedding ring.

35
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,730
You've got this little piece of metal on
your hand. You hit yourself, you know,

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,220
it's like a constant fucking why can't,
it's like a painful reminder. Oh,

37
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:23,550
that's right. I'm married. You
know, fly goes onto your face,

38
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:25,890
you're whack yourself right in the face.

39
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:29,010
You already slept yourself in the face
and then your wedding ring like catches

40
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,310
like your brow, you know, like half fuck.

41
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,460
And right after that happens.
Yeah,

42
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,473
it goes high.

43
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,770
I was just asking if you could do
me a favor. When did that come from?

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,070
I did the Smad is thing tonight.
Right?

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,550
Me and my wife, right. And my
wife, we had this, you know,

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,150
every once in a while you've got to clean
house, right? It'd be like, all right,

47
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,360
let's go with a kid.
Can Harris,

48
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,390
let's just down and we're going to talk
about what we've been doing over the

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,430
last whatever month, six months, decade,

50
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,950
depending on how long it's been
since you've had those talks, right.

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,810
Having a talk in,
in,

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
in a relationship is like fucking the
nd a year when you have to do your taxes

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,470
and you didn't organize anything and
you've got a year's worth of fucking

54
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,400
receipts all sticking out all over the
place and you just keep putting it off

55
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,190
and putting it off, you know what
I mean? The next thing you know,

56
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:31,040
the box is fucking another box
down the street, right? Um,

57
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,630
so we, we try to air it out.
So we went out, all right,

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,140
got some chicken wings
and we just fuck it.

59
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:43,050
I think we were just going to go out to
hand. We knew that we needed to hang out.

60
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:45,750
Like we got to hang out, right? The
kids taking a lot of our us time,

61
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:49,250
you need to go fucking hang us.
We'd go hang out and then just all this,

62
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,880
the shit came out.
All right.

63
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,320
And one of the things that I was doing
is I was ruining television for her.

64
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:58,590
Cause I, I, I uh, I don't
shut up. When I watch TV

65
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,530
imitate people, I make
fun of them. And, uh,

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,010
when the other person is in the room
and they want to watch the show,

67
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,470
evidently it's really annoying.
Of course it's annoying. So, um,

68
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,870
and if she's watching reality TV, like
I never shut up cause it's just, I mean,

69
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,430
I dunno.
So I've been trying not,

70
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,880
you know, if she's watching something
and that we both enjoy like, Oh Zach,

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,800
you know, or uh, the Black Mirror.

72
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,090
Oh they all got Boston. They got the RS
in there. Uh, all the shows that we like,

73
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,800
twilight zone, all of that shit. If
we're watching shit like that, I shut up.

74
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,620
All right. But if it's anything
else, I don't shut the fuck up.

75
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,120
So she's watching like reality shows.

76
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,440
So tonight she was watching
the Golden Globes. All right.

77
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,910
And I know right there,

78
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,730
I can't watch that show with her
cause she's gonna get mad at me.

79
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,510
So I just wanted to watch sets monologue.

80
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,650
I always watched the comic cause it's
such a, it's such a fucking crazy Gig,

81
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,150
right to come out there.

82
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,680
You do an all brand new shit in
like sitting right in the front row,

83
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,880
like two feet away is fucking
Oprah Winfrey and you know,

84
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:20,460
Samuel Jackson and willing to fall. These
fucking people are there. They just,

85
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,530
it's like the whole move to Holt.
Everything you watch in Oman TV,

86
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,330
the television shows,
movies,

87
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:30,140
all of a sudden it turns around and looks
at you while you go out there with the

88
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:34,460
new fucking 10 minutes. So
whatever the hell it is they do. So

89
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,740
I'm watching that Seth is
fucking killing. And I, and I,

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,560
the first time I talked was at some point
when I saw Oprah was sitting there and

91
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,270
I leaned up and go,
can you mentioned doing your jokes?

92
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:50,530
And Oprah is like right
there. She was like, and,

93
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,930
and I was like, oh fuck. All right.
It's like, I'm going to shut up.

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,160
MMM.

95
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,810
And then the award show started and
the smartest thing I did is I just, I,

96
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,320
I pretended I had to go do something and
I just sort of got up and I walked out.

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,300
So I wouldn't, I wouldn't do the
rest of it. I wouldn't do the rest.

98
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:14,790
I wouldn't ruin the fucking show for.
And you guess what?

99
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,470
We're not in a fight right now.
It's unbelievable. You know?

100
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,010
And she would just, I just stayed
in the kitchen. I made some waffles.

101
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:27,330
I'm one of those breakfast for dinner kind
of guys. You know? That's how I do it.

102
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,470
That's my swagger.

103
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:29,920
Yeah,

104
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,410
that's it. That's, that's the
marble man that I have in me.

105
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,523
MMM.

106
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,200
I just realized the second I said that,

107
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,670
that's like some shit you say when you're
trying to be interesting on a date or

108
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:47,520
if you're too dumb to know you're not
interesting. You would say something. I,

109
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,680
first of all, I want to thank everyone
who's still listening to this.

110
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:52,080
The fact that I said I'm
a breakfast for dinner

111
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,370
kind of guy.
All right.

112
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,580
What I should've said was I like
having breakfast for dinner sometimes,

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,330
but I sent him a breakfast for dinner
kind of guy. Why you say kind of guy?

114
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,470
You should be legally required to do
the double fucking pistol shot with you.

115
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,090
Okay.

116
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,300
With your fingers and that kind of guy,
Bang,

117
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:17,470
Bang side of fucking sausage.
Um,

118
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,430
so that was out there and
making waffles and, uh,

119
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,020
she yelled out, she goes,
Sammy wants, Sammy wants Sam
Rockwell one. So I, you know,

120
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,490
obviously love Sam and, uh, he did
something that's really hard to do.

121
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,520
We had a great speech and,
um,

122
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,160
yeah.

123
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,993
And then,
you know,

124
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,470
I was watching a little bit more and I
felt all these things that I was going to

125
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,980
say. So I just walked up. I walked up
before I said something stupid. You know,

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,090
if she talks, it's all black, you're not
a rapist. Welcome to the Golden Globes.

127
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:52,380
Like I would've been doing shit like that.

128
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,410
Okay.

129
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,670
Do you realize you could be an
absolute fucking monster? Okay.

130
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:04,370
But if you wore an all black Tuxedo,
like no,

131
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:08,380
everyone would be looking at you like you
were progressive. That's why, you know,

132
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,840
I understand why it's done because it's
a show of strength and everybody's like,

133
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:15,860
yes, this is obviously something that, you
know, it needs to stop, Yada, Yada, Yada,

134
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:20,360
and a bunch of other obvious shit.
But, um, it also creates a sing would,

135
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,170
you could just walk in and no one's
going to fuck with you because you're

136
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,220
wearing the right uniform.

137
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,970
That's why I don't like all of that
political correctness stuff is because you

138
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:30,500
create a roadmap

139
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,580
yeah.

140
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:32,881
For,

141
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:37,620
for people to just get across the
river because they know what to say,

142
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:40,110
what not to say when they're
in public and everything. Oh,

143
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:43,090
he said native American
Gaddy said Mum, Mum, Mum,

144
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,610
Mama obviously and he has an all black
Tuxedo. Hey, must be a good person.

145
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,290
All right.

146
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,160
Now all of this is just shit that no
one wants to fucking here when they're

147
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:57,480
trying to watch. So I ran in,
I saw Rockwell when I heard
Carol Burnett was there.

148
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:01,380
I ran and I saw that and when I heard
Roseanne Barr and John Goodman we're on,

149
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:06,120
I ran in and I watched that and I went
out and always have something else.

150
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:10,500
I saw Jennifer Anniston. Oh No, she
was there with, uh, uh, Carol Burnett.

151
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,710
How fucking great does
she look, Tony? Man,

152
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,650
she does not age at all her
and fucking how he lawn.

153
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,160
I said the exact same.
That's kind of weird, right?

154
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,080
I say the exact same thing when
I saw how he launched today,

155
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,950
when I was watching the playoffs was
like give, he fucking looks unbelievable

156
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,550
guide. Just as he has not lost
one hair on top of his head.

157
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm an Ilab,
that hair cuts and so I was like 15.

158
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,470
Um, anyways, uh,

159
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,850
I fucking watched so much God
damn sports this weekend. Right.

160
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,120
I did do a little duo lingo trying
to get back into the hole, trying to,

161
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,830
I have to become bilingual and I have
to learn how to speak French because

162
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,410
that's such a snooty fucking
language and I'm such a dope.

163
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:04,740
How hilarious would it be?
That's what keeps me going.

164
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,350
All right. Not Respect for the
culture, not trying to improve myself.

165
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:15,351
Just how fucking funny it would be if I
was completely fluent in French and like

166
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,450
really good at it. I could
speak the slang. Yeah. But the,

167
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,380
I wouldn't have an accent,
you know?

168
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,920
Let me just take a how much dumb shit
I've said right now and you're all of a

169
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:28,230
sudden out of no way.
I could just start speaking perfect.

170
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,770
I could go to Paris and no one would
turn their fucking nose up at me.

171
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,650
Okay.

172
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,610
Oh,
the opportunity,

173
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm telling you I want to do that cause
I want to go there and I want to act

174
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:40,700
like a fucking moron. I mean,
not even have to act. I'm just,

175
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,020
I'd ramp it up, you know, and then just
listen to hear what they would say.

176
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:45,740
And I would just,

177
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,660
I would say 10 days of just laughing my
fucking balls off and then ruining it

178
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:55,580
for all you guys who go over there, if
you're from here. Um, anyways, so I,

179
00:10:55,581 --> 00:11:00,140
uh, I had the peach bowl taped, recorded,

180
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,220
saved in fucking digital space,
whatever the fuck you kids say.

181
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,660
And I was meaning to watch it because I
came home from the Rose Bowl and I saw,

182
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:13,100
I was like, Holy Shit.
Central Florida one. So, uh,

183
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,420
I actually put it on in, my wife
was six this weekend, you know,

184
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:20,780
everybody got the bug, everybody got the
stomach flu. I haven't got it yet. Okay.

185
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,310
I take these little chewables.
Alright.

186
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,600
And I, I take a men's, uh,

187
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,470
what the fuck do you call
it? Men's, uh, vitamin.

188
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,190
What do they call those things? Men's
daily or some shit. I never take them.

189
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:41,840
I take them when I start to feel sick
and I knew everybody was getting sick

190
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:46,400
around me, so I just started fucking
just chow when those things down. Right.

191
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,320
And I've been able to hold it off and
last night I actually slept in a different

192
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:54,940
room. You know what I mean?
I love my wife, but you know,

193
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,770
I'm not going to start puking and
shitting, you know what I mean?

194
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,370
Unnecessarily. I wouldn't put
her through that. Right. And he,

195
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:07,550
Jesus Christ for better, for worse. And
then there's, there's like common sense,

196
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,040
um, and my wife's cool as hell. So she
was just like, yeah, get Outta here.

197
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,420
Get outta here. So, uh, I left.

198
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,170
You know what's weird is if,
when you have a chance,

199
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:24,670
like when I sleep in a different room,
I sleep on the opposite side of the bed.

200
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:29,380
So when I wake up and I get a sense
that the edge of the bed is on the wrong

201
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,900
side and I'm not on the road,
you know,

202
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,790
it freaks me out. Like,
where the fuck am I?

203
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,470
Did I get arrested for a murder I didn't
commit? And then I opened my eyes.

204
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:44,160
I'm like, Oh fuck no, I'm just sleeping
in a different room in my own house.

205
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,400
That's cool. Um, so anyways,

206
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,470
I watched the fucking peach bowl
and I watch to central Florida, man,

207
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:54,250
what a fucking game. What a gay
men, central Florida hub. I, I,

208
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:59,280
this is long overdue. Congrats in that. I
hope it say his name is Sheena Queen. Uh,

209
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,090
Griffin, the linebacker on the
team. The guys got one hand,

210
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,910
he's got one hand and he was dominating,
dominating Auburn,

211
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,870
who I swear to God,

212
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:13,350
half of their guys looked like they
had like 40 pounds on whoever they were

213
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:17,930
lining up against. And I
love Auburn. I Love Auburn.

214
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,970
I love watching a beat, Alabama.
You know, I love seeing that shit.

215
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:26,090
It's just fun. It's fun to see, you know,

216
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,530
cause Alabama supposed to win. So Auburn
was supposed to win that one. So I mean,

217
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:33,380
how do you not root for Central
Florida? Central Florida? It,

218
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,250
I went to their campus, right?
Did I go to the central Florida?

219
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:40,150
I don't think I did. I went
to the other one. I the,

220
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,550
where are the game was at the war and the,
for the one that's in Orlando,

221
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,660
I went to that one and I just went in and
I looked at the campus and I was like,

222
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,950
yeah, I could've got accepted here. I
could've gone to this fucking school.

223
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,400
Like their campus is in the
middle of like a rotary,

224
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,490
like there's a big
roundabout and they just put,

225
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:01,490
it's like they had a big roundabout and
then they stuck a school right in the

226
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:03,360
middle of it.
Um,

227
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,150
so I had to root for him because
I love that game so much.

228
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:11,570
And I'll see you gotta love an underdog.
So congratulations to them. And, uh,

229
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:16,160
what else did I watched all of the playoff
games playoffs except, uh, yet, uh, no,

230
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,851
I can't even say that.

231
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:21,851
I watched two of the Games today and I
missed you don't put the Kansas City game

232
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:25,630
on right at the end.
And cause my brother texted me,

233
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:30,110
he said it was talking about, uh, Sean
Mcdonough's voice when it cracked.

234
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,760
I can't believe the level of shit the
guy got for that. That was a great call.

235
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,860
It just was,
it just wasn't a touchdown.

236
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,000
Then everybody who sues fucking miserable.
It's got to trash the guy.

237
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,950
I wish something as exciting is that
happened to every game just to hear him

238
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:46,701
lose his shit.

239
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:51,701
All I heard was a guy that loves
the game and loves his job.

240
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,260
Everybody's like, yeah. Did
you hear his voice? Crack is,

241
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,370
I've entered all my voice cracks
when I get excited, you know. Um,

242
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,880
anyways, so everybody's
jumping all over. Uh,

243
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,680
Andy Reid, you know, giving him
shit for fucking, I don't know.

244
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,500
I don't even know what the hell happened.
I have no idea.

245
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:14,800
I know that they're big fucking tight end.
The potato sack race guy.

246
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:17,080
I know we took a shot to the
head so he wasn't in the game.

247
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,400
Obviously that will change the bill.

248
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:21,820
You were literally going to break down
a game he didn't watch. Yeah, probably.

249
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,420
Probably. Um, you know, you know,
loves to say, you know what,

250
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:30,390
the guy can't get it done,
guy can't get it done.

251
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,740
Any radio at guy can't get done. You know,
people love to say that kind of Shit.

252
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,890
People can't get it done in their
own lives. You know what I mean?

253
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,490
Can I can't get it done? Nobody can
get it done in Kansas City. Okay.

254
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,170
Nobody's got it done in Kansas
City since fucking hang strap.

255
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,310
All right.

256
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,590
He's gone to a fucking franchise that
is a perennial fucking loser and he came

257
00:15:56,591 --> 00:16:01,030
from another one, Philadelphia. That's
a perennial fucking loser. All right.

258
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:03,520
Kansas City won a Superbowl in 1970.

259
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,860
The fucking eagles won in 1960.
Hm.

260
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,390
Anybody could do the Phil Jackson thing
and fucking go jump on the Goddamn

261
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,550
Lakers when they got already
got Colby Bryan Shack.

262
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,460
Eddie raid likes a challenge.

263
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,390
I've go to the most miserable
fucking sports city in the world.

264
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,010
Philadelphia, the, yeah, he
went there before the fit.
The Phillies won. All right.

265
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,090
When it was a fucking drug where they'd
won 1980. But you know what I mean?

266
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,500
So in defense of that guy is
everybody shitting all over them?

267
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:40,050
Like they would have known how to run the
clock or whatever the fuck they giving

268
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:44,490
him shit about that guy. He's taken
out two huge fucking challenges.

269
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,390
The Philadelphia Eagles
and the Kansas City chiefs.

270
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,933
MMM.

271
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,240
All right. So there's my take on it.
Having not watched the game, you see that?

272
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,730
You see what happens when
you just give find an angle.

273
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,760
Did you just go off on it?
It actually sounded for half a second.

274
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:07,120
Like I knew what I was talking
about. Right. Actually,

275
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:08,440
you know why he didn't see the game?

276
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,980
The real reason I didn't see the game
but wasn't because my wife was sick.

277
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:16,270
The real reason why is because I
was busy looking at Game Phil Film.

278
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,890
I was busy looking at game field,
getting ready to, uh, you know,

279
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:25,600
I had to coach some kids out in the
buffalo against this team. The jag was,

280
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,280
if one more person sends
me a God damn photo going,

281
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,340
is it me or you've looked just
like this guy. It's like, dude,

282
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,920
that choke was made like a year ago.

283
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,300
Okay.

284
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,350
Like if you guys really want
to just fucking annoying me,

285
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,290
just keep sending me that like,
and g got gotta deliver it.

286
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,710
Like it's the first time,
you know, I should've done,

287
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,370
I should've started re
tweeting all of them.

288
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,550
And maybe that's why I need to do it.

289
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,930
I thought I already retweeted them to
be like, it's this joke has been made.

290
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:59,310
Let's can we build on it. I'm not saying
don't make the joke, but you got to

291
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,950
knock knock. Who's there?
Banana. Banana. Who knock knock.
Who's there? Banana. Banana.

292
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,150
Who I get.

293
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,353
MMM.

294
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,880
Where the hell am I? All right, Jack.
Speak the fucking bills. Oh, that's right.

295
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:16,680
I watched that.
That's the first game I watched.

296
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:19,170
I missed the Atlanta
Falcons playing the rams.

297
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:20,923
MMM.

298
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,760
And I think like a lot of people,
I forgot that Atlanta one,

299
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,820
the first 58 minutes of last year's
Superbowl and then what was great was they

300
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:35,840
completely fucked up their regular season
to the point nobody was talking about

301
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:39,170
them, but they made the playoffs.
So now it playoffs until, and I,

302
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:41,930
everybody's zero and zero to start.

303
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,790
And they got all that experience in the
last year. Last year, right? I Dunno.

304
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,850
Put the fuck do they play next week?
They go to Philly,

305
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,800
they go to Philly and Philly
was all lined up to go.

306
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,710
And what happens?
Huh?

307
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,730
Carson Wentz gets his fucking need fucked
up for the rest of the season because

308
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:06,720
it's Philly. Okay. And I'm
not shitting on Phil Yeti.

309
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:10,170
Eagle Fan will tell you this the
second you put that fucking helmet on.

310
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,660
Somebody who's got to
break that curse man.

311
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,750
Do you think it's going to be Nick
foals? Ah, this is his last name.

312
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:23,610
Sound too much like follies,
the nic, foals follies.

313
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,860
If he fucking blows this game,

314
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:28,710
I'm telling you right now he's going to
be started in one of those ice capades.

315
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:33,711
He'll be like the guy with the top hat
bringing out a bunch of old eagles on ice

316
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:35,690
skates that never won super bowls.

317
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,650
I'm trying to figure out who
I'm going to root for this year.

318
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,750
Obviously I'm rooting for the Patriots,
but who else do I like? You know,

319
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:43,650
I actually like the saints.
Uh, what a great game that was.

320
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:48,651
Now that game I saw against the
fucking path is a lot of drops,

321
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:53,790
some critical drops by the panthers or
the first time felt that about, you know,

322
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,160
what I think's going to happen.
I think drew Brees, drew Brees,

323
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,460
the underrated drew Brees,
he's like third all time passing.

324
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:01,710
Nobody talks about them.
You know what I mean?

325
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,890
You know why he's just a
regular looking guy. You know,

326
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,740
he's a little taller than Doug Flutie.
Okay.

327
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:13,770
He's a little shyer than fucking,
uh,

328
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,280
Brett Farve and he's not as
good looking as Tom Brady.

329
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,790
Okay.

330
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,940
You know, and he's down there in New
Orleans and nobody's paying attention.

331
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,050
Nobody is fucking paying attention. And
meanwhile, the guys out there killing it,

332
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,080
he's got a Superbowl ring.

333
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:30,670
Okay.

334
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,420
So now he's going to Minnesota.

335
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,430
Yeah.

336
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,800
To face some guy named case Keenan who
people will say it, he's in the running,

337
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,590
they'll be the athlete play in the league.
He is,

338
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,190
you think drew Brees is afraid
of that? I don't think he is. Um,

339
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,630
it is my prediction for next week knowing
nothing about the Minnesota Vikings.

340
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,040
Okay.
I say drew Brees goes into Minnesota.

341
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,690
Okay. And when he leaves is going to be
a bunch of people crying at the mall of

342
00:20:58,691 --> 00:20:59,524
America.

343
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,810
I think the sates go in and
they fucking beat Minnesota.

344
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,130
You know, buddy of mine was going, uh,

345
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,210
I can't believe Minnesota built another
dome there, like a cold city team.

346
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:14,800
That's like a great advantage.

347
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,890
And now drew breeze is going
to go in and play in a dome.

348
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:20,700
He's going to be at home. And I was
just like, why did they make a dominant?

349
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:22,180
I was like,
that's what I was thinking.

350
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,980
But we're old guys and I
think that, uh, you know,

351
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,200
the NFL has done with us,
you know,

352
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:33,400
they're now trying to move on to the
millennials and you've got to build a dome

353
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,650
because millennials don't
like to go outside. Right?

354
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:39,940
So if he can just get them to an Uber,
they'll get to the game and they look,

355
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:43,030
you look you back inside again,
you back inside this big TV screens.

356
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,420
You can stare at those instead of watch
the game. But he can sit here and say,

357
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,960
you, you, you are at
what you watched on a TV.

358
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,560
Um, all right. And the Patriots
are playing the titans.

359
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,150
Uh, we'll see. We'll see how that
one goes. You never know. And, uh,

360
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,170
who did the steel has got the
Steelers get the fuck in a,

361
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,930
they got the jags right?

362
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,840
The Steelers got the jags
kind of happy.

363
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,510
Both those teams, one of them is
going to knock the other guy off.

364
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,570
Although I am not excited, you
know, if we get past the titans,

365
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,410
I am not excited to play the Steelers
again cause they already beat us once this

366
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,710
year. Um, but unfortunately,

367
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,300
uh, we were given the victory
over that whole bullshit.

368
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,360
Maybe it's a good thing cause he
ended up getting home field, but, um,

369
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,100
I always think the team that loses has
the advantage the second time around.

370
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:43,630
However, however, I just think bill
Belichick has such a superior coach,

371
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,060
by the way. You know, I'm like,

372
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,580
do I really have to address this
stupid shit about bill Belicheck

373
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,290
that he's going to leave the patriots
over a fucking personal trainer? I,

374
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,470
I sometimes I just think that the fucking
media just has it out for the fucking

375
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:00,280
patriots.
I just don't understand.

376
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:05,020
I've never seen such a big punch
of shit made out of nothing.

377
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,750
And here's the thing,
if he's fucking going bad,

378
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:11,140
it Bella check ever went back
to the giant who gives a fuck?

379
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,090
He's not ours. He started with
the giants. Okay. We didn't,

380
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,910
he started with like the
fucking lions or southern,

381
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:22,090
but he started with the giants. Okay.
That's where he got his first ring.

382
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,510
Then he went over to the Goddamn jets.
Right.

383
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,400
A man goes over to the
fucking jets and um,

384
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,530
no. He went to Cleveland before that and
they fired him. Typical Cleveland move.

385
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,130
He goes over to the jetty, was going to
be the jets coach. It was right there.

386
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:41,950
And then he just wanted to get off Monday,
bill Parcells and he left.

387
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,410
So I, it wouldn't be a defection out
of Boston. It would be a return home.

388
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,430
We fucking stole that guy in 1999
we've gone to seven Superbowls.

389
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,360
One five maybe. That's why we never beat
the giants. That was the football gods.

390
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:03,900
God Bill, you never shut a
left actually showed a left.

391
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,753
You know what I mean?

392
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,810
That was like when he stepped
out from bill Parcell shadow,

393
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:13,340
it became the fucking legend
that he is now. But anyway,

394
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:14,500
so the end of the fucking day,

395
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:17,650
I don't give a fuck about Tom Brady's
personal trainer. I don't give a shit.

396
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,370
Who the fuck would break up the
Goddamn band over that is beyond me.

397
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,280
Am I really supposed to think that that's
a real fucking thing that would shock

398
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:31,180
me? Not if he left. It would just
shock me. If it was over that.

399
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,810
Okay.

400
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,220
But you know, Bill Parcells
leftover Terry Glen, rest in peace.

401
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,063
You know,

402
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,720
I'll never quite forgive that guy for
telling the fucking team that he wasn't

403
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,630
coming back the next year before we
played the packers and the Superbowl.

404
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,650
And uh,

405
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,260
actually has that ever even
been confirmed? Somebody
just told me he did that.

406
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,611
All right,

407
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,700
I'd like to apologize to bill Parcells
with the fuck am I talking about here?

408
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,470
She listening to as a man who
did nothing but this weekend.

409
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,370
That's what you're doing.
Okay.

410
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,550
That's why you probably listening cause
you probably did it too. All right,

411
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,270
here's one of the Douchey is things.
I haven't done it yet,

412
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:14,420
but I'm going to do it and I feel like
I have to admit to it before I do it.

413
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,260
Okay.
Anybody in in Ireland,

414
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,270
we're not going to make sure that's the
right country. Who Makes Shepherd's Pie?

415
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,390
You know what I mean? There's,
there's like all these,

416
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,450
those fucking Pi's over there and I love
all of them cause I got all that blood

417
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:34,010
in me. English, Irish, Scottish, so at
any sort of Elena knows fucking meat pies.

418
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:35,000
I liked that shit.
All right.

419
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:40,001
Shepherd's Pie or Ridge in

420
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:46,810
shepherd's pie was invented by shame
is so shepherd shepherds pie or cottage

421
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:53,000
pie. He's a meat pie. Bababababa
[inaudible] place of origin.

422
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:56,720
The United Kingdom. Oh, all right.

423
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,430
Cause there's no sheep in Ireland. Is that
what it is? I always forget that then.

424
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,200
Then Ireland, they make it. They'd make
a different one. Right. Shepherd's Pie,

425
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,680
cottage pie, blah blah, blah, blah. That
just you get could get care history.

426
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,010
It's going to be boring as shit.
In early cookbooks,

427
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:18,210
the dish was a means of using leftover
roasted meat of any kind in the pie dish

428
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:23,211
was lined with mashed potatoes as well
as having a mashed potato crust on top.

429
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,050
Oh, say build a wall around it
back then. Where did it come from?

430
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:31,990
Okay.

431
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,450
I like that. I can't find it so I
can't, so I just yelled at my computer.

432
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,910
I don't give a fuck. You
know, that's it right there.

433
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:42,700
That's why I didn't do well in school.
I look it up and I have again, I got,

434
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,720
I got that clock in my head
like a quarterback. You know,

435
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,960
we've got the clock before I just throw
it out of bounce. I don't care. No, no.

436
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:51,570
I'm not going to learn it. I'll, I'll
fucking make it up on the next question.

437
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,890
And that's why I got like a three
90 combined on my sats. I did.

438
00:26:55,891 --> 00:27:00,230
And I took a prep course and I actually,
I actually,

439
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:04,890
I studied, did I break it? I
don't think I break broke 400.

440
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,940
I know. Whatever you do is you look,
do they give you like three 50? I know,

441
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,050
I know.
Um,

442
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,030
anyways, I'm going to make a shepherd's
pie with cauliflower mashed potatoes.

443
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,520
I just have to pause here
as everybody's gone. Um,

444
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,563
yeah.

445
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,920
Cause this gluten free diet that I'm
doing that I'm kind of half ass doing it,

446
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,760
but just half ass doing it.
I don't have to work out.

447
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,100
It's fucking great telling you,
man.

448
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:42,510
If you lay off the gluten, I remember
thinking, what the fuck is glued?

449
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:45,510
And then they told me what it's
everything that it's in. And I'm like, oh,

450
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:49,020
so like all the good foods,
all the foods I love.

451
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,923
MMM.

452
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,650
I've just been laying off the
old glute there. Uh, gluten free.

453
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:59,920
If you ever saw my flat ass, she be
surprised on us. Sorry. Bad joke.

454
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:02,931
Yeah.

455
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:07,760
So I'm going to make it with a
cauliflower because I'm not allowed to eat

456
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:12,710
potatoes.
I'm sorry people,

457
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:15,430
I've been out here too long.
You know,

458
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,500
I've been 10 years out here,
out here in Hollywood,

459
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,440
and I become a gluten free Douche.
I'm not really,

460
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,180
because I got these Brioche buns that I
bought for the hot dogs at the Rose Bowl

461
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,780
and it was the only thing I fucked up.
I forgot to not only bring hot dogs,

462
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:31,800
I forgot to buy them.

463
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,580
So I have all of these brioche bonds and
it's like I'm not going to throw them

464
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,230
out.
So when I brought some hot dogs,

465
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:40,970
so I'm kind of full of sodium
and gluten at this point. Um,

466
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,140
anyways, so I'm going to
make shepherd's pie with, um,

467
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,660
mashed potato and I'm not putting,
well,

468
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,560
it's one recipe I saw they had corn in
it and I was like, oh, I want to fucking,

469
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,420
why would you do that?
It's all about the piece.

470
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,900
You had the lamb in there,
right?

471
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,760
You get a little bit of
onion and minced that up,

472
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,080
couple of other fucking salt and pepper,
whatever else you put in there. And then,

473
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,910
then,
then you get the piece fucking corn.

474
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,350
It's an imposter,
doesn't have the guts of a p.

475
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,870
That's what yellow.
It's a little yellow.

476
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:18,860
Fucking cowardly fucking sort
of vegetable. Then a fruit.

477
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,780
Is it not at all. So that's why I'm, I do,

478
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:23,800
I'll make a shepherd's pie
with fucking mashed potatoes.

479
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,780
Got Cauliflower mashed potatoes.

480
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,480
I actually really like cauliflower mashed
potatoes. I don't like cauliflower.

481
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,150
But if you're gonna throw a
bunch of butter on it, I mean,

482
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:33,790
how is it not going to taste good?
You know,

483
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,600
the only thing I really don't like is
that fucking, uh, what is that shit?

484
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:41,890
They were putting in
everything for awhile. Oh,

485
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:44,140
what the fuck it was it
being with at teed in it?

486
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,980
Truffle oil.

487
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,820
Okay.

488
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,101
I mean,

489
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:55,730
one time we went out and there was mashed
potatoes and they had truffle oil in

490
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:56,660
it. No, no, I'm sorry.

491
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,980
Head at a macaroni and cheese
and they put truffle oil.

492
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,540
Why would you do that? You don't need
to, it's pasta with cheese. Fuck off.

493
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:12,030
You know, truffle oil for a while it was
like the fucking Hari Krishna of herbal

494
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,630
ingredients, you know? Yeah.

495
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:21,000
Tell him he don't want any
fuck out of you. We need low.

496
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,003
Um,

497
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,540
okay.

498
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:24,820
And I,

499
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,700
and the waiter or the waitress or is,

500
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:32,400
is there an, is there, I can't believe
no one's been offended by that yet.

501
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:35,970
Wait around and wait. She said, and we're
all waiters is, is there a fucking, uh,

502
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:40,640
gender, gender neutral fucking
term we can come up with that, uh,

503
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,880
wait, attended, who that's going
to give someone a body image.

504
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,420
Um, the fucking person
who gives you your food,

505
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:55,200
who would rather be doing a
different job for better money there.

506
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,330
Is that a good description?
Was that genderless? Um,

507
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,210
told me that there was only a little
bit of trust. It's just a hint of it.

508
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,830
That's just a hint. That's just a
dash. And I was like, all right,

509
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,840
and I ordered it and it just,
it just sucked.

510
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,460
Truffle oil overpowers
every fucking thing.

511
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,680
It's like a comic that's on offstage,
like a fucking lamp shade over.

512
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:24,430
It's God damn head. I hate truffle
oil. I don't even know what it is.

513
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,690
Should I look that up and fucking,
is it from like a mushroom or something?

514
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,090
Truffle.

515
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,580
Okay.

516
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:32,900
Oil.

517
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,470
This is why the Internet mets makes
people less funny because back in the day

518
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:41,730
you just had no idea and he just guessed
and then there was always somebody in

519
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:46,230
the room with a big enough fucking ego
to just definitively give you an answer

520
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,300
even though they didn't know. Truffle
oil is a modern culinary ingredient.

521
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:55,290
Used to impart the flavor and
aroma of truffles to a dish.

522
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,660
All right,
now we're looking up truffles.

523
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,440
Truffle is a fruiting body of subterranean

524
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,940
has come set fungus. Oh
fuck. Is that all right?

525
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,990
Now I'm looking up a scum set.

526
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,720
A scum set is a division or a
phylum of the Kingdom of Fuji.

527
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,650
Fuji. All right. What's
a phylum in biology?

528
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:29,180
A phylum is a level of classification.
Alright.

529
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,740
Taxonomic rank.

530
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:38,150
Biological classification. A taxonomical
rank. See what I'm saying? It,

531
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:38,984
this is why I don't look up.

532
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,900
I'm too dumb to understand the fucking
definition. It just, it just keeps going.

533
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,100
It's like a humble.

534
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,150
Okay.

535
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,820
By the time you get down and you don't
even know what the fuck you were asking

536
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:53,880
the question. So keep it going.
Like, like, uh, I can't say that.

537
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,160
You know what I mean? Some of
these fleet streaming sites, right.

538
00:32:56,161 --> 00:32:59,870
And you're fucking, oh, I want to watch
that. Oh, wait a watch that now watch.

539
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,850
It was another thing I was going
to watch. Um, all right. Anyways,

540
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,730
so what am I read a little about
advertising? Shelly shall lie.

541
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:14,300
Read a little bit of advertising.
Oh, look who's back in Doki. Oh,

542
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,250
Indochino talk about how every man
looks better in his suit. Yes, they do.

543
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:24,510
Especially if it's an all black
suit at the Golden Globes.

544
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,800
So we know that your progressive,
okay.

545
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,650
We know that you're a progressive person,

546
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:38,150
you're not wearing that suit to a
hopefully ward off any investigation on

547
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:42,370
yourself.
Alright?

548
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,610
Indochino is the largest
custom apparel company,

549
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,120
okay?

550
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,870
They make suits and shirts.
I know those words in French costs.

551
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,880
Dube shimmies made to your exact
measurements for a great fit.

552
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Guys love the wide selection of high
quality fabrics and the option to

553
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:08,680
personalize all the details,
including the lapel jacket lining,

554
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,480
monogram, and much more. That's actually
cool. You can customize it. All right.

555
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,960
Here's how it works. Pick your
fabric, choose your customization,

556
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:18,280
submit your measurements,

557
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,720
place your order and wait for it
to arrive in three weeks or less.

558
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:27,220
Is it any wonder why people are
so fat now? This is incredible.

559
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,570
You can shoot back in the day if
you wanted to have something made,

560
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:34,570
you had to go down and talk to Jimmy, the
gent and he'd be like, yeah, keep going.

561
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,010
Should I did try dad's.
Okay,

562
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,870
you almost got whacked trying to get your
own personal fees. Fucking millennials,

563
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:41,860
they don't have to work for anything.

564
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,370
He can shop online and then don't cheat
or.com or visit any of their showrooms

565
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,720
across North America this week.

566
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:54,721
My listeners can get any premium indochine

you can't tell the difference between

606
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:47,870

any questions, the clerk he is,

607
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:51,770
he doesn't know what the fuck
they're talking about either or.

608
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:54,620
You can't really help you since they're,
they're not experts on the product.

609
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,680
So usually,
you know,

610
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,830
there's just one person working the
register and there's somebody else running

611
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:01,590
around getting ice cream for old people.
There's nobody, there's nobody there.

612
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,453
You know what I mean?

613
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,490
I love when the old people go into the
fucking pharmacy to get their ice cream,

614
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,743
you know?

615
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:07,860
Okay.

616
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,840
That's how they live off social security.

617
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,170
Yeah.

618
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,940
You know,

619
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,060
All of us running around going
to these gourmet fucking places,

620
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:19,390
they go to the pharmacy.
Ice Cream is ice cream.

621
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:21,220
It all gives you a headache
if you eat it fast enough.

622
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,110

673
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,680
[inaudible] [inaudible] all right.
And went done.

674
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:37,490
We're done the reeds for the

675
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:40,520
you have noticed that, uh, I am in
a little more of a perkier mood.

676
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,420
I am in a great move. Cause guess what?
Guess what? Guess what? Guess what?

677
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,350
Guess what?
Um,

678
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:51,340
I finally made a breakthrough in my
rehab of this fucking lingering a rotator

679
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:58,670
cuff injury. You're not sorry. I don't
even know if it's cup or cuff links. Cuff.

680
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,330
I always forget.
I think I said Cup for most of my life.

681
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,990
Let's go back to row a Wikipedia rotate

682
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,060
Brodie Tor. Oh, it's cuff.

683
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,150
It's not cup in anatomy.
The rotator cuff is a group of muscles

684
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,770
and their attendance, that act
to stabilize the shoulder. Yeah,

685
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,870
that's the problem because
when they fucking don't,

686
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,660
you show the kind of comes out of
the socket maybe, I don't know.

687
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,310
Okay.

688
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,530
Uh,
the four muscles of the rotator cuff are,

689
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:35,970
are over half of the seven
scapular meal muscles.

690
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,090
Scampi it for you.

691
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:41,150
And marbles are a group of seven
muscles that connect to the humorous,

692
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,310
humorous to the Scapula.

693
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,440
They are amongst the
muscles that act on the

694
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,640
Glio rule. Well Joe, what the fuck
is that? The shoulder joint. Oh,

695
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:57,620
that's his shoulder.
Joined the Glencoe Humber all join up.

696
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,000
It gives a fuck many ways.

697
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,070
My shoulder's been bugging
me so I didn't understand.

698
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,170
Um, I don't understand how to Rehab.
I like when I felt pain, I stopped.

699
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:11,760
I didn't understand that you had to
kind of go into it a little bit like you

700
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,470
skimming the frost enough, right?
We should making steel cut oats,

701
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,470
you know that awful Gluey Shit on top.
You just skim that off.

702
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:22,230
He kind of got to do that
with the pain. So, um,

703
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,130
yeah,

704
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,710
it's person told me this great
exercise we were, I just,

705
00:43:26,711 --> 00:43:30,130
I laid down on my back
and then put my arm,

706
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,550
like if I was standing up,
I would be pointing straight ahead.

707
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,550
But when you lay down your back, you're
not pointing at the ceiling. Okay?

708
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:38,560
I'm not saying put your arm
up over your fucking head.

709
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,370
Just pointing straight up and
just start making little circles,

710
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,330
you know, a bunch clockwise,
a bunch counterclockwise.

711
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:52,350
And then you just gradually increase
slowly as shit the circumference of them.

712
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,400
And when you start to feel the
top layer of pain, you know,

713
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,760
that's where you stopped. But you,
but when you, when I was going, wow,

714
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:05,650
I've been doing it when I go around
into this circle is I kinda stay at an

715
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:09,490
acceptable level of confronting the pain.
And I swear to God,

716
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:13,780
I've been doing that for
like the legislature since
a Thursday and I've gotten

717
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:17,680
like 30% increase,
I would say in my range of motion.

718
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,830
And I feel like I can get this thing,
you know,

719
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,360
I'm not saying restrengthen it,

720
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,960
but I think I can get it all back by
the end of the fucking month. Oh, I,

721
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:28,730
I can't say that because I don't want to
fucking rush it because I don't mess it

722
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:30,610
up again.
Um,

723
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:31,780
yeah,

724
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,910
they're very excited about,
that's putting me in a better mood.

725
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:35,140
You know what they say?
You know,

726
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:40,080
hey, at least she got you health because
it puts you in a bad guy. Damn mood. Um,

727
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,900
all right. So somebody was asking
me, Dean del Ray's diet. Hi Bill.

728
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:46,710
Can you please talk about Dean
del Ray's diet details on,

729
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,800
on his next podcast?
I'd like to lose a little weight myself,

730
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:54,900
so I have to go into
Dean del Ray's podcasts.

731
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:59,010
Let there be talk from the all things
comedy network, network network.

732
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,350
Um, Dean can explain it. I
don't remember all of it.

733
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:08,380
I just kind of like,
I eat like for breakfast I have two eggs,

734
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,400
always g and then I have a one serving
of steel cut oats to take for fucking

735
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,340
ever to cook. Um, it's
another way to lose weight,

736
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,740
waiting for your food to be ready.
Um,

737
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,620
and then for like a snack,
I'll have a z bread,

738
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,340
which tastes like shit unless you put
butter. And I have almond, peanut butter,

739
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,550
almond butter is what it is.
And uh,

740
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,550
I have that and that's actually
fucking delicious. And it's filling.

741
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,930
And then for lunch I have a

742
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,970
keen awash with uh,

743
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:42,470
okay

744
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,520
with black beans.

745
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,090
And then I throw salsa on top to
give it some sort of fucking flavor.

746
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:49,910
Cause other than that, you know, I've
never eaten a shoe with, you know,

747
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,430
with a newspaper on top because
that's what it tastes like.

748
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,690
And I try to avoid throwing salt
and any of that shit in there. Um,

749
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:59,210
and then in the afternoon,
I dunno,

750
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,880
what the fuck do I have?

751
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,940
There's always that one meal
before you have the real meal.

752
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,940
Right around four o'clock.
I have like a fucking a

753
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,500
okay.

754
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,890
I Dunno what. Sometimes I'll
have a whatever the fuck I want.

755
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:16,130
And other times it's like this
pasta that's made out of chickpeas,

756
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,670
it tastes a little weird, but
it's not that bad, you know?

757
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,500
And then for dinner I just have a protein
with like a salad and I'm done and I

758
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:29,450
just drink waters and I stay away from
the booze and all of that bullshit.

759
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,400
And um,

760
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,520
it's just weird thing when
you eat like that where

761
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,240
I think what you mean when
you say God like, God, this
food is so boring and blah,

762
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:45,520
blah, blah, blah, blah. It's cause
you're used to the sugar assault.

763
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:50,890
It gets your system going like sugars or
salt does whatever the fuck salt does.

764
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,180
Like it's like you get your
fix so when you eat that,

765
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,410
what do eat stuff that doesn't
have any of that in it. Um,

766
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,010
okay.

767
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:05,390
You're just not hungry afterwards
and it's weird and then,

768
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,430
but you feel energized. But it's
a, it's a different kind of,

769
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:13,630
you got to adjust your brain to the
fueling your body rush as opposed to the,

770
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,000
the rollercoaster of sugar and salt.
Um,

771
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:25,020
so I that, that's as much as I know
about the Diet and I've been doing that.

772
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:28,170
And then, you know, I like
that most of the time,

773
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,190
probably 80% of the time I eat that way.

774
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,220
And then occasionally if I just
want to have a fucking pizza eat it.

775
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:38,560
But Dean does it, dangerous fucking
stays with it. And that fucking guy,

776
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:42,250
he'll every once in a while he just sends
me a picture of him when I first met

777
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:44,050
him. It doesn't, he doesn't
all get the same person.

778
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:45,760
Okay.

779
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,590
Cause not only did he
lose all this weight,

780
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:52,540
like he like his skin fucking cleared up.
You know,

781
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,010
they used to look like a fucking cop
with 20 years in is what it used to look

782
00:47:57,011 --> 00:48:00,820
like. You know, now he looks
like a fucking rock star. Um,

783
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,060
so I would listen to him out his podcasts,
let there be talking. I'm sure he's,

784
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:10,100
he said a dietician or something.
He gets great guests over there. Um,

785
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,710
all right bill, you're not an
addict. Hey old ginger balls.

786
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,540
Uh, I'm a big fan of the
podcast and looking forward
to your next special and the

787
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:22,600
new season of F is for family.
Keep up the great work. Thank you.

788
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:26,410
I been listening to the podcast for the
last couple of weeks and I've heard you

789
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:29,630
going back and forth about abstaining,

790
00:48:29,631 --> 00:48:34,210
but from booze and most recently
about a, yeah, I'm sorry. They fuck,

791
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,270
I said a lot of bad things about Aa.
If it fucking works for he works for you.

792
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:40,330
It's just, it's just fun to make fun
of that Shit. You know, it's funny,

793
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,730
I saw the other day in a
strip mall. It was, you know,

794
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:44,170
all these different
stores that one of the,

795
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,370
one of the stores there and
said alcoholics anonymous,
you know what I mean?

796
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:51,820
It's uh, it's kind of putting
it out there, isn't it?

797
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:54,580
You know,
it's bad enough.

798
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:57,790
These poor people had to sneak into porno
stores and that type of shit back when

799
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:59,860
they would drink at night. You know,
you're going to do that to him. Just,

800
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,030
yeah.

801
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:06,950
Shouldn't it say bill W's? Well,
I guess how that signed up,

802
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:09,690
a bunch of cats like me might be walking
in like, what are you guys selling?

803
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:14,990
And you guys would be like, hope
smoke filled room with donuts. Um,

804
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,710
I've been working in addiction
and back to the letter here,

805
00:49:18,711 --> 00:49:22,820
I had been working in addiction and
the addiction field for over a decade,

806
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,130
teach and addiction course at a college
and work at one of the most highly

807
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:33,080
respected addiction programs
up here in Canada. Ah, dude.

808
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,410
You know, you had it all. You
had me until you said Canada.

809
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,050
Canada doesn't count.

810
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,060
Yeah.

811
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,260
Dude, you, you live in Canada. For me to
be considered an alcoholic and Canada.

812
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:47,630
I have to drink like
fucking two cases a Molson.

813
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,520
Okay.

814
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,300
You guys, animals up there have you
guys don't know you're alcoholic.

815
00:49:53,301 --> 00:49:57,140
She just think you keeping
warm. All right, well let me,
let me not judge this guy.

816
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,360
Now that I've mentioned my credentials,

817
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,120
while at the same time sounding
like a pompous content are,

818
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:06,440
I love this guy called himself out on,
I can tell you that you are not an addict,

819
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,950
but it's like you are not the father,
you are not an addict,

820
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:13,220
but everything you have mentioned on the
podcast that I am a longtime listener.

821
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,910
Um, oh, so when you said we listened
to the last couple of weeks,

822
00:50:16,911 --> 00:50:19,370
I guess you'd dip in and
dip up, right? All right.

823
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:22,220
The word addiction is thrown around a lot,

824
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:27,980
so as the word hero is thrown
around a lot and typically to

825
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,980
any behavior that is out of our control
a to put it as simply as possible.

826
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:37,640
People will often say things like they're
addicted to things like TV, shopping,

827
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:38,900
sex,
et cetera.

828
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:44,000
People will also use the word to
explain what draws system symptoms of a

829
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:45,950
substance or behavior.
I,

830
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,550
I must be addicted to coffee because I
get headaches in the morning if I don't

831
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:51,200
get a cup.
However,

832
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,440
experiencing enjoyment or withdrawal
symptoms does not mean that someone has an

833
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,304
addiction.

834
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,840
Can we just kind of stop here and say
this is one of the best written fucking

835
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:07,520
letters in a while. I apologize that
my level of intellect is reading it,

836
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:10,190
but I think you guys can hear that this
person seems to know what he's talking

837
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:15,191
about or she or it or
her who used to be him.

838
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,180
Did I cover everything? However, in
the edition, in the addiction field,

839
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,240
there is a way to tell if
someone has an addiction.

840
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:28,610
We call them the four C's of addiction,
cash,

841
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,400
cons,
cauliflower

842
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:38,750
and I dunno, I, I bring up in
the chargers la charges. Okay.

843
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:41,270
If you've persisted,
if you can,

844
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,280
if you have persistent cravings
for drugs, alcohol, slash, alcohol,

845
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:50,960
if you have lost control over how
much and how frequently you use,

846
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:55,550
if you continue to use despite
consequences. I he legal issues,

847
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:58,190
job loss,
children taken away.

848
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,080
And if you feel a compulsion to use I,
he always feeling like you need,

849
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:04,700
okay,

850
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,940
uh, a drug or alcohol is a
bunch of weed smokers going, um,

851
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,240
and alcohol is a drug.
Uh,

852
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:14,220
then you can begin to think
you have an addiction.

853
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,120
Knowing what I know about
from you, uh, on the podcast,

854
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:20,130
I'm not going to pretend
to know you personally.

855
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:25,110
I have never heard you
mentioned any significant
consequences around booze other

856
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:28,620
than your Dui when you were young
and you have control of booze.

857
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:33,621
Since you can have a full bar in the house
and not drink it and abstain for long

858
00:52:33,781 --> 00:52:36,150
periods at a time from booze,

859
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,960
the bar in the home also means you
don't have a compulsion to drink.

860
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,040
People that struggle with significant
alcoholism cannot have booze just sitting

861
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:48,170
around their place drinking it. It's
fucking funny to me. I don't know why.

862
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,250
Like they're just sitting there seeing
it at the corner of the ride and they're

863
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:54,480
like sweating. It's
fucking looking at me, man.

864
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,470
He liked that black dude and predators
shaving your head. I see you over there,

865
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,100
that bar.
Um,

866
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:08,040
I don't believe you have an addiction
and you don't need to go to Aa for me.

867
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,950
He wrote it all in capitals.
Uh,

868
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,760
you're just some content likes to boos
whose job in lifestyle allows for it.

869
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,820
Dude, you're going to talk
me to drink it tonight. Um,

870
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,030
if you ever feel like you d
do need some serious help,

871
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,700
go see a professional instead of some,
sorry,

872
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:28,500
sat bleeding his heart in a church
basement in front of a group of strangers.

873
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,180
Having said that, I know Aa does work
for some people and if you're into that,

874
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:36,690
knock yourself out, you just like me,
you had to shit on it a little bit.

875
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:41,520
I hope this helps and can silence the
bill w listeners of the Monday morning

876
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:45,900
podcast. Best of luck in the new year and
all the best in the air and your lovely

877
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:50,020
daughter and go fuck yourself. Wow.
I might have to fucking download,

878
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,790
download that, whatever
printed out and frame it, uh,

879
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:58,710
at framers.net or whatever the fuck
those people are. Frame Bridge.

880
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,640
I got to use those guys for
that. Wow. That was awesome.

881
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,720
That made me feel better about myself.
Um,

882
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:12,180
am I going to drink now? No, I got to go
do a set tonight. Uh, all right, chef.

883
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,750
Not Making enough money.
That was really informative by the way.

884
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,133
MMM.

885
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:22,870
I definitely went through periods
where I was craving it, you know,

886
00:54:22,871 --> 00:54:25,750
and didn't want to drink and I was
just like, this is what I did. And,

887
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,720
and he and I would just go
over it and I just, you know,

888
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,680
but I felt more like a diet thing,
like late at night,

889
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,080
just fucking eat.
Well,

890
00:54:35,081 --> 00:54:38,050
don't go out and go make a fucking
grilled cheese sandwich your friend,

891
00:54:38,051 --> 00:54:39,370
and then you just go out and do it.

892
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,880
But what that first fucking night when
you don't do it, then I could stop.

893
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:46,000
So yeah, I don't think I am.
Bill. Stop giving you examples.

894
00:54:46,001 --> 00:54:50,020
The guy left you off the hook. All
right, chef. Not Making enough money.

895
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,730
All right,
dear Billy Betty Crocker,

896
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:58,750
I liked that one a way to go champ.
On your pie making skills.

897
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,930
I'm the chef of a new
restaurant this year.

898
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,870
The restaurant has made a hundred
grand more than a year before.

899
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:08,560
The restaurant is doing great,
but I'm making sad money.

900
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,520
I have a wife and a daughter.
My wife has always supported my cooking,

901
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:14,560
but I don't make the
money. I should. Recently,

902
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:19,561
my wife told me I could work with her
brother as an electrician for the water

903
00:55:19,931 --> 00:55:23,620
district. I could be making three
times more than what I could as a chef.

904
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,950
I love cooking. It's the one
thing that makes me happy too.

905
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:31,951
I hang tight with the cooking and do
what I love or skip out and go with the

906
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:37,030
easy money. I have investors ready to
support my cooking, but I need money. Now.

907
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:41,170
Love to hear what your thoughts
are. Your thoughts. Oh Jesus, do.

908
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,850
This is a huge fucking decision.

909
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,660
How much do you love cooking? Is this
your dream? Is this what you want to do?

910
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,003
MMM,

911
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,610
I,
I can only equate to standup comedy.

912
00:55:57,611 --> 00:56:00,430
There is not a job out there that
would have paid three times more

913
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,600
than what I could make as a
comedian that I would have ever,

914
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:07,060
ever even for a second,
considered

915
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,990
ever,
ever.

916
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,040
Not even for a fucking second.
Okay.

917
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:18,840
If you feel that way about cooking that
I would stay with the chef jump. However,

918
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:23,090
if you know,
if you don't feel that way,

919
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:26,400
I would talk to somebody else.
This is a major decision, dude.

920
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:29,170
I'm not making this decision
for you, but I can tell you, uh,

921
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,923
you know,

922
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,460
one of the great things about my dream
of being a comedian was I really had no

923
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:41,300
other options because I kind of sucked
at everything else and I was miserable

924
00:56:41,301 --> 00:56:42,200
doing anything else.

925
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,780
And that was the only thing I ever
did where the second I did it,

926
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:49,220
I was just like, oh, I'm doing this for
fucking ever said I don't give a shit.

927
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:55,150
So, uh, but I also didn't have a
wife and a daughter at the time.

928
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,770
There's a lot of variables here.

929
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,030
MMM.

930
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,720
You have investors ready
to support your cooking,

931
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,190
but any money right now?

932
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:07,923
Uh,

933
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,010
I would say this, if, if you,
this is your decision buddy.

934
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,650
If you decide to keep cooking,
you gotta,

935
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,870
you gotta get your wife on the right page.

936
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:20,220
You guys got to give him extra to
say on the same page. You know,

937
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,620
if you really believe in yourself
and then you can run a restaurant,

938
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,050
you can be one of those guys,
right?

939
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,480
Walking around with the orange clogs,
fucking riding a vesper and all that shit.

940
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:33,120
You know,
like Mario Batali,

941
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,350
that was another guy,
foggy grabbed a couple people's asses.

942
00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:40,140
Now I never get to see him again.
You know what I mean?

943
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,310
Kenny just fucking from
his self imposed exile.

944
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:47,460
He can't just make a fucking use the
well method and show me how to make

945
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:51,270
something, you know, you just
put them on a leash, right?

946
00:57:51,271 --> 00:57:54,810
You put them on a fucking leash and he
can't go anywhere away from the island in

947
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:59,730
his kitchen. Uh, anyways. All
right. That's what I would do.

948
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:04,320
Okay, so I would ask, how much do you
want to be a fucking chef? All right.

949
00:58:04,321 --> 00:58:06,660
And if you want to be a chef,
you gotta get your wife on the same page.

950
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,660
Other than that, uh, you know,
if it's not your fucking dream,

951
00:58:11,661 --> 00:58:15,410
then you could just fucking become an
electrician who has the best fucking

952
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:20,030
cookouts ever. All right. Ex-Girlfriend
hooks up with stranger at party.

953
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:24,660
We both attended.
Okay.

954
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:26,600
Okay.

955
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,140
Hey Billy, on the back.
Nine of life. That's true.

956
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,450
My girlfriend and I broke up about
four months ago after an 11 year

957
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:38,000
relationship. Wow. Sorry to hear that.

958
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:41,810
We share a lot of the same friends and
I knew we would see each other at a

959
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:46,250
friend's New Year's party.
Two days before the party,

960
00:58:46,251 --> 00:58:51,230
my ex hit me up and asked to get a drink
and clear the air before seeing each

961
00:58:51,231 --> 00:58:53,750
other for the first
time since the breakup.

962
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,960
We had an awesome time and
we ended up going out again

963
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,910
the next night and add
an even better time.

964
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:05,710
She then asked if I wanted to share a
cab to and from the New Year's party.

965
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:10,711
I agreed while at the party she met a
guy and they were all over each other the

966
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,690
entire night.
Oh God.

967
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,890
She ended up ditching me and going
home with him at the end of the night.

968
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:23,270
I have hooked up with a few people to
break up but never in front of my ex.

969
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:28,430
And after the previous two nights I was
absolutely devastated by what she did.

970
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,230
I would love any advice or insight.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

971
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:38,300
Well that it really seemed like,
unless she was completely shit faced,

972
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:42,080
that really seem a little calculated.
And that right there sir.

973
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:47,140
Your story right there is why I avoided
staying in contact with ex-girlfriends.

974
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,980
I'm not saying they were all bad,
but I had a girlfriend like that,

975
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:57,250
an x and uh,

976
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:02,210
they have like this sixth sense is right
is you're starting to get past and over

977
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:06,080
them. They just feel it. They call
you up and they just fuck you.

978
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:08,910
Life your head up all over again.
Um,

979
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:14,490
here's one for you dude. What kind
of a person would do that? Huh?

980
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,370
The kind of person that you
don't want to put your seed in.

981
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,450
Just know that that could have been
the mother of your fucking children.

982
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,550
You dodged a bullet. Congratulations
sir. Congratulations.

983
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,413
Okay.

984
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:34,630
And I'm willing to bet that unless
she completely fucks up her life,

985
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:41,770
you will not hear from her again or
you will hear from her because she is a

986
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:48,230
sadistic person and wants
to hear your reaction.

987
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:50,000
She wants to hear the pain

988
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:54,060
and get off on it while she goes like,
well,

989
01:00:54,061 --> 01:00:57,480
I didn't think there'd be a
problem because we were broken up.

990
01:00:57,481 --> 01:01:02,160
So I don't know why you're putting this
on me. Okay. I thought we both had,

991
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:03,450
we have nice time.

992
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,950
We were adults and the whole time she's
just getting off on the fact that you

993
01:01:07,951 --> 01:01:11,100
still give a fuck. So Ah, dude,

994
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:15,390
you dodged a major fucking bull. I mean
I, I would never do that to somebody.

995
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:19,470
I would never, I wouldn't
do that. Like if a,

996
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,630
you know, I, I wouldn't do that
now. I've been with Nia forever.

997
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:30,690
If I saw an x grove, I would never
fucking, I would just western hail,

998
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:32,220
let's get out of here.
It's gonna, you know,

999
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,280
let's go someplace a little more quieter.

1000
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,670
I would never do that to somebody
that's just a fucking asshole,

1001
01:01:38,671 --> 01:01:41,520
male of female to do that to somebody
who's a really fucking asshole thing.

1002
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:44,160
I'm sorry that happened to you, but you
know what? You know what's great too.

1003
01:01:44,161 --> 01:01:47,670
She's out of your life. She's
Outta your life. And you know,

1004
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,830
you know what those people are,
but they like those.

1005
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:53,910
What about Bob people you know, remember
the beginning of, what about Bob?

1006
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:57,570
The therapist gets Bill
Murray's character away from it.

1007
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,620
Dumps him in fucking Dreyfus.
His lap. That's what she's,

1008
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,160
she's the fucking, the female
version. Those what about Bob People?

1009
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:07,770
If you can ever dump them off on
other people's fucking tremendous.

1010
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:12,360
And she did it to herself
and this is what you do.

1011
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:15,630
Anytime you ever see her after that,
just big smile on your face.

1012
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:20,460
Big Smile on your face. Hey, how are
you doing? Why are you mad? No, no,

1013
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:21,570
we broken up.

1014
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:25,360
Good for you. You know,
have the time of your life,

1015
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,440
my senior leave.

1016
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:30,970
All right.

1017
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:35,970
And now's a great time dude to
fucking expand your horizon.

1018
01:02:36,641 --> 01:02:40,060
Find new friends and dull a fucking hobby.

1019
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:43,300
Travel Gig itself in great shape.
Go to the gym.

1020
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:47,560
It's time to you fucking work on you.
And that person is,

1021
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,290
is in the rear view fucking mirror.

1022
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:56,540
You know what all she did was give you a
great fucking story to tell the love of

1023
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:59,060
your life. Cause that,
that chicane it. All right.

1024
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:04,370
Enjoy your 2018 you're a free man. All
right. This girl is killing me man.

1025
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,110
All right, dear Billy, big head.

1026
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,120
Ah Shit. You guys are really accurate this
week. Uh, back nine, big head. I mean,

1027
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:17,620
what are what? I'm fucking on the
ropes here so we throw in the towel a,

1028
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,190
I am a sophomore in high school,

1029
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,440
okay,

1030
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,290
but I've been listening to your
podcast podcast for a year now.

1031
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:26,740
I need some advice out. Jesus
Christ. This is fucking scary.

1032
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:31,360
I hope you need some fucking
regular advice. All right,

1033
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:35,260
I need some advice on how to handle
this. Girl. Hey Nia, you out there.

1034
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:37,743
They are.

1035
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,600
You want to,
you want to give this kid some advice?

1036
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:47,460
Oh, that's right. You're
sick. Okay. Sorry.

1037
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:56,070
Hang on. Let me hit pause here. Hang on.
Hang on. All right. I'm back. I'm back.

1038
01:03:56,071 --> 01:03:58,500
Jesus Christ. She's still
sick. She's still sick.

1039
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,340
Sleeping upstairs again tonight.
Um,

1040
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:04,973
all right.

1041
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,980
A sophomore in high school and I need
some advice and he knows how to handle

1042
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:11,670
this girl. I dated her for about nine
months last year. A lot of heartache this,

1043
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,680
this week and learned a lot.

1044
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:17,640
The problem is that this girl is
really immature and I cannot have a

1045
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:20,250
conversation with her without her arguing.

1046
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:21,470
Yeah.

1047
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:21,750
Sorry.

1048
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,120
Pick this up without arguing with me or
something over something not important.

1049
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:30,550
Oh, tell you're a son who gives a
shit. Fucking move on to the next one.

1050
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,411
For example,

1051
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:35,410
towards the end of my relationship with
her and she gave me the silent treatment

1052
01:04:35,411 --> 01:04:38,560
for multiple days because I told
her I didn't like Australia.

1053
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,230
She constantly insulted me,
called me dumb, and told me
I was a terrible brother.

1054
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:49,660
The date and your sister when
she just observed your family.

1055
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,193
What state

1056
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,220
did this come from and did crazy things
like this throughout our relationship.

1057
01:04:55,221 --> 01:04:59,080
She's one of those girls who
thinks that she, she's always,

1058
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:04,150
she thought that she always gets to be
right and I am not and I am not about

1059
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:06,970
that life.
He says when she broke up with me,

1060
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,340
it was this whole scene,
Walter,

1061
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,190
that sounds like you dodged a bullet here.

1062
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:19,300
What dating is all about is what you
don't want and then you figured that out

1063
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:22,710
and then you finally fucking meet
the right person. You totally, yeah,

1064
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:24,490
you're fucking youngest shit.
What's the problem here?

1065
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:26,850
I got very close with
their family and while,

1066
01:05:26,851 --> 01:05:30,730
so you're a good guy and when we broke
up her seven year old sister's sobbed,

1067
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,430
Jesus Christ,

1068
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:38,590
her mom even went to the extent to call
me on the phone to tell me I was a great

1069
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:42,730
boyfriend and wished me wish that me and
her could possibly work things out in

1070
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:43,510
the future.

1071
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,110
Her family adores me to this day due
to the fact that I really played up the

1072
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:50,170
whole nice guy thing or what
are you really an asshole.

1073
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:53,710
This is where things get even worse.
She constantly leads,

1074
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,130
leads me on and I fall for it.
Yeah.

1075
01:05:57,131 --> 01:06:01,870
That's what being young is all about.
And at a town fair we have,

1076
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,840
we have,
she hung out with me all weekend.

1077
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:09,190
We were very flirty and she heavily
led me on, but when I asked her out,

1078
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,910
she said she wasn't ready. All
right dude. This once again,

1079
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:13,990
if you listen to the last,

1080
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:18,991
so this is why you do not stay
in contact with ex girlfriends.

1081
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,070
Okay.
She just doesn't,

1082
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:27,210
she doesn't want you to meet someone else
until she's met somebody or, I don't.

1083
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:31,320
I don't. I don't know what the fuck they
think. I just know. I just know you just,

1084
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:34,710
you gotta, you gotta you gotta you
gotta walk, you gotta walk. All right.

1085
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,480
The same thing happened
a few months later.

1086
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,550
I have left her alone
for the past few months,

1087
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:42,930
only talking to her once every three
weeks and every time she ends up being mad

1088
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:47,931
at me for some dumb reason an hour ago
she was mad at me for not roasting her

1089
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:53,400
and called me pathetic roasting her.

1090
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,583
Hm.

1091
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,320
I'm trying to figure out what the fuck
you live. You've got a little fair,

1092
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:04,950
the town fair. And then you guys
also have roast. I don't really,

1093
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:07,750
this is all right.
She apologize all the time for her action,

1094
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:09,340
but continues to do the same thing.

1095
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:12,880
Should I not even talk to her or
should I forgive her because she's just

1096
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:17,830
immature and can handle our feelings?
Any advice would be appreciated.

1097
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:21,760
Especially you get the, uh, the
lovely Nia to answer as well.

1098
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,860
Hope the family's doing great and
go drink a beer. It's hilarious. Um,

1099
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:32,710
yeah, I would just have a conversation.
I would just say, listen, uh,

1100
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,190
I don't enjoy talking to you because
you always get mad at, you yell at me.

1101
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:41,220
We are broken up and I don't think it's
healthy for us to continue talking to

1102
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:44,830
one another. However, when I see
you, I don't want it to be weird.

1103
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:48,580
So is there a way that you,

1104
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,780
you want a nice way could just fuck
off and let me get on with my life.

1105
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:56,140
But if I see you, you know, we
could just walk by, you know,

1106
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:59,680
we could raise eyebrows, you know, and
acknowledging that we saw each other.

1107
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:04,000
Maybe we get a high five and
not saying anything, you know?

1108
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:07,870
And then if she flips out, it gives
a fuck. Think gives a fuck. I mean,

1109
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:09,700
it's just doesn't, you
know, it doesn't sound like,

1110
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,590
here's a question for you since you
broke up it, has it ever ended? Well,

1111
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,520
any interaction, any interaction you've
had with them? Okay. If the answer is no,

1112
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:21,980
then she got to stop
interacted with there.

1113
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:23,750
But it seems like it's such a small town.

1114
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:28,010
I'm judging you because you went
to a fair. Okay. So my world,

1115
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:29,840
you brought your prize
pig down there or not.

1116
01:08:29,841 --> 01:08:31,190
I don't know what the
fuck happened after that.

1117
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,830
All right.
Um,

1118
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:40,150
I would say, yeah, I would
just, you know, this,

1119
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:42,490
I imagine plenty of other women,

1120
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,050
you know,

1121
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,860
uh, what's the proper word at that
age? Chicks you fuck go to school with.

1122
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:49,510
Okay.

1123
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:54,190
It's really no middle world, right?
Girls, you know, girls that point,

1124
01:08:54,191 --> 01:08:57,010
you're a fucking teenager. I don't, I'm
not, I'm not going on Wikipedia again.

1125
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,360
I don't know what the fuck word is.
Okay?

1126
01:08:58,361 --> 01:09:01,180
There's plenty of the fucking chicks
you could be hanging out with.

1127
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:02,933
All right?

1128
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:05,820
That's it. And here's the
thing. Here's a tip for you.

1129
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,840
When you fucking hang out with them,
don't talk about your old relationship.

1130
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,180
Okay?

1131
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,960
What about some mother fucking woman?
They don't want they, they, well, yeah,

1132
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,673
I don't want to hear it.

1133
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:17,720
Okay.

1134
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,630
She have a beer with one of
your buddies out in the woods.

1135
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,790
How are the fuck you do it? And
just be like, yeah, you know, I,

1136
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,500
I don't encourage underage drinking.

1137
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:26,800
Whatever the fuck you did she give
you guys do, that's when you vent.

1138
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:32,750
Uh, what do you are you will, you have to
do is every time it starts to scab over,

1139
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:36,220
she calls up or you call her and
then you got an open wound again,

1140
01:09:36,221 --> 01:09:37,320
but you gotta do what you got it.

1141
01:09:37,321 --> 01:09:41,560
You got to heal like a fucking ex mat
and then the next time you see her and a

1142
01:09:41,561 --> 01:09:43,040
guarantee,
if you don't give a fuck,

1143
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:47,090
she's going to fucking be all over you
and want to hook up and this is what she

1144
01:09:47,091 --> 01:09:49,070
have to do.
You got to not do it.

1145
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,570
And then watch how quickly or that all
that flirty turns into fucking anger.

1146
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:56,930
And then she's going to yell at you and
then just be, keep it cool and be like,

1147
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:58,340
this is why I don't hang out with you

1148
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:04,700
cause y'all fucking crazy a ballet.
Do something like that.

1149
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,880
And I would also ask some more adults
who actually actually know the people

1150
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:11,180
involved in this story,
including yourself. Okay.
All right. Good luck to you.

1151
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,700
All right.
Sister is obese.

1152
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,433
All right.

1153
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:20,190
Sister is obese. Dear freckles.
Hoping you can offer some advice.

1154
01:10:20,191 --> 01:10:24,510
My sister is and has always
been on the heavy side.

1155
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,330
Oh that's sucks.
But Shit has gotten out of hand.

1156
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:31,200
If I had to guess or body
fat is easily 40 to 50%.

1157
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:34,110
I love her and I'm struggling
to get through to her.

1158
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,570
Okay.

1159
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:40,100
Uh, you seem like you'd never
hold back or sugar coat reality.

1160
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:43,490
Um,
should I do the same in this situation?

1161
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:48,170
I don't want to send the poor girl into
a whirlwind of emotions and maybe that's

1162
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:49,004
what,

1163
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:49,510
okay.

1164
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:52,840
But maybe that's what she needs. Thanks
for the help. Oh, that's a big one, dude.

1165
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,240
Okay.

1166
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:59,040
Um, I don't know how old she is. I
don't know. I don't know her. Um,

1167
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:05,450
yeah. How do you get somebody's
daddy? Tell somebody, hey,

1168
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,030
tell your sister she's fat.

1169
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:14,050
Uh, let me see. Let's me just
Improv a couple of scenarios here.

1170
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:19,620
Acs I doing, did I mention you're
overweight? That's too blunt.

1171
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:24,800
What has four limbs and needs to lose

1172
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:25,723
85?

1173
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,430
Uh, it's not good to joke about. Um,

1174
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:38,340
I don't know how you'd do it cause I
don't know how fragile she is and I

1175
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:42,210
wouldn't want her to go more in that
direction cause nobody wants to.

1176
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,063
Um,

1177
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:48,900
is there a way that you could just start
cooking a little more healthy around

1178
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:53,040
the house and your producers
or some stuff or maybe, uh,

1179
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:57,990
get her to start working out with you
and maybe just go for a walk or something

1180
01:11:57,991 --> 01:11:58,824
like that.

1181
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:00,940
MMM.

1182
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,920
Maybe just sit down.

1183
01:12:02,921 --> 01:12:06,340
He had a great talk with her and find out
what's going on with her and you don't

1184
01:12:06,341 --> 01:12:07,270
bring up our weight.

1185
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:11,950
Maybe you work on your relationship
with her and then she opens up and maybe

1186
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:16,750
there's some sort of pain that's
causing her to eat like that. I mean,

1187
01:12:16,751 --> 01:12:19,300
that's like a psychological
thing sometimes. Uh,

1188
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,650
from what I've heard on shows that I've
seen where people actually know what

1189
01:12:23,651 --> 01:12:26,980
they're talking about. So
maybe you need to get like, uh,

1190
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:29,650
I don't know what your relationship is,

1191
01:12:29,651 --> 01:12:32,260
but maybe if she feels
comfortable opening up to you.

1192
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,183
MMM.

1193
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,750
Just ask her what's going on with her,
how's she doing, how's she feeling?

1194
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,850
Blahblahblahblahblah and if she, you
know, there's something going on with her.

1195
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:49,100
Maybe she lets that out and then baby,
she brings it up and I hate how I look.

1196
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,820
And then you can be like, well, let's do
something about it. You know, maybe try.

1197
01:12:51,821 --> 01:12:54,560
I try that way, but I don't think
I would bring up that she's fat.

1198
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,050
I wouldn't do that as much
as I made those jokes.

1199
01:12:57,051 --> 01:12:59,810
But this podcast is supposed to be
funny and it's supposed to be fucking

1200
01:12:59,811 --> 01:13:04,130
ridiculous. So I had, I had to do a cup.
All right, what do you want from me?

1201
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:08,090
I'm bald with a big head and I'm on the
other side of the fucking golf course.

1202
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:12,730
[inaudible] it's, it's, it's where I'm
at. All right? That's a podcast people,

you don't really fucking need.

1208
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,720
It's not going to cost you any money.

1209
01:13:28,721 --> 01:13:32,320
And I'll get a little bit of credit for
driving traffic their way and they'll be

1210
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:37,300
like, ah, bill is a couple of bucks.
That's it. All right everybody,

1211
01:13:37,301 --> 01:13:40,180
I'm going to go drink my face
off cause I'm not an alcoholic.

1212
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,410
I'm not going to go do a set.

1213
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:46,390
I'm going to go do a set cause I'm

including going up to San Francisco
to hang out with them doing a shelf.

1218
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,320
All right, that's it.
