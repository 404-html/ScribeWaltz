1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,890
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burns
time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:09,810
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast. And I am just checking in on you.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,350
That's it is, you might notice my
voice is a couple octaves lower. Uh,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,370
I've been doing shows all this week,
um, and I was sick like a month ago,

5
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:24,580
so I don't know that it's
fucking recovered, but uh,
I don't have my usual, uh,

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,720
you know, mid range voice,
but this, I promise you

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,100
this is me anyways. Um,

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,270
I'm up here in San Francisco with the
North's theater with a Nate Kraig.

9
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:41,620
We've been having a great time all
week. Um, last night, you know,

10
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,050
it's one of those nights,
just had a great show.

11
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:47,440
It was like I didn't want to fucking go
home, so we ended up going over to a,

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,060
was just walking around and
ended up just at the Fillmore.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,530
So we walk over, it goes, go fucking go
over there, have a drink or something.

14
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:58,870
Right, because Billy's off
the wagon again. Right.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,820
I guess when I get home I'll get back
on the fucking wagon. I'm the worst.

16
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,790
I'm either on or I'm off and I'm off.
Yabber anyway,

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,400
sorry. Um, by the way,

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,990
if you want o see arguably some of
the funniest shit on the Internet.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,581
Nay.

20
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:21,900
Craig told me about Kyle done against a
Instagram page and I guess Joe Rogan and

21
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,950
Tom Segora. Those guys
have all hyped it. I don't,

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,270
I've been completely out of the loop.

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,640
That guy's one of the
funniest fucking comedians.

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,680
I've always been a huge
fan of his stuff and um,

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,170
and I thought it was so fucking
original, but I, his Instagram page,

26
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,690
I can't even describe how,

27
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,140
how fucking hilarious I was like every
morning for like the last three days I've

28
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,360
been watching all of his
videos for like an hour,

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,610
just laying in bed crying, laughing. Um,

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,740
his Instagram is at Kyle done
again. K, y. L. E d, u. N, n.

31
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,040
I. G. A. N. A hope I spelled that
right. And the num number one,

32
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,860
and he does like that face swap thing
and he does this fucking ridiculous

33
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,030
impression of everybody.
Bill Maher,

34
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,180
Donald Trump, uh, Caitlin Jenner,

35
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,040
all the Kardashians.
Um,

36
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,750
just everything that he does,
his fuck is bill Maher's ridiculous.

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,960
And then he got like all these
different Trump's, he's got tiny Trump,

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,240
trans Trump, just Trump in general. Um,

39
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,610
it's fucking unbelievable. Um,
so check that out. So anyways,

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,080
um, we ended up walking over to the, uh,

41
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,830
we ended up over at the Fillmore.
Should we go to walk in, you know,

42
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,950
and there's a band playing. So of
course the secure, is that right?

43
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,140
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

44
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,560
We're like, yeah, hey, we're just going
in there to get a drink. And the guy goes,

45
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,760
you can't, there's a show going on.
This is a concert venue. You know,

46
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,880
I taped a specialty. I was kind of
funny. I said, yeah, I know. I go,

47
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,960
I've performed here. He goes, Oh, you've
performed here. I've never done this.

48
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:11,440
I just said, yeah, I'm a comedian. I
just want to go on and have a drink.

49
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,970
And then fortunately, he recognized me
and I was able to pull that fucking card.

50
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:17,590
I never pull a car.
It was pretty cool.

51
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,210
So then I went upstairs and I just
hear this fucking woman's voice.

52
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,530
He's just incredible playing the guitar.
Incredible.

53
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,000
And I poked my head in to see,
and you know,

54
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:35,330
there's this big tour bus to this shit,
but there wasn't a band on stage.

55
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,111
It was just,
you know,

56
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:40,310
you know when the one person is up there
and they're playing to a loop and then

57
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:43,130
they loop it with something else, the
Pr, you know, she was doing that shit.

58
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,350
I was like, ah man, I miss seeing bands.

59
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,180
I get it all the fucking crowd stole
the music and the fucking labels do the

60
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,000
cross the board
fucking deals with or even take a PC,

61
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,390
a emerge, you know, the greedy cunts.
So I get it. So it was just like, yeah.

62
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:02,390
So it was kind of bummed out even
though her voice was fucking incredible.

63
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,621
It's just like,

64
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:07,280
I like watching a live band cause I like
when I want to bands like improvising

65
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,114
and shit.

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,430
I always love watching like Stevie Ray
Vaughan cause she'd see Tommy and uh,

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,760
Chris Layton, well never stopped looking
at them cause they're like, all right,

68
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:17,331
what's he doing?

69
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:20,060
Is he going to go around again or is
he going to fucking go into the verse?

70
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:20,671
You know, when, you know,

71
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:24,280
when it start to come to the point
where he would come out of the Solos,

72
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,120
are you going to keep solo
and what is he going to do?

73
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:28,610
And when you just see that and then
you see Stevie just give them like this

74
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:32,120
fucking little nod as he's
wailing on the guitar.

75
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:36,620
And then they just seamlessly
in that moment know that,

76
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:41,300
that go into this next session.
That's what I fucking love. Um,

77
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:46,130
so it's just one person updates, you
know, but you're here in a band. I get,

78
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:49,370
you know, I'm a fucking old guy, Amar.
Where's the rest of the people? Right.

79
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,900
So I walked into the other Roman, I
was sitting there with Nate, you know,

80
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,270
and I'm just listening to this woman
singing and I'm like, oh my God,

81
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:57,110
she's fucking unreal.

82
00:04:57,111 --> 00:05:01,600
I'm here a little Amy Winehouse
suggest she's incredible and uh,

83
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,150
had a drink or something. And then
I go, man, that's, I swear to God,

84
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,260
that sounds like a band.

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,940
And then I walked back out there and now
there's a whole band on stage and I'm

86
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:12,680
like,
where the fuck did that woman go?

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,620
Was she opening like what the fuck
was going on? Long Story Short,

88
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,650
I find out it wasn't a woman who was a
guy and his name is Alan Stone and that

89
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,670
was one of the fucking best
voices I've ever heard in my life.

90
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:31,650
Incredible Guitar player. When
you see the name of the band, um,

91
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,270
it was funny, we went
in there, it was like a,

92
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,330
like all these hardcore fans of this band
is called Andrew Andrew McMahon in the

93
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,164
wilderness.

94
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,330
Now granted this isn't like my necessarily
my style of music that I would listen

95
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:50,350
to, but like how well
these people sang was just,

96
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,820
it was fucking incredible.

97
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,930
The Piano player was cracking me up
because he was dressed like Kenny Loggins

98
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:59,300
and like the early eighties,
and like if you looked at the guy,

99
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:02,120
like that guy is going to
have a major cocaine problem.

100
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,060
He had like the Kenny Loggins beard and
then he had the sweater tied around his

101
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:10,420
neck.
Um,

102
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,820
like when I came up in the 80s,

103
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:18,350
anytime they were going to have like an
asshole in a fucking coming of age movie

104
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:20,950
in the 80s, they always had the
sweater tied around him, you know,

105
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:22,850
if the fucking frat boy or whatever.
But anyways,

106
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:27,590
but it was a completely different vibe
and afterwards,

107
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,220
all these nerdy Chicsville going
out and talking and look at my face.

108
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:34,280
Can you tell I was crying. They
were crying. There was definitely,

109
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,570
I don't know what was going on,

110
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,000
but it was definitely sort of
the crowd was those, you know,

111
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,360
the kids who can't throw a ball,
you know,

112
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,400
and aren't good at fighting. It
was that group of people. Um,

113
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,920
and they were fucking ended this band
and this band was fucking amazing.

114
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,240
Fucking amazing.

115
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,800
But what was hilarious was the bartenders
were all bored as shit because none of

116
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,634
them were drinking.

117
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,340
The Fillmore has this really long bar
that goes all the way down the left side.

118
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:14,351
And these fucking bartenders would
just leaning with their backs against,

119
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,520
you know,
where the cash registers.

120
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,500
That shit where with this looks
on their faces. It's like,

121
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,480
how the fuck did I get this shift?

122
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,230
I'm not going to make any fucking
money tonight. But anyways, um,

123
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,580
if he get a chance to see them live or
ever get a chance to see that Alan Stone,

124
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:35,240
I just was looking him up and he was
singing with the Daryl Hall and stuff.

125
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,110
Evidently the guys is like fucking
legendary. And I'm going like,

126
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,570
who's this chick? Why?
Where's the rest of the band?

127
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:44,180
And I just walk in the other room.
So fucking stupid.

128
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,760
But I'm glad that I was able to,
uh,

129
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,570
cause I was talking with people afterwards
when they will leave and I go, well,

130
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:54,830
where was that woman? And they will
laugh and go, and that wasn't a woman.

131
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:59,420
That was a guy. I go, that
was a guy, Dave Allen's down.

132
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,940
God. Um, anyways, uh,

133
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,100
so I went up when I saw that there
was a whole bad, like I've, you know,

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,580
I've only been to the Fillmore
a couple times and um,

135
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,280
when you're upstairs you got,
you know,

136
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:17,240
unless you have like the two old guys in
the muppet show seats in those things,

137
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:18,620
it's very hard to see the band.

138
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,030
But then there's this one area
where it's straight on, so upstairs,

139
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:26,570
so I walk and there was this
woman's security sitting down. I go,

140
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:31,280
is it okay to walk over there? And
she goes, did that section is private.

141
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,440
And I wanted to be like,
I only asked you once,

142
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,480
you fucking cunt. I don't know if
she was yelling over the music,

143
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:42,291
but it was just like,

144
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,830
what the f I felt like it was on like
a seven year relationship with her and

145
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:49,610
whatever the fuck it is that I,
I do that bugs or I just did it.

146
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,360
That section has private,
uh,

147
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,040
you know what I thought about,
you know,

148
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,130
who's that guy used to climb
in to the ring? Like a spider.

149
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,230
The Guy who kicked the guy in, broke
his leg in half. Um, Anderson Silva.

150
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,900
I remember that front kick he would
do and you just didn't see it coming,

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,460
you know, that went into my head
when she leaned forward. Private.

152
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:18,130
Just give the old right there Fred.
You know,

153
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,980
and I would do that as an empowering
move to a woman, you know,

154
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,830
treating her as an equal like, well
that's what you would do to a guy. Right.

155
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,470
How come women don't want that part
of equal rights? It's all right.

156
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,920
You want to make what we
make then uh, you, you know,

157
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,690
you gotta take a Mitt to the
face every once in a while.

158
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,200
By the way, I've been such an
asshole on stage this week.

159
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:49,640
I've been having such a good time. I
said someone was ridiculous shit. Um,

160
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,590
I dunno that I've said, I don't
think ever, I've just been like,

161
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,970
it's a total reaction to like, what
the f all this fucking crap out there.

162
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,080
You know, I did this interview
recently and I was talking to this guy,

163
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,690
I'll probably get in
trouble for the show camera.

164
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,380
What the fuck are you talking
about? But the guy goes, yeah,

165
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:10,250
but you can't say they can't see. It's
like, what's food? Fuck yes I can.

166
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,850
You can't say why. Why did people all
of a sudden won't know their jokes?

167
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:20,120
And then then there'll be,
yeah, what's going on? What
the fuck is going to happen?

168
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,330
Um,
so anyways,

169
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,540
I been up here all this week and um,

170
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,700
I got this thing in my writer, but if
I spend more than one night someplace,

171
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,240
they'll bring in some old drum kit or
whatever and I just play on it during the

172
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:40,200
day. So, uh, I'm up here and I dunno, the,

173
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,810
one of the guys who,
uh,

174
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,310
works at the theater is a drummer and
they get me this sick fucking Dwu kit.

175
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,260
That sounds amazing.

176
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:52,850
I brought my double pedal up and I brought
my fucking that while that music that

177
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:57,260
I wrote out on that a Metallica song just
been having like the best fucking time

178
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,930
ever, although I'm missing my
wife and my kid big time. But, um,

179
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,500
this really is a, an amazing city. And I
had a friend of mine come out last night,

180
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,400
uh, who I hadn't seen in awhile and
I kind of learned some shit though.

181
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,630
I was glad that we hung out there rather
than over at the punchline because I

182
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:18,880
really like how my brain works as far as
when I get depressed is when I tried to

183
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:21,470
go into the past.
You know,

184
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,670
like if you go into a place that
you haven't been in a long time,

185
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:29,060
like you're all excited and then you
walk in there and like, nobody that,

186
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,800
you know, you don't know anybody
anymore and you're like that, ah, fuck,

187
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,480
I'm old. The time came and it
went, why did I enjoy it more?

188
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,640
Ooh, you know, so I was glad
I met her over there. But uh,

189
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,990
you know,
she just was one of the people,

190
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:51,350
I don't know if this should have been
a person like her and every comedy town

191
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:55,510
because she fucking her tastes and
comedians and how much she gave,

192
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,540
there's still gives a shit about comedy.
He was,

193
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,020
I think one of the major reasons why the
standup scene here has always been so

194
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,440
frigging strong. So anyways, let's, uh,

195
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,780
let's plow ahead. I went to the
giants game yesterday. The, uh,

196
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:13,330
the baseball giants,
uh,

197
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,740
they had a day game fucking started
at like one o'clock and I'm,

198
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,920
Nate was giving me all this shit
because I was keeping score.

199
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:24,640
When I go to baseball games, I like
to keep score because if, if I don't,

200
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:29,410
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
You know, there's literally 18 people,

201
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,470
you know, you don't know who's
given up hits in the eye.

202
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,930
You literally make a pitching
change and you don't even hear it.

203
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:38,600
Cause there's so much fucking
shit going on, you know?

204
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:42,910
And at the giants they have this woman
doing the fucking announcements and like

205
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:47,350
they have voice just, it just doesn't
carry, like, I don't know what it is.

206
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:52,300
Like you need the base to cut through.
She's [inaudible].

207
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,730
Yeah. I'm like, what the fuck did she say?

208
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,550
Then I'd have to look at the number and
then I got to look it up on my phone.

209
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,870
It's like you just announced it over a PA
system. How the fuck did I not hear it?

210
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,060
Um, I played drums. Maybe my
ears are fucked up. I don't
know. I don't know what.

211
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:07,894
But um,

212
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,220
I got a $12 cores at that
fucking ballpark and a boy.

213
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,210
What's funny is when
you get the scorecard,

214
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,780
the scorecard is a dollar and then
they make you pay for the pencil.

215
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:23,170
Now the pencils, a buck, it's like
the cheapest thing in the park.

216
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,350
And got a bag of peanuts and had an ice
cold beer. I sat there keeping scores,

217
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,150
fucking gray. Only thing I was missing
was a cigar would have been perfect.

218
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,070
And I'm this fucking Guy Suarez.

219
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,780
Got Sheldon the first dating
and then he settled down.

220
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,480
But the giants were never able to catch
up. It was, you know, it's a good game.

221
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,980
It's definitely good game. Beautiful
Ballpark. The reds got some guy on their,

222
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,530
on their, uh, their team,

223
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:52,060
little fella and he goes by scooter.
So like I'd be like, you know,

224
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:55,390
at some point you got to call me by my
name, but he still goes by scooter. Right.

225
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:57,520
So we're sitting there going like,
Nate's going,

226
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,930
how tall do you think that guy is?
I'm like,

227
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,000
that guy might be a couple
inches shorter than me.

228
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,320
And then he steps up to the plate and
just fucking crushes one crushes one all

229
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:14,130
the way out to the fucking, I call it
the ocean. Mccovey is bay cove. Sorry,

230
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,840
cubbies cove, whatever the fuck it is. Um,

231
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,470
I think that's why he
still goes by scooter,

232
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:25,360
cause that's got to really fuck with
the other PR, the pictures, you know,

233
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:25,961
confidence.

234
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,690
I mean you just step up to the plate
and name's Mike and he'd go yard.

235
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:32,950
He's not going to give a fuck with some
guy named scooter hits the ball into the

236
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:36,490
fuck. You know your best pitch into the
fucking ocean. That's good. You know,

237
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:41,020
you gotta be, you gotta take a
lap around the mouth going like,

238
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:41,950
is this the end of my career?

239
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,160
Some fucking make a wish kid just came
up and just fucking crushed into the

240
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:48,220
ocean. Um, anyways,

241
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,410
how about those Boston Celtics.

242
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,170
Okay.

243
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,600
Once again, I'm working every
fucking night. This week,

244
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,270
I've missed every second of
the last series in this series.

245
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:01,890
I just keep watching the
highlights and um, and defense,

246
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:05,880
the Cavaliers, uhh, I guess they have
the worst team defense in the league.

247
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,260
Um, but you know, Brad Stevens I guess
is out coaching them and all that stuff.

248
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:12,030
But, uh, I gotta be honest with Ya,

249
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,660
I really won't feel comfortable that
we're going to beat the cavs until we win

250
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:22,170
the fourth game.
Cause if the Cavs went tonight,

251
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,610
I'm assuming the plane tonight,

252
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,480
then all of a sudden it's two one and
he just gets scary again. Like, Oh fuck,

253
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,970
here comes to Lebron.
Hit comes Lebron. I mean,

254
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,640
you're talking about a guy who
has led his teams to the finals,

255
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,910
how many years in a row? And I don't give
a fuck that he was on a pile on team.

256
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,570
Coby was on a pile on team his entire
fucking career and he didn't go to the

257
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:43,310
finals fucking, you know, seven
years in a row, whatever the hell,

258
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,280
okay,

259
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,110
Lebron is working on right now.
So, uh, we shall see this is all,

260
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,190
you know,
it's all gravy,

261
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:55,350
but they just keep winning
in the fucking rocket speed.

262
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:59,790
The goddamn warriors last night,
I guess, which is incredible.

263
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,560
Um, you just can't root for the warriors.
Once Duran went to the warriors,

264
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,980
you just can't fucking real. It's the
stupidest, it's so fucking stupid.

265
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,810
It makes the Miami Heat not
look like a pile on team again.

266
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,060
Maybe he was a pilot thing, but I'm
just saying, you know what I mean?

267
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,510
Was the NBA was self,
I know I've said this a thousand night,

268
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:24,511
but the NBA was so fucking great that
warriors thunder series with thunder went

269
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:29,690
up three games to one and then they
fucked it up because they were too young.

270
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,740
They didn't know how to win.

271
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,100
And the warriors showed the
championship heart that they had.

272
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,500
And then that was the story the next year.

273
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:37,850
Okay.

274
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,370
Was where the thunder going
to fucking get over the hump,

275
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:43,590
where they going to dig down deep and,
and,

276
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,670
and slay the fucking dragon.
And what happens?

277
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,780
Okay,

278
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,990
Luke Skywalker goes, you
know what? You are my father.

279
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,490
I'll fucking join the dark side in fucking
Kevin Durant just goes over there and

280
00:16:56,491 --> 00:17:00,600
the second he went over there,
everybody who watches Nba hoop goes, oh,

281
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,150
the warriors are going to win the
championship. And then they did.

282
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,370
It was fucking boring as shit.

283
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:06,900
Yeah.

284
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,180
Um,
the only thing I like about it

285
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,720
okay,

286
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,520
is that Darren didn't go to the
Lakers and I have to watch them,

287
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,840
you know, once again, free agent their
way to yet another fucking championship,

288
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:23,320
which admittedly is a Celtics fan.
We did in 2008 but the fucking,

289
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,823
you know,

290
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,220
I've watched the Lakers get
five championships in the
last like 20 years doing

291
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:34,780
shit like that and it's just,
you know, gets fucking tired
after a while, you know.

292
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,200
Um, especially because, you
know, according to them,

293
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:40,150
their one championship
behind us, which, you know,

294
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:43,210
we all know through Bill
Simmons Book Than Not that too.

295
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,170
And we also know there was a mobbed up
fucking ref that fixed that Sacramento

296
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:50,540
serious, so they get fucking
two banners, you know. But, uh,

297
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,260
what I do like about it is that's
very la to pad your resume, you know,

298
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,510
to make Instagram videos and then
call yourself a director. Um, anyways,

299
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,080
so I am a,
I dunno,

300
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,050
we'll see what happens. I wish I could
just watch one of these fucking games.

301
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:13,380
If we get by the Cavaliers
and the warriors, you know,

302
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,060
of course they're going to
go to the fucking finals.

303
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,550
How are they not going to
win a championship when
you have like every fucking

304
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:21,120
good guy in the league is
on your God damn team. Um,

305
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,680
I mean,
I dunno,

306
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,120
the Celtics actually could win one or
two games against the fucking warriors.

307
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:31,490
I mean, I'm not looking ahead here.
I mean, that'd be what I'm real.

308
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:34,880
And then we got Kyrie Irving
free agent guy right there, Bill.

309
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,010
You fucking hypocrite. Um,
yeah, but we're upstart too.

310
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:43,520
Those are all fucking, I'll
fucking, everybody adds one
free fucking agent, right?

311
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,310
That's all I'm saying. It was just, it
was just bad. I just don't understand why,

312
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:47,510
you know,
I fucking hate the legs,

313
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,570
but I don't understand why that one
guy couldn't go to the fucking Lakers,

314
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:55,380
but Kevin Durant could go to
the fucking gold state wage.

315
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:58,040
Did you killed all?
He killed the whole fucking story.

316
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,150
Yeah.

317
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,380
It'd be like if when the Celtics beat
the Lakers and 84th magic said fuck it,

318
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:05,820
they just joined the Celtics.

319
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,360
I Dunno, whatever. I'm an old guy.
The Celtic signed free agents too.

320
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:18,470
But let me, I would, I would think
if we went to make a move like that,

321
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,700
um, someone was actually
saying that, you know,

322
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,290
Duran or somebody is up for free
agency and he might go to the Celtics.

323
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,210
And I was thinking,
I don't fucking want that guy.

324
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,620
I don't know to become
part of the problem.

325
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,953
Yeah.

326
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,690
He's just going to bounce
around the league. No

327
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,310
picking up rings. I, you know, and this
is from a guy who barely watches the NBA.

328
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,440
Why am I the subset?
I'll tell you why.

329
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm the subset now that he asked
the question for, for you guys.

330
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,210
Now I'm going to answer it. I just
remember when I was at, when you were,

331
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,840
when you were a fucking kid and you had
outdoor recess and you would choose an

332
00:19:55,841 --> 00:20:00,130
up teams, even as little kids, if it
got too lopsided, you'd be like, oh,

333
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,650
wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait, wait. Even it out.

334
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:06,340
Because even then you knew like, where
would the satisfaction be in winning?

335
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,320
Kids know, kids know not to do what
the fuck they're doing. But I mean,

336
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:16,120
that is the way it's done now.
I mean, free agency, again,

337
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,050
I should just accept the fact,
okay, here's, okay, here's the deal.

338
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,010
I accept the fact that there's free age.
It's okay. And I admit that the Celtics,

339
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:28,060
you know, we bought a
championship in 2008. Okay,

340
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,220
okay.

341
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,090
And uh, you know, and we also had a Kyrie
Irving this year, but you know, maybe,

342
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:37,170
you know, fuming Lebron could get
along a little better. I mean, I don't,

343
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:41,890
I don't fucking know, but there has
to, should that should be aligned.

344
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,830
You know, that that Miami, he
thinks shouldn't have fucking
happen. The, the, the uh,

345
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,090
what's his face trade.

346
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,480
Okay.

347
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Kevin Garnett with Kevin Mchale and the
front office gives us old team Kevin

348
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,250
Garnett for nothing that
should have been blocked,

349
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,790
would pog is saw with Jerry West
and the front office went to Lakers.

350
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,520
That should have been blocked. Just shit
like that. That's all I'm saying. Sick.

351
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,300
So I took a little burden on there,
you know, maybe, I don't know. Fuck it.

352
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,570
Who gives a fuck?
Um,

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,360
okay.

354
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,060
So anyways, uh, what do I got here?

355
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:20,010
I got two more God damn show.
You have no rights.

356
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,600
I have no reeds here on Thursday.
Uh,

357
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,120
and I'm trying desperately not to do my
impression of countdown against Donald

358
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,500
Trump or fucking bill Maher to his bill
Maher is so fucking ridiculously on.

359
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,920
Have you ever seen the
one he does? Um, where he,

360
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,190
she has like Bill Maher
reading to children.

361
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,510
He's stringing reading like nursery
rhymes. He's like, hey dude, it'll do,

362
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:50,440
it'll do cat and the fiddle. Okay.
The cow jumped over the moon.

363
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,780
Really over the moon.
This story is bullshit.

364
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,800
He just like makes the kids cry.

365
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,850
I know I'm doing a shit version of you
got it here the guy stop listening my

366
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:05,050
podcast and go, here's some real
comedy at, at Kyle done to get one.

367
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,450
The guy's a fucking genius.

368
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,050
I don't get how that guy is not on
Saturday night life. I just don't.

369
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,230
Okay.

370
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,860
You know, I, I bet you know why. Cause
they wouldn't do the Caitlyn Jenner Shit.

371
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,090
I Dunno what happened. They, they're
all fucking political over there now.

372
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,750
That used to be rebellious,
you know,

373
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,370
you've got to see is Caitlyn
Jenner. Shit baby Trump. All right,

374
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:31,320
I'm done hyping it. I don't want to
fucking overhype it. I can't over hype,

375
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:35,220
but it's fucking hilarious.
Alright, plowing ahead here. Um,

376
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,630
so I got what's tonight?
Thursday,

377
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:43,000
I've got two more shows up here
and then that's the end. Um,

378
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,820
I'm going to be just doing a bunch
of sets around La, get ready for 'em

379
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,240
my, my big shows there in, uh,

380
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,370
in Europe and then my big birthday
turning 50 next fucking month.

381
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,710
You know, I don't feel any different.
My shoulders fucking great.

382
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,360
Here's the deal. Every year on
my birthday I got to do like uh,

383
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,420
the amount of pushups for whatever year
I am and I haven't done them the last

384
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,410
couple of years cause my
shoulders but fucked up.

385
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,190
So I think the last time I did was I
turned 47 so I'm up to doing sets of 35 so

386
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:27,351
I'm right on right on pace here and
maybe then turning 50 won't be as

387
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:30,450
devastating.
But I did 50 shops.

388
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,790
Does that make me a mortal?
Um,

389
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,200
anyways,
you know what I think we'll have,

390
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,050
this podcast is going
to be a little short.

391
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,170
I mean I don't think I have
anything else to talk about man.

392
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,790
How the fuck am I going to fill up
these I feel, I don't even know why.

393
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,390
I mean self employed.
Why do, why do I feel,

394
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,900
what am I going to fire myself if
I know through a full half hour?

395
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,810
Is that what it's going to be at?

396
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:55,040
You know the red sox are
actually playing the Oakland A's.

397
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,740
I was thinking of going over
there like an asshole. You know,

398
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:02,540
what I did here in the San Francisco
was joking. I did the impossible.

399
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:07,430
I actually got a fucking sunburn in
San Francisco like the sun was out,

400
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:12,100
but I was just like, it's San Francisco.
It's always cold and shitty here. Um,

401
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,260
they just have miserable fucking
weather. Um, that, you know,

402
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:21,350
they have the great white shark fucking
weather, right? The water's freezing.

403
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,090
No one ever made it off the
rock man. Right. It's just
always like that. In fact,

404
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:30,470
I used to always come here and every
time I would come here I'd get sick. Um,

405
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,540
I dunno why it was like
the flight from new,

406
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,290
I was living in New York and every time
I'd come out to do the punchline I would

407
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,770
get sick because a I way I
wasn't taking care of myself.

408
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,450
Then I had that extra long flight and
then I would step off into this just cold,

409
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,770
damp, fucking awful weather. And like
three times in a row when I came here,

410
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,490
I got sick. And, um,
Molly at the punchline.

411
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,730
I remember the last time I came out there,
she sent me like fucking

412
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,530
sent me all these vitamins,
c packages,

413
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,260
just fucking drinking a zillion
of them before he got out there.

414
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:06,860
So I would get sick. I started to
think I was allergic to this down.

415
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,650
So when I looked,
you know,

416
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,620
I looked up the fucking weather coming up
here as I was waiting for it to pop up.

417
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:14,180
I just said cold and shitty.

418
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:18,560
And I looked at it and it was every day
there was clouds with a little bit of

419
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,380
Sun and then rain and I don't know
what happened. Something changed.

420
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,280
So yesterday we, uh, we walked
over to the ballpark and I'm,

421
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,020
I'm like, God, this is going to
burn off. This is going to burn off.

422
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,320
I bought a couple of
really good seats and uh,

423
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,640
I was just sitting in the sun the whole
fucking time wearing a north face jacket,

424
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:40,010
sweating my ass off. But I was like, oh,

425
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:43,070
I can't take this off cause
I got on shorts sleeves
underneath that I'm going to

426
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:44,060
fucking burn up.

427
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:49,420
So I sat there and a winter coat in
like 75 degree weather keeping score.

428
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,800
I looked like a fucking,
you know,

429
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:56,390
the only thing I was missing was those
giant headphones with like the am radio

430
00:25:56,391 --> 00:26:00,650
antenna sticking out of it. Um, those
are the fucking lunatics though.

431
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,550
Like I wasn't that bad of a nerd.
You know,

432
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,570
those guys who actually listened to the
ball game while they're watching it and

433
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:12,860
they're keeping score. Um, but I'll tell
you, they know everything that's going on.

434
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,170
They know when they
make a pitching change,

435
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,830
when there's a pinch hitter and all of
that shit, like trying to keep score,

436
00:26:18,831 --> 00:26:20,180
like when you're out in the outfield.

437
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,960
The only way I was able to do
it cause I was, uh, and um,

438
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,710
right behind home plate.
So when somebody came up on on deck,

439
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,840
I would just check the number to make
sure they didn't switch somebody out. Um,

440
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,110
and that's my exciting
story about keeping score.

441
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,860
All right, I'm finished. I'm
starving. I'm going to go.

442
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:41,780
I've been eating good even
though I've been drinking again,

443
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:43,890
which I don't fucking like,
but it just get,

444
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:45,570
I get fucking bored when I'm out here.

445
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,640
What am I going to do
you want to fuck me up?

446
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,280
Was I brought my resent a stone up here.

447
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,940
I brought the little external fucking
dis thing that you stick it in.

448
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,850
I plug it in and I left
the fucking disc at home.

449
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,850
So now what am I supposed to do? Am I
supposed to get some folk a coloring book?

450
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:09,790
My shows are at seven every night.
I'm done by nine. I'm all wound up.

451
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,920
You know, I've seen more goddamn
couples arguing and public up here.

452
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,640
The city is more expensive I guess than
even New York City for rent or to buy

453
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:27,990
something and you can really
see the stress on the people
just screaming at each

454
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:30,900
other.
So that three times yesterday.

455
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,410
Okay.

456
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,930
And I'll tell you the
woman was winning all three

457
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,040
and each one of the relationships, I was
like, she's a lot smarter than that guy.

458
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,440
Why is she with this person?

459
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,600
Because like the guy was like
trying to come back. You know

460
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,600
the rocky Balboa.

461
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,370
What about you? Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

462
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,800
And the woman would just rattling off
all the things that this guy was fucking

463
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:00,190
up a credit. I was just
walking by, you know,

464
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,560
I experienced a relationship for five
seconds and my immediate thought other

465
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:09,250
than these two people need the
break up was uh, you know, I, she,

466
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:12,100
she's got you there buddy.
She's making a lot of good points.

467
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,973
Yeah.

468
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,420
And I have been joking
about this onstage to,

469
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,500
San Francisco has the most homeless
homeless people I've ever seen in my life.

470
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,270
Yeah.

471
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:33,160
It's almost like they're not real. They're
so fucking homeless. There's skid row.

472
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,560
It's just fucking,
it's unbelievable.

473
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,660
We walked by this woman,

474
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,980
she was literally passed out in her
hand was on the ground and there was an

475
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:45,380
empty bottle of booze that like,

476
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,760
so artistically had just rolled like,

477
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,470
like two and a half
inches away from her hand.

478
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,630
Yeah.

479
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,130
It looked like you were
on you. Yeah. Like you,

480
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:57,860
one of the set of a movie about
homeless people like that,

481
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,020
that's just such a perfect shot.

482
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,090
You know about alcoholism and
addiction and all of that type of shit.

483
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,680
But it's like real. Yeah. We will
like walking off from the park,

484
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,530
trying to avoid the hills,
you know, as much as we could.

485
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:16,220
And we just got into this.
It was like, you know,

486
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,980
everybody's got their skid row.
They have a neighborhood,

487
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,680
just a fucking name.
You just walking through,

488
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,870
you know,
I saw this fucking guy,

489
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:30,020
he's in a wheelchair when these guys
in a wheelchair, but his legs work,

490
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,310
whatever the fuck that
deal is, you know? And uh,

491
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,320
he just had like his shirt pulled
up over his face and then his hands,

492
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,010
like covering his face, like he was
the saddest person on the planet.

493
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,653
You know,

494
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,990
I was walking around with the Fillmore
and this is blind guy, just asking people,

495
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,940
somebody can help them cross the street.

496
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,430
Yeah.

497
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,470
So I was like, all right,
I'm going that way, you know?

498
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,890
And then he grabs my arm and
then I immediately put my
hand on my wallet because

499
00:30:01,891 --> 00:30:03,930
it's like, all right, I know
I'm a gullible white guy,

500
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:06,300
but I'm not that fucking dumb.
All right.

501
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,210
So I go to step off the curb and he
goes, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

502
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:11,250
And I was like, Oh yeah, you're
right. It's fucking green.

503
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:14,250
And then I'm looking at him like,
I start laughing like,

504
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:16,230
how the fuck did you know
that that light was great?

505
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,110
Okay.

506
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,070
And he started laughing.
I forget what the fuck.

507
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:23,640
I guess it makes a noise or some shit like
that, but I almost walked a blind guy.

508
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,490
He goes,
you got to watch out for the buses

509
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,180
that was walked a blind guy, right
it right into the fucking bus. Um,

510
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,340
so I'm a fucking liberal SAP,
you know, this woman says to me,

511
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:42,550
can you give me blah, blah, blah?
And she look all sad and some subway,

512
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,330
she fucking asked me. I was like, ah,
give us some money. And I said, Nate,

513
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:49,880
you think she's drinking?
And he goes, yeah. And I was,

514
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,160
I was like, all right, forget it.
I won't fucking, and he goes, look,

515
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:57,120
if you want to go buy her a sandwich,
I'll fucking do that. And I was like,

516
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:00,810
all right, all right. You know? Well,
maybe she needs some fucking boots.

517
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,550
I got a phone call. Oh, look who it is.

518
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,470
Look cool. What is an old friend
of the podcast? Joe To Rosa. Joe,

519
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:11,940
I got you on speaker

520
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,230
recording right now.

521
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,440
I'm recording. Wrapping up, Joe. Joe,
remember we used to do on informed,

522
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,850
remember we used to wrap.

523
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,783
Well that's good.

524
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,960
When are we ever going to do
another episode of anything?

525
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,190
Uh, no. I gotta tell Ya.

526
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,660
Fans across the country have
asked the same question and

527
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,870
was that plural or was it just, was that
one fan or did you actually save fans?

528
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,250
There was a fan,

529
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,550
at least one guy in every
city asked the same question

530
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,180
after, after I opened. People ask
me all the time, nope, no bullshit.

531
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,180
And after I opened for you and uh,
what was the ladder,

532
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,860
but the chip load people came up to me
after the show outside and we're like,

533
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:05,810
what are you doing on it for us? I
was like, dude, I want to, I, I just,

534
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:07,160
uh, it's hard, you know,

535
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,960
you know, it's fucking hilarious
about all of this shit. Joe,

536
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:14,020
if I jumped in my car,
how quickly would I get to your apartment

537
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,240
with no traffic?

538
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,670
W with no traffic.

539
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,600
I got a whole set up over here.
Let's just do one

540
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,950
Joe.
I gotta be honest with you.

541
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:32,930
I have the weirdest relationship with
you out of all of my friends because we

542
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:34,430
never had a falling out.

543
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,060
But how little we see each other
and how close we live together.

544
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:42,810
It's like we had a out, I don't know
what happened, what happened to us, Joe.

545
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,450
So we travel outside of what happened.
Nothing happened.

546
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,390
We transcended into family territory.

547
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,720
I consider you family at this
point and you know, you've seen,

548
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,000
you don't see your family that much.

549
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:58,930
Yeah,

550
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,550
I mean, honestly, dude, I
look at you as her family. I'm
like, yeah, you know, we're,

551
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:03,550
we're good.
We're good.

552
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,600
Family Bag D. Um, all right,

553
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:09,030
well I think there's a
reason why you called.

554
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:12,060
So I guess week we got to do something.
We got it.

555
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:15,000
We got to at least I got to have
you on the podcast is a guest.

556
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:16,680
Is there anything you'd
want to promote Joe?

557
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,610
Uh, Bill, I have a podcast on my
own and I will see you with hell.

558
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,610
Oh, it's okay. It's about
that. It's like Jesus, Joe.

559
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,850
He said it's about horror movies.
Sorry, I talked over here.

560
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,140
She could check that out and I'm,
I'm not the old San Jose.

561
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:39,160
A rooster teeth feathers at the end of
the month here the last week of May.

562
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,210
Ah, you're going to shake your ass
up there in northern California.

563
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,790
Yup.

564
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,370
Yeah.
Shaking my fucking tail feathers.

565
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,930
Making you money. All right. Let me end

shit. You have to go on it.

572
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,630
It's some of the funniest shit
I've seen on the fucking Internet.

573
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,140
I'm not threatening your job. I'm just
saying you got to do it. All right.

574
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:21,110
Let me wrap up this podcast. Don't
fucking hang up cause you won't pick up.

575
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,360
You know, you never pick up unless
it's a broad there. Um, all right.

576
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:29,960
That's, that's the Thursday afternoon
podcast. I got to talk to my uh,

577
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,660
Mike fucking step brother Joe to
Rosa here. Enjoy the music and uh,

578
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,450
the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday, greatest
hits that will follow here.

579
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,270
All right, I'll check in
on you on Monday. You cuts.

580
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,523
Yeah,

581
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,980
I'm out of my pocket.
I do like when I'm out here,

582
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,310
I literally had to a rule about
just relaxing when I drive.

583
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,160
And one thing that it helps,

584
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,600
it's very therapeutic for me is letting
people go if you're really liking it.

585
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:52,650
I get so frustrated with the quality of
the driving out here at the inability to

586
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:58,911
fucking make turns at a decent speed and
we'll do it when they go buy shit out

587
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,580
here. The second they pass it, it's
it. They don't even remember it.

588
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,880
They have no fears, no fucking
clue. As for what's behind you.

589
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,760
Like you know what they do here,
I'd hear that fucking drives me.

590
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:10,860
Now you'll be sitting behind some
guy to a red light, you know,

591
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:12,180
in Europe on his bumper,
you know,

592
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,750
like you're supposed to be not in
crazy and it's the light turns green.

593
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:18,020
He then puts his left fucking direct,

594
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:22,550
no lines, absolute enraging and it's
self centered and yeah, it's, it's, it's,

595
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:23,150
I'm with you.

596
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,220
It's wrong that I fantasize about pushing
him into traffic and know it's wrong

597
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:30,690
that you don't have the moral
courage to do it. That's totally,

598
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,180
I think that's totally right.

599
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,180
And whenever you hear about someone
getting shot and killed for road rage,

600
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,080
everyone folks goes, oh my God,
that maniac that shot, that person.

601
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:43,160
And I honest to God,
the first thing I think is I'm glad like,

602
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,970
and until I find out the guy with the
gun was the Dick who fucked up for it.

603
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,090
I love that you have to find out that
the guy with the gun was a dick. I know.

604
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,240
To find that out.
The guy with the gun overreacted a little

605
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,531
something about,

606
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:59,640
because people are so self centered
in narcissistic when they drive it,

607
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,370
it's a reflection of who they really are.

608
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,150
So that's why we take it so fucking
personally may like let you let people go.

609
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:10,060
If the guy, if the guy doesn't wave thank
you to me, he don't do that. I've heard,

610
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,780
and Wilson,

611
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,710
they don't do that out here.

612
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:14,800
And I go from like being this
fucking mother Theresa Person.

613
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,820
I turned it to the devil. It
starts, I try to stay calm as such,

614
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:22,330
with a couple of release and my car.
I just got really, really, really,

615
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:24,580
you're not going to fuck these fucking
people out of here. I don't know.

616
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:26,170
What the fuck are you to
move down here for it?

617
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,050
I ended up turning into that
just because some douche.

618
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,550
Do you see the look on their face? They're
like, please, please, please let me go.

619
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,480
And you go to let them go
and you think like, Oh hey,
thumbs up something. Nothing.

620
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:41,410
They immediately, I just
back into their own. Uh,

621
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,790
I don't know.

622
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,370
I find sometimes I wave at people out
here and they look at me like weird. Like,

623
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:47,080
what do you know me?
Like, I maybe, you know,

624
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:51,420
I did move 2,500 miles away
from where I learned, you know,

625
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,050
societal rules. So maybe, uh, but you
know, you just think if, you know,

626
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,780
if you're waving to another white guy, I
mean we're pretty fucking generic. Yeah.

627
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,690
You know,
there's not a lot of

628
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,320
depth of the culture here because
that there's no gang signs.

629
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,640
I can see black guys get a little freak
out watching which your fingers a turn.

630
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,500
Well,
plus east coast though is,

631
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,990
it's so aggressive and I
hate to do like an la thing,

632
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,100
but out here maybe that courtesy
like in Boston or New York,

633
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:16,230
if someone lets you cut it and it's like,
hey mother Fucker,

634
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:17,670
I did you occur to seeing like,
Hey,

635
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:20,820
thank you for the car to say you're a
good shit though. Welcome, you're welcome.

636
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,900
But here it's like,

637
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:25,020
well that was just expected because they
might do that for each other more out

638
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:27,870
here. It's not a big deal.
That's the only I can think of.

639
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,050
I was in the Pennsylvania turnpike one
time driving to a Gig and I know I'm

640
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:32,940
popping all over every,
I'm very self conscious talking.

641
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,230
No, you're doing, you're doing
much better. But I don't have,

642
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,910
I don't have anybody to
help us out with this.

643
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,560
Okay.

644
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,510
I was driving to a Gig and the guy cut
into my lane and I was doing about 70 it

645
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:45,350
was raining and he had a trailer

646
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,800
that's not normal.
And I'm like,

647
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,250
yeah, it was a real drive
to my Mustang. Real punk,

648
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:55,340
your shit fucking hydroplaning Karger
call and I'm driving and this guy's coming

649
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:57,890
into my lane and I immediately, your
mind when you think you're going to die,

650
00:38:57,891 --> 00:39:00,860
it goes very quickly. And I'm like,
okay, you got to slam on the brakes.

651
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:03,910
You're going to have an accident.
Hit the wall. Like it tried to, it's

652
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,720
that's smart. Yeah. Slow, slow
yourself down. Sideswiped the wall.

653
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,630
So I jam on the brake,

654
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:11,750
I hit the horn and he veers out
and we don't have the accident.

655
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,130
So then I'm not afraid. I'm in a
rage at this fucking guy. Right.

656
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,640
And I pull up next to him and it's a,
it's a like a,

657
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,350
you don't have a fat
black dude like it all.

658
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,540
Family Mopey guy and I'm ready to really,

659
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,420
you know Cleveland from
family guy actually. Yes.

660
00:39:26,421 --> 00:39:28,140
William Stephenson fellows or the commerce

661
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,430
and now he looks at me and he
gives me the like, oops, I fucked

662
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,220
dup. Wave Up. Sorry.

663
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:39,221
And it gives me that and every bit of
anger drink cause he just owned up to it.

664
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,500
I'm sorry and sorry. Yet
I wave back. No problem.

665
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,480
That was it in a second my rage.
It was gone. You know what's funny?

666
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:52,340
I sometimes when somebody acts on the
rage, even though I know it's wrong,

667
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,760
I sort of lived through the,

668
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,190
the fucking ecstasy
that that must be like,

669
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,790
do you remember when Russell Crowe
through the phone? That's the guy.

670
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,930
I just can't imagine.

671
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:07,070
Like when you're in a hotel and you're
not getting the customer service you want

672
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,330
on whatever it is that the fact that
you actually take the machine that they

673
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:16,010
won't help you with and
fucking hurt somebody, the
person who is not helping you,

674
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:20,960
you fucking hurt him with it. Completely
wrong thing to do. But I can't imagine.

675
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,940
I always was wondering why. Cause
he's letting that phone go. Just Ah,

676
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,390
just fucking all that rage going on him.
I think it was, it was good for him.

677
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:30,740
It was bad for the guy behind the,
uh,

678
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,630
behind the counter behind
the counter was born

679
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,550
well learned a lesson that day.
Russell Crowe learn not to do it.

680
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:39,000
The other guy probably learned better
fucking customer service next time because

681
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:41,780
I remember when that happened,
I was in the Greenwich Hotel and uh,

682
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,530
which Dinair owns and I remember like,

683
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,750
Oh my God, that's a really
nice place. It's a beautiful,

684
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,820
like he would stay at a die
for on a stupid comment.

685
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,570
But I remember thinking this satisfaction,

686
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:53,540
it must've felt when the phone
hit the guy, like how good.

687
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:56,210
That must've felt a throw that phone
with that motherfucker. And again,

688
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:58,220
he got in big trouble for
that. But yeah, that was the,

689
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,930
do you know how mad you are?
You're,

690
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,160
you're pulling the wires out of the wall
and that voice is still not going. Okay,

691
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:07,440
what are you doing? What are you
doing? And then you wrap it up,

692
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,830
you leave your hotel, you walking
down the hall, he leave Your Room,

693
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:13,650
you get into the fucking elevator
and your brain's still going. Yeah.

694
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,620
Throw it at him. Yeah, throw it
out. What happened? Well, I mean he,

695
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,930
he went downstairs to the front.
I mean I don't,

696
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,950
I was just going to pick the phone up
off the desk and just do it on him. Oh,

697
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,350
I thought he was upstairs in his room.
Maybe he was, but I thought the, I didn't,

698
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,110
I didn't, I thought he just picked
the phone up and threw it at the guy.

699
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,760
That makes way more satisfying.
I find

700
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,190
out that he actually wrapped the cord
and took the phone from downstairs.

701
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,000
That makes me love him more. I was,
I loved him just for picking it up.

702
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:40,670
I probably fucked it up. I fucked
up everything. I don't know.

703
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,180
Do you know the other day I
actually called the periodic chart?

704
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:47,390
I called it the periodical. Yeah.
But that's the understand. I mean,

705
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:51,110
once it was a magazine bad,
no excuse.

706
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,920
It's like you're on a, you're on a
western. You call it a cow boy. You had,

707
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,130
how do you not fucking know? It shows
you the amount of fucking research I did.

708
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,323
Okay.

709
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,330
Hey,
what's going on?

710
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:47,410
It's bill burr and this is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

711
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:51,970
May 17th, 2010. How the hell are you?

712
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,120
How are you doing? How's
your work week? Uh, yeah.

713
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:02,230
Uh, I just, uh, this is one of
these days, right? Where I should,

714
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:02,981
I shouldn't,
you know something,

715
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:07,570
I'm gonna start having tap out days where
I don't do the fucking podcast because

716
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:11,890
I just got off a goddamn flight and
I am fucking exhausted. Once again,

717
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,480
I flew across this goddamn country,
and once again, it was the usual shit,

718
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:17,980
you know?

719
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,800
And I don't want to make fun of people
who are out of shape because they've got

720
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:25,480
a really heartfelt letter from somebody
who was opie saying, what the fuck?

721
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:27,730
Why you always trash and fat people?
Which I'm not.

722
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:31,920
That's all you're hearing because
that's the one that pulls on you, your,

723
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,130
your heartstrings, you know? And he writes
the whole fucking thing about how Blab,

724
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:40,120
Blab, a blue, a blue Yeti, Yada, Yada,
all this fucking shit, you know, you know,

725
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:42,100
everybody feels, everybody,
whatever group they're in,

726
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,780
they feel like they get it the worst.
You know, we get it the worst, you know,

727
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,010
even blah, blah, blah. When they blue
bell blue people least sake again,

728
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,630
right? But when they say, fuck,
I know, please. All right,

729
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,440
everybody thinks they got it the worst
and only one person is right. Okay.

730
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,360
So you got like a fucking 85%
chance of being wrong. You know,

731
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,290
nobody says, uh, you know, I'm going to
beat you like an obese stepchild. Do they?

732
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,020
They don't. They say, I'm gonna beat
you like a red headed stepchild.

733
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,830
They don't have kick a fat
Guy Day, do they? They have
kick a fucking redhead day,

734
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,020
a Ginger Day, right?
That's what they have.

735
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,480
Mia did make a fucking
video about, uh, uh, the,

736
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,970
the fucking genocide of obese
people did shake. No, she didn't.

737
00:44:24,971 --> 00:44:27,850
She made it a red heads and it was funny.
Even a me,

738
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,450
I've been so beaten down as
a fucking redhead. Alright,
so quit your fucking wine.

739
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:39,720
You know, it's a fucking
podcast. I trash everybody.

740
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:45,060
Everybody's going down, including
myself. Everybody goes down this week,

741
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,680
okay.

742
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,090
If my Bruins are going to lose four games
in a fucking row and I got to listen

743
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:54,650
to Keith Robinson,
okay.

744
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,470
A guy who my entire time of knowing him,
every time I tried to bring up hug,

745
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:03,560
he goes out, Haka, sticks. I don't
like it. Nobody cares about hockey.

746
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:06,640
All of a sudden he gives a fuck.
You,

747
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,720
what's funny about that
fucking ignorant jackass?

748
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,900
He wouldn't even unknown that the
Bruins had a historical collapse of,

749
00:45:18,171 --> 00:45:22,850
of, of, of, you know, I'm so
stupid of historical proportions.

750
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,690
He wouldn't even have known.

751
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,650
It's just that ESPN finally
showed some fucking hockey.

752
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,130
Okay.

753
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,060
Jesus Christ.

754
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:34,980
I was in Boston when it happened and I
really want to tell Philly people that

755
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:37,790
everybody was devastated.
But I gotta be honest with Ya.

756
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,360
I think maybe 11% of the city gave a shit.
And I'll tell you why,

757
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:47,361
because we haven't won in 38 fucking
years and we've pretty much sucked.

758
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,960
Um,
the,

759
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:55,160
Brian's kind of jumped the shark
when Ray Borg had to leave the team,

760
00:45:55,161 --> 00:45:59,330
so he'd have an opportunity to win.
And then he went out to Colorado,

761
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,340
won the cup,
and then I know he,

762
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,120
he meant this in a good way.

763
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:10,510
He brought the cup to the city to sh
remind everybody in Boston what it looked

764
00:46:10,821 --> 00:46:11,654
like.

765
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,110
And that was a low point, you
know, that was a low point.

766
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:21,990
And then we were up three games to one
against the Canadians and we couldn't

767
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:23,880
close them out.
We lost that fucking serious.

768
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,710
Then they blew up the
team and they traded away.

769
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:28,800
Gone Chad and fucking Joe and dude,
fuck him.

770
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:32,790
The couple of queers they leaders do.

771
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,320
So we trade away our best fucking
guys for what? Who Do we get?

772
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,880
We got the fucking baby face Magoo.

773
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,180
We ended up trading to fucking Toronto.
That's the only thing I got.

774
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,660
I got right now we've got the number
one pick, fulfill fucking castle.

775
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:53,130
That's all I got right
now. But um, anyways,

776
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,540
uh, I dunno what happened and that
series, all of a sudden they just stay,

777
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:02,370
just fucking sucked.
It wasn't like they weren't even trying.

778
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,960
They weren't even fucking, they
were just standing there going, wow,

779
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:11,790
look at the flyers. Jesus
Christ. Can that guys skate? Oh,

780
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:14,070
hang on a second. I'm going to
try to clear it out of the zone.

781
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,210
And the guy would take a slap shot at,
he couldn't even get it.

782
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,100
He couldn't even clear it
out of the fucking zone.

783
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,170
It would go like sideways into the boards.

784
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:29,140
Jesus Christ. And now my God, that fucking
Mac Davis looking jackass, Hartnell,

785
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,820
whatever the fuck his name is,
he was funny.

786
00:47:31,821 --> 00:47:36,410
But Hartnell is after the game when he's
not, when he's not wearing a helmet,

787
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,500
he looks like a scary son of
a bitch like Jesus Christ.

788
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:45,530
Did that guy just come out of the woods,
you know?

789
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:46,950
Yeah.

790
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,820
Does it does, does, you know he
fucking, he just, he just looks like,

791
00:47:50,821 --> 00:47:54,180
I don't know what he looks like. He looks
like a mountain man. He puts that in,

792
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:58,320
that helmet on. All of a sudden he looks
like he's in blades of glory, you know,

793
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:00,270
and he fucking guy can't even skate every,

794
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,940
every time he goes to make a pass he
falls down. But the fuckers there though,

795
00:48:05,941 --> 00:48:06,774
tapping it in

796
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:12,240
Danny Bay or all those fucking assholes.
Congratulations Philly.

797
00:48:12,241 --> 00:48:15,900
You guys totally deserve it. Uh, you know,
unlike the bro Wins, you didn't quit.

798
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,870
You kept playing the game. Yeah. Dot.

799
00:48:18,871 --> 00:48:21,900
I don't know what happened that actually
the Bruins play the game right through

800
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:26,790
game four and they played the first period
of game seven and a little bit of the

801
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:29,560
third period.
You know,

802
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,200
and I know this sounds like I'm
taking away from the flyers, but dude,

803
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:36,400
they were just standing there and they
had one line that would actually go out

804
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:38,410
and start checking some of the flyers.
And when they did,

805
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,410
all of a sudden we were getting, we were
getting opportunities and it's like,

806
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:45,490
why wouldn't you continue doing
that? Was, is that crazy? Well,

807
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:50,160
not yet another job. Craig g head on the
bench. Did he also sit on the bench go,

808
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,620
Oh yeah guys, by the way, don't forget
to play hockey when you're out there.

809
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,640
And uh, when they're, when they're
around our net, they have the puck.

810
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,210
It's usually a good thing to
try to, you know, disrupt them.

811
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:06,211
Trying to put it into the net rather
than just standing there and waiting for

812
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:08,740
them to shoot it into the neck,
into the net.

813
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:13,630
So you then can whack your stick on
the ice and frustration. Oh jeepers,

814
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,580
they did it again. Golly, Gee,
Gee Wiz. I was fucking brutal.

815
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,800
It's bad enough. I had to sit
there and watch the Bruins lose.

816
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:23,110
But I was in Boston,
which means,

817
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,140
and this is a great thing
about fucking being in Boston,

818
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:29,650
is you guys know how I feel about
Dan Shaughnessy. Okay. The Guy,

819
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,610
he knows baseball, I'll give, you know, I
will give him that. But other than that,

820
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:37,900
he has made a fucking career on misery.

821
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,410
The guy loves misery is any
fucking misery to be found.

822
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,280
I don't give a fuck if somebody's
playing highlight or stick ball.

823
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,450
He's going to be there to write a fucking
story and the great thing is is he

824
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:52,690
doesn't even have the decency to know
what God damn thing about the sport.

825
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:58,470
All he's gotta do is just talk about this
misery that's about ready to happen or

826
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:02,890
is happening and then somehow
tie it in to fucking game.

827
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:07,450
Six of the 1986 red sox met series.
That's what the fuck he did with hockey.

828
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:12,280
If anybody who lives in Boston still
has ios going to grab one of the globe's

829
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:14,260
Boston Globes.
It's fucking hilarious.

830
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,090
I was saying it the night when we lost
and I was in a bar with like eight other

831
00:50:20,091 --> 00:50:20,924
people.

832
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,100
It was more fucking flat screens on than
they were fucking Bruins fans at that

833
00:50:25,101 --> 00:50:28,010
point. Right? Typical of all cities

834
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,660
at Dewald that die hard.
It meant die.

835
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:31,730
Everybody's fucking die hard
when they win a championship.

836
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,060
All of a sudden when they shit the bed,
four games in a row, you don't do it.

837
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:37,700
I'm kind of into the Celtics
cutting into the Celtics course.

838
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,130
You are you like a winter,
don't you?

839
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,003
MMM.

840
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,380
But I was literally standing there going,
you watch this guy, he'll somehow to do,

841
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:48,210
you know, he'll bring it around to the
curse of the bay, which of course he does.

842
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,170
And the great thing is,
is he does not know shit about hockey.

843
00:50:52,171 --> 00:50:56,490
All he did was he looked at the
box score to see who scored when,

844
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,223
just so you could be,

845
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:03,350
and it's 1748 of the second period when
a fucking Hartnell shot the puck in the

846
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:09,120
net debt. So he could then be
like, uh, it was quieter in the,

847
00:51:09,121 --> 00:51:13,110
in the garden than it was in Fenway back
and fucking puppet with Mookie Wilson.

848
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,460
He, ah, you guys are the worst. He's the
fucking worse. And he's got, he just,

849
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:17,970
I don't know.

850
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:22,970
I just want to understand how that guy
still has a job and why people in Boston

851
00:51:23,161 --> 00:51:26,430
continue to buy his books
about fucking misery.

852
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,120
Okay.

853
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,580
You know,
he's such a pussy.

854
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,010
Anytime anything remotely bad
starts to happen in Boston sports,

855
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,440
he always got it. Oh my
God, what's going to happen?

856
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:41,760
Yeah,

857
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,550
it's, it's, it really is that how
you fucking approach, you know?

858
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,430
Yeah.

859
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,550
Whatever the fucking word is for
adversity. Adversity, that's the word.

860
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:51,770
That's how you approach it.
It isn't,

861
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,110
you wouldn't have gotten to the level
that you're at as a sports writer and

862
00:51:56,111 --> 00:52:00,270
being on ESPN if that's how you
approach adversity. So stop to eat.

863
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,930
You don't use your fucking lazy.

864
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,960
Learn about the Goddamn game before you
write another one year lazy ass fucking

865
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:08,470
articles.
Dan Shaughnessy,

866
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,430
you want to see what this guy looks
like? I'll tell you right now, just go,

867
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,930
go to fucking, uh, the
[inaudible] podcast.com.

868
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,960
Get on my nice fucking photo.
Put up a him this week.

869
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:23,900
That noodle hair looking jackass.
Do you know,

870
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:25,970
I remember like a year after the red sox,

871
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,410
after they came back being
down four games to none.

872
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,520
You know, not against some sad
sack fucking team that barely met,

873
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,550
made the God damn play offs.
It doesn't have a fucking score.

874
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,700
They came back against a 210 $200 million
fucking team with like four or five

875
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:47,170
first ballot hall of
famers. We go on and, and,

876
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,510
and when the God damn world series
the very next year in September,

877
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:52,830
we got a couple of injuries.

878
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,700
We had like a six or seven
game lead against the Yankees
and all of a sudden the

879
00:52:56,701 --> 00:53:00,870
Yankees come on and we start to lose a
little bit and this fucking idiot writes,

880
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,610
the curse is back. You can feel
it. It's back. It's in the water.

881
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,520
You know, it's the curse of
what Dan of course of what?

882
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,450
2004 the worth of the
fucking 1111 month curse.

883
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,630
The curse of what that,

884
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,160
that no one wants to buy your
stupid fucking book about misery.

885
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:26,380
Is that what it is? I
Dunno, I got a admit.

886
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,010
I think that was the worst part about
the Bruins losing four games in a row

887
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:33,210
cause it was for the fucking life on me.
I still don't hate the flyers.

888
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:38,100
I actually liked Carsello. I really liked
him and I hate the fucking Canadians.

889
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:42,660
I hate the Canadians. In of a
flyer fan gave me shit. I mean I,

890
00:53:42,661 --> 00:53:45,930
I'd just sit there and take it.
Canadian fed gave me shit.

891
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,570
I'm not going to take it cause I'll
tell ya at the end of the fucking day,

892
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:52,050
that Flyer Fan, he's from the United
States. That's a fellow countrymen.

893
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:54,960
So all he's going to do
is trashed the Bruins.

894
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:58,390
He's not going to trash the good old USA.
That's why I don't like the Canadice.

895
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,280
Why I hate to Canadians fans the most.
They fucking trash my team and my country.

896
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,114
I'll tell you right now,

897
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,910
I won't stand for it with their
little pointy little French noses,

898
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,530
they appoint a little French noses.
Huh? Talking about yesteryear,

899
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,800
I'll walking around with that high school
fucking Letterman jackets up on how

900
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:17,940
they used to dominate the league 30
fucking years ago may tell you summary now

901
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:18,660
Canadians,

902
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,220
you guys can fucking slide all over the
ice block and as many shots as you like

903
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:27,210
cause you goaltender actually sucks.
If he's any fucking good.

904
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:30,060
Why you guys flopping around like a
bunch of goddamn flounders every time

905
00:54:30,061 --> 00:54:33,810
someone takes a fucking wrist shot.
Oh my God,

906
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,910
whatever. Am I really trashing
teams that are still in it?

907
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:41,400
I'm going to shut the fuck up
now. What am I going to do? Okay.

908
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,760
What goes around comes around.
I've talked a lot of shit.

909
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,930
My teams have won a bunch
of championships. We deserve
some sort of, you know,

910
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,440
it's the balance, Dan Shaughnessy.
It's the balance. Okay?

911
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:57,000
He can't win all those
fucking championships in five
years and not expect to get

912
00:54:57,001 --> 00:55:01,560
kicked in the seeds as a sports fan.
All right, but do me a fucking favor.

913
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,830
Don't write any more articles about
hockey because you don't know a fucking

914
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:07,590
thing about it with your
glancing at the box score.

915
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,840
Curse of the Babe Horse
Shit that you wrote.

916
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:11,640
Yeah,

917
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,780
they should surround this.

918
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,540
You know what they should do
with all those globe though?

919
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,310
That piece of shit article he wrote,
they should snip it all out.

920
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:22,390
The tie him to a stake and use that as
a stuff that you use to start a fire.

921
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,670
Whatever that word is.

922
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,900
What does that word come on?

923
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:32,901
Help me out here that we're to use when
you stoke a fire with something gives

924
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,530
with a k, doesn't it kill in a kit,
Caitlin, our country. Something. I don't.

925
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:40,010
What the fuck it is? Jesus
Christ. I know. I don't, you know.

926
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:42,500
Okay.

927
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,500
If you gave me a three games to none lead
with like fucking six of my friends I

928
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:53,600
used to play pond hockey with, we
could have one, one fucking game.

929
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,060
Jesus Christ

930
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,640
just fucking stupid and around

931
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:07,520
standing around. Nothing
went up. Three games,

932
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,670
three goals to none in game seven.

933
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,180
Then all of a sudden they score the flyer
score one goal and then they go back

934
00:56:16,181 --> 00:56:20,500
to that pussy hockey again.
He's good to go.

935
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,780
Do you think they're going
to score another one?

936
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,980
It was, it was pathetic. And uh,

937
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:34,270
I dunno, I am ashamed. I'm ashamed.

938
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:39,340
I'm ashamed of my team, but I still love
him and I'm still wearing my and shit.

939
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,950
I don't give a fuck, you know? Okay.
It's a fuck. Lose three games in row.

940
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:49,320
Four games in a row. Yeah. Why would
you give a shit, you know, you know,

941
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,110
I know.

942
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,900
I like how these idiots are sitting and
talking about hockey right now going

943
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:55,750
like, you know, and it's wide open this
year. It's fucking wide open. You know,

944
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:55,920
they'll,

945
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,800
they'll though number one sheet to sheet
three sheet for she is fucking gone.

946
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:03,850
Yeah. That's because the two teams
that are left beat those teams. Stupid.

947
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:09,400
All right, well actually now the
Bruins beat the fucking third seat,

948
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,110
whatever I'm just saying.

949
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,700
And all of a sudden people don't have
the Canadians like they'd like to add

950
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:18,760
still an eighth see team. They are
still an AFC team, but you know,

951
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,740
they'd beat the capitals and the penguins.

952
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:25,990
So I would have to think that they
are odds on favorite to win it. And

953
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,100
I know this is boring the
shit out of everybody.

954
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:34,440
I've literally talked about hockey
for 15 fucking minutes. Have I? Ah,

955
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:39,100
fuck you guys. I don't give a shit.
All right. In this next round,

956
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:43,420
I am for the Black Hawks and I am for,

957
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:46,090
and uh,
I am for the flyers.

958
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:48,920
My nightmare.

959
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:53,921
Finals obviously is the Canadians for
San Jose because I hate both of those

960
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:58,520
teams. I respect San Jose. I went there,
there actually it's a hockey town.

961
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:02,180
They fucking love that team. Even now,
even though they fucking choke every year.

962
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,060
But I got to, I just don't like
how they, you know, they annoy me.

963
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,570
Okay.

964
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,403
San Jose.

965
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,400
And they annoy me because they remind
me of how annoying my French am,

966
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,400
how my franchise never
fucking signs anybody.

967
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:18,540
And they somehow sign everybody in there
and an under the fucking cap. But, uh,

968
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:23,310
I gotta go for the Black Hawks because
they haven't won it since 61 at, uh,

969
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:26,730
so I'm pulling for that team and uh,

970
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:31,040
and then I got to pull for the
flyers because, uh, I dunno, I,

971
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,990
she always have like the flyers. I
have to admit, I always liked him.

972
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,350
I liked the fights back in the
fucking day. Oh. And speaking of that,

973
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,420
I remember that shit
before this series started,

974
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,850
they got this new show
and on the versus network,

975
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,760
this round table of
like for regular dudes.

976
00:58:44,761 --> 00:58:46,590
And then we'll have like some
big sports star. Come on.

977
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:49,410
I'm not saying if it's a good show,
a bad show, but I saw somebody on,

978
00:58:49,411 --> 00:58:53,970
I believe it was that show going
like a Bruins verse. Flyers. Oh God,

979
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:56,970
this is going to be a blood bath.
Okay.

980
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:00,180
Just for the fucking record for
people who don't fucking watch hockey,

981
00:59:00,181 --> 00:59:03,420
it's not 1979 anymore.
All right. And the Bruins,

982
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:07,470
it flyers just played seven games,
seven games,

983
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,500
I believe.
Two of which that went into overtime.

984
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,790
I'm already trying to block the whole
memory that's series out and there wasn't

985
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:19,110
one fucking fight.
There wasn't even at any cheap shot.

986
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,690
There wasn't.
I can't remember if,

987
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,250
I don't mean I wasn't really paying
attention with the Bruins then I'm gonna

988
00:59:23,251 --> 00:59:26,250
want one point. Mac Davis there
got got to stick to his face,

989
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:29,220
but just cause the dude was trying to
lift the stick up and he missed it.

990
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:34,720
You know, we've got a couple of
fucking stitches. Yeah. Ah, fuck it.

991
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:38,140
All right. That's it there.
I addressed it. So, uh,

992
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:39,780
okay.

993
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,440
I Dunno, whatever. I heard there's a
really good guy in the draft next year.

994
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,980
Taylor Hawkins. Is that his name? Was
that the drummer from the foo fighters?

995
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:50,790
I can't fucking remember. I don't know
any of that shit. I'm just hoping. Look,

996
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:55,740
this is all I wanted. All I
wanted was us to fucking, uh,
after we beat the, the, uh,

997
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:59,430
the fucking savers just to have a good
showing in the next round. They don't,

998
00:59:59,431 --> 01:00:02,310
we fucking lose. I don't
care. I know we're rebuilding,

999
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:07,050
but did you have to shit the
bed to that fucking level?

1000
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,420
All right. Whatever. This is the Monday
morning podcast. This is a, a, a,

1001
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,310
a special hockey edition of the,
uh, the Monday morning podcast.

1002
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,870
Um, all right. I don't even know
where the fuck to go from here. Uh,

1003
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:26,100
how about a youtube video? I might've
even hype this thing last week. Uh,

1004
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:30,210
this is one of these things.
Um, uh, just search this.

1005
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,410
Don't fall asleep at a baseball
game. Just watch that. And uh,

1006
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,430
for all you women out there,

1007
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:40,260
you'll realize how much fun it is to be
a guy when you watch this video. Like,

1008
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:45,090
we can have fun when there's absolutely
nothing going on. And not only that,

1009
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:49,710
it's fucking hilarious. Are you saying
that we can't have fun? Actually,

1010
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:53,220
I think I kind of am,
but I think the reality is,

1011
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:57,450
is I just don't understand your
fun. So I want this, this fall.

1012
01:00:57,451 --> 01:01:02,430
You all the ladies out there. Uh, why
don't you watch that video. Okay. And,

1013
01:01:02,431 --> 01:01:06,140
uh, I challenge you not to fucking
laugh. Well, I guess you won't. Yeah,

1014
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:06,961
you won't laugh.

1015
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:09,840
You guys are great liars and your
greater controlling your fucking emotion,

1016
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:12,240
so you won't, but I'm just telling
you it's a funny fucking video.

1017
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,260
All right now and, and if you want
to show me how women have fun,

1018
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:20,550
you show me a video of women doing
like absolutely nothing is going on,

1019
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,290
but it's still fucking hilarious.

1020
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,730
Find one of those on youtube and I'll
have a little more respect for whatever it

1021
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:31,440
is that you do because my
references are, I guess, uh,

1022
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,750
sex in the city.
You know?

1023
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,730
Is that even a reference? I don't
know. Just the women I've dated,

1024
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:40,140
I've always watched that fucking show.

1025
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:41,720
Okay.

1026
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,210
You know, can you believe in and make it
an another fuck? I'm one of those movies.

1027
01:01:44,211 --> 01:01:47,150
They make it another sex and the city
movie and now they're going to Egypt.

1028
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,640
At what point are they just going
to let that fucker think die?

1029
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,470
Why don't they just have the cast of the
drew Carey show show up and that's what

1030
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:54,981
they should do.

1031
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:58,340
And then turn it into colleague Leah
and somebody gets fisted and then just

1032
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:00,170
fucking ended.
Could somebody just end?

1033
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,960
This really has nothing to do with
either one of those franchises.

1034
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:07,730
It has to do with my fucking
jet lag and uh, and the Bruins.

1035
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:12,110
Complete fucking collapse.
Oh, fuck it. Hearts.

1036
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,340
Ah, Jesus. All right.

1037
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,250
You know, I drank a
lot this past week. Um,

1038
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,100
this is, this is, I'd realize something.
This is a big test in a relationship.

1039
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:33,000
I don't give a fuck how beautiful you
think a woman is, how much you love her,

1040
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:37,130
how much she makes her heart go pitter
patter your heart. Go pitter patter. The,

1041
01:02:37,131 --> 01:02:41,340
the true test of whether
or not you can stand.

1042
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:45,300
You're going to be able to stand the
woman that you think you're going to spend

1043
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:50,301
the rest of your life with is if you can
handle what her voice sounds like when

1044
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:54,120
she's trying to yell
over the noise in a bar.

1045
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,830
If you can handle what that sounds like

1046
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:03,530
and you just fill in your funny punchline
right there because evidently I don't

1047
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:04,910
have the fucking energy to do it.

1048
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,780
What have I just talked for hockey
for 17 minutes to my fucking self.

1049
01:03:08,781 --> 01:03:12,290
I trashed Dan Shaughnessy.
I told the fat guy to stand down.

1050
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,910
You know fucking people want sympathy
cause they always eat the last cookie

1051
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:20,990
rally self as sons of bitches.
Um,

1052
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,510
all right.
You know what I'm gonna do this week?

1053
01:03:23,511 --> 01:03:27,860
I'm going to tap out by reading some
fucking emails from some of my listeners.

1054
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,690
Oh, here's something I learned
this week. Did you know though,

1055
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:33,530
the natural color of rubber is white?
Did you know that?

1056
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:36,110
I didn't know that went
by this guy's place.

1057
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:39,950
He had this collection of fucking cars
and old motorcycles and I love that shit

1058
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,350
cause I wish I was good
at working on cars.

1059
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,100
You know what I mean by I wish
I had like a set set a ranches.

1060
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,980
Now you are working on a car,
you know,

1061
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,600
greasy rag in my back pocket.
I could fucking, you know,

1062
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:57,680
find that right spot and the jukebox
and make it play a song, you know,

1063
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,670
but I can't, you know, I kill and you
know what? Fuck you, I could, I could,

1064
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,200
if I took some time,

1065
01:04:06,201 --> 01:04:09,590
I watched a couple youtube videos
and he gave me a regular old engine,

1066
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,220
I could do some shit. I could figure
out some stuff maybe in another life.

1067
01:04:13,221 --> 01:04:16,150
I don't know what. So anyways,
this guy had an old motorcycle guy,

1068
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:20,870
like I was going at, you know, all white
tires on it. And he goes, that's actually,

1069
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:24,860
cause it was like, uh, one of the
original motorcycles, I guess,

1070
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:29,090
where you couldn't even fucking stop the
thing. It just had to run out of gas.

1071
01:04:29,091 --> 01:04:31,400
You just turned it on
and it just went full on.

1072
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:35,850
And I guess the way to slow it down was
you had to reach down and put your hand

1073
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:40,130
over, uh, the carburetor or
something, whatever the fuck. Yeah.

1074
01:04:40,131 --> 01:04:43,610
With the air goes in the old is that
what happens? Oxygen and gas mixture.

1075
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:44,990
He just put it over there.

1076
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:48,320
You sort of smothered it and that's
how you slowed it down. But anyways,

1077
01:04:48,321 --> 01:04:50,030
these tires,
I know that's completely wrong.

1078
01:04:50,031 --> 01:04:54,050
So you fucking gearheads can trash man.
I don't give a fuck. You doing a podcast,

1079
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,830
you've got a podcast on how the original
motorcycles run. I didn't think you did.

1080
01:04:57,831 --> 01:04:59,460
So go fuck yourself.
All right.

1081
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:04,700
Don't you clean out under your nails so
your wife doesn't get another fucking

1082
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:08,330
infection. That was brutal. Um, anyways,

1083
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:11,900
when you finger blaster just to spell
it out to the fucking nerds in the

1084
01:05:11,901 --> 01:05:16,490
cubicles, um, how do I
know that? I forget how.

1085
01:05:16,491 --> 01:05:17,180
I know that.

1086
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:20,510
I overheard you a fucking dirty broad
talking about that in a bar one night.

1087
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,300
Anyways. Yeah, I guess the
original color of of rubber,

1088
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:26,150
it's natural color is white.
I didn't know that.

1089
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,420
So all these years when I was
looking at white wall tires,

1090
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,780
I thought that they just took like a
strip of white paint or whatever and they

1091
01:05:32,781 --> 01:05:35,510
painted them white and the
natural color of rubber was black,

1092
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:39,730
but it is white and you would
think I would have noticed,

1093
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:44,470
you know all the years of looking at
cars that side swiped curves, you know,

1094
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:47,050
and hacking up their tires.
It was always white underneath.

1095
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:49,510
You'd think that I would
have noticed but I never did.

1096
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,630
So here's my question for
all you gearheads out there.

1097
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:54,010
Why did they paint it black?

1098
01:05:55,770 --> 01:06:00,270
You know
anybody,

1099
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:03,900
I don't know.
Fucking know.

1100
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,120
Where am I going with this shit.
You know what that actually reminds me.

1101
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,300
Have you ever see like when somebody
dies on a bicycle and then they have that

1102
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:12,550
entire ghost white bicycle
that they have there,

1103
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,920
that creepy one with the flowers.
I saw another one.

1104
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:18,190
It absolutely gives me fucking chills.

1105
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,850
It's my closest sixth sense moment
that I'll ever have in my life.

1106
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:22,930
When they do that,

1107
01:06:22,931 --> 01:06:27,931
I don't for the fucking life of me
understand why they have to put the bike

1108
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:34,720
there too. You just can't put a reef down.
Why do they have to do the whole bike?

1109
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,340
What is,
who started that?

1110
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,790
I know I talked about this on the opiate
Anthony show a couple of years ago,

1111
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:40,990
but what the fuck?

1112
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:42,360
Okay.

1113
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,030
It still bugs me. It just
creeps me out that, you know,

1114
01:06:45,031 --> 01:06:48,720
he was on a bike and he died.
They don't have like drunk drivers,

1115
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,760
you know, they smash into trees.
So you get hit by a drunk driver.

1116
01:06:52,761 --> 01:06:54,710
Do they frost out a fucking car,

1117
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:56,743
you know,

1118
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,730
mannequin underneath it and I, that's a
brutal job and I, you know what I mean?

1119
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:04,710
It's just fucking creepy.
Fucking creepy.

1120
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:08,490
Stop it. Some, you know, gets
hit on a bicycle, a wreath.

1121
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:09,780
They're like a normal person.

1122
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,810
Fucking sit there and don't you just put
the bike he got hit on with a bent up

1123
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:18,140
tires and shit.
I knew it was going to be mean this week.

1124
01:07:18,141 --> 01:07:22,160
I'm tired and I'm fucking, my Bruins lost
four in a row. All right. Let me, uh,

1125
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:26,540
try to get something positive here. I'm
literally in May Day, May Day right now.

1126
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:28,303
All right. Hi, Bill.

1127
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,660
My fiance and a couple of our friends
saw you and Atlantic city this past

1128
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,870
Saturday. You be on hysterical. I got a
picture with you, but Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh.

1129
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:40,040
I recently quit my job as
a photo retoucher for this
high end retouching company

1130
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,790
by my job was to make models
thinner and more beautiful,

1131
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:48,560
but also sit on my ass 10 to 12 hours
per day like a robot. It was brutal,

1132
01:07:48,561 --> 01:07:52,130
but what could help me through it was
listening to your Monday morning podcast.

1133
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:54,770
I would sit there in a silent
room hysterically laughing,

1134
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,130
often needing to throw my
headphones off because I was crying.

1135
01:07:58,131 --> 01:08:01,760
I was laughing so hard. In fact, I got
in trouble once for laughing so much.

1136
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,570
I needed to be more and people told me
I need to be more serious about my job

1137
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:09,860
for thanks. So thanks for doing
what you do. Uh, well thank you.

1138
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,840
I don't know why I saved that podcast.
That email made me feel good.

1139
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,251
And you know what,

1140
01:08:16,251 --> 01:08:19,640
I saved that before the Bruins lost
four games in a fucking row. So I was,

1141
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,490
I was in a better mood.

1142
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,090
Yeah.

1143
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:26,520
All right, let's read another one. See
if I can get out of this. I'm a really,

1144
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:29,760
really bombing right now. Ah,
Bill. Hi. I love your work.

1145
01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:33,810
I don't know if you've
covered this before, uh,

1146
01:08:33,811 --> 01:08:36,740
as I found out about you, uh, uh,

1147
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:41,790
but what are your views on celebrity
adoption? I think I saw Sandra Bullock's,

1148
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,520
uh, has just done this, but to be honest,

1149
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:49,521
she doesn't have the profile orange or
indeed now the father figure to really

1150
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:53,790
pull off this adoption seriously though.
I think it's sick.

1151
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:58,230
They find the most fashionably deprived
countries, countries. Oh my God,

1152
01:08:58,231 --> 01:09:01,670
I can't even read this week
too. All right, Bill, come on.

1153
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:06,960
Get your shit together. Right. They find
the most fashionably deprived countries.

1154
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,960
Uh,
that doesn't even make sense.

1155
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:13,680
You mean the most popular ones to give
a fuck about? Is that what you mean?

1156
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:17,610
They take the prettiest kid
in the orphanage and then
dress him up at the baby

1157
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:20,430
gap and carry them around
like a fucking Chihuahua.

1158
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:25,700
It's like by absorbing them into
this plastic la bullshit lifestyle,

1159
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,820
they pretend they're actually doing
something about the root cause of global

1160
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:30,654
poverty.

1161
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:35,690
When Angelina Jolie adopts a 56 year
old Serbian war widow with a drinking

1162
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:39,510
problem, takes her to Disney
world and lets her fuck Brad Pitt,

1163
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:42,870
I might then buy it. All
right. That's all hilarious.

1164
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:46,800
Even though I didn't read
it correctly. Plot, um,

1165
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,130
um, you know, this is
just this classic thing.

1166
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,420
Where do you ever notice
when you do something good?
If people find out about it,

1167
01:09:55,421 --> 01:09:58,570
they have to trash it on some level. I
mean, you know, I get what you're saying.

1168
01:09:58,571 --> 01:10:03,100
I've actually done bits about that.
Uh, you know that they, you know,

1169
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:05,170
I actually did something
about Paris Hilton,

1170
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,640
something bedazzleing some
African kid making her,

1171
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:13,300
making the kid match her
phone or something like that
and she left it behind in

1172
01:10:13,301 --> 01:10:17,410
a club was one of those topical jokes.
I don't think I ever did on TV, but uh,

1173
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:20,410
she is kind of doing something about,

1174
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,660
you say she's not doing
something about poverty.

1175
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:24,770
Okay.

1176
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:28,460
She just took a kid who wasn't poverty.
All right,

1177
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,380
I'm going to play the devil's advocate.
Okay.

1178
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:34,460
And put them in a fucking
house with running water and
is now going to feed them.

1179
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,240
You know, I think a lot of times
when people do good shit like this,

1180
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:41,810
it annoys people because it reminds
us that we're not doing shit about it.

1181
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,460
Maybe that's why I make fun of them.

1182
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:44,670
Okay,

1183
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:45,960
well maybe it's that thing,
you know,

1184
01:10:45,961 --> 01:10:49,320
he didn't pray in public so everybody
can see how fucking holy there.

1185
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,920
I don't understand why they can't just
adopt a kid personally and just fucking

1186
01:10:52,921 --> 01:10:57,720
do it and then that's it. You don't hold
it up on the cover of people magazine.

1187
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:00,810
Look now I'm agreeing with you. I'm going
to go a little skit. So on this one.

1188
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:06,360
Yeah. Sandra, why do you get to
hold the fucking thing up? You know,

1189
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,860
I don't fucking know,
but she is doing something about poverty.

1190
01:11:10,861 --> 01:11:15,030
That kid was fucking broke and really
sick of all you people who don't live in

1191
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:18,420
Los Angeles talking
about how plastic La is.

1192
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:22,200
And then you're acting like nobody lies
in nobody's full of Shit and you're

1193
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:26,010
fucking hometown. Just be honest.
They're better looking than you.

1194
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:29,190
They have more money than you.
Okay.

1195
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:34,140
And they're living the life that
you fantasize about. All right.

1196
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:38,850
I'm man enough to admit that
I was actually mad enough
to move out here and have

1197
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:43,040
the audacity to think that I could live
that life on some level that's helped us

1198
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:47,640
fucking pathetic. I am. Um, look,

1199
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:49,500
I gotta be honest with you.
If I ever did something like that,

1200
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:53,130
I think it's a great thing
to do. You know, I, you know,

1201
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:58,190
and considering the world is fucking
overpopulated and where we're headed

1202
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:04,011
towards major food shortages that nobody
wants to deal with because everybody's,

1203
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,760
you know,
I haven't had a boy yet,

1204
01:12:05,761 --> 01:12:08,340
so I'm going to try to have another
kid or I haven't had a girl yet,

1205
01:12:08,341 --> 01:12:10,680
so I'm gonna try to have another kid.
You know,

1206
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,770
I read something about this
guy in rolling stone today.

1207
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,600
I ain't know his fucking name,

1208
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:19,200
but he's some legendary soul
singer that I've never heard of.

1209
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,840
So I don't think he's at legendary cause
I think it would have heard about him.

1210
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:25,710
I think when you're like, seriously,
well I guess if he was an icon,

1211
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:27,870
I would've heard about them. Whatever.
I'll give it to him. He's legendary.

1212
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:32,900
The fucking guy had 21 kids who
then spawned 90 grandchildren.

1213
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:38,460
Um, and you know, I'm going to
fucking call it first in the future.

1214
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,210
That's going to be fucking
considered illegal.

1215
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:48,410
Like what that guy did is basically he
had his own major fucking oil spill into

1216
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:55,770
the ocean, but rather than
the ocean, it, it was on land.

1217
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,080
You know, his fucking seaman. What,

1218
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:05,040
just fucking leaking out 5,000 gallons
of fucking day. Just like that.

1219
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:07,740
God Damn Crater.
The bottom of the ocean.

1220
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:13,890
You think he didn't just on a couple of
ducks, make a 21 fucking kids. They did.

1221
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:19,490
That guy should be in fucking
jail for that 21 fucking kids.

1222
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:26,040
I mean, you guys are at work. Can
you name 21 people you work with?

1223
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:30,270
Can you imagine if that was your fucking
kid? 21 kids. He has 90 grandchildren.

1224
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:31,770
There's no,
do you understand?

1225
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,580
He doesn't know the names
of all of his grandchildren.

1226
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:41,180
Oh, maybe he does. But in
order to make room for that,

1227
01:13:41,181 --> 01:13:45,560
you'd have to forget half your friends'
names. I know the names of 90 people.

1228
01:13:45,561 --> 01:13:48,410
What the fuck? I probably know the
names of 90 professional athletes.

1229
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,920
I'm really underestimating the power
of the human brain. But what the fuck

1230
01:13:55,170 --> 01:14:00,170
one fucking guy's dick with
two balls is far as we know,

1231
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:07,320
created that,
that fucking ecological disaster.

1232
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:13,000
You know, what I love about rolling stone
is, is, is they got in, in that, um,

1233
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:17,740
in this week's issue where they have
Keith Richards on the cover yet again,

1234
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:20,350
you've got to love rolling
stone every fucking three weeks.

1235
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:24,730
If tonight just have some teeny bopper
on there. They're still mining the 60s.

1236
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:25,970
Yeah.

1237
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:30,740
The exile on Main Street reissue.
I love this shit were like,

1238
01:14:30,741 --> 01:14:34,010
the original artists were like
back in the day were just like,

1239
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,260
do you want to release this song now?

1240
01:14:36,261 --> 01:14:40,850
It's sucks compared to the rest of the
shit. And then 40 fucking years later,

1241
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:42,190
okay,

1242
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:43,720
when you want to buy another yacht,

1243
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:48,220
you start putting out shit that you didn't
feel was worthy of releasing when you

1244
01:14:48,221 --> 01:14:51,470
were at your peak.
You know,

1245
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:55,400
I don't fucking know that Tupac
Shit that Jimi Hendrix Shit,

1246
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,630
the fucking, uh, I don't know.

1247
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:03,410
There's very few that I can think of
that they actually reissued that were

1248
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:06,650
actually worth listening to.
I'll tell you one that in recent years,

1249
01:15:06,651 --> 01:15:10,160
this past decade was led Zeppelin when
they came out with that concert film of

1250
01:15:10,161 --> 01:15:13,390
them at Royal Albert Hall. And, um,

1251
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:18,710
you know, all that concert footage,
that shit was great. That actually

1252
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,640
was great stuff. But they, but they
also weren't, why were you guys red?

1253
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,680
Led Zeppelin is repackaged. They act for
and what the fuck am I talking about?

1254
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,870
Every two years they,
they, they, whatever,

1255
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:34,890
10 years they do the new digital
remaster of whole lot of love.

1256
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:37,010
You know what I mean? I don't know
what the fuck I'm talking about.

1257
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:39,820
Talk about rolling stone. Okay.
So getting back to that shit,

1258
01:15:39,821 --> 01:15:43,580
they actually do a story
on this guy who's like, um,

1259
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,090
he goes into like,
you know,

1260
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:51,091
war torn countries and he liked buys up
land and he makes deals with basically

1261
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,830
war criminals or,

1262
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:58,831
or whatever to buy up land because
he knows that this unbelievable like,

1263
01:15:59,141 --> 01:15:59,974
um,

1264
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,040
okay,

1265
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,500
food crisis is common.
It's fucking scary.

1266
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:08,830
And this guy is out there having 21
goddamn kids who then go on to have 90

1267
01:16:08,871 --> 01:16:13,300
fucking grandchildren. And uh, you know,
it's the kind of shit that, you know,

1268
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:17,300
that like, that's it. Morning
talk show stuff. You know,

1269
01:16:17,301 --> 01:16:21,590
like nobody would even even sit there
and talk about how fucking reprehensible

1270
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,693
that is.

1271
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:25,913
I Dunno.

1272
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:28,770
Look, I think I should get a
tax break at my fucking age.

1273
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:30,123
All right.

1274
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:35,100
I to be able to drive a full size
fucking hummer with no muffler down the

1275
01:16:35,101 --> 01:16:38,840
Goddamn street.
The fact that I have not procreated and,

1276
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:43,480
and just basically, you know, right now
I'm, I'm basically doing what people,

1277
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,130
well related to Hitler or doing,
I'm letting my bloodline die off.

1278
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:52,810
If you guys ever heard of that shit,

1279
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:57,960
then evidently the relatives of a,
you know, like his fucking great,

1280
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:02,040
great grand nephews or whatever
or whatever the fuck they are.

1281
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,010
This evidently like
two or three more left.

1282
01:17:05,011 --> 01:17:10,011
They live in Long Island and they
all made a pact not to get married.

1283
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:11,090
Okay.

1284
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:12,320
And uh,

1285
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:13,370
okay.

1286
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:18,370
And just let the bloodline die off because
they're so afraid that whatever made

1287
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:22,970
Hitler so fucked up, we'll let, I
mean they talking like some omen shit,

1288
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,040
you know,

1289
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,850
like you'd be pushing you a little baby
Hitler on his swing and all of a sudden

1290
01:17:28,851 --> 01:17:32,910
your nanny's standing on a rooftop,
you know,

1291
01:17:32,911 --> 01:17:36,440
jumping off because like subliminally
this little fucking kid told him to with

1292
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:40,030
is fucked up. Pew prepub pre
pubescent mustache. Yeah.

1293
01:17:40,031 --> 01:17:41,460
I fucking hate this podcast.

1294
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,730
I really would erase this thing
if I wasn't 35 fucking minutes in.

1295
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:48,630
I really would. I really would,
but I can't because I can't,

1296
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:51,270
I can't go through this fucking shit
again. I can't read this stuff. All right.

1297
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,540
Well anyway, I can't remember
what my fucking point was. Look,

1298
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:56,010
I think Sandra Bullock did a good thing.

1299
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:57,300
Okay.

1300
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,990
Okay. Uh, why she did it.
I don't fucking know. Okay.

1301
01:18:00,991 --> 01:18:03,030
But I'm going to give it the benefit
of the doubt that she did a good thing.

1302
01:18:03,031 --> 01:18:06,600
But just notice anytime anybody does
something, even remotely consider it.

1303
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,750
Like how fucked up that
makes people around him.

1304
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,450
At no point did Sandra
Bullock, oh, I did this.

1305
01:18:13,451 --> 01:18:15,940
You should do this to look
what a great person I am.

1306
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:20,500
Granted she's holding the fucking kid up
like a Goddamn bowling trophy on people

1307
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:23,320
magazine. You know what?
You're fucking right.

1308
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:27,450
But I kind of relate to her cause
like when people find out, I,

1309
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:30,430
I when I first bought my Prius,
I got a ton of shit from people.

1310
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:32,260
What did you do that for?

1311
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,140
Who you think you think you were
actually making a difference?

1312
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,870
You know, like they got all
fucking defensive. I'm like, dude,

1313
01:18:37,871 --> 01:18:40,930
I'm not saying you can't drive with
the fuck you drive. I bought it for me.

1314
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:44,860
I fly every other fucking weekend. I put
my own hole and the fucking ozone layer.

1315
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:48,630
I'm trying to do something,
something, you know,

1316
01:18:48,631 --> 01:18:51,510
to not be a total douche. Right.
That's all I'm doing here.

1317
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,220
I'm not saying you're
doing anything wrong.

1318
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,560
I'm not saying you can't drive
a fucking car with a v eight.

1319
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,040
I'll give a fuck what you do.
Get in your car and get away from me.

1320
01:18:58,650 --> 01:18:59,550
Fucking asshole.

1321
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,770
Um, I dunno. So that's what
I have to say about that.

1322
01:19:03,771 --> 01:19:05,030
I don't know if it made any sense.

1323
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:06,430
Okay.

1324
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:10,010
I Dunno. I got no idea. All right.
Uh, here we go, Bill Birth. Wow.

1325
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:13,060
What do you want to ask me? Ask
Bill. Um, oh, here's one for you.

1326
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,410
I got it right here.

1327
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:17,230
This is the one that's going to pull
this fucking podcast out of the God damn

1328
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:20,740
mud bill on 21 years old and
attend a big 10 university.

1329
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:23,700
I'm not the best looking guy in the world,
but I think I'm,

1330
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:28,600
what I lack in that department is made
up with high amounts of intelligence and

1331
01:19:28,601 --> 01:19:29,950
charm.
Wow.

1332
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:33,730
You just really sound like a sweaty
fat guy with a lampshade on his head,

1333
01:19:33,731 --> 01:19:37,300
but I'm not going to judge. Um,
that's another fact. I joke.

1334
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,880
Maybe I do have something with,
I don't know.

1335
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,010
You know what it is because I'm constantly
in contact with those fucking people

1336
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:49,120
to Goddamn epidemic out there.
You know,

1337
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:51,100
I had the aisle seat and uh,

1338
01:19:51,101 --> 01:19:54,010
I was back towards the back of
the plane today and you know,

1339
01:19:54,011 --> 01:19:56,260
the aisle seats great.
You could stretch out a little bit.

1340
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:59,320
When you want to get up and take a leak,
you don't have to step over people.

1341
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:01,960
There's a lot of fucking advantage just
to have and if when you start getting

1342
01:20:01,961 --> 01:20:05,050
towards the back of the plane and that
becomes that moment where everybody has

1343
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:07,210
to go to the bathroom
and aligned develops.

1344
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,040
The problem is is as these round people
are trying to get past each other,

1345
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,540
there's not enough room.

1346
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:17,490
So what ends up happening is one of these
douchebags stomach slash unit ends up

1347
01:20:17,491 --> 01:20:21,630
on your shoulder as they lean a little
bit into your fucking airspace so the

1348
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:22,950
other fatty can get by him.

1349
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:30,080
It's fucking guy was enormous on the
God damn plane to the point I felt like

1350
01:20:30,081 --> 01:20:34,280
heat coming off of him. Do you want to
stand like how out of shape that is?

1351
01:20:34,281 --> 01:20:39,020
It was like,
you know you could like like earth,

1352
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:43,340
the planet fucking earth.
How the co it's core is still on fire.

1353
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,870
Okay.

1354
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:47,910
All right. I really didn't
want to attack fat. People get,

1355
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:50,920
I know I'm going to lay off. I'm going
to lay off for the rest of the podcast.

1356
01:20:50,921 --> 01:20:54,670
That's it. That's it. God bless Ya. I
know it's a problem. I'm room for you.

1357
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,450
Do the right thing. Have a salad.
I got my problems. Look at me,

1358
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,580
you know, whatever. All
right, here we go. Uh, anyway,

1359
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:08,940
you fucking try to get through this.
All right. I'm not the best looking guy,

1360
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:13,260
but oh boy. Can I tell a joke? I'm not
just patting myself on the back there. Uh,

1361
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:15,750
there is a reason I'm standing it
all right. For the past two years,

1362
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:18,880
I've been doing horribly in school.
Oh, Jesus. Now I just trashed this guy.

1363
01:21:18,881 --> 01:21:19,980
He's going to fucking kill himself.

1364
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,590
I've been doing horribly
in school dealing with, uh,

1365
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,950
things that are pretty depressing,
but because of this,

1366
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:30,951
I've had to come up with clever ways of
trying to pass classes in an effort to

1367
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:34,650
not get dropped from school. Uh, as such,

1368
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:39,651
my strategy has been to pick a teaching
assistance that are females in order to

1369
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:45,060
try and charm my way into passing the
classes while putting in as little work as

1370
01:21:45,061 --> 01:21:48,900
possible as I possibly could do.
Do you have a future?

1371
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,140
I'm gonna tell you this right now,
son. Don't give up on yourself.

1372
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:53,430
You have a fucking future.

1373
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:58,560
If you've figured out a way
to pass classes by doing
that charming people while

1374
01:21:58,561 --> 01:22:00,060
doing little or no work,

1375
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:03,750
I'm telling you there was a
corner office waiting for you.

1376
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:08,100
So don't, don't give up on
yourself. All right, here we go.

1377
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:13,110
What the fuck am I? A bit up a
little work as possible. Granted,

1378
01:22:13,111 --> 01:22:17,100
I am well aware that manipulating slash
charming women into giving me good

1379
01:22:17,101 --> 01:22:21,180
grades is fucked up and not the most
practical way of going about doing things,

1380
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:24,570
but it fucking works. Hey Dude, they
do that to get a free drink out of you.

1381
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,460
You don't don't if there's no shame
in that fight, fire with fire.

1382
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:31,500
I'm totally what this guy.
However,

1383
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:36,270
my lack of foresight is very much
evident now is something you probably saw

1384
01:22:36,271 --> 01:22:39,720
coming happened. I fell
hard for my ta, this,

1385
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:43,440
the teaching assistant this semester
from day one. I was attracted to her.

1386
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:47,760
This is a good story so far. How
could this go off the rails? Um,

1387
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:52,440
let's continue. And a while. I do
try and charm her every chance I get.

1388
01:22:52,441 --> 01:22:53,370
In an odd way,

1389
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:58,400
me being so attracted to tour has fueled
my melt motivation to study and show

1390
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:01,680
off the fact that I can easily acer class.

1391
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:06,890
I go every week to her office hours
I go to are,

1392
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:11,460
but I go every week to her office
hours she holds for students,

1393
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:13,980
which are about two
hours and nobody ever go.

1394
01:23:13,981 --> 01:23:18,450
So it ends up just being her and me
flirting with one another the entire time.

1395
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,520
However,

1396
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,600
maybe it's because I'm a male or maybe
it's because I'm so attracted to her,

1397
01:23:24,601 --> 01:23:28,940
but I didn't notice the huge
wedding ring on her finger. Oh,

1398
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:34,110
geesh. [inaudible] we go, everybody,
it's going this way again.

1399
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:38,070
A lot of guys out there, if I can
do on a wrong turn, all right.

1400
01:23:38,071 --> 01:23:41,640
But I didn't notice her huge wedding
ring on her finger up until about a month

1401
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:46,590
ago. Uh, I bet in a class
now for about four months. I
brought it up to her saying,

1402
01:23:46,591 --> 01:23:48,000
Holy Shit,
you're married.

1403
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,440
And her response is what holds my hopes.
Okay.

1404
01:23:52,441 --> 01:23:55,560
Before I get into her response,
dude, you're full of shit.

1405
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:59,030
There's no way for four fucking
months you didn't notice her,

1406
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:00,330
her fucking wedding ring.

1407
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:04,290
This is you toning down the fact that
you knew right out of the gate she was

1408
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:07,800
fucking married. She had a huge wedding
ring. He didn't, you didn't notice.

1409
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,270
Okay, maybe you're young, maybe you
don't look, but how do you miss that?

1410
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:16,690
And then you said, Holy
Shit, you're, you're married.

1411
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:21,400
That sounds like a great setup line
to get the response that you got.

1412
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:25,990
So the guy says, Holy Shit,
you're married, Huh? And she goes,

1413
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:30,430
he goes in a response is what holds up
my hopes in an astonish almost forgetful

1414
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:34,360
way. She replies, Oh yeah.

1415
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:39,730
Wow. Okay Dude, you're in. All right.

1416
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:43,560
I'm not saying you should do it, but if
your, if your question is, am I n Urn,

1417
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,393
mmm.

1418
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:50,150
Census, revelation. I have been
continuing to bring up, uh,

1419
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:54,590
as much as I can about her husband. If
nothing else for comparison. All right,

1420
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:57,110
this is getting twisted. Dude, don't
bring up her husband. Just go in.

1421
01:24:57,111 --> 01:25:01,340
If you've got a Banger, just
fucking banger. You know, does,

1422
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:04,820
does he look good better in a
jacket? Did I do, I do. I look better

1423
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,210
the more I bring it up though,

1424
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:11,510
the more it seems like she regrets
getting married at such a young age.

1425
01:25:11,511 --> 01:25:14,960
She got married at 23 and now she's 25.
This is my predicament.

1426
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:18,040
My parents got divorced when
I was six because my bald,

1427
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:22,250
childish fat piece of Shit. Father cheated
on my mother with their best friend.

1428
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:25,470
So I have reservations about
dating a married woman. Uh,

1429
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:28,550
it doesn't sound that horrible.
While I'm trying to justify,

1430
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:33,010
doesn't sound that horrible while I'm
trying to justify attempting to date a

1431
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:35,920
married woman. But it's
like you said, what is it?

1432
01:25:35,921 --> 01:25:38,620
75% of marriages go right
down the shitter right now.

1433
01:25:38,621 --> 01:25:43,300
I have no problem with waiting it out. But
I'll ask my question in two forms. One,

1434
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:47,770
what would you suggest doing to try and
feel out the likelihood of this marriage

1435
01:25:47,771 --> 01:25:50,890
lasting? And two, if
it's clear that it's not,

1436
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:56,110
which with not much prying done on
my part is clear to see it won't.

1437
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,400
What can I do to perhaps bring about
the breakup as soon as possible?

1438
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:06,260
All right, dude, these are the questions
of a 21 year old. Okay? First of all,

1439
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:10,040
you don't date a married woman.
All right? You want a banger?

1440
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:10,903
Go ahead and bang her.

1441
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:15,910
She actually wants you to bang her because
she needs some sort of spark to get

1442
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:21,350
up her courage to get out of that fucking
marriage that she clearly didn't want

1443
01:26:21,351 --> 01:26:26,090
to be. And um, I'm telling you right now
as, as she was walking down the aisle,

1444
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,600
her brain was screaming, what the fuck
are you doing? All right, this is, uh,

1445
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:31,610
you know,
she got married at 23.

1446
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,700
I don't know what our dating
experience was before that.

1447
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,140
Maybe she doesn't know
how to get out of it.

1448
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:40,820
She seems like someone who does not know
how to get out of a relationship now,

1449
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:44,510
what kind of relationship she has.
It doesn't sound like an abusive one.

1450
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,830
It sounds like a,
I don't know.

1451
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,550
She just got involved in something
and then she just got into deep.

1452
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:56,870
Didn't know how to get out of it.
The dude had met her family.

1453
01:26:56,871 --> 01:26:58,310
When are you getting married?

1454
01:26:58,311 --> 01:27:03,290
And she just fucking went down that
fucking water slide. She did not get off.

1455
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:07,010
And now this is her deal.
So this is the deal, dude,

1456
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:10,400
you're going about this the
wrong way. I, first of all,

1457
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:13,400
you shouldn't fucking do it,
all right?

1458
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,310
You shouldn't do it because you're,
you're,

1459
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:18,500
you're dealing with the
married fucking woman here.

1460
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:22,760
There's somebody who wanted to spend the
rest of his life with her, all right?

1461
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:27,560
And you're delving into
that shit so you don't,

1462
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:28,700
and you want to tear it and he'll do,

1463
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,420
you don't know what this
girl's going to do. Okay?

1464
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:35,420
She could be using you for the courage,
right?

1465
01:27:35,421 --> 01:27:38,370
Go out and Fucking Bang you alright?

1466
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:42,350
And a God damn rainstorm come
home like a drown fucking rat,

1467
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:45,680
just so he can start the
conversation and be like, honey,

1468
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:49,520
where the fuck are you bed?
So she could just flip out and be like,

1469
01:27:49,521 --> 01:27:54,210
I just fucked one of my students.
You know,

1470
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,280
just so she could just get out.
Whatever.

1471
01:27:56,281 --> 01:27:58,380
How many fucking years
she's been sitting on?

1472
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,280
I don't want to be with you anymore.
All right?

1473
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:08,690
And I'm telling you, if you, if
you meet a psycho fucking woman,

1474
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:13,930
they have a really bad fucking habit of
doing something really fucked up with

1475
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:17,570
the person that they're
in a relationship with.

1476
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:22,040
And then they feel guilty
afterwards so they have to confess.

1477
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,880
And then, you know, the
guy can't hit the woman.

1478
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:27,530
So guess who he's going to come and hit.

1479
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:33,140
You know that you just blew up his fucking
life. So you shouldn't fuck this girl.

1480
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:37,160
But I'm telling you right now, dude, if
you're got a Banger, just fucking Banger,

1481
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:42,110
but you wanting to date a married fucking
woman is completely the wrong fucking

1482
01:28:42,111 --> 01:28:43,340
thing to do.
I like,

1483
01:28:43,341 --> 01:28:46,400
I just gave you the green light to go
ahead and bang her if you want. You know?

1484
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,250
I mean,
I'm not telling you to do that,

1485
01:28:49,251 --> 01:28:52,820
but I'm telling if you're going to choose
one or the other, he got three choices.

1486
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:56,630
Don't fucker. That's what I'm
telling you to do. All right?

1487
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:59,540
But if you're going to go with,
if you're going to go to the dark side,

1488
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:04,200
there's Darth Vader and there's
Darth Vader light here. Okay?

1489
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:08,730
And I'm saying to,
to take the less calories of evil here.

1490
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:12,900
What you should do is just try to bang
her. Do not try to date this girl, okay?

1491
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:15,540
This girl isn't ready to date.
She doesn't know what the fuck she wants.

1492
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,800
She Shell, she so doesn't know
what she wants and she show her.

1493
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:22,410
So has an inability to communicate
what it is that she wants,

1494
01:29:22,411 --> 01:29:25,320
that she actually married somebody
she doesn't want to be married to.

1495
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,290
She's just sitting there
with its screaming inside.

1496
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,020
I don't want to maybe married you.
I don't want to be married.

1497
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:33,120
I don't even married at this point in
my life. I don't want to have kids.

1498
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:36,570
I'm not ready for this. I want to get the
fuck outta here. I want to, I want the,

1499
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:37,500
you know what she needs to do.

1500
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:41,790
She's break up with this guy and go get
an apartment and live by herself for a

1501
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,670
good year and a half, two
fucking years, you know?

1502
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:49,740
And Not really date anybody for a good
six fucking months. Cry this shit out.

1503
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,380
Go to therapy,
figure out what's wrong with her.

1504
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:56,190
Make a fucking list of what she
wants in life. She's got to do shit.

1505
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:59,520
She needs to do that kind of work.
And you're trying to date this woman,

1506
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:04,320
this fucking mess while she's still
married. Don't do it. All right.

1507
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:08,400
Go charmed the shit out of somebody
else and, and try and bang them.

1508
01:30:08,401 --> 01:30:12,690
I'm telling you right now, do, don't
fucking do it. Don't do it. All right.

1509
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,970
That's my advice to you.

1510
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,370
Uh,

1511
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:23,880
that's it. That's it. That's all I got to
say on that. Don't, don't fucking banger.

1512
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:26,370
And if you do decide to Banger,

1513
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:32,100
I mean you do decide to get with
a do not fucking data. Okay. Even,

1514
01:30:32,101 --> 01:30:33,090
even if I'm telling you,
dude,

1515
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,570
you're going to fucking probably make
the wrong decision because you're young,

1516
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:40,520
you're probably going to try and dater
cause you actually got feelings for all

1517
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:41,370
right?

1518
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:46,110
And then what she's going to do is she's
just going to use you to get over this

1519
01:30:46,111 --> 01:30:51,030
other guy before she dumps you and fucking
rips your heart out of your God damn

1520
01:30:51,031 --> 01:30:55,430
chest. That's what the, you're
going to be roadkill. All right?

1521
01:30:55,970 --> 01:31:00,770
Fortunately, you haven't banged her yet.
You know, all he got his feelings for.

1522
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,210
So get out now,

1523
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:07,040
dial it down a sir class.
Get on with your fucking life.

1524
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:11,690
There's plenty of other fucking teachers'
assistants out there, that chicken bag,

1525
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:15,860
all right? But that's not the move to
make. Good luck to you. It's your life.

1526
01:31:15,861 --> 01:31:19,970
You make your decisions,
but I'm telling you over and over again,

1527
01:31:19,971 --> 01:31:22,730
evidently I'm going to keep saying
the same thing over and over again.

1528
01:31:22,731 --> 01:31:27,440
Do not cease and desist.
Fuck that. Walk away.

1529
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:31,110
Walk, Dude. You know, you don't want that
on your resume. You just don't. All right?

1530
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:34,810
All right, trust me. Okay,
here we go. Asbell Ah,

1531
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:39,410
this story is a little bit long. Um,
but I was out with the clothes. Oh,

1532
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:43,460
Jesus. Here's another one. Oh,
Jesus. Um, the story's a bit long,

1533
01:31:43,461 --> 01:31:46,610
but in the end of your
podcast, but in the end, oh,

1534
01:31:46,611 --> 01:31:49,400
this is this fist that actually an
interesting one here. Okay, Bill,

1535
01:31:49,401 --> 01:31:53,690
this story is a bit long, but in the
end, your podcast makes a girl cry.

1536
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:57,830
Okay? Somehow my podcast made
a girl cry. Okay, here we go.

1537
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,000
I was out with a close friend and
his girlfriend, his girlfriend,

1538
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:05,080
having some drinks and a
five bottles of wine later.

1539
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:10,060
My friends girl brings up a point
about how pro athletes are overpaid.

1540
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:15,040
I said, a yes, it is dumb to pay
someone $8 million to catch a football,

1541
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:19,570
but if you think about everything else,
it's, it's, it is deserved. First off,

1542
01:32:19,571 --> 01:32:24,571
millions of people play plan there every
Sunday around watching these athletes

1543
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:27,610
and since the industry is
a gold mine for the owners,

1544
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:31,480
the talent gets paid a pretty
fair portion. Secondly,

1545
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,130
virtually every man in America has
played organized sports at some point in

1546
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:39,970
their lives. I think it's fair that
you are, if you are the absolute best,

1547
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:42,730
it's something that every man
has tried to do in their lives.

1548
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:43,600
You should get paid.

1549
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:48,430
This isn't the high score and that
arcade game and your favorite pub.

1550
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:53,380
Every man in America has put, put
some quarters in this, in this one.

1551
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:58,330
I don't know. I think some of that left
out or that just read that bad. Anyway,

1552
01:32:58,331 --> 01:32:59,320
so I'm from that,

1553
01:32:59,321 --> 01:33:03,700
it quickly turned into an argument about
the fact that pro women don't get paid

1554
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:07,750
that much, and that's where I
bowed out. I stopped and said,

1555
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:12,310
Oh, you're one of those girls. I'm sorry,

1556
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:15,970
but this conversation never
goes. Well Jesus, dude,

1557
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:18,820
you're totally Batan or for a
fight. I love this guy. Okay. Uh,

1558
01:33:18,821 --> 01:33:23,560
she snapped back and said, no, no, no, no,
no. Say what? You're going to stay now.

1559
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:26,890
Come on. You brought it up. Fucking
thay. She didn't say all that,

1560
01:33:26,891 --> 01:33:31,660
but I know she did. So he goes,
honestly, I tried to avoid
the issue. No, you didn't.

1561
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:35,890
You baited her into it by saying, Oh,
you're one of those girls. I'm sorry,

1562
01:33:35,891 --> 01:33:39,970
but this conversation never
goes. Well, a classic,

1563
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:44,680
what do they call that? We
had your fucking year. You
do the reverse sell. Yeah.

1564
01:33:44,681 --> 01:33:47,200
You don't want a car like this.
Then the, the, the, the, the,

1565
01:33:47,201 --> 01:33:52,030
the guy actually sells it himself. Um,
oh, there's my dog. Cleo, come over here.

1566
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:57,490
Cleo audio. What's going
on? I just picked her up.

1567
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,730
She was staying down at the dog.
He Super Eight. Look at you.

1568
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:05,080
They gave you a little high top fade.
Denya trimmed underneath the belly.

1569
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:08,200
Huh?
What's up buddy?

1570
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:15,610
Little exhale into the
microphone. All right, here we go.

1571
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:21,010
I fucking hate when a dog does that
lick my fucking toe.

1572
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,230
It's weird.
It's creepy fucking moment.

1573
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:26,320
That should not happen between an
animal and a human being. All right,

1574
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:29,890
I'm continuing on. Yes. He basically,
you baited this woman to a fight, dude.

1575
01:34:29,891 --> 01:34:33,130
You know you did. I know you did. And
I love you for it and think it's great.

1576
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:35,350
I love arguing with women like this too.
So anyways,

1577
01:34:35,351 --> 01:34:40,030
let's continue on and I'm not buying
your shit. Honestly. I tried to back out,

1578
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:43,720
but she said, say what you're
going to say. So he goes, honestly,

1579
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:48,670
I tried to avoid the issue. Uh, I did.
I will say that I am a bit of a massage.

1580
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:52,780
A misogynist? Yeah. Okay. Yeah,
Dude. Okay. I had no idea.

1581
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:58,640
Uh, but I know, uh, what not
to get into with feminists. Um,

1582
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:01,010
plus she's my friend's girl.
Uh,

1583
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:04,130
this is getting ugly and you're
drinking just can not end well.

1584
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,310
But she forced me into the
argument after she heard me say,

1585
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:10,430
after she heard me say to my friend,

1586
01:35:10,431 --> 01:35:14,150
why am I arguing with the
girl about sports? Dude,

1587
01:35:14,151 --> 01:35:17,990
you're being totally passive aggressive.
That's hilarious. Let me guess.

1588
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:19,940
You said it like three feet from her ear.

1589
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,060
Why am I arguing with the
girl about sports? I mean,

1590
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:25,820
they don't know shit about
sports. You know? How did
they just make me a sandwich?

1591
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,060
And then they fucking did he come back at
you and you and you act like, you know,

1592
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:33,800
I tried to avoid it. Okay, here we go. So
I began, it began, here's the argument.

1593
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:38,080
Uh, she told me, um, I played
high school, thought Garth,

1594
01:35:38,081 --> 01:35:39,620
I know sports.

1595
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:44,600
This made me snap because she was
bringing up high school credits to me,

1596
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:49,250
which people really don't do around
me. Uh, people don't do that around me,

1597
01:35:49,251 --> 01:35:50,330
I guess for good reason.

1598
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:53,540
In high school I was ranked number one
in the state for three different sports

1599
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:55,310
ranked nationally in football.

1600
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:59,990
I was inducted to the high school football
hall of fame at the age of 21 played

1601
01:35:59,991 --> 01:36:04,130
division one ball on a full scholarship
and was projected to go seventh in the

1602
01:36:04,131 --> 01:36:08,810
draft until I blew me knee out.
I got to ask you a question dude.

1603
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:13,400
Blew me knee out. Are you from
like England? We are playing footy.

1604
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:14,810
We talk in soccer over there.

1605
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:19,120
At this point I thought
you were like maybe that,

1606
01:36:19,121 --> 01:36:23,060
that guy that fucking running back there
that went to buffalo from Ohio state.

1607
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:28,070
Um, no, but he did good. He did go
number one in the first round. Anyone.

1608
01:36:28,071 --> 01:36:30,050
He pretended to talk on
a cell phone to a team,

1609
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:34,580
but he was really talking to his agent.
The fuck was that guy's name. Anyways. Um,

1610
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:38,840
I don't, um, Willis mcgahee. All
right, continue bill. Fine. Um,

1611
01:36:38,841 --> 01:36:42,860
I don't bring this stuff up ever. So
she, uh, she might not have known,

1612
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:46,190
but she baited me and I felt
like putting her in her place.

1613
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:49,610
I was starting to get arrogant
but still making my point.

1614
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:52,520
So you're basically telling her that
you were ranked number one in three

1615
01:36:52,521 --> 01:36:55,130
different sports and you would
have been seventh in the draft,

1616
01:36:55,131 --> 01:36:57,320
but you blow out your knee do it.
I wish I was there to see that.

1617
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:02,330
That's a great one. I bet
that shut her down. Uh,

1618
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:04,490
but she baited me and I felt
like putting her in a place,

1619
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:09,440
I was starting to get arrogant now.
Not you dude, you're down to earth. Um,

1620
01:37:09,441 --> 01:37:13,520
but still making my point of why sports
are such a money grabber. I said,

1621
01:37:13,521 --> 01:37:17,920
over 60,000 people come out
every Saturday to, uh, every,

1622
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:21,590
every over 60,000 people came out every
Saturday to watch what me and my friends

1623
01:37:21,591 --> 01:37:25,640
do athletically. And we weren't even
getting paid. She interrupted with,

1624
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:28,490
I don't care.
Uh,

1625
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,150
then she started talking
about women's soccer against.

1626
01:37:31,151 --> 01:37:35,060
So I interrupted her by saying I
have never played soccer in my life,

1627
01:37:35,061 --> 01:37:38,840
but I can guarantee you that
I am better at it than you are

1628
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:42,321
dude,

1629
01:37:42,321 --> 01:37:46,400
where you blew you like leaning over a
table of coronas pointing in her face at

1630
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:49,910
this, at this point, and are
you much bigger than her, her,

1631
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:54,800
her fucking boyfriend that he
didn't try to step in? Oh God,

1632
01:37:54,801 --> 01:37:59,340
I wish you fucking made. This would've
been a great youtube video. Um, anyways.

1633
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:02,580
Now what I meant by that was
I was probably twice as fast,

1634
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:07,530
five times stronger and have enough
natural coordination to pick up soccer and

1635
01:38:07,531 --> 01:38:12,000
be as good, if not better at it than you,
because I'm a pretty high level athlete.

1636
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:17,250
What she heard was all men are better
at sports than ever than every woman.

1637
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,960
She got emotional,

1638
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:23,580
but her anger held back the tears
while I was just trying to figure out,

1639
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,820
while I was just trying to figure out
how the conversation got to this point.

1640
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,790
Well, if you want to figure
out how it got to that point,

1641
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:33,480
let's start with your opening line of
like, oh, you're one of those women,

1642
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:38,070
I know enough not to get into Oregon with
the, with the fucking woman. Like you,

1643
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:42,300
you know, come on dude.
You baited her into it.

1644
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:46,890
You baited her into what you wanted
to have the argument because you love

1645
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:52,080
yelling at women. And I relate.
I'm not judging you. Um, you know,

1646
01:38:52,081 --> 01:38:55,380
it's not like you're on people magazine
holding up the woman that you were

1647
01:38:55,381 --> 01:39:00,240
yelling at, cause you just adopted
her like Sandra Bullock liquid. I did.

1648
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:04,020
Oh, Thong. Yay.

1649
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:09,520
Um, she got emotional, but our anger
will held back on, tears it up a Da.

1650
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:14,220
Finally my friends stepped in
and I settled down. Uh, she just,

1651
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,930
she got silent for a bit,

1652
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,100
but she sparked back up when
I brought up ed hardy shirts,

1653
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:23,160
the ones that are so colorful
and bedazzled and Warren,

1654
01:39:23,161 --> 01:39:27,240
a couple of sizes too small by
dudes. Uh, she said, I don't got,

1655
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:30,930
I don't get why guys wear stuff like that.
Girls don't like girls don't like it.

1656
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:36,060
I came back as I came
back and said as before,

1657
01:39:36,061 --> 01:39:40,830
I agree that the shirts are dumb,
but girls actually do love that shit dude.

1658
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:44,190
You just love fucking pissing off women.
That's what you do.

1659
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,700
You're just arguing with this
woman on every fucking point.

1660
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:50,640
That's what you're doing.
Um,

1661
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:55,470
and I think it's fucking hilarious
cause I've done this. I am this guy.

1662
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,700
Did I write this? That I get drunk and
send myself a fucking email anyways,

1663
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,550
she replied with,

1664
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:04,140
are you going to tell me that you
know more about girls than I do too?

1665
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:10,080
Then I do also basically he said to
which I said yes and he finally admits,

1666
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:15,090
I think I was trying to fight at this
point. We were on bottles seven of wine.

1667
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:20,490
Uh, I said, you obviously know more
about what it's like to be a woman.

1668
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:23,610
I'm sorry,
my screen just went blank.

1669
01:40:23,611 --> 01:40:26,400
You obviously know what moral it's
like to be a woman than me. Yeah.

1670
01:40:26,401 --> 01:40:30,660
But figuring out what girls want
in a man is our job as guys,

1671
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:33,390
since I was 14 I've
been studying this shit.

1672
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,720
I spent more time learning about
girls in college than I did about my,

1673
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:40,140
about my degree. Uh, she
made some more dumb points,

1674
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,810
mostly just angry at me saying,
well,

1675
01:40:42,811 --> 01:40:47,760
I don't like the shirts and I'm an
I'm a girl. So there you go. Anyways,

1676
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:51,930
uh, you know how when you're
drunk you get better at arguing,

1677
01:40:51,931 --> 01:40:55,340
but Merce worse at, uh,
coming up with solid points.

1678
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:58,970
I couldn't think of how to explain
this to her, but a classic bill,

1679
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:03,050
Bill Burr Line came into my head.
I told her, you don't get it.

1680
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:07,460
Men literally have to develop a
skill to get women to like them.

1681
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:12,950
Uh, and then he writes, which
is a great line by the way,

1682
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:17,870
but I may have taken it too far and he
goes on to say it's not love at first

1683
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:20,540
sight and all that soulmate shit.

1684
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:24,720
Men have to purposely take
steps to get you separate the,

1685
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:28,040
to separate yourself from the crowd.
The feelings part,

1686
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:30,920
the feelings part might
be out of your hands.

1687
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:36,110
But to set up those things is an easy,
unless you're wearing some sparkly shirt.

1688
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:40,220
Most of my closest friends wear
those shirts and trust me it works.

1689
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:43,210
I'm not saying you're stupid. Uh, I may,

1690
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:47,300
I may have said that part a little
sarcastically course she wore. Um,

1691
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,910
but let's pretend that me
and my friends have only s.

1692
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,320
Let's pretend that me and my friends
have only slept with 50 girls each.

1693
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:59,270
That means I've partly
personally witnessed why over
300 girls have slept with

1694
01:41:59,271 --> 01:42:02,720
guys plus add up all the times.
We all stuck.

1695
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:06,410
We all struck out and why I
think I'm pretty experienced.

1696
01:42:06,411 --> 01:42:09,950
And knowing what girls like,
uh, how many girls have,

1697
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:13,790
have you convinced to fuck you?
Um, this is when she cried.

1698
01:42:13,791 --> 01:42:15,770
What I didn't know was
she used to be a lesbian.

1699
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:23,720
She quit being a lesbian to be with my
friend and she is sensitive about it.

1700
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,600
Yeah. I would think she
would be sensitive about it.

1701
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:29,810
Considering you can't quit
being a lesbian, you either
are one or you aren't one.

1702
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:35,630
Yeah. You know, I kind of blew a couple of
guys, but I quit. Yeah, I didn't like it.

1703
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:40,490
Made me paranoid. Went back
to bed. Giannis um, anyways,

1704
01:42:40,491 --> 01:42:43,280
he said I became the I at that
point I became the asshole.

1705
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,530
I left the bar thinking two things.
One,

1706
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:49,970
why did half the shit I said come
out with a Boston fucking accent.

1707
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:55,100
And after realizing this, uh, after
realizing the reason why I thought, fuck,

1708
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:58,160
I got to stop listening
to the Goddamn podcast.

1709
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:02,270
Can you believe this fucking guy?
I mean,

1710
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:06,710
there must have been 22 off ramps he
could have taken as that thing developed

1711
01:43:06,711 --> 01:43:10,520
into a major fight.
And he chose to stay on the highway.

1712
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:16,100
And then in the end he comes around
and he tries to fucking blame me. Dude.

1713
01:43:16,101 --> 01:43:20,270
The reason why you listened to this
podcast is because you just like me now

1714
01:43:20,271 --> 01:43:21,500
because I've created

1715
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:26,870
inside of you. All right, the
fuck dude, come on, admit it.

1716
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,370
You like doing it. I liked
doing it. I love a women go
in there and they, and they,

1717
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:35,360
and they make some stupid fucking
statement. I love at that point.

1718
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:40,720
I love trashing them because so many
guys just stand there and they just stay.

1719
01:43:40,971 --> 01:43:45,971
They just sit there and agree and they
let them say stupid fucking things with

1720
01:43:45,981 --> 01:43:50,060
no points behind it because they're,
they're still in that adolescent.

1721
01:43:50,061 --> 01:43:53,720
Keep it happy. It'll fuck
me. And it gets annoying.

1722
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:57,830
And you just sit there and you watch
one guy after another getting played for

1723
01:43:57,831 --> 01:44:01,840
free fucking drinks, you
know, Carrie and shit forum,

1724
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:05,990
helping them to move and it makes you
fucking annoyed after awhile makes you

1725
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:07,900
annoyed.
But uh,

1726
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:11,150
then then what you do is you get involved
in shit like that and you absolutely

1727
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,730
barium. Let me ask you
this dude, how many times,

1728
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:17,690
how many times have you fucking
standing up pointing at her? Huh?

1729
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:21,790
Be Honest. You know, you
even alluded to it yourself.

1730
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:24,400
Were you just sitting there going like,
maybe I said that a little sarcastically.

1731
01:44:24,401 --> 01:44:27,760
Of course you did. Of
course you did. You know,

1732
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,500
whatever. Do you know you, you fucking
year you got issues with women? Sort of.

1733
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:36,530
Why welcome. Welcome. Fucking join
the Goddamn club. Don't blame me.

1734
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:38,510
Don't fucking blame me.

1735
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:42,310
Go find out where the meeting is and
then tell me where I can go with like a

1736
01:44:42,311 --> 01:44:47,300
couple of guys with, with drinking
problems. So if you find out, uh,

1737
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:48,583
okay.

1738
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:50,900
I don't even think what
you did was that bad.

1739
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:54,980
I don't think it justifies
fucking crying either.

1740
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:56,930
I think that whole thing is annoying.
You know what?

1741
01:44:56,931 --> 01:44:59,840
I'm going to stop this podcast here
because it's already been over a fucking

1742
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,980
hour.
And I know by the end of this,

1743
01:45:00,981 --> 01:45:02,450
I'm gonna end up agreeing
with this fucking guy,

1744
01:45:02,451 --> 01:45:05,720
which I don't want to do
because this guy is me.

1745
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:10,730
I'd say about 18 months ago, I've actually
made some strides. Haven't I? Cleo?

1746
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:14,900
Right? I got a female dog, didn't
I? I got a bitch laying at my feet.

1747
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:21,460
All right, whatever. There you
go. Another jetlag podcast.

1748
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:24,110
Everybody congratulations
to Philadelphia flyers.

1749
01:45:24,111 --> 01:45:25,520
I'm fucking polling for you guys.

1750
01:45:25,521 --> 01:45:29,060
It would be great to see you guys win
a championship or even the fucking, uh,

1751
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:31,910
eastern conference finals.
God knows you'd be,

1752
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:37,090
you'd be more better behaved in those
assholes up in Montreal who burned down

1753
01:45:37,371 --> 01:45:39,290
their fucking city every time they win.

1754
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:42,290
And then they look down on
us because we're fat fucks.

1755
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,430
At least we don't like shit on fire.
You fucking pyromaniac.

1756
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,870
Granted we dealt because so,

1757
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:52,530
so many of us are so flammable because
of all that fucking Lard we have inside.

1758
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:55,910
I'm going on with that
man with a fat joke.

1759
01:45:55,911 --> 01:45:59,450
I like that people get hurt this
week. All right. That's the podcast.

1760
01:45:59,451 --> 01:46:02,180
God bless all the Ia and I will,
uh, I'll talk to you next week.

1761
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:41,720
[inaudible]

1762
01:49:22,270 --> 01:49:23,103
okay.

1763
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:53,640
Hmm.
