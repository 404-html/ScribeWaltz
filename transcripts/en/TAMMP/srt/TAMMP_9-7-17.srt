1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,323
Hello.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,190
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,750
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Dan,

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,780
I'm just checking in on you. Okay,
so you know your week's going.

5
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:20,390
How are you guys doing?
I am in a great mode.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,410
I'm in an awesome mood. Ah, you in a
bad mood. You driving in your car there,

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,500
you stuck in traffic.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,560
Is this some Dosha in front of you
not doing what you want them to do?

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,610
Oh, you haven't? Little dictated thoughts.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,120
Thinking about what you
would do if you are in power,

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,490
what you would do with this person,
what rule you would implement. You know,

12
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,170
it's gotta be awesome being a dictator,
you know what I mean?

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,810
How much fun is it on the 4th
of July to shoot off fireworks?

14
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,350
Can you imagine how much fun that
fatty over North Korea's haven't?

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,680
You know how hard did they fucking laugh
when they shot that one over Japan?

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,780
I mean, Jesus Christ, we had a fuck dude.
Everybody had to go to bed after that.

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,720
Then he's just laying in bed,
so fucking amped up like a kid.

18
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:07,910
Believe we just did tell me.
I know it's crazy.

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,680
We just freaked out a whole country.
Okay. Calling each other up,

20
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,650
dude. The whole world's
talking about us, man.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,270
What a fucking lunatic.

22
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,800
What if there was a malfunction
on that fucking thing in it?

23
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:29,150
Any do you just landed? That
guy is, I'm telling you man,

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,190
he's got to lay off the fucking sweet.
All that sugar is just cs.

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,380
There's not fucking,
it's not doing them good.

26
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,830
He's not making sound decisions.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,800
Thank God we have such a
level headed guy on our side.

28
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,060
Oh my God.
You know,

29
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,980
watching the dead zone was always scary.

30
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,050
Watching the Martin Sheen
character get into power,

31
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:59,051
but I think to go back and watch it now
is going to be just picture and Donald

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,291
Trump go on.

33
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,110
The birds are away gentlemen and doing
that little thing he does where he puts

34
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,950
his index finger and his thumb together
and this other three fingers are in the

35
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,180
air.
The birds of the way,

36
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,770
the greatest birds ever. Um, yeah.

37
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:14,371
Jesus Christ.

38
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:17,610
All this fucking end the day shit
talking about these goddamn tornadoes one

39
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:21,450
after another. You know, like some
battle royal of fucking weather.

40
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,880
I did Rogan show last night.

41
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,730
There's nothing worst than hanging out
with somebody who's fucking informed.

42
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,190
He starts Salmat instinct was
forming out over the Atlantic.

43
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:33,030
They'd never seen anything like this.
This is the size of fucking Florida.

44
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,060
Hey Bill,
how much time do you want to do tonight?

45
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,450
I was in a fucking panic. He was like
laughing at me. Go look at Bill's face.

46
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:47,080
Look at Bill's face. It's like, Joe, what
look am I supposed to have on my face?

47
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,750
When you basically said,
you know everything,

48
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:53,260
you had everything but Jesus fucking
crowd surfing in on that fucking thing.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,460
Not to mention, I'm going to miss
ship in Alabama this weekend. Okay,

50
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,920
Mississippi, Alabama. The harder the FCC,

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,130
I'm gonna tell you something right now
is a fucking northern white boy. Yanky.

52
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:09,100
I fucking love Mississippi and Alabama.

53
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,790
I love that whole fucking structure.
The south,

54
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,060
how they all shit on each other and
then it's somehow lands in Louisiana.

55
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:21,040
Louisiana's lap, right? You're in Georgia
and all they do is make fun, Alabama,

56
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,380
right? Alabama's like, Fuck Georgia. Hey,

57
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:25,910
at least we're not Mississippi
and Mississippi. So like, go,

58
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:30,760
what the fuck do you want from us?
Ah, why don't you go to Shreveport?

59
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,550
Tell me how you fucking enjoy that.
What's going on there?

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,320
It's free there and I couldn't no
catfish. Um, I love it down there.

61
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:41,380
Granted I'm fucking white. You don't even
have to Klan started marching, you know,

62
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,210
and I got all fucking nervous. I could
fake my way through it. You know,

63
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:46,660
give him a nod.
You don't slip into a store real quick.

64
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,700
Um, anyways, I don't know if I
mentioned this the other day. Um,

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,770
I started playing catch again. You know,
something I used to do as a kid. Good,

66
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:03,940
clean, fun. You just need a glove of
ball in a friend, maybe a baseball kid,

67
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,730
baseball kid baseball. He had. Um,

68
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,810
and it's just been a good time.
This is how old I am.

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,620
I did 45 minutes a catio and
I can say I didn't stretch.

70
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,650
I thought I stretched and I went out there
and a old Billy fucking old face does

71
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:23,550
not have the range of motion
he used to have. And, um,

72
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,230
my buddy through the ball and it bounced
in front of me and it just sorta was

73
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:30,340
skidding along the ground and I bent
down to get it and anticipating it was

74
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:30,860
going to hop on.

75
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,160
I don't know what I was doing or I just
didn't get down far enough and went

76
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:37,360
right by my glove and hit right
and my left ghost white calf.

77
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,190
And um,

78
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,270
it only hurt as much as it
should of heard like a baseball.

79
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,850
However fast it was traveling
and he hit the ground,

80
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:49,540
it's slowed down a little bit me then.
Nice sound against my alabaster shit.

81
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,710
Right then I thought I was fine
and within like three throws,

82
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,770
my calf just fucking tightened up.
Like you couldn't believe.

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,090
And for like the last three days,
it's felt like it's on fire.

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,580
Right?
Like if you thought of my,

85
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,410
like if they were going to
do a documentary on my calf,

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,180
they would go to van Halen one and they
would take that clip from David Lee Roth

87
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,590
singing, I'm on fire. Um,
it's been fucking killing me.

88
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,270
So, uh, I got to have a, I don't know,

89
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:24,010
I'm going to have somebody
fucking work it out, but, uh,

90
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:28,150
my buddy gave me this shit.
This is a free advertisement.

91
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,950
This is how fucking good these guys are.

92
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,320
It's called a aren't a care gel.
They ever heard of this stuff. It's,

93
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,900
it's homeopathic.
What'd you call me?

94
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,060
Homeopathic medicine aren't a care,

95
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,910
it's for muscle pain and stiffness.
Swelling from injuries and bruising.

96
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,470
I get pain relief. This shit, I'm
telling you, it's fucking magic.

97
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,000
I put this stuff on, I felt like
I was bionic, you know, like,

98
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,020
like in that you could just fix
me like a machine. One of those,

99
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:04,070
one of those fucking Moonraker movies,
blade runner, whatever the fuck it is.

100
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,920
Like they would just open my cabinet and
it looked like the inside of a fucking

101
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:11,420
mix. I just felt like that they just, that
thing just soldered a couple of wires,

102
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,070
wires to get. I mean, it
didn't cure me. I mean,

103
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:17,030
I definitely feel like now I just feel
like I got hit with a golf ball rather

104
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:17,864
than a baseball.

105
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,703
MMM.

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,820
You know, at the end of a drive,
I'm not saying right off the tee,

107
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:26,060
let's not get crazy here. Okay,
let's not get crazy. So anyways,

108
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,830
that's the free thing.
I'll tell you right now,

109
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:31,490
if you fucking ever do something before
you go to a masseuse and haven't fucking

110
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,510
unglue your muscles and get all
that Schmutz out of there is my,

111
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:39,230
a person says, ah, Arna Care Gel a.

112
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,530
R.
N.

113
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,420
I Care Arnie care like Arnold Palmer,
except it's I a r.

114
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:52,220
N. I. L. I. A. R. N. I. E. Right?
Yeah. Why don't you confuse to people?

115
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:56,030
So he goes, I had to do some free massage
because I lost another advertiser.

116
00:06:56,031 --> 00:07:00,890
I can't believe it. I put my fucking
heart and soul into these fucking reads.

117
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,380
You know, I could go monotone.
I can just read what they wrote.

118
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:08,680
Okay.

119
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,680
I could just go with it. But you're
not going to listen. And I know this

120
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,830
show must go on even if I'm
reading fucking advertising.

121
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,260
But those fucking console over there,
the most those people,

122
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:25,390
that was a one and done.

123
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,680
Yeah.

124
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,780
How dare you bring up hand jobs that
at the end of the massage rates,

125
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,410
what the fuck are you talking about?

126
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,510
That's a huge part of your industry.
Either you're doing it, oh,

127
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:40,610
you're not doing it

128
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,120
the fuck.

129
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,430
It's like your year in food.
You're selling some sort of food.

130
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,400
Now bring up trans fat,
like that's not a big fucking issue.

131
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,720
That is a hot button issue.
That dead is dead.

132
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:59,230
That needs to be brought up in front
of Congress. When I, I stand by that.

133
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,630
If you could legalize
weed at a state level,

134
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,710
you should be able to legalize a
hand job at the state level. Okay.

135
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,980
Now if the feds come in and she's got
your Dick in her hand, you're Ron,

136
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:14,760
you're wrong. All right. You're
on your fucking own. You Joe.

137
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,640
Pesci in good fellas out.
No. Right. That's it.

138
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,120
Yeah,

139
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,840
that's it. All right ladies.
It does it mean anything to us.

140
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,980
It doesn't mean anything.

141
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:27,740
If you ever saw the look on the woman's
face when she's doing it, I mean,

142
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,610
I swear to God.

143
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,170
Okay.

144
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,080
I swear to God, like it's just like
she's, she, I don't know what she did.

145
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,790
Thinking of fucking zillion other things,

146
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,290
which is probably usually where you
got this part of your safe place,

147
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:42,560
you know when you're fucking
employed in the sex industry. Um,

148
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,160
I don't know what the fuck to
tell you. I know it's tight. So,

149
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:48,400
because I brought that up, which was
funny enough to make people listen,

150
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,570
they walked away from all the fucking
massages that my listeners would have got.

151
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,200
Okay.

152
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,370
Now I'm not going to lie to a third
of them would have been expecting

153
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,120
some sort of a hand release at the end
of it. So maybe, maybe that's okay.

154
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,220
I'll take that. Okay. I will. I will
take that part of it. All right.

155
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,140
What I'm getting tired of these deeds,
deed, the blue aprons, the nature boxes,

156
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,500
you know,

157
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,230
they're all good when the sun's out
and the second they see a little bit of

158
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:14,930
rough water.
Okay.

159
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,680
What do they do? They fucking
pull up stakes. It was
fucking phony bastards. Okay.

160
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,460
And they take their aprons and they're
fucking twats and they go to somebody

161
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,740
else's podcast. And I'll tell you
right now, I've had enough of it.

162
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,050
My,
my gosh darn just over here.

163
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,080
Okay.

164
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,530
To try and put a little bit of
money in your pocket. You know,

165
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,280
how many people do you think
at that fucking massage place?

166
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,890
I've actually gone to a massage parlor
and gotten fucking jerked off. How many,

167
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,780
you know what I mean? Fucking out. She's
done it. Don't get me fucking start.

168
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,850
You know, I got in the, Oh my
dogs back in town called Clio.

169
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,140
He's back in town. I just saw
her, she fucking freaked out.

170
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,920
We had a nice little battle royal.
I took over this awesome fucking hike.

171
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,490
Love that God damn dog. And I love
that. She's got a great family now.

172
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:07,300
Family Big East. And uh, she
put it on a little bit awake.

173
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,380
He's new people there. They're raw.
They're treating her right. Um,

174
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,390
but she looked awesome and, uh, same
old dog dragging me down the street,

175
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:19,210
all frigging excited and that
type of stuff. So, uh, it's out.

176
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:21,690
It all worked out nice,
happy in,

177
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:25,030
and she's got a little more white
whiskers around her muzzle, you know,

178
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,210
becoming very distinguished and stately.

179
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,180
These last couple of a in
the last, I don't know, it
gave away almost a year ago.

180
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,390
It's fucking unbelievable. Nine months
ago, 10 months ago, nine months ago,

181
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,860
nine months ago. Um, so it was great
to see you and everything. So, uh,

182
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,530
she's in town for like 10 days.
I'm leaving for a couple of days,

183
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:45,870
but that's what I do when she comes to
town. It take for a hike every morning.

184
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,770
It's kind of been working out. I get to
see her every couple of months, you know,

185
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,820
she's not around where she can eat
my baby or attack somebody else,

186
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,880
so she'll never get put down and I
won't have to deal with an unbelievable

187
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,160
amount of guilt. And she's got a
great house and she's, you know,

188
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:04,080
she's fattened up. It's fucking perfect.
I love it. She's not fat people.

189
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm just saying she is
living a good life of energy.

190
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:11,220
Still a ball of muscle though.
Good Lord. That's a strong dog.

191
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,840
Okay.

192
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,710
Um, I still miss the hell out of her,
but I definitely made the right decision.

193
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,690
So anyways, um, what's going on
tonight? Oh, the Patriots yet that,

194
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:25,110
that dad, Buddha, Buddha,
good to do. Good to

195
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,810
ignore your fucking wife.

196
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,160
Football season is back bay.
Ignore the arcade.

197
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:44,010
Sorry. Just blow it. Years. Ignore the
hurricanes. Ignore all fatty up there.

198
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:47,090
Fucking doesn't it fucking guy in
North Korea. They look like he,

199
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:51,150
he's a same shape as like curly from
the fucking three stooges. You know,

200
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:55,960
I'd love to see me. They just reshot
the old football sketch. You know?

201
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,680
Can somebody please do that just for the
sort of Photoshop and do in that thing.

202
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,110
Does that run an employee singer?
All Rah Rah doing that whole thing.

203
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,490
Just put his head on Curley's
fucking body. It's what he's,

204
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,710
he's Kim Jong Howard.

205
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,870
Uh, how many times would I be put
to death in that fucking country?

206
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:23,370
I can't even fucking imagine.
I can't even imagine. You know,

207
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,560
you got to go out swinging. You got to
go out like a fucking, you know, Gino,

208
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,090
I'm not, I, you know, sit
down was a fucking brutal guy.

209
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:32,430
But did you see how that guy went out?
He was standing there.

210
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,790
He's just staring them all in the eye.
They put the rope around his neck.

211
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,030
He's still talking shit. Yeah, go
fuck yourself. Go Fuck Yourself.

212
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,660
You know it's fucking any people always
talk about, dude, when you were in Philly,

213
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,690
how did you handle? They're fucked, Dan.
We'll know when we would sit down handled.

214
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,600
He was talking Shit, right? Until
they fucking Yank that rope. Oh,

215
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:55,200
that lever or whatever. I would've
been crying like a little girl. Go on.

216
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,650
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll sweep the streets.

217
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,790
That's how I would have gone out,

218
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,330
gone into the next world and God
would have just been looking at me,

219
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:09,450
shaking his head, you know, of all
the awful fucking things you did.

220
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:13,410
I think you're bitchy way you left
was the worst. Get Out of my sight.

221
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:15,510
And then they just pushes the
button and go down to health.

222
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,520
I go down a hill and a burn forever.

223
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,470
And that's a good fucking thing to bring
up when you got two gigs coming up,

224
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:27,000
Mississippi and Alabama, I'm gonna
tell you, go down my CVL Bam.

225
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:30,450
Lynn's mother fuckers ain't got
computers yet. They ain't got computers.

226
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:33,700
But I'll tell you, they still eat.
They'll still leading. I don't tell you.

227
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,970
Give him some clothes line and they'll
catch catfish. He and dry your overalls,

228
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,490
mother fuckers.
They can live off the land.

229
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,140
You know, if, um, what Rogan was
telling me was even remotely true,

230
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,630
him and Jimmy Dora are the
two most informed fucking
comedians I know as far as

231
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:55,080
they actually pay attention to shit.
Somebody says some shit.

232
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,950
And rather than just taking it as truth,
they actually will fucking research it.

233
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:03,690
They'll have guests on their show. I
cannot recommend their podcasts. And, uh,

234
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,380
his bar Joe's podcast and uh,
um,

235
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,440
Jimmy doors youtube show highly enough.

236
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,330
And you don't always have
to fucking agree with them.

237
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,670
But I'm telling you right now,
I want to tell you something right now.

238
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,300
If you fucking watch and see it.
And if you're watching Fox News and Shit,

239
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:20,850
I mean that's, you know, those
people. Okay, I'm going to, you know,

240
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,400
no offense to other comedians,

241
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,770
but they're definitely more well
spoken than a lot of us. But you know,

242
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,250
I'm just saying there is
a whole, uh, you know,

243
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,830
just look at how they read the
ads on those channels and then,

244
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:36,670
you know exactly like that.
They're, they're, they're,

245
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,360
they're stuck between the
lines. May, I don't know what
I'm talking about them. Um,

246
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,870
uh, fuck that reminded me of something now
I just forgot it. What the hell was it?

247
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,190
Something I wanted to talk about.
Not News,

248
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,930
not be in between the lines
a fucking, it's over. Um,

249
00:14:55,931 --> 00:15:00,700
so anyways, I am going to, uh, one of my
favorite things and I don't have a lot of,

250
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,490
I don't have any favorite things in
Mississippi yet cause I've only been there

251
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:04,810
one time,
two times.

252
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
One time I was driving up to the airport
after I watched the Patriots beat the

253
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:11,980
rams and the super bowl and I just
couldn't get a flight into fucking New

254
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,900
Orleans. So we drove, we flew in and out
of fucking, uh, what does it, Baton Rouge,

255
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:21,560
Mississippi. I'm kidding.
Um, Jackson, Jackson,

256
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:25,950
Mississippi. And um, and then I
did a gig there a few years ago.

257
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,990
Um, so, ah, I don't know a
lot about it, but Alabama,

258
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,760
Alabama. I'll tell you something. What
I love about Alabama, I loved the, uh,

259
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,420
first of all, the fucking, I'm going to
the Alabama game, by the way, on Saturday.

260
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,210
It's an afternoon game against mighty,
Mighty Fresno state.

261
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:51,070
They could surprise some people.
Um, so I'm going to go there.

262
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:53,140
I'm not going to be a cunt
in root against Alabama.

263
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:57,460
I really don't hate the crimson tide.
It's just that they are the fucking,

264
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,330
the Yankees or the Patriots. So, you know,
they're the ones that always fucking,

265
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:05,920
you know, uh, winning, right?
So, uh, we'll Yankees, you know,

266
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,520
they, they want enough, even
though they haven't won since 2009,

267
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:12,930
so there's still the fucking Yankee. So
sitting on 27, you know what I mean? Um,

268
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,340
okay.

269
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,520
I just couldn't become a college fan
and jump on their bandwagon. Like,

270
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:20,760
if I was watching the NFL, I would
fucking root against the Patriots to,

271
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,620
that's what you do. If you, if you just
what you do, it's what you do, you know,

272
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:31,260
just jump on the fucking big bandwagon.
I'm like Roger Clemens,

273
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:35,400
when he joined the Yankees after
they'd already one fucking three. Um,

274
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:36,890
okay.

275
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,390
I would say Yah.

276
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:39,970
Yeah,

277
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,430
yeah. That's, that's how, that's why I
root against them. So when I go there,

278
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:44,530
I'm not going to be a cop.
I'm going to root for Alabama.

279
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,790
But there is a major part of me that
wants to bet Fresno state and just start

280
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,060
the game up. Like, you
know, it's 57 to nothing,

281
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,100
but you know what it is.

282
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,730
Nick Saban has an intensity
slash anchor slash in ability.

283
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:06,840
I'm telling you to drown a puppy that I,

284
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:10,300
I just know that even as second string,
it's just going to keep, you know,

285
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:13,540
running up the points because they
don't want to deal with it and practice,

286
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:14,891
you know,

287
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:19,300
that they didn't score another fucking
30 points against Fresno's number one,

288
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:22,660
I don't know anything about Fresno state.
I'm not trying to disrespect Fresno.

289
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,153
Okay.

290
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,440
Okay.

291
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,910
Now, if you're like me and you watch any
sort of basic cable stuff about gangs or

292
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:32,460
prisons or anything, they
always, it's a, you know,

293
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:36,290
the second they start one of those shows,
you can literally turn over an hour.

294
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,540
Glass is sand and it's not getting me to
get halfway through before they end up

295
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:43,350
in Fresno. And then there's
always that guy, you know,

296
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,670
with the Bandana all the way up to
under resides Bandana on his head.

297
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:51,450
And then the dark sunglasses,
they have his voice, altered
names. Look, girl, birth,

298
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,920
normal burden of care.
Pretty aware of the more vocal booth.

299
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,620
We'll go for the real mobile. You can't
understand a word they're saying, right?

300
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,200
Not because my urge would cove. Um,
so I'm not trying to fuck with Fresno.

301
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,611
All right?

302
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:16,611
Everybody knows that fucking stretch
between La and San Francisco.

303
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,010
You don't know what the
fuck goes on out there,

304
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,050
Charlie Manson lives somewhere up there.
All right. There's a nice national park.

305
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,060
There's a bunch of people growing
food. But other than that, you know,

306
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,360
I don't know what goes on
other than it's really hot.

307
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,980
And a lot of people grew up career board
from Europe. So I don't have any fun,

308
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,940
not trying to fucking shit on Fresno.
Okay.

309
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,380
I'm just a praise pasty freckled guy
trying to go to a football game. So I'm,

310
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,410
I'm working with del Rey
and fucking Joe Bart,

311
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:49,500
nick the Rosebowl tailgate legend and a,

312
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:53,790
we're doing a Gig at some casino in a
missed ship and then were in Alabama.

313
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,900
And when I go to Alabama,

314
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,150
I got a place that I liked to eat every
time I go there. First Time I went there,

315
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:02,340
a fan came. Remember how I found out
by buying gold, their bug type saws.

316
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,690
Barbecue started stands
for smart ass Wilson's.

317
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,120
I always go there.
They have a Manet's based barbecue sauce.

318
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:15,810
Swear to God. It's white. You're like,
there's no way that's going to taste good.

319
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:19,140
You eat it. You're like, Jesus,
that's fucking delicious.

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,230
Jesus Christ. Is that delicious?
So, um, that's a good time.

321
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,870
I'm actually thinking of
coming back again next year.

322
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,380
I'm going to do quick kick here and
then I think I'm going to come back next

323
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,410
year,

324
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,080
do a little bit of a bigger show and
next year I'm going to go to Talladega.

325
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,880
I went to Daytona 500 I'm going to go
Talladega next. I got to go to that man.

326
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,300
I used to always watch that with
hair game, you know, scold that car.

327
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,500
Cale Yarborough I'm fucking uh,
what's his fade? Rusty Wallace.

328
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,620
Daryl Hall trip.
Who else was fucking running back then?

329
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,770
Richard Petty was winding down.
I told you that.

330
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:57,630
I used to buy all the fucking model cars.

331
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,330
I build them and put the
stickers on them and shit.

332
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:03,420
I used to always skip the engine because
they just wanted to get to the fucking

333
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,570
car part and I wouldn't let it dry
and it wouldn't let the paint dry.

334
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:09,240
I was just too fucking,
they always came out like shit.

335
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:14,010
There was glue all over the place because
I was just too impatient, you know?

336
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,450
I wish I could buy one of those models
again and actually just take the time to

337
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:22,260
see if I could do it right.
Like the people who really did it right,

338
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:26,940
they would paint all the parts before
they even took it off that plastic grid

339
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:30,960
and they would let it dry for like a day.

340
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,380
And then they would just slowly put
the whole fucking thing together.

341
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:38,610
And it was a fucking work of that. I
would never do that. I was all, you know,

342
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,090
you know as the worst was
when you remembered the
decals and he'd soak them in

343
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,630
the warm water, then they'd all start
coming off and you were like fuck.

344
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:46,800
And they would roll up and you,

345
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,920
they all look like shit and they'd be
put on lead like an angle, you know?

346
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,750
Then he, then he had like
the older guys, right?

347
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,390
And they had a little thing like
pair of tweezers. All right.

348
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,620
They'd have a pair of tweezers
and that little fucking, you know,

349
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,150
judo jeweler glasses on and they
put it on there. Look, unbelievable.

350
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,860
And I always wish I had the
patience to do that. And I don't.

351
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,000
And that's why standup comedy spend the
only thing that was ever good at this

352
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:18,001
because it is just going up there
and just fucking letting you add go.

353
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,080
And I kind of learned something this week
within in my a frustrating way trying

354
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,180
to learn drums and it's just like to do,

355
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:28,900
you have to fucking sit down and
if you want to learn something,

356
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,640
you have to take a big breath,

357
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,390
you have to relax and you
have to start really slow.

358
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,740
And I've known this for fucking years,
I've seen everybody talk about it.

359
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:43,540
Some of the most monster players ever
talk about how slow they start a new idea.

360
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,100
But the whole thing is,

361
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,490
you know with all this information
on the Internet you can be like,

362
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:50,260
well what bpm is,
is this song?

363
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,620
It's 115 and then you just think
[inaudible] going to get it at 10 feet.

364
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:58,621
And so you start playing it like 95 when
you should be like 65 so that's my new

365
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:02,500
shit.
I got to fucking relax.

366
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,120
I got to pick like one or two things
and just stick with that for awhile.

367
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,150
Just like how you would with the model,
right? Just leave those pieces on there.

368
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,550
Paint the fucking thing and walk away.

369
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,060
Just let it dry. So, um, anyways,

370
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:22,240
I know I'm a fucking mess here. I'm all
over. I'm all over the Goddamn map. Uh,

371
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,070
22 minutes of fucking talking shit. All
right, we got six reads here. People,

372
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,470
you know,
these fucking reads like these,

373
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:33,700
these advertises is becoming
like a special forces, you know,

374
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,480
or a fucking some sort of military
operation here. It's like, you know,

375
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,400
most of you will not be
coming back. All right. Um,

376
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,980
private pile infantry. You made it
all right. Draft kings, everybody.

377
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,031
Oh,

378
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:53,710
is this the perfect read for tonight or
what fantasy football season is finally

379
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:58,060
fought Guinea
and there's no better way to,

386
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,000

You don't want to lift.
Knows,

448
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,670
they know that their drivers
are what keeps them moving.

449
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,350
Well that's what the fuck you do.

450
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,390
Okay.

451
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,050
Do you know what Koch knows
if you're thirsty. Uh,

452
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,940
so they do everything they could do to
make sure their drivers are happy on

453
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:47,774
every trip.

454

455
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,900
Lift believes that being a ride share
driver should be fun if you're having a

456
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:59,090
good time.
So are their passengers.

457
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,180
If you're choosing a ride
sharing company to drive for,

458
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,070
go with the company
that treats you better.

459
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:09,071
Lift lift was the first
to offer in APP tipping.

460
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:12,740
When you drive for Lyft,
you keep 100% of the tips.

461
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:16,580
Drivers get paid over $200 million in
tips. Since the feature was introduced,

462
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,410
express pay lets drivers get paid
almost instantly instead of four weeks.

463
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,890
Lyft has even taken the
guesswork out of pickups.

464
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,040
The new amp amp device uses isn't that

of dollars a week plus tips. One,

been easier to give yourself a raise.

467
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,310
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

468
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:47,150
Maybe that's why nine out
of 10 left writers, uh,

469
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,890
get a perfect five star rating.

00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:55,900

I watched an episode of Tj fucking hookah.

531
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,070
The,
I will tell you this right now,

532
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:03,071
the funniest running you will ever see
in your life by William Shatner and his

533
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:08,590
fucking partner.
All they do is their constant.

534
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,370
They always have like a fucking wide
shot and they show TJ hooker running like

535
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,140
he runs for like six seconds every
shot. It's like, why? I would,

536
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,210
you know what it is,
is they had it,

537
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:23,690
they had to fucking do an
hours 22 or I think it would,

538
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:27,620
a full season was back then were like
22 episodes of an hour long show.

539
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:31,250
That's 22 hours of television.
Well, actually with the, uh,

540
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,840
with the commercials, eight
minutes per half hour, 44 minutes,

541
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:40,841
they had to wait 44 minutes
of fucking Shit Times 22.

542
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,780
I mean, it's, it's like
where we came up short again.

543
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,970
We'll just have William
Shatner run a little longer.

544
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,100
Can TJ hooker like run half the length
of a football field before he catches up

545
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:53,870
to somebody a third of his fucking age?

546
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,620
I saw the one, uh, I got to
get this actress name. Um,

547
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,970
he was one of, he was one of my, uh,

548
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,880
one of my favorite actors when I
was growing up. He was in colors.

549
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,640
He was a Latino Dude.
He got hit by a drunk driver.

550
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,300
Unfortunately it was like 37
to 30, 38 years old. Hang on,

551
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:17,690
I've got to get this guy's
name. Uh, let's see. Colors.

552
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,760
I am D B. I didn't know Don
Cheadle was in that movie.

553
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,700
I got to watch that again.
That'd be one of his earliest ones.

554
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:30,590
I am on nightmare walking. Um,
it's something silver, I believe.

555
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,580
Trinidad Silva. So he was
in this episode of, um,

556
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,170
this episode of,
uh,

557
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,680
Tj hooker and it was fucking hilarious
because all of a sudden TJ hooker when

558
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:46,550
he's talking to would throw in some
fucking Latino words and it was only like

559
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:51,210
shit that like a white people
know like cake pastime,

560
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,940
fucking Agua. He said at one point, well
maybe if you stop back to like a polo,

561
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,490
like he threw in like chicken
and it's just like, yeah,

562
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:01,550
that's because the writing staff
ordered El Pollo Loco that day.

563
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,780
But Trinidad Silva, I believe
he was in the jerk. Um,

564
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,570
I think he was in the, well, you know
what, I want to look up his fucking,

565
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,010
this guy was amazing.
He was in Hill street blues.

566
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,640
He was in the jerk.
Yeah.

567
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,730
He actually died during the filming of
a underrated movie by Weird Al Yankovic

568
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:26,780
called UHF. I was in colors. Uh, yeah.

569
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:31,300
Hill street blues stir crazy.
He had such,

570
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:34,910
Amy died so young. Yeah, he was on Barney
Miller. I mean that this guy Lou grant,

571
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,480
the white shadow. The jerk.
Ms Guys. I am DB page Beretta.

572
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,020
Okay.

573
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,950
You know, granted, he played, played a
perp in all of those fucking things here.

574
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:47,320
He's probably fixing games in the white
shadow. That's the way it was back then.

575
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,380
And this guy somehow got through it and
opened the doors for a bunch of other

576
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,840
people. I hadn't seen him in a while.
It was great to see him. Trinidad,

577
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:57,700
silver look them up a 1915 and
1988. Unfortunately, he was, uh,

578
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,590
he was only 38 years old. Jesus
Christ, um, phenomenal actor them. Um,

579
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,720
all right, legal zoom. Last
one here. Legal Zoom. When
you run your own business,

580
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,660
when you know that time equals money,
it's not just an old saying, it's a fact.

581
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:15,340
So why Hawaii?

582
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Her waste your valuable time dealing with
an issue that legal zoom can help you

583
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,990
with. I'm doing this because I'm going
to Mississippi and Alabama this weekend.

584
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,070
You may already know, put your hands in
the air and feel the spirit of Jesus.

585
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,370
They had over 2 million people have
used legal zoom to start their business.

586
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:33,160
But legal zoom services don't end there.

587
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,730
There's a kingdom waiting for you after
your kit. They're fucking website.

588
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,600
Running a business comes with
taxes, contracts, hiring employees,

589
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:45,490
and the devil basically a lot of fine
print and we all know that the devil's in

590
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:46,480
the details.
I'm sorry.

591
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,530
That's why legal zone built a network
of independent attorneys licensed in all

592
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,730
50 states, not in Puerto
Rico, not in our territories,

593
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,760
just the 50 states they can provide the
advice you need to get through the daily

594
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,320
grind of running your business. By
the way, everybody in Puerto Rico,

595
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:05,490
I hope you make it through this storm.
Good Lord.

596
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,530
Good Lord Man.
Okay.

597
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,210
Rogan scared the shit out of
me and I live in fucking la.

598
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,800
I can't imagine what this poor
people doing out there. Uh,

599
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,470
and you don't have to worry about billable
hours since legal zoom isn't a law

600
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:21,920

all right,

607
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:44,360
I think that's the podcast for this week.

608
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:47,960
I'm going to go play some drums and he
barely relaxed. No, actually I'm not.

609
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:50,210
I gotta go write an episode.
Episode three

610
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,160
nine of a

611
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,880
season three of f is for
family were actually this week.

612
00:37:56,881 --> 00:38:00,090
We're working on episode seven
so you not in the business.

613
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,700
The reason why it's called three
Oh nine three means season three.

614
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,020
I never knew what that meant. I finally
figured it out after three seasons.

615
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:07,731
I remember last year,

616
00:38:07,731 --> 00:38:10,020
it's like we're working on two oh four
and I'd be sitting in the back of the

617
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,500
room like we're not on
the 200th fourth episode.

618
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,660
But I knew that sounded
stupid. So I finally just, I
finally just asked, you know,

619
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,870
then he felt it.
I felt all the writers looking at me like,

620
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:26,850
why is this hacky comedian in this
fucking room? You know? And it hurts.

621
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,440
Um, no kidding. My work with great
people in case any of them are listening.

622
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,160
And if you're the one person in
the writers from listening to your,

623
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,460
my favorite writer in the room.
Um,

624
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,590
so I'm writing the episode three Oh nine.
That's what I have to do today.

625
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:42,280
I just do like,

626
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,280
I do two scenes a day and
then I get through the script
and then I do like three

627
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,320
or four passes. I didn't do that last
year, but this year I'm going to do it.

628
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,180
And then,
uh,

629
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,630
I bring it in and then everybody just
guts the thing and maybe like three jokes

630
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:56,411
make it,
but you know,

631
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:59,560
it's all about making that template and
that's the game that everybody fucking

632
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:02,290
place. All right, so that's the podcast.

633
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,640
Let's go pats Dr fucking year off.
Right?

634
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,120
Who's going to step into Edelman shoes
before he comes back for the wonderful

635
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:14,560
playoff run? Okay. I hope it doesn't
come back too soon. You know?

636
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,820
Do you know why Edelman got hurt?

637
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,050
That was the curse of the
nude ESPN magazine issue.

638
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,790
You know what I mean?
I,

639
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,360
I can't remember the last time I laughed
harder than watching him jump through

640
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:29,860
the air, catch a ball and have it over
his junk. Is he through through the year?

641
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:33,610
That was one of the funniest
fucking things I've ever seen.

642
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:37,070
I just don't understand how a woman,
I dunno, maybe, I guess what else?

643
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,280
I just don't understand
how any level that is.

644
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:41,290
Anything other than fucking hilarious.

645
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:47,660
Naked men are just funny. I used to
do a bit, my accent, the naked man is,

646
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:51,040
is one or two things. It's either funny
or scary depending on what's happening.

647
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,240
Like if you're at a game and a naked guy
runs across the fucking field, I mean,

648
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:57,700
you're fucking on the ground laughing.
However,

649
00:39:57,701 --> 00:40:01,630
if you're walking home late at night and
a naked guy jumps out of Bush, like, ah,

650
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,890
that's the scariest fucking
thing you'll ever see, right.

651
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:09,280
I'd rather see a fucking rattlesnake,
you know,

652
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,400
I would rather see that and I'm
terrified of fucking snakes. Okay.

653
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:16,690
Then to have some fucking naked
guy jump out of a fucking Bush. Um,

654
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:21,040
I probably should just given up that
information. All right. Anyways,

655
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,610
dude, let's troll them.
Um, anyways. All right.

656
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:29,250
That's the a the podcast for this
Thursday. Have a great weekend.

657
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,890
You can't enjoy the football game tonight
at the college football this weekend.

658
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,770
Maybe tune into Alabama,
Fresno state. I will be there.

659
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,520
I will be there and thank you to everybody
in shippy and a Alabama for a buying

660
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:45,820
the tickets. I'm going to come out
there with my Yankee Bullshit and uh,

661
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,800
telling you guys once again why
you lost that war. All right.

662
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,491
Enjoy the,
uh,

663
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:55,360
the music here and we're going to have
another half hour of stuff from a classic

664
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:59,710
podcast from a Thursday gone by in a
year that already happened or possibly

665
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:01,830
early this year. I don't
know what it is. All right.

666
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,030
Hey,
what's going on?

667
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:12,840
It's bill burr and this is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

668
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:16,080
September 7th,
2009.

669
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,250
Happy Labor Day.
Happy Labor Day.

670
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:26,030
What are you guys doing today? Huh?
With your big bad days off? Uh,

671
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:30,150
what are you doing? You laying around you
becoming fat fucks. What are you doing?

672
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:35,151
You Barbecue when we're going over

673
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:39,270
barbecue. You want to
come Steven? No, I don't.

674
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,160
I want to fucking drink and
forget that I married you Carol.

675
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,970
I'm sorry. I'm going to fuck, I'm
moving some shit around right now.

676
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:50,040
And this is the Monday
morning called podcast.

677
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:53,610
I'm going to hit cod past podcasts.
I'm actually gonna try to do some, uh,

678
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,870
something different this week because
it's such a special fucking holiday cause

679
00:42:57,871 --> 00:43:01,490
it is Labor Day. Why do
they call Elumelu? Well, no,

680
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,270
I'm sorry. I always have to do a
tribute to fucking eighties comedy.

681
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,170
I'm actually watching a fucking, I watch
too much sports this weekend and I just,

682
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,600
uh,

683
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,390
watching the end of the Colorado Colorado
state football game and right after

684
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:18,210
it, um, I taped best
damn tough man. You know,

685
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:22,200
cause it game always goes longer than
it's a lotted so you have to take the next

686
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:26,460
show, listen to this fucking spazz.
He goes by the name of the coach.

687
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,720
This is the classic example of a scared
guy before a fight and he's trying to

688
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:34,280
turn that fear until like
some sort of fucking, uh,

689
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,210
courage. But it works. This guy goes
by the coach. This is hilarious.

690
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,510
They're actually showing them right now,
he's getting his gloves put on.

691
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:43,500
Listen to this maniac.

692
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,200
I Dunno,
you get to hear that.

693
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,040
But basically you standing there and he
just goes like at showtime and then he

694
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:06,330
just snaps. It's showtime. You
just, you got to, I'm sorry.

695
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,550
I don't even know if this
is even going to translate,

696
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,040
but I gotta I gotta get
the rest of this shit here.

697
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,020
I gotta get the other thing
that he fucking says here.

698
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,440
What the fuck is wrong with this stupid
piece of shit? Fucking God damn cable.

699
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,860
Anybody else have this fucking
problem with your cable?

700
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,443
All right.

701
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:30,870
Did I just delete it? Ah, you
fucking cunt. All right. Whatever.

702
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,860
God Damn it, that was going to be such as,
that was like my big fucking different,

703
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,090
uh, beginning that I was just going to
have there and I just ended up deleting it

704
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:43,770
because my fucking cable sucks. Yeah.
What are you going to do? It's a holiday,

705
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:46,690
right? I shouldn't even
be doing this. So anyway,

706
00:44:46,691 --> 00:44:49,950
so the next time they come to him,
he's screaming some more.

707
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,380
So he goes out there and of course
he doesn't know how to fight.

708
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:56,310
He's flailing or flailing around with
this dude. And in the end, you know,

709
00:44:56,311 --> 00:45:01,260
he gets knocked on his ass and he,
and he loses. So it's the, it's every,

710
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:04,660
basically, every time they show
the guy, he, he would say one,

711
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:09,210
the first little thing he would say
quietly and then he would just completely

712
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:13,470
flip out. I can't fucking believe I,
God, I deleted that. What an asshole.

713
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,270
So whatever. The guy ends up losing in the
end of the fight, he goes, uh, he goes,

714
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:22,320
I'm ready for some more. I ain't even
bleeding yet. And then he just snapped.

715
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,590
Ah, fuck. I don't know what Co,
what sport that guy, coaches.

716
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:33,240
But if I was playing on his team,

717
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:36,330
I would run through a fucking
wall for that guy. You know,

718
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,990
I don't know all the pens. Depends
on your personality, you know,

719
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:44,190
I like maniacs like that. God
dammit. I can't believe that. Fuck.

720
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:46,500
I knew that was going to happen. I
knew it was going to happen. You know,

721
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:49,200
it's the worst.
It was not on every bad enough.

722
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,780
If I had to try and rewind it and get
back to where the hell it was, but then,

723
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,400
then I, it comes up with the delete thing
and accidentally deleted it. I'm sorry.

724
00:45:56,401 --> 00:46:01,380
Everybody. Ah, fuck. Where the hell do
you go from here? Um, it's Labor Day.

725
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,200
Well, what exactly are you
supposed to do on labor day?

726
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,060
Am I supposed to observe something
for all the people who died at work?

727
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,360
Do they have a little parade?
Do you guys like parades?

728
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,860
That was a little pathetic things with
the mediocrely talented people of your

729
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:18,840
town marched down your fucking street.

730
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,920
Isn't that the worst when you come from
a small town? It's just a numbers game.

731
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:25,740
I mean, how many truly fucking
talented people can there be?

732
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,730
But somehow they still have to
put together a band. You know,

733
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:34,380
some chick with braces playing a fucking
flute marching down the street and then

734
00:46:34,381 --> 00:46:36,090
they always end it with
like a fire engine.

735
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,520
Just trying to drown out
your bad local band. My eight

736
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,920
or everybody's singing in monotone,

737
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:46,920
a bunch of dentists and accountants
sitting there with their fucking weird ass

738
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:51,490
looking kids.
God a buck a.

739
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,170
Do they do that today?
Is that what you're supposed to do?

740
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,200
Am I supposed to be dressed up
like it's the revolutionary war?

741
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,680
Reenacting something. I
gotta be honest with you. Uh,

742
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,700
Labor Day feels like every other fucking
day to me because I'm a comedian and

743
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:09,810
I'm always sitting in my underwear
at fucking 12 noon. All right?

744
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:13,230
That's why I do this. Do you think I
want to make you fucking people laugh?

745
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,220
I don't,
I don't.

746
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,900
I just remember when I was 14 sitting in
my underwear eating toast one day on a

747
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:20,160
Saturday morning and I was thinking,

748
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:24,960
would it be fucking great if I
could do this every day? You know,

749
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,650
wake up, watch cartoons,
wrestle with my fucking dog,

750
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,360
you know, and just have absolutely
no responsibility whatsoever.

751
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:36,580
And I got to tell you something.
I made that dream come true.

752
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,560
We get worried when you die. God's
just going to be looking at the video,

753
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:42,460
your life,
you know,

754
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,770
just looking at it then kind of
glancing over at you and just,

755
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,270
just shaking his head. Barely. You
get one shot at this and this was,

756
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:50,104
this is what you did.

757
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:55,600
Do you realize that you spend over 98,000
hours of your life in your underwear?

758
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:59,170
And I'm not even counting when you were
fucking sleeping. Oh, speaking of that,

759
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:03,730
the other day I met him still on,
I'm still sorry.

760
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,150
Nia just walked by laughing at
me like I'm an idiot. I, um,

761
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,070
I'm still on European time.
Um, today was the first day,

762
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,500
actually got up at nine o'clock.
I've basically,

763
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:19,030
I have been when I was over in Sweden.
How did you feel about that?

764
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,530
When I was over in Sweden,
uh, last week, um, Clia,

765
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:27,220
what are you doing?
You stop walking around like a creep.

766
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,660
My dog is like most big
dogs there. Uh, she's apt.

767
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:34,780
She doesn't realize how big
she is. And, uh, so she's,

768
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,620
but she's not afraid of a
lot of things. Uh, you know,

769
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:42,460
she's not afraid of other dogs, but
hardwood floors scare the shit out of her.

770
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,520
So she so worried that
she's going to be slipping.

771
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,230
She walks like really slowly in daintily
all around the apartment and it looks

772
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:54,280
like she's going to like sneak up on you
something that's right. Just laid out.

773
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:55,943
All right.

774
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,000
Ooh,

775
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,160
Ooh. I got to teach her how to howl. Oh,

776
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:04,830
you guys want to see something
fucking adorable. Do you want to see?

777
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:06,150
You want to see something that we'll,
we'll,

778
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:11,151
we'll make you actually believe again in
whatever the fuck you stopped believing

779
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:16,860
in. Go on Youtube and search a boxer, B o,

780
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:18,840
x,
e r and baby,

781
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,790
and there's a little baby playing with
a boxer and I'm telling you it's, it's,

782
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:26,940
it's one of the most adorable
things you'll ever see. You know,

783
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,020
there would be less violence in the
world if everybody watched this video.

784
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,410
Actually that's not true. Everyone would
watch the video and then the second,

785
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:37,300
somebody next to you in,
ah,

786
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:41,220
the rage would come back and you'd want
to just fucking blast him in the face.

787
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:45,560
But whatever, I digress. Let me get
back to what I was talking about. Um,

788
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:49,530
so anyways, so I have been when
I was over in speed and yeah,

789
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,250
I was up all night and uh,

790
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,910
and then I would sleep all day like
that awful heavy metal song by that band

791
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,940
slaughter and read that.
That's when you knew it was over.

792
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,600
Everybody said it was over when fucking
nirvana came out. No, it wasn't.

793
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,790
It was over when slaughter came out.
Slaughter,

794
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:09,720
slaughtered the rest of hair metal.
That awful guys voice

795
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,343
Zap.

796
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,770
No, it isn't right. It
isn't. It's fucking terrible.

797
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,820
Um, anyways, I'm plowing
head here. So, uh,

798
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,840
I finally got used to the time over in
Sweden and then I came back to the states

799
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,330
and now I'm on Sweden time.

800
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:34,331
So basically I have been up every fucking
night watching old football clips and

801
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:40,030
whatnot on, uh, on the Internet
and I call it all you guys all, uh,

802
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,080
sent me emails going, I swear to
God I don't work for the NFL man.

803
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,130
Just tell me where I can see them.
Where do you see all the videos?

804
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:51,920
Where is the main site where
everybody watches videos?

805
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:53,690
That's where the fuck they are.
Okay.

806
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:55,230
Okay.

807
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,580
It rhymes with Mu Lube. Um, anyways,

808
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,650
so I,
that's what I've been doing late at night.

809
00:51:01,651 --> 00:51:05,880
I've been watching these
fucking videos and uh,

810
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,550
what am I trying to say here? I
don't know what happened. So yeah.

811
00:51:08,551 --> 00:51:11,040
So I fall asleep at la about six,
six 30 in the morning.

812
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:13,620
I sleep until one in the afternoon.
That's what has been happening to me.

813
00:51:13,621 --> 00:51:18,130
I feel like a fucking drug addict.
Right. So evidently yesterday, um,

814
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,770
I was passed out and for some
reason I was in the nude.

815
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:27,690
All right, go ahead. Visualize that
one face down in the fucking nude.

816
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:32,691
And my girlfriend took a picture of me
because she thought it was funny and I

817
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,220
saw it and I,
I dunno,

818
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,050
I never really had a, Oh look, I never
thought it was a good looking guy,

819
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:41,040
but I thought it was all right.

820
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,970
I saw myself laying there butt
ass naked and I got to met. Dude,

821
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,710
I look like a fucking cadaver.

822
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:53,940
That was the worst part. It's not that I
looked at its shape. I'm in decent shape.

823
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,850
I just look like somebody just
had fished me out of a river.

824
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,530
That's the only way I could describe.

825
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,710
The only thing missing was bill
Curtis, his voice, just narrating.

826
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,390
I'm bill Curtis,

827
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:12,000
a pasty freckly man was fished out
of fuckhead river the other day.

828
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:16,860
This sleepy little town with their, with
the fuck. I was gonna say Memorial Day.

829
00:52:16,861 --> 00:52:20,760
What the fuck is it? Labor
is Labor Day parade. Hey,

830
00:52:20,761 --> 00:52:23,070
stupid can't with braces playing a flute.

831
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,220
It looks perfect and talks
looking at me right now going,

832
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,220
you do not sound like Bill
Curtis, whatever. I fucking
looked like it was dead,

833
00:52:29,221 --> 00:52:31,560
so I deleted the picture and
then my girlfriend felt bad.

834
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,790
She goes, oh, I thought it was cute.

835
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,590
I didn't know how to make you
self conscious and it was cute.

836
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:39,723
It wasn't cute.

837
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,610
No one should see what they
look like face down naked.

838
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:50,810
Ah, I can't shake the image. I hope
you guys aren't having your fucking,

839
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,150
your traditional Labor Day breakfast
while not while you're, you're,

840
00:52:55,151 --> 00:52:59,180
you're visualizing that Jesus Christ.
I look at that Rosetta stone.

841
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,480
Remember I was going to learn how to speak
Spanish. I just hate when you do that,

842
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,950
when you're like,
I'm gonna learn how to do this shit.

843
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,460
And you and you buy something and you
just stick it on your bookshelf and it's

844
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:10,160
just sitting there mocking your
laziness for the next nine months.

845
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:14,450
I got that for Christmas last year and I
cannot fucking say anything in Spanish.

846
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:16,771
You don't really get to do,

847
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:19,230
I'm just gonna go down to home depot and
I'm going to find one of those Mexican

848
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:23,730
dudes who are raw always asking me
if they can fucking rewire my entire

849
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:26,060
apartment for fucking three
because of the hardest,

850
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,390
hardest work in fucking
people on the planet. Um, and
I'm just, we had looked at,

851
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:34,980
why don't I just give you 20 bucks and
teach you and you just teach me how to

852
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:38,780
speak Spanish. Is that okay? And then
of course it'd be like, I nod. I Dunno.

853
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,780
I Dunno what I know I want,
I want you to teach me,

854
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,540
teach Amelia how to speak a I die.
I don't know.

855
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,510
Leave saying,
hey,

856
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,910
we just sit there for fucking an hour
and then after awhile my forehead,

857
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,320
would it be sunburned and I would
just give up. That's probably what,

858
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:57,181
what happened and who knows?

859
00:53:57,181 --> 00:54:00,750
Maybe I would actually make a friend down
there and maybe he was really good at

860
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:02,670
an instrument and he
was slightly retarded.

861
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:04,320
And then I would draw that talent out.

862
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,940
And then some day a Freddie prince junior
would have a comeback plane. That dude,

863
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,210
and we can make a little Oscar winning
movie. Maybe that could happen.

864
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,250
All right, let's plow ahead.
Let's, let's, let's get, let's,

865
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:19,260
let's actually be smart this week.

866
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:22,380
And rather than waiting till 50
minutes into this podcast to hype,

867
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:23,580
what the fuck I have to hype.

868
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,540
Why don't I hype what I have to
hype right fucking now. Okay,

869
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,630
well I'm going to do that. Of
course. The second I say it,

870
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,960
my fucking computer shuts down. All
right, hang on a second. Um, all right.

871
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,750
This week I am going to be
in Philadelphia, Pennell,

872
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:41,340
Pennsylvania at the helium
comedy club. Um, September 10th,

873
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,660
11th and 12th. Um, for the love of
God, please come out to that show.

874
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,480
Please show up.
And a,

875
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:50,490
I got a brand new hour at least
since the last time I've been there,

876
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:52,050
cause I haven't been there
in like a year and a half.

877
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:56,790
And that's plenty of time for me to
come up with some new shit. So, uh,

878
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,220
please come down there. I'm actually
gonna try to go to a Phillies game,

879
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:03,660
check out that new stadium and uh,
what else am I going to do there?

880
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,900
I think that's it. I think
that's it. You know what,

881
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:09,330
somebody actually sent me an email,
you know,

882
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:11,410
cause last week I was telling
you guys about hiking,

883
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:12,990
watch those Superbowls clay out.

884
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:17,130
Would you just take a confidence
step in the apartment? Jesus Christ,

885
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:19,260
you would think there were
land mines under the floor.

886
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,500
The dog has never fallen down.
That's the funny thing.

887
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,770
I could see if she fell down the first
day she was here and then she'd have this

888
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:28,890
little, my God, Oh my God,
she's never fallen down

889
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,380
and I was just put that up to see a
scared pit bull, isn't it? Um, anyway,

890
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:39,900
so this guy actually told me about
a, uh, if you're into hockey,

891
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,830
hockey, I don't know, I just said
it that way if are into hockey. Um,

892
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:47,730
there's actually a fucking
website if I can find it. Uh,

893
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,780
where I was watching the
1974 Stanley Cup finals,

894
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,450
like game six. I had never seen it. Um,

895
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:58,500
and I was watching the Bruins verse the
flyers of course the flyers probably

896
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:02,370
when that fucking game, cause I know they
won the series and you have to go to,

897
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,700
uh, this is it right here. This
is for the sports fans out there.

898
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:08,390
It's h f boards,

899
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:13,620
B o a r d s.com/um,

900
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,341
actually,
you know what,

901
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:18,390
just go to that [inaudible] dot com and
just go to that and just start searching

902
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:21,210
for some games and they have all the
original games in their entirety.

903
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,040
And if you are a big sports fan,
like I,

904
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:27,430
it's great to watch those because you can
watch how the game has changed and all

905
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:29,320
that type of stuff.
I gotta be honest with me.

906
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,240
And I had like the greatest fucking
weekend ever where, um, you know,

907
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:37,000
just because college football started
and I don't really happen. Like two,

908
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,800
two years ago I became a college football
fucking maniac and I absolutely love

909
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:45,490
it. And um, I was actually
once again sleeping until noon,

910
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:49,030
which is fucking like three
o'clock east coast time.

911
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,970
So I missed like most of
the first games I think.

912
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:54,730
I think it was like missed like the
first three quarters of the first game.

913
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:58,420
So I wake up my girl, like she gives,
she would have made some breakfast.

914
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,040
She actually brings it into me.

915
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,310
I have breakfast in bed and I walked
into the living room after I eat it.

916
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:06,970
She just made me breakfast in bed people.
Okay.

917
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,960
And I fucking hinged and she goes in
to watch one of her reality shows and I

918
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:14,440
woke up and uh,
after I ate the breakfast,

919
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:16,930
I realized that I was missing
all these college games.

920
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:21,930
So I just stumbled in the living
room because when you're my age,

921
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:25,780
you stumble for the first hour when you
wake up because for some reason your

922
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:30,310
Achilles shrink up to your fucking the
bottom of your ass and your legs don't

923
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:34,000
work. Right. Right. So I
stumbled in here and uh,

924
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,700
I just took the remote from
our, usually I say, honey, you,

925
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:38,650
would you mind if I just Kinda,
I didn't,

926
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,970
I just fucking walked in and
I put on the USC game and uh,

927
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,620
she rightfully just looked down
at the floor. Like, really?

928
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,710
I just made you fucking steak and eggs
and you fucking just come wandering in

929
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:54,190
here. And then she just sort of walked
out and then I had to do that pathetic.

930
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,890
You know when you want to apologize
for something you just did,

931
00:57:56,891 --> 00:58:00,430
but you want to continue
doing the thing that you're,

932
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:03,520
that you're apologizing for.
So rather than hitting pause,

933
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,720
I kept watching the game,

934
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,890
like yelling out the side of my
mouth as she was walking away.

935
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,620
Sorry honey. I do. And

936
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:15,910
I just continued to watch the game and
she gave me the silent treatment for the

937
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:18,580
next four hours,
which actually worked out good.

938
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,730
I think I watched like 12
football games this weekend.

939
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:25,000
I don't know why anybody gets to
fucking NFL package. You don't need it.

940
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,950
You can get all the, all the college
games you want for free and a,

941
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,830
and the kids are young. They haven't
blown out there needs to fucking maniacs.

942
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:37,030
Nobody's holding out. I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck of saying.

943
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:39,190
You know,

944
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,830
it's getting hot in here cause I have
to close my God damn windows because I

945
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:44,890
curse too much when I do this.
You know what? I actually,

946
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,890
I have some more audio here.
Let me take a actually a sip of water.

947
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,770
Like I'm Frank Sinatra in
between fucking songs here

948
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,210
then ain't water. All right. Um,

949
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,960
you ever hear him say that he makes a
joke back then when it was funny that you

950
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:01,630
were drinking booze on stage?
Um,

951
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,170
I actually found another record.
If you guys are actually

952
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,680
big fans of my podcast,

953
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,650
you know what sucks about this shit as
I have to literally move my mixer and

954
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:15,550
everything else, listen to it, hit
the floor so you didn't hear that.

955
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:19,950
And then we'd go, God damn
these fucking wires. Um,

956
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,710
I've been slowly but surely.

957
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,510
And that's how you, he never say it had
been slowly. You always have to say,

958
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:28,790
but surely he always said that they
think they go together. You know,

959
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:33,200
sick and tired.
Slowly but surely suck my dick.

960
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:35,330
Look my balls. You know, it all goes
together. All right, here we go.

961
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,410
I've been basically buying my dad's
record collection one album at a time.

962
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:42,020
And this is one of the weirdest
fucking albums my dad had as a kid,

963
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:44,300
but because I was a kid and I
didn't know any better, I loved it.

964
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:47,570
Listen to this shit. This is
basically the original, like,

965
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:50,420
you know when you watch Austin Powers
and they're kind of mocking the weird

966
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,500
music of the 60s.

967
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,920
This is basically why this is a
called persuasive percussion 1966.

968
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:02,940
And in defense of the orchestra, I think
that they were trying to demonstrate, um,

969
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:06,110
as many instruments as
they possibly could,

970
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,880
isolated how good they sound and
the new found high fi stereo.

971
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,740
So here we go,
listen to this shit.

972
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,370
Okay,

973
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:16,203
any day now.

974
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:40,180
How's that?
The Shit of what?

975
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:45,630
Okay.

976
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:47,610
Uh, you know, a lot of
people, if they saved,

977
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:50,940
they'd go back in a time machine that they
would go back and try and stop Hitler.

978
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:51,480
I wouldn't,

979
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,440
I go back to this fucking
recording session because I
just want to see the looks

980
01:00:55,441 --> 01:00:57,630
on people's faces when they
played their kind of music.

981
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,120
I always picture Barney Rubble's face,
you know,

982
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,390
when he was playing the drums in
that one Fred Flintstone episode,

983
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:07,470
we got Barney rubble Logan for travel.
And he had like,

984
01:01:07,471 --> 01:01:09,210
his eyes were all squinted.
Like that's,

985
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:13,800
I just picture all these guys and like
fucking those turtle necks with, with the,

986
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:17,610
uh, the peace sign. Remember how buddy
rich was, was dressing and like the, uh,

987
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:21,540
the early seventies when he was trying
to act like he was still going to stay

988
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:24,180
relevant with these new hip Kooky kids,

989
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:29,520
but he was still playing big band music
and he would come out with like these

990
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:33,480
plaid Johnny Carson fucking Hagar slacks,

991
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,700
a knitted turtleneck, and then on
the outside of the turtle neck, um,

992
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,480
a little precursor to Eddie Murphy's,
a pinky ring on the outside of his glove.

993
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,710
He would have his, he'd have his
necklace outside the turtleneck with a,

994
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:51,420
with a peace sign and it was
all in like silver, I dunno.

995
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,030
And he let his hair grow a little long
and he had that awful fucking to pay,

996
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,990
but he still was fucking fantastic.
All right.

997
01:01:57,991 --> 01:02:00,900
Was that worth the trip all the
way over to my high Pfiesteria.

998
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,550
Do you guys have a hi Fi? Huh?
All right. Sorry about that.

999
01:02:05,551 --> 01:02:08,100
I'm a fucking nerd. So that's basically
what I did all this weekend. I, uh,

1000
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,340
listened to bad records and I,

1001
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:12,540
I was listening to and watching all
these football games and I got to admit,

1002
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:17,850
you got to watch his old football games
because it is such bullshit nowadays the

1003
01:02:17,851 --> 01:02:20,850
way they, they don't let these
fucking wide receivers can,

1004
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,330
they can do whatever they want. You can't
even cover the fucking receivers. Huh?

1005
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:28,290
Any Georgia bulldog fans out there. How
bad did you guys get fucked on that call?

1006
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,300
I'm not saying that you
would have won the game,

1007
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:32,250
but that was definitely
a pivotal fucking moment.

1008
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:36,540
This guy is going over the middle, the
ball, his throne high and the defense,

1009
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:40,320
the defensive back lays them out. That's
football and then like, and Yancy,

1010
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,110
stammering,

1011
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:46,110
Yay and nay hearing that
roughness was unnecessary.

1012
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:51,220
Who's fucking pathetic?
I mean, unnecessary.

1013
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,890
I'm doing my fucking job.

1014
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:59,170
If you want to see how far football is
changed, a fuck it. Who gives a shit?

1015
01:02:59,171 --> 01:03:02,860
Go on to youtube and just fucking search.
Um,

1016
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,230
search 1978 AFC championship game,
uh,

1017
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:13,380
Steelers versus the Houston Oilers and
watch part for go all the way to the end.

1018
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:18,220
You're going to see Mike Barbara goes
over the middle. Dan Pastor Rini,

1019
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,510
the fucking douchebag throws it like
nine feet over his head. But my Mike,

1020
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,920
Barbara's a Gamer, right? So he goes
up for the thing. Mike Wagner comes in,

1021
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:32,170
doesn't even look at the ball and just
fucking goes as low as he possibly can.

1022
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:36,460
Hits Mike Barber right on his, God Damn
Nice. You ever see a guy on youtube?

1023
01:03:36,461 --> 01:03:40,360
You ever watch a guy like
slam into offense doing 80
miles an hour on a fucking

1024
01:03:40,361 --> 01:03:43,480
motorcycle. And that way,
you know, you just launch,

1025
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,410
it's like you're standing up in the air,
but you're doing flips, head over heels.

1026
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,260
That's what he did. He flipped
it, flipped around like twice,

1027
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:55,650
landed on this astro turf and he's holding
his fucking knee and flipping out and

1028
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:59,500
he, you know, he's on the ground for
like five minutes. When he gets up,

1029
01:03:59,501 --> 01:04:01,990
he's pointing at Mike, Mike
Wagner, you mother Fucker,

1030
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,170
you cheat motherfuckers screaming all
this stuff and the announcers in the booth

1031
01:04:05,171 --> 01:04:08,770
and just sitting there going like, well,
you know, Mike wasn't looking at the ball.

1032
01:04:08,771 --> 01:04:13,330
So, uh, I mean, I dunno, I'm Mr Barbara is
really, he's really annoyed. But I mean,

1033
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:17,770
he was just doing his job. He's
just doing his job. You know,

1034
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:23,140
there was no unnecessary roughness.
Actually, there was back then,

1035
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:25,960
but you actually had to do
something that was unnecessary.

1036
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:27,940
Now you're doing the necessary shit.

1037
01:04:27,941 --> 01:04:31,540
It is to cover a fucking receiver
and they go, it's unnecessary.

1038
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:35,530
That's why one of the biggest bullshit
records ever broken was Dan Marino's

1039
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:37,900
touchdown record by Peyton manning.

1040
01:04:37,901 --> 01:04:42,430
Remember that year when he cried because
the fucking patriots diff diff players

1041
01:04:42,431 --> 01:04:46,120
actually covered his fucking receivers.
You Ne we're trying too hard.

1042
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,480
And the next thing you know,
you can't even touch these fucking guys.

1043
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:52,690
And he breaks Dan Marino's record Dan
Marino where to thrown 90 touchdowns if

1044
01:04:52,691 --> 01:04:55,540
you couldn't touch Clayton and duper.
All right, that's it. I'm done.

1045
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:59,410
I'm done with this sports this week cause
I know people like I know at one point

1046
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,400
and he went once and then when you take
him on boards, they get bored. Well,

1047
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:06,370
you know something. Listen to
another fucking podcast. All right,

1048
01:05:06,371 --> 01:05:07,360
you're whiny cunt.

1049
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:12,130
Go enjoy your fucking Labor Day
on somebody else's podcast. Ah,

1050
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:14,800
how do you like that? Look at me getting
all tough. All right, you're gonna.

1051
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,800
You guys want to,
um oh wait real quick.

1052
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,430
Um, my team is a Lsu. I think
I'm gonna go with Lsu this year.

1053
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,540
There's some bought that les miles.
I just liked the Guy Fourth and 12,

1054
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,430
two minutes into the game
and he fucking goes forward.

1055
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,650
This is like a direct quote for him.
They go less.

1056
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:32,740
Why do you always go for it on fourth
down? And he says, well, you know what,

1057
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,900
when you have play makers on your team,

1058
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,300
you have an obligation to turn them loose.

1059
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,640
That might be one of the
greatest quotes ever.

1060
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,830
I love the southern
fucking turn them loose.

1061
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,790
You got play makers on your
team buddy. Okay, you follow me?

1062
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,030
You have an obligation. Turn them
loose. Just turn them dogs loose.

1063
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:55,630
Just see what to come up with. Go out
there and dig up fucking first down.

1064
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:00,130
Greatest fucking fake field goal
of all time. Lsu. Look that up.

1065
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:04,270
Lsu fake field goal. It's the smoothest
shit you're ever going to see.

1066
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,210
Just flips it right over
his God damn shoulder.

1067
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,280
I was fucking them as a thing of beauty.
All right,

1068
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,470
here's some youtube videos for you guys.
If you're new to my podcast,

1069
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:15,880
this is what I do every week. I act like
a fucking moron in my apartment and um,

1070
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:21,000
people send me in these youtube videos. I
already gave you the boxer baby one. Um,

1071
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,360
and the Lsu fake field goal. And
uh, this is just a creepy one.

1072
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:28,540
It's really quick, but it's
really creepy. Look up, um,

1073
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:32,950
animal recording fail,
animal recording fail.

1074
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:37,951
It's somebody's filming an Anaconda or
some big ass fucking snake and evidently

1075
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:41,230
the snake was not ready
for, it's a closeup. Okay,

1076
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:44,650
we'll just leave it at that and a,
and I'll make it jump.

1077
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:48,700
It'll fucking Mickey jump. All right,
this is going to be a quick podcast.

1078
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:51,550
I'm already to the questions
and I'm only 24 minutes.

1079
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:52,480
And you know what this feels like.

1080
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:56,470
This feels like when I'm fucking
bombing on stage and I'm,

1081
01:06:56,471 --> 01:07:00,670
I know a lot of you guys out there and
not comedians. Sure. We all aren't.

1082
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,350
And uh, basically what happens is
when you're having a great set,

1083
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:10,540
all right, say you're slated
to do 50 minutes, okay?

1084
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,290
Somebody comes back and they say,
Hey kid, can you give me 50 minutes?

1085
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,450
Can you go out there and give
it the college track? Right?

1086
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:19,120
And you fucking go out there and you
start killing. And if you're killing,

1087
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,620
and if you're totally on,

1088
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:24,280
what ends up happening is
you do 50 minutes and you
feel like you only did half

1089
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:28,720
your act, you know, but on
nights when you're bombing,

1090
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:32,260
you're about to jokes away
from your closing bit,

1091
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:35,170
and you look down at your watch and
you're about 12 minutes into your set.

1092
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:40,510
And that's when the dry mouth
sets in and you're like, okay.

1093
01:07:40,511 --> 01:07:43,450
Uh, so, uh, what do you
do for a living? Oh yeah,

1094
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,990
here's my cute little jokes about
fucking plumbers, you know? Oh,

1095
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,930
that's the worst I ever tell you about
to send my first headlining gigs.

1096
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,460
This is basically how I became a headliner
was a first year I had to write the

1097
01:07:57,461 --> 01:08:00,790
material. All right? And
I had gotten up to a,

1098
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:04,660
I knew I had 45 minutes,
but I had never done 45 minutes.

1099
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:09,300
And when you headline or go on last or
whatever the fuck you want to call it, um,

1100
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:13,780
on a real show as a headliner,
you have to do at least 45 minutes.

1101
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,890
That's how it works.
Okay.

1102
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,050
I don't know where the fuck you
guys are from where I'm from.

1103
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,780
That's how it fucking works.
You've got to do 45 minutes.

1104
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:25,190
So I had been doing standup for
about three and a half, four years.

1105
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:28,040
So I had written 45 minutes of material,

1106
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:32,060
but I had never done 45 minutes.
You know what I mean?

1107
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,080
I was basically, at that point, I was a,
I was the feature act or the second guy.

1108
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:40,460
So I was doing like anywhere from 20
minutes to 30 minutes at the most.

1109
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:45,380
Usually Feature Act does 20 to 25 30
if you work at working with like an old

1110
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:48,890
bitter headliner who's given into the
fact that he's not gonna make it or maybe

1111
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,920
he just doesn't feel like
doing it. Um, you know,

1112
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,650
that's when you work with those guys.
And she said, they just come up to you.

1113
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:58,610
And then I worked with this guy one
time when he looks at me and he goes,

1114
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:04,010
he goes, hey, kid, kid. Uh, he goes, Huh,
how much time do you get? Um, I dunno, uh,

1115
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,920
30, 35. And he just goes do all of it.

1116
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:13,640
He's just like, dude, your whole
fucking act, play with the crowd.

1117
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:17,000
I don't give a shit. I'll fucking do 11
minutes and close the show. I've had it.

1118
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:20,480
Right. So, um, anyways, yeah.

1119
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:23,300
So I'd written 45 minutes
of material and I uh,

1120
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,840
but I'd never done it all in a row,
so I didn't know how to put it together.

1121
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,150
So when I moved down in New York,
you know,

1122
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:32,490
the only way to start headlining is at
some point you got to bite the bullet and

1123
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,660
just tell somebody that you're a
headliner. You don't tell that to a,

1124
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:39,740
to a good room. You tell it to like, you
know, you have a rooms, you have be rooms,

1125
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:44,480
you got C and d rooms, so like to c and d
rooms. I was like, I just told the guys,

1126
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:48,230
yeah, I'm a headliner. And
I looking at me, you know, I
was just a kid. They're like,

1127
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:51,020
you're a headliner. And I'm like,
yeah, yeah, I'm a headliner. You know,

1128
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:53,690
it's like when we try and get served,
when you're under age,

1129
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,180
you just try to have that look
of confidence. Don't flinch.

1130
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,480
Just give him the money. I would
like a vodka. Collins. Yes, I would.

1131
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,930
Me and my one whisker on my chin
would like to have some alcohol.

1132
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:07,730
Thank you very much. And um,
the first time I headlined,

1133
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:09,470
I remember I went on after this,
this uh,

1134
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:13,700
this black dude was on in front of me
and he was totally like high energy to

1135
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:14,534
begin with.

1136
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:19,820
And that's one of the first things you
learn how to do as a headline is how to

1137
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:22,190
follow somebody if they have
high fucking energy. Right?

1138
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:26,030
So this guy is doing his act and you know

1139
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,320
it like it is, you know, he's
been doing it for a long time.

1140
01:10:30,321 --> 01:10:33,290
So he just keeps building with the energy
building and building and building.

1141
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:38,470
And he ended his act doing some jokes
about like a prostate exam and by the end

1142
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:41,420
he's just screaming

1143
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,270
and he's got his fucking,
thank God my mother Fucker

1144
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,280
is screaming into this,

1145
01:10:47,281 --> 01:10:51,000
my killing in this restaurant
and I'm sitting there,

1146
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:54,810
I'm already sweating trying to think how
the fuck am I going to follow that guy.

1147
01:10:55,050 --> 01:11:00,050
And I made the biggest fucking mistake
you can ever do is when somebody ends and

1148
01:11:00,241 --> 01:11:02,880
they're on 11 with the energy,

1149
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:07,620
the worst fucking thing that you can do
is to go on stage and start your act at

1150
01:11:07,621 --> 01:11:10,950
the same energy that that, that
that guy left off. First of all,

1151
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,980
you're not going to have enough
energy. There's no way. You can't

1152
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,880
be on 10 for 45 fucking minutes.
You're going to pass out.

1153
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:23,100
Okay. And not only that, it's bizarre
to have someone just come out on stage,

1154
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:27,550
you know, please welcome
bill burr screaming.

1155
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,590
I said, I like that guy in the tough man
thing, you know, you got to get psyched,

1156
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,790
you got to get pumped. I was coming
out with like that kind of energy.

1157
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,950
So I went up there and eight
minutes in screaming my act,

1158
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:45,120
I am pouring sweat and I remember looking
down at my watch feeling like I had

1159
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:49,270
done at least 25 minutes and I had
only done like 11 minutes and I,

1160
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:53,730
I was out of breath out of breath
from telling fucking jokes.

1161
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:56,040
And I had no,
I just remember there was a,

1162
01:11:56,041 --> 01:12:01,041
for some reason there was a big fish tank
in this place and I was trying to riff

1163
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:06,190
about the fish tank and it was a
restaurant and like a, anybody oded,

1164
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:11,010
the filet of fish goes, I think I know
where they got it. It was, it was awful.

1165
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:16,210
Oh, just fucking, Oh I, you know
what actually got a bad feeling.

1166
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:17,710
Just even thinking about that fucking set.

1167
01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:21,040
So if you are a comedian and you're
listening to this and you're just starting

1168
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:23,230
to headline,
if you follow somebody with energy,

1169
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,960
what you actually want to do is
go in the opposite direction.

1170
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:30,850
That's what I learned as you go up there
and you just start really fucking slow

1171
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:33,400
and actually kind of eat your balls for,
you know,

1172
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:37,480
just let everybody just bring it down.
Everybody fucking relax.

1173
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:41,020
And then when she get him relaxed,
then you start to build them up again.

1174
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:44,860
You know what I mean? It's just like
doing drugs. You start coming down,

1175
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:48,010
but you know, once you go through the
floor and you start filling depression,

1176
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,100
you take another drug and you
start coming back up again. That's,

1177
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:54,790
that's where right there,
right as you go below the floor boards,

1178
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:59,020
that's when I grabbed you by the back of
your fucking God damn shirt and I pull

1179
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:02,920
you back up again, comedically. And
then we, then we go back up again.

1180
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,491
But this is what,

1181
01:13:04,491 --> 01:13:09,491
what ended up happening was I would do
my jokes and I could kill for 37 minutes.

1182
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,370
And for some reason
when I said 37 minutes,

1183
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:16,480
I just wrote it on my Ottoman
with my finger. I wrote 37,

1184
01:13:16,481 --> 01:13:20,050
like the fucking rain man,
fucking Weirdo.

1185
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:23,830
I really have a lot of rain man qualities.
I don't know if you've noticed that,

1186
01:13:23,831 --> 01:13:26,020
but uh,
like

1187
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,020
I can actually name all
everybody who's won the Superbowl

1188
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:35,270
the last 43 years and now I don't have
it in front of me, but I can do it.

1189
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:39,080
So if you ever see me, I'll fucking
rattled them off, rattle them off.

1190
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,450
I had my head to the side just
like the fucking rain man.

1191
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:44,900
And they just want me to go back and name
all the losers. I can fucking do that.

1192
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:48,110
And uh,
I was actually at 1.1 to,

1193
01:13:48,111 --> 01:13:52,670
to memorize where all the Superbowls
took place and that's when, uh,

1194
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:53,750
right after I had that thought,

1195
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:56,090
I kind of caught myself in a mirror
and I was just like, what are you doing

1196
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:59,770
bill? What, what, what do you,
what do you run it from? You know,

1197
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,250
because I'm just sitting there in the
mirror going green bay, Green Bay jets,

1198
01:14:04,251 --> 01:14:08,780
chiefs, colts, cowboys, dolphins,
dolphins, Steelers, Steelers. Yeah,

1199
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,150
Raiders, cowboys. See, can
I still do it? Steelers,

1200
01:14:13,151 --> 01:14:16,480
Steelers and then Jim Plunkett
with the fucking Raiders.

1201
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:20,650
Jill Montana. That was
in Pontiac, Michigan.

1202
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:25,651
They beat the Bengals and they stopped
Pete Johnson right down the goal line and

1203
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:29,440
then the fucking Redskins who I hated
because I was a huge cowboy fan.

1204
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,920
They'd beat the dolphins that Fulton
Walker and took the kickoff back.

1205
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,220
See,
I remember all this shit

1206
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:42,280
and the rate has kicked the shit out of
the Redskins and next year and then a

1207
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:45,220
fucking 40 niners beat the dolphins.

1208
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,880
Remember that sports illustrated with
Dan Marino was on the cover and he was

1209
01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:52,600
pointing at him like, yeah, this is
going to be the first one, right.

1210
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:57,120
With Joe Montana. Next year was
the bears, which could have,

1211
01:14:57,121 --> 01:15:00,570
should have been the greatest
fucking Superbowl ever. You know,

1212
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:02,470
I'm just going all sports this week.
I don't give a fuck.

1213
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,630
I'm just going to give you guys
a heads up. Do you remember that?

1214
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:08,950
The bears went 15 and one
in the regular season.

1215
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,090
Okay. And the only team they lost to
was the dolphins on a Monday night.

1216
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:18,120
It was fucking awesome cause the dolphins
basically defended the 72 dolphins,

1217
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:22,450
you know, undefeated record
by beating the fucking bears.

1218
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:28,270
So in the AFC championship game that year,
it was the dolphins first,

1219
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:30,290
the Patriots, and we were
playing them in the orange bowl.

1220
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:31,530
And we had this curse we had,

1221
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:33,430
we had never won in the
orange bowl for like fucking,

1222
01:15:33,431 --> 01:15:35,380
I don't like 20 goddamn years.
Okay.

1223
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:40,180
Since like Lyndon Johnson was an office
and the San Diego chargers played in Los

1224
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,310
Angeles. Okay. And, and um,

1225
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,400
the fucking dolphin should have beat
us and then they should've gone to the

1226
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:50,410
Superbowl and then the bears should have
been set up to fucking avenge their one

1227
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:53,710
loss of the year.
And then the dolphins with Dan Marino.

1228
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:56,710
And that unbelievable fucking offense
was the only ones that was able to beat

1229
01:15:56,711 --> 01:15:59,200
the 46 defense.
And what fucking happens.

1230
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:04,870
Stupid ass patriots. We come in
there and we beat them. Right.

1231
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,780
And then, you know, let's
squish the fish. Remember that,

1232
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:10,220
squish the fish and everybody.
Miami was just so like, Ooh,

1233
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,560
Dolphin join of foods.
There are minimal. Hello

1234
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:18,980
was some of the gay as shit
talking ever during that time.

1235
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:23,270
And somebody who made a song in Boston,
remember that song by Pete Townsend, uh,

1236
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:28,280
face to face that face to face, gat
to face to face, something like that.

1237
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:33,380
Somebody wrote us a squished the
fish to that song, squish the fish,

1238
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:35,750
get to squish the,
if it was fucking horrific,

1239
01:16:35,751 --> 01:16:38,510
but somehow I still actually watch
the game. And then the Patriots got a,

1240
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:43,040
they got raped, I believe is the best
way to describe it, um, by the bears.

1241
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:45,170
46 to 10.
Then the next year was the giants.

1242
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,720
Then the red skins than
40 niners 40 niners.

1243
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:52,490
And then was the bill's error where they
lost to the giants, Redskins, cowboys,

1244
01:16:52,491 --> 01:16:56,210
cowboys. Then the 40 niners,
then the cowboys and the
packers. And then the pack.

1245
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,000
Uh, you had a packers
beat the fucking patriots.

1246
01:16:59,001 --> 01:17:03,560
I went to that game than the Broncos
won the next two. Then the rams,

1247
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,440
then the ravens. Stupid. Ah,

1248
01:17:06,441 --> 01:17:10,190
that coach there and they have no
idea how fast we shut up the clown.

1249
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:14,810
They beat the giants then patriots,
then Tampa, patriots, patriots,

1250
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:19,280
Holts stealers. Giants stealers.
Huh? You like that Shit

1251
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:24,800
fucking rain man. What do you want to
go another sport? Name another sport.

1252
01:17:24,801 --> 01:17:27,770
I'll fucking do it. I can go all the
way back to like the early seventies.

1253
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:29,220
That's what I,

1254
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:32,630
I actually fucking sit there and
I write that down on like Napkins,

1255
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:36,860
cocktail napkins. When I'm on planes.
Like that's how I make plane rides go by.

1256
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,530
Like right now, maybe you're on
a plane listening to this shit.

1257
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:41,240
I actually sit there.

1258
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:44,110
Green Bay, Green Bay jets.
Yeah, definitely the chiefs

1259
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,780
and I'm a fucking loser.
All right,

1260
01:17:47,781 --> 01:17:51,350
let's get to some of the questions
here for the week. Jesus Christ. Nia.

1261
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:52,883
Okay.

1262
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:57,030
This is what happens when
I'm doing my fucking podcast.

1263
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:00,430
Nia is always getting ready
to go somewhere and she
comes out in all sorts of

1264
01:18:00,431 --> 01:18:01,810
fucking different dress.

1265
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,640
Okay.

1266
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,130
And I'm not ready for it.
Um,

1267
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:08,950
you just tell her you were going to go do
one of those sports illustrated covers.

1268
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:15,220
Some of those ones where they were the
mesh, this bathing suit. Yeah, exactly.

1269
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:20,920
All right. Let's plow ahead here.
Um, questions of the week. All right.

1270
01:18:20,921 --> 01:18:24,790
Question number one. Hey Bill, I'm sure
you've by now you've seen the punch.

1271
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,700
Just wondering what your
opinion was on it. Personally,

1272
01:18:27,701 --> 01:18:31,900
I thought the Boise state player deserved
it and the expression on his face was

1273
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:34,690
priceless. Go blue. All right.
There's a Michigan Fan are,

1274
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:39,210
unless you're saying go blue
because of the fucking turf. Um,

1275
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,480
um, okay. How do I explain this shit?
This is basically what happened.

1276
01:18:43,481 --> 01:18:48,250
Boise state played a, played Oregon
and I guess last year, Boise State,

1277
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:49,210
I'm injured

1278
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:51,770
the quarterback on a fucking,

1279
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,860
I was just picturing that dude
from England getting all pissed.

1280
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,060
Well, it's none of this shit because I
know he doesn't give a fuck about all this

1281
01:18:58,061 --> 01:19:00,280
stuff, but I don't give a fuck.
You don't watch this stuff.

1282
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,190
I'll talk about the premier
league next week. So anyways,

1283
01:19:03,191 --> 01:19:06,970
somebody in Boise state injured
the quarterback on Oregon.

1284
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,100
So the running back on Oregon.

1285
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:10,380
Okay.

1286
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,940
Since we, we owe Boise
state, uh, and ass weapon.

1287
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:16,190
So we use basically talking shit.

1288
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:20,720
So they play the game and they held that
guy who talks shit to minus five yards.

1289
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:23,660
So at the end of the game that came up
and they talked a little bit of Shit.

1290
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:28,430
The guy gets in his face as Fabi like,
ah, where are you going to say now man,

1291
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,264
what are you guys?

1292
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:34,050
And then the dude looks away and the
dude who was getting yelled at just wound

1293
01:19:34,051 --> 01:19:37,280
up and he fucking dropped
the guy and then it,

1294
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:41,220
then it just got ugly and ugly and
ugly. What do I think about that? Um,

1295
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:43,890
it was definitely funny.

1296
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,460
There's definitely funny to see it when
you see a guy getting somebodies face

1297
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:51,270
talking a bunch of shit and then
the other guy just, you know,

1298
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,840
just fucking winds up and drops him.
It was definitely funny, but uh,

1299
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:59,730
I thought that dude had it coming. You
know, if you're going to say, you know,

1300
01:19:59,731 --> 01:20:00,990
you got an ass whooping common.

1301
01:20:00,991 --> 01:20:04,170
If you're going to talk shit and
then only get minus five yards,

1302
01:20:04,171 --> 01:20:07,980
you got understand that people are
going to give you some shit back. And a,

1303
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:09,380
I gotta be honest, man, I feel really

1304
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,860
bad for that guy because uh,
you know,

1305
01:20:12,861 --> 01:20:17,500
he could've got drafted and
now he got suspended and um,

1306
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:21,770
and just one of those heat of the moment
things were, I don't know, at some point,

1307
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:25,040
you know, I mean he might've
just fucked his whole life up.

1308
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:26,830
Yeah.

1309
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:29,230
Like now, now he won't get
drafted and then what do you do?

1310
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:30,110
Yeah,

1311
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:34,140
you work at best buy, you could have,
you know, you could have gotten at least,

1312
01:20:34,141 --> 01:20:34,980
you know,
even if you suck,

1313
01:20:34,981 --> 01:20:38,490
you're going to get like six figure
contract maybe for a couple of years.

1314
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:42,900
You run around and play for the
fucking chiefs or some shit like that.

1315
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:46,800
I don't know. It was just really
bad. It was fucking ugly and a,

1316
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:49,380
and then the fact that it was a black
dude and he punches a white dude.

1317
01:20:49,381 --> 01:20:52,140
Then you go on the internet and
everybody has to write some racist shit,

1318
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:55,140
which is one of the things I really
can't stand about. Youtube is all the,

1319
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:58,350
all the, uh, all the racist on there.
I really can't fucking stand that.

1320
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:02,190
I don't mind when someone writes some
shit just to be a dick to annoy somebody,

1321
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:03,180
but like a,

1322
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:05,070
yeah,

1323
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:05,520
yeah.

1324
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,900
The n word is used pretty liberally on
youtube and that's the one fucking thing,

1325
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:13,170
you know, somebody asked me that actually
about my website was saying like,

1326
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:16,610
you know, why don't you have a
page where people can, you know,

1327
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,680
leave comments and stuff like that.
And that's why I don't,

1328
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:23,070
because people ended up arguing and then
invariably somebody writes something

1329
01:21:23,071 --> 01:21:27,130
racist or something just really horrific,
uh,

1330
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:30,930
some about Jews or something.
And then it's on my website.
It's just, I, you know,

1331
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,830
I don't condone that shit and I just,
you know, I don't give a fuck what I do.

1332
01:21:34,831 --> 01:21:35,820
The podcast.
Do you want to,

1333
01:21:35,821 --> 01:21:38,550
you want to write something or send it
to me and I'll fucking read it on this?

1334
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:44,050
Um, I dunno that I explained
that I, I feel bad for that guy.

1335
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:47,080
I feel bad for that dude because
he just fucked his life up.

1336
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:50,230
And one moment by punching the guy
in the face, but you don't see them.

1337
01:21:50,231 --> 01:21:50,801
I don't like,

1338
01:21:50,801 --> 01:21:54,070
I don't like when people sucker punch
somebody and then they have like that.

1339
01:21:54,071 --> 01:21:58,170
Yeah. What, what fucking vibe?
What do you mean what? Uh,

1340
01:21:58,171 --> 01:22:01,180
I wasn't looking at you when you punch me
in the face. Yeah, I'm going to go down.

1341
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,620
That's really, it's really no skill
level there, but in defense of that guy,

1342
01:22:05,621 --> 01:22:09,070
if you do get in somebody's
face and talk shit, yeah, you,

1343
01:22:09,071 --> 01:22:10,600
what you do is that you do that little,

1344
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:14,830
you know that little gay backwards
skip that fucking football players do.

1345
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:17,910
That's what you do while you look
at the person. You don't say a,

1346
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:22,240
you don't talk shit and then just fucking
turn the other cheek like you're Jesus.

1347
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,560
You know? Do you think Jesus ever
got dropped with that whole fucking a

1348
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,550
wait, did he, did Jesus say that? Talk
Shit and then turn the other cheek?

1349
01:22:32,551 --> 01:22:36,060
He didn't say that.
He said if somebody slaps you,

1350
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,960
turn the other cheek so they can slap
that side. What kind of a fucking,

1351
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:45,730
you know, woe is me. That's
how I am not religious.

1352
01:22:45,731 --> 01:22:49,450
I can't get behind that son of God, not
son of God. Profit or whatever that is.

1353
01:22:49,451 --> 01:22:50,950
Just,
just some dumb shit,

1354
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:57,690
son. If somebody kicks you
in the left ball when you,

1355
01:22:57,691 --> 01:23:00,960
I stopped watering and you can
actually see your right ball.

1356
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:05,830
Hold it out for him so he can kick
with that one. Yeah, go fuck yourself.

1357
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:06,280
You fucking

1358
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,390
Hippie your stupid ass sandals.

1359
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:11,920
He really was the original fucking dirty
ass hippie wasn't he wasn't Jesus that

1360
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,240
all right. That should get some people
sending me some emails. God help me.

1361
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:20,170
If I ever get fucking famous and they
start cutting up some of the Goddamn shit

1362
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:24,550
on this podcast, I'm really going to be
in trouble. Um, all right, next question.

1363
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:27,380
Bill, did you ever, uh, at some
point in your early career,

1364
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,630
think about performing on a cruise ship?

1365
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:32,570
This guy has no idea how
funny this question is. Uh,

1366
01:23:32,571 --> 01:23:35,420
I'm not sure if you've ever taken a
cruise before, but let me tell you,

1367
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,860
it's pretty fucking sweet.

1368
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:41,460
Okay. He says, uh,

1369
01:23:41,461 --> 01:23:46,080
it seems like you literally a would
be getting paid to go on vacation,

1370
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,560
get shit faced daily and flirt with
some finance trim in between all that.

1371
01:23:51,871 --> 01:23:56,340
If you could find the time on Tuesday
and Thursday night to do your act for an

1372
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,740
hour in the main show room.
Um,

1373
01:23:58,741 --> 01:24:02,520
not to mention you're waking up in some
of the sickest places in the Caribbean

1374
01:24:02,521 --> 01:24:04,590
every other day.
Let me know what you think.

1375
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:10,100
All right? Um, okay. Amongst comedians,

1376
01:24:10,101 --> 01:24:14,660
you are never further out of
show business then when you do,

1377
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:18,410
when you do stand up on a cruise ship,
um,

1378
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:24,620
people who do stand up on cruise
ships, it's basically, uh,

1379
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:26,210
I dunno,
it's,

1380
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:31,290
it's like there's two places where
you go out to pasture as a performer.

1381
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:34,790
Um,
Vegas and cruise ships.

1382
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:40,040
Vegas isn't bad because you'll get like
$1 million fucking like that. Danny Gans.

1383
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:44,630
Dot. Guy Just fucking passed away. Like
that guy was making millions. He had like,

1384
01:24:44,631 --> 01:24:48,530
he was making like five, 6 million a
year. He doesn't have to be on the road.

1385
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:53,280
You let the crowd come to you. There's
a lot to say about that shit. But, uh,

1386
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,850
when you're out on a cruise
ship, I mean, first of all,

1387
01:24:55,851 --> 01:24:57,560
let's just break this
whole fucking thing down.

1388
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:01,850
It seems like you'd literally be
getting paid to go on a vacation. Yeah.

1389
01:25:01,851 --> 01:25:03,350
Except you have to work.

1390
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:07,520
That's actually one of the classic things
that club owners used to do when I was

1391
01:25:07,521 --> 01:25:09,170
starting out to try and fuck you over.

1392
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:13,160
When they would try to book you down in
Florida in the wintertime and they'd off,

1393
01:25:13,161 --> 01:25:16,130
you're like 80 bucks for the week or some
awful shit. And they'd be like, yeah,

1394
01:25:16,131 --> 01:25:18,320
but you know,
it's kind of like you're on vacation.

1395
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,120
It's kind of like a paid vacation.
Yeah.

1396
01:25:20,121 --> 01:25:25,010
Except I have to work except for that
working part. You fucking assholes.

1397
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:29,720
Um, now, uh, a cruise ship is an absolute
fucking nightmare, believe it or not.

1398
01:25:29,721 --> 01:25:31,760
One of the first things you
want to do as a performer,

1399
01:25:31,761 --> 01:25:34,940
the second the show is over, is you want
to get the fuck away from the crowd.

1400
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:39,340
You want to get away from
the crowd because the only
way to describe it is you,

1401
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:42,830
you ever get stuck in an elevator with
some douche bag and you have to make this

1402
01:25:42,831 --> 01:25:45,020
small talk conversation
that you don't want to have.

1403
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:49,670
Imagine being stuck on a boat with a
fucking a thousand of those people.

1404
01:25:49,671 --> 01:25:51,350
Cause that's basically what it is.
Now.

1405
01:25:51,351 --> 01:25:55,340
I'm not trying to be unappreciative of
people will come out to see the fucking

1406
01:25:55,341 --> 01:25:59,570
show, but you know, I dunno.
What do you do for a living?

1407
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:02,550
Okay, let's use the plumber
analogy. Does that guy,

1408
01:26:02,551 --> 01:26:06,710
I want to talk fixing fucking toilets.
How did you get into fixing toilet?

1409
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,100
Do you get nervous right before
you have to fix a toilet?

1410
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:16,200
You know, it's awful.
I did one cruise ship

1411
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:19,370
and I actually, uh, I got, I
didn't, I need to get fired,

1412
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:23,420
but I was definitely not asked back.
And uh, the whole thing was a lie.

1413
01:26:23,421 --> 01:26:24,830
They told me, I told him, first of all,

1414
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:27,770
I said that my act is not
conducive to a cruise ship.

1415
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:32,060
I just don't see myself doing well on a
cruise ship. And uh, they were like, no,

1416
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,000
you know, cause people are old on
cruise ships and they're like, Nah,

1417
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:37,730
this is a young hip cruise ship.
I already told this fucking story.

1418
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,050
And I got on there,
there was that old

1419
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:41,640
Vietnamese woman passed out,

1420
01:26:41,641 --> 01:26:45,450
missing all their fucking teeth upfront
and I ate my balls the entire week.

1421
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:48,480
And the only people I made
laugh was the band. You know,

1422
01:26:48,481 --> 01:26:51,960
the captain wrote a letter saying,
how is offensive to all fucking people?

1423
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:56,250
And cruise ships are a nightmare,
sir. They're a fucking nightmare.

1424
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,930
And I don't know what cruise
ship that you're taking, but um,

1425
01:26:58,931 --> 01:27:01,230
all I know is that when
I took a cruise ship,

1426
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:06,000
they would stop and you had basically
four hours to see whatever the fuck you

1427
01:27:06,001 --> 01:27:09,930
could see before you had to run back to
the ship or they would leave without you.

1428
01:27:09,931 --> 01:27:13,080
So it was a very stressful situation.
And then other than that,

1429
01:27:13,081 --> 01:27:16,920
you were just out on the water and
it all looked the fucking same to me.

1430
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,000
Okay.

1431
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,530
Maybe I didn't take a good one.
I mean,

1432
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:22,140
if I went to the Mediterranean
and did a European cruise,

1433
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:25,290
imagine that would be
cool. But, uh, you know,

1434
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:27,690
I don't want to go to Athens
for fucking three hours,

1435
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:29,903
you know,

1436
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,100
and fucking sitting there running around
trying to see all this shit, you know,

1437
01:27:33,101 --> 01:27:36,400
in flip flops and a fucking Hawaiian
shirt, you know, dressed like

1438
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:41,480
Robin Williams before he does God damn
special. Um, it's, it's a nightmare Gig,

1439
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:45,130
sir. They definitely pay
well, but it is, it's,

1440
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,190
it's a fucking nightmare
and you're out to sea.

1441
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:51,970
And I don't know when I did them,
they didn't even have Internet access.

1442
01:27:51,971 --> 01:27:55,300
So there was no way for your fucking
agent to even get in contact with you if

1443
01:27:55,301 --> 01:27:58,960
you did have a big audition.
But even if he did have a big auditions,

1444
01:27:58,961 --> 01:28:01,180
now you can fucking get off the boat.

1445
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:02,680
Okay.

1446
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:05,980
You know, call a fucking helicopter
helicopter, you know, it's, it's horrific.

1447
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:09,120
Anyways, let's plow ahead here. Um,

1448
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:12,250
it's getting hot as fuck
here in my apartment because
I had to close the windows

1449
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:16,270
because I curse. Um, what
is this section here?

1450
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:22,410
Something I wasn't aware of. I don't even
know what this is. Let me read this. Um,

1451
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:25,420
the reason I'm writing you is
I'm a huge college football fan,

1452
01:28:25,421 --> 01:28:29,620
but I have to say that there is one trend
that has emerged over the past decade

1453
01:28:29,621 --> 01:28:32,740
that really bugs the shit out of me.
Oh, this guy doesn't like the promos.

1454
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:36,160
I haven't, has anybody got any other
football fans? No to this. He said,

1455
01:28:36,161 --> 01:28:40,420
why is it that every major
football telecast kicks off
with some redneck singing?

1456
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:41,254
A theme song?

1457
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:45,590
I guess it started with Hank Williams
jr now that's the only one I know that I

1458
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:49,270
ever read. It wasn't
football. Shamona not part.

1459
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:52,750
I fucking hate that. I don't like
that one either. But I wasn't aware.

1460
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:56,020
He's saying they're doing it everywhere.
He said it's gotten way out of hand.

1461
01:28:56,021 --> 01:28:58,600
A few years ago, college game
day employed it's own country,

1462
01:28:58,601 --> 01:29:03,570
mute music band to sing the show's theme.
It's like the guy with the fiddle.

1463
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:06,920
Um,
and the guy wearing the big

1464
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:11,080
top hat are supposed to be a little less
white trash because they're joined by a

1465
01:29:11,081 --> 01:29:15,220
black guy shouting out football
audibles in the middle of the song.

1466
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,670
Wow. Dude, that sounds
fucking horrific. Um,

1467
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,880
this year to top it all off,

1468
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:26,500
all the day apparently isn't complete
unless some other Appalachian with a 10

1469
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:31,360
gallon hat sings the scene theme song
for ABC's game of the week on Saturday

1470
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:31,570
night.

1471
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:35,650
Not to mention that during the actual
game the ACC has its own commercial with

1472
01:29:35,651 --> 01:29:40,300
some other hicks singing a theme song at
least that is somewhat understandable.

1473
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,540
The AACC is predominantly
um, uh, southern conference

1474
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:46,350
coffee conference.
Such a moron.

1475
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:47,900
All right, look, I get it.

1476
01:29:47,901 --> 01:29:50,840
College football has a lot of fans
in the southeast part of the country.

1477
01:29:50,841 --> 01:29:54,680
Football in general attracts
a large audience of white
males between the ages of

1478
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:57,830
25 to 40. I am one of those
white males. And frankly,

1479
01:29:57,831 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm a little tired of my football viewing
experience becoming intruded on by an

1480
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:05,880
assorted cast of characters from
Hazard County. Sorry for the rant,

1481
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:09,230
but I had to get that off my chest and
frankly my wife couldn't care less.

1482
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:11,600
Okay. Oh Dude, I'm in that boat.

1483
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:14,300
I know that you start rant to your
girlfriend about some shit and they just

1484
01:30:14,301 --> 01:30:17,570
start glazing over. Like, yeah,
I really don't care about sports.

1485
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:21,830
So at any point,
if you want to stop yelling at me,

1486
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:25,550
you're spending on the side of my
face, by the way. Um, yeah dude,

1487
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:27,740
I gotta admit I haven't noticed that shit.
But I'll tell you why.

1488
01:30:27,741 --> 01:30:32,570
Cause I don't watch pregame post game.
I don't, I just watched the games.

1489
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,430
I don't want to watch that part where
people like, you know, I'll tell you,

1490
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:38,660
you know, if I'm Terry Bradshaw,
I got gotta be taken a,

1491
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:41,960
what's John Stallworth doing?
Fuck. Give a shit. You know,

1492
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,660
and I don't listen to sports talk radio.

1493
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:50,980
All those people fucking freaking out
losing their minds here in Oklahoma.

1494
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:55,940
He wants your starting quarterback
put the second stringer in. Relax.

1495
01:30:55,970 --> 01:30:59,210
That's why they have coaches. You
don't have to worry about it, sir.

1496
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,830
The decisions will be made.

1497
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:05,170
Um, alright. Underrated. Overrated
for the week. Uh, underrated.

1498
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,740
The television series,

1499
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,330
brotherhood. Um, dude,

1500
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:13,600
the Brotherhood was my show and
they actually canceled it. Um,

1501
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,970
this is what this guy has to say about,

1502
01:31:14,971 --> 01:31:17,820
he says a crime show on
showtime was recently canceled,

1503
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:20,880
was much better than the similar,
the soprano's.

1504
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:22,590
It had superior writing and acting.

1505
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,000
It also had a better place and his
characters were much more interesting. Um,

1506
01:31:27,001 --> 01:31:30,930
it could be just be that the whole
Italian mafia thing is getting tired,

1507
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,900
John Hra, but, um,

1508
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:37,320
but I got to go with Brotherhood
as overall being a better show,

1509
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:40,920
although they were both good.
Uh, yeah, the Brotherhood is
awesome, man. If you guys,

1510
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:44,610
uh, have a DVD store
around you, what sucks is,

1511
01:31:44,611 --> 01:31:47,940
is this too awesome seasons
and they're really the,

1512
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:52,050
the cliffhanger that they left you with.
It's basically based on that.

1513
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,740
I think the Billy and Whitey Bolger thing,
we're back in Massachusetts,

1514
01:31:55,741 --> 01:32:00,220
they had a really high ranking politician
whose brother was a really high ranking

1515
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,053
gangster.

1516
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,150
Yeah.

1517
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:05,480
And uh, this is something else I think
I already talked about on the podcast.

1518
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:10,200
Yeah. That was like the dynamic and
everyone would always be asking the, uh,

1519
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:13,650
was I think it was,
it was Billy Billy Ball jar,

1520
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,900
I think was the politician
and Whitey was the gangster.

1521
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:21,780
And they would always ask Billy be
like, what is your affiliation? I, dude,

1522
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:26,530
I don't have any affiliation
with my brother, you know,
Massachusetts, my brother.

1523
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:26,650
Yeah.

1524
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:27,483
Uh,

1525
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:32,790
I'm just trying to do the best job I can
do to the tax payers of Massachusetts,

1526
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:34,743
you know,

1527
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:38,710
and the last thing I remembered happening
was the gangster actually won the

1528
01:32:38,711 --> 01:32:40,780
state lottery.
How fucking hilarious is that?

1529
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:43,870
So this basically the show was based
on that took place in Providence,

1530
01:32:43,871 --> 01:32:47,620
Rhode Island. I highly, highly
fucking recommend that you watch it.

1531
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,780
It sucks that there's only two seasons,
but um, starts off a little slow.

1532
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:54,690
There's a lot of fucking,
uh,

1533
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:56,430
yeah,

1534
01:32:56,430 --> 01:32:58,350
there's a lot of characters,
but um,

1535
01:32:59,140 --> 01:32:59,510
okay.

1536
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:01,760
Actually at one point I'm actually
going to give away something.

1537
01:33:01,761 --> 01:33:05,750
This is just sort of a little vignette
that they had on the show is a Yankee fan

1538
01:33:05,751 --> 01:33:10,280
comes into one of the provenance bars
and starts talking shit to one of the

1539
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:14,470
hothead gangsters and who's a red sox fan.
And um,

1540
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,180
he fucking blows his brains out.

1541
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:18,783
Okay.

1542
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:19,620
And it,

1543
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:24,450
it was really, it was disturbing.
It was disturbing. Um,

1544
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,480
so definitely checked out and that
fucking guy was a great actor.

1545
01:33:27,481 --> 01:33:31,770
And not to mention that I'm
the guy who plays Freddy Cork,

1546
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:34,110
um,
is actually,

1547
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:38,280
believe it or not because he's such a
great fucking actor is Kevin Chapman who

1548
01:33:38,281 --> 01:33:41,610
was a comedian that I started out with
and he was one of my feet that was one of

1549
01:33:41,611 --> 01:33:44,460
my favorite characters on
TV and Tony Vee was in it,

1550
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:45,900
another great comedian from Boston.

1551
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:48,640
I'm so fucking pissed that they
canceled that show cause uh,

1552
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,170
that was my show man. I love that
show. So I got to go with you. Yeah,

1553
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:56,070
a brotherhood. Definitely
underrated. Alright. Overrated. Uh,

1554
01:33:56,071 --> 01:33:57,960
this dude says the black eyed peas,

1555
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:02,310
the sheer amount of times I've heard the
new album against my will is staggering.

1556
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:05,970
The only people you'll catch
listening to them are the lame ass.

1557
01:34:05,971 --> 01:34:09,930
Want to be cool white people who have
never heard of anything unless it was on

1558
01:34:09,931 --> 01:34:12,750
the radio. Yeah, I know. They
definitely play them in elevators.

1559
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,830
And if you go to staples,
um,

1560
01:34:16,831 --> 01:34:19,340
I can't even think of their fucking
music, but I can't stand. Ah,

1561
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:24,630
did they do London Bridge always that,
that check when she went solo.

1562
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,380
Oh, that was Fergie by herself.
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. Yeah.

1563
01:34:31,381 --> 01:34:32,970
You know what I actually
discovered the other day,

1564
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:36,870
I have a lot of shit in my iPod that
my girlfriend downloaded on her fucking

1565
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:40,320
computer was on the blink. And
uh, did I say on the blink?

1566
01:34:40,321 --> 01:34:43,890
I don't know what the fuck that means
when it was on the Fritz. He, uh,

1567
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:46,110
so she downloaded all this shit
that I never would have listened to.

1568
01:34:46,111 --> 01:34:49,680
So the other day, what was that
song? I crazy. Who sings that song?

1569
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:50,733
Yeah.

1570
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:56,550
GNARLS Barkley. I never,
she used to listen to that
song and I fucking hated it.

1571
01:34:57,410 --> 01:35:02,390
Um, with that dude singing in
that falsetto, you know. Uh,

1572
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:05,420
but I actually listen to the lyrics.
It's, I actually like the song now.

1573
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:07,880
I was at the gym lifting weights,

1574
01:35:07,881 --> 01:35:11,230
listening to that song and I've
never felt gay or in my life. Uh,

1575
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,970
I gotta wrap this up cause that was
embarrassing to even admit that. Um,

1576
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:16,700
all right, I'm 53 minutes then. That's
going to be the podcast this week.

1577
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:20,810
I know it's a little fucking, it was
little off this week I think, but um,

1578
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,450
I'm coming down off a Tylenol pm.
I had to do it to,

1579
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:27,080
I had to drag myself up like fucking
Michael Jackson so I could actually fall

1580
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:31,040
asleep by two at night so I could wake
up and actually try and do this thing at

1581
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:33,050
some point remotely near Monday morning.

1582
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:35,420
I hope you enjoyed this podcast this week.

1583
01:35:35,421 --> 01:35:38,390
I hope you guys had a great
Labor Day weekend. I apologize.

1584
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:40,130
I can't believe I deleted that,

1585
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:44,390
that rant at debt boxer was doing.
It was fucking great.

1586
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:45,770
The coach look out for him.

1587
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,400
He's a tough man and evidently he's
ready for more cause he only started

1588
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:53,000
bleeding. He always started
bleeding. All right, that's it.

1589
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:56,180
Please continue to listen to the
podcast. I'm going to be at the, um,

1590
01:35:57,290 --> 01:36:00,680
helium comedy club this weekend
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

1591
01:36:00,681 --> 01:36:05,600
Please come down to the show and
also, uh, please join my mailing list.

1592
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,620
I never bring that up.

1593
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:10,250
I would like to get more people on my
mailing list because my space is really

1594
01:36:10,251 --> 01:36:14,960
dying. A slow, pitiful death. I barely
get any emails over there anymore.

1595
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:19,190
And um, I don't know where, I
don't know where to go next. Um,

1596
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:22,310
Coz I imagine Facebook will
take a nosedive. Twitter,

1597
01:36:22,311 --> 01:36:25,370
we'll take a nose dive and his whole
jumping around is driving me fucking nuts.

1598
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:29,690
I figured out how to blog here on my
website and I'm going to start blogging,

1599
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:34,640
actually began one about Sweden
that I will finish and um,

1600
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,290
hopefully I'll get some
new videos up there,

1601
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:39,410
but it's a billboard.com if you
could go on and you sign up,

1602
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:44,440
you just sign up for my mailing list
underneath the city that you're closest to

1603
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,433
and

1604
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:46,650
okay.

1605
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:49,980
Basically I only send you emails if I'm
coming to your town or if I'm going to

1606
01:36:49,981 --> 01:36:50,760
be on TV.

1607
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,940
I'm not going to be one of
these douchebags who every
week gives you the bill

1608
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:58,770
burr update and then I become spam in
your life. It's not going to be that way,

1609
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:03,771
but please sign up for it because my days
on my space might be numbered because

1610
01:37:03,781 --> 01:37:06,360
I don't, I don't, I don't know
that there's anybody left.

1611
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:11,340
I'm really feeling like fucking Mad Max
and I'm there looking for fuel. You know,

1612
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:15,930
it's just whores and uh,
people sell in music.

1613
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:20,670
That's all that's left and me, you know,
tumbleweeds over there. People. All right.

1614
01:37:20,671 --> 01:37:24,300
That's it. That's a podcast for this week.
Please tune in next week. Wait a second,

1615
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:26,460
wait a second. Did you want to
chime in with something? Nia?

1616
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:26,781
Well,

1617
01:37:26,781 --> 01:37:31,390
I'm just surprised you didn't talk about
Tila Tequila being shocked by that NFL

1618
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:32,443
football player.

1619
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:37,390
Oh, that's right. Shawne Merriman
choked out. Tila Tequila, you know I,

1620
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,380
well Susan [inaudible]
she probably deserved it.

1621
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:44,100
Exactly.
Fucking asshole.

1622
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:49,950
What do you mean it's a podcast?
I got to make it funny.

1623
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:51,523
Yeah.

1624
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:56,280
I don't like how you actually have my,
you actually have my voice

1625
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:59,250
down. Like you actually know
what I'm going to say. No,

1626
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:00,120
that's not what I was going to say.

1627
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:04,050
I was going to say before I was so
rudely interrupted with your completely

1628
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:07,650
offensive, I don't like how you know,
you, have you noticed that with women,

1629
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:10,350
whenever they do an impression of their
boyfriend, they always have to go,

1630
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:11,440
Ooh,

1631
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:15,910
before they say anything. I wanted to go
out to go to a restaurant and you know,

1632
01:38:15,911 --> 01:38:18,520
my boyfriend said he was going
to take me and I was like,

1633
01:38:18,521 --> 01:38:20,320
so we're going to go to the
restaurant and he's all right.

1634
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,220
Football game.

1635
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:24,893
Okay.

1636
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:28,720
I know. My impression of you
is really bad. It is bad.

1637
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,780
Do you want to go to a party this weekend?
My girlfriends

1638
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,473
in a while ago.

1639
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:41,610
What? Ben Roethlisberger Ah,
that was, that was, that was
us. That was a cash grab.

1640
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:45,150
He raped me.
Ben Roethlisberger

1641
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:48,390
well do you feel like, like the whole,
my whole big thing with the dogs.

1642
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:51,080
Why don't you come over here near the
microphone if you're actually going to

1643
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:55,710
come in here and high jacket is my lovely
girlfriend. Nia. Everybody. Hi. Hey.

1644
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,500
Let me just do this as like an interview,
like a little Dick Cavett thing. What,

1645
01:38:58,501 --> 01:38:59,800
what was your question here?
Uh,

1646
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:04,940
my question was in regards to
the football player who, uh,

1647
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:09,420
allegedly choked out to what
Tequila, um, and, and other,

1648
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:13,230
why you being so official?
The question that I had this afternoon.

1649
01:39:13,231 --> 01:39:17,400
And first of all, I just must say I love
the show and I'm really active listener.

1650
01:39:17,401 --> 01:39:21,780
First time caller. Uh, no, but
do you think, cause I feel like,

1651
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:23,940
and I guess we'll see. Please
get to the point, ma'am.

1652
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,740
We'll see how the story develops.

1653
01:39:25,741 --> 01:39:30,660
But like do you feel like the Michael
Vick thing got more attention then when

1654
01:39:30,661 --> 01:39:35,000
athletes have like sort of like these
abuse charges putting aside? Cool.

1655
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:35,893
First of all,

1656
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:41,120
Shawne Merriman didn't have like 40 my
space horse hung from trees that he was

1657
01:39:41,131 --> 01:39:43,320
electrocuted and drowning.
Okay.

1658
01:39:43,321 --> 01:39:47,850
He choked out one dumb whore with
a fake tits of bisexual hort. That,

1659
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:51,630
and I have to say that I can,
I fucking hate the San Diego chargers,

1660
01:39:51,631 --> 01:39:56,160
but my hatred went down a
little bit knowing that he
slapped her on Tila Tequila.

1661
01:39:56,161 --> 01:40:00,270
It's just funny if she was, if
she was just, you know, a regular,

1662
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:04,620
you know, Girl from Hooters
whose dad didn't stick around.

1663
01:40:04,621 --> 01:40:09,480
So she felt the need to dress
around scantily clad and
try to get guys attention.

1664
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:14,090
You want to see my clam. If she was one
of those people, that's a woman say, Huh?

1665
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,920
Do you think that's a woman's
say? Well, I'll tell you this.

1666
01:40:16,921 --> 01:40:18,740
I'll tell you this right
now and I might get an I.

1667
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:21,720
Am I getting in trouble here as I
weighed into these dangerous waters?

1668
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:24,740
Women don't say clam.
They don't refer to it as a clam.

1669
01:40:24,741 --> 01:40:28,350
So how would you know that? Because
I'm a woman. You asshole. Well,

1670
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:33,420
well first of all, oh,
you're storming out.

1671
01:40:33,421 --> 01:40:35,940
You're going to take off your
little lapel mic and just walk out.

1672
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:40,980
All right. Obviously I know they don't
do that. Get back here. You can't.

1673
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:45,330
You can't just leave like
that. No, they don't say,

1674
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:47,100
I'm going to show you my clamp,
but I will tell you this.

1675
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:48,720
When women get fake tits,

1676
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:52,080
they will show you them like they got
their nails done because obviously it was

1677
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:53,740
a very insecure part of their body,

1678
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,870
so now they have it and they will.

1679
01:40:56,810 --> 01:41:01,150
It's so easy to even be able
to touch them. Did you just,

1680
01:41:01,151 --> 01:41:05,080
all you gotta do is like what their big
paranoia is now that they have them,

1681
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:07,720
they want you to tell
them that they feel real.

1682
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:12,040
So all you gotta do is just
be like, uh, you know, other,

1683
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:16,030
they look really natural at the,
do you feel like they feel oh yeah,

1684
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:19,660
here and they just grab your hand for
some reason because their hand is on your

1685
01:41:19,661 --> 01:41:20,200
hand.

1686
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:25,200
They don't feel like you're
actually feeling them up
before you felt a fake boob

1687
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:27,770
before.
Okay.

1688
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,960
Girl that I used to work with had um,

1689
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,940
fake boobs and she was just
talking about it I guess.

1690
01:41:32,941 --> 01:41:37,510
Like sometimes they do and I was like, Oh
really? And she was like, yeah, feel them.

1691
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:41,940
They felt, yeah, see where they
go. It's actually like nice.

1692
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:44,700
I haven't really felt a lot of boobs.

1693
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:49,280
Well when you say nice, what do they,
what do they felt like a bag of sand

1694
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:55,200
both full and nice and just bucks to
me and soft, you know, like a woman

1695
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:59,120
really. I came in here to
talk about, no, I'm actually,

1696
01:41:59,121 --> 01:42:02,510
I'm getting turned on by this. This is
like, well, this is really good. You know,

1697
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,040
I gotta tell you got a lot
of creeps or listen to this.

1698
01:42:04,041 --> 01:42:07,010
So they probably touching themselves
right now. I know they drive trucks.

1699
01:42:07,370 --> 01:42:11,840
Help out a little. No, I'm not going to
haul out my girlfriend and my own podcast.

1700
01:42:11,841 --> 01:42:13,760
You're a good girl, right? Say it.

1701
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:19,460
What do you, wait a minute. What are
you, this is what you do with the office.

1702
01:42:19,461 --> 01:42:23,330
You go around filling up girls
with fake tits. The office were,

1703
01:42:23,331 --> 01:42:27,830
where was it when you were at fucking
in a Bill Haley swimming pool down the

1704
01:42:27,831 --> 01:42:29,870
street.
I can never remember people's names.

1705
01:42:29,871 --> 01:42:34,040
What's the name of the fucking guy
who has playboy? Hector Camacho.

1706
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:36,890
What's his name? Hugh
Hefner. I knew there was an h

1707
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:43,080
nine I'm brutal one. That's one of
the on long. Hector Camacho was a box,

1708
01:42:43,081 --> 01:42:47,540
so that's one of the long standing jokes
in our relationship is how this is.

1709
01:42:47,541 --> 01:42:52,370
What happens is I can never remember
famous people's names. So I just,

1710
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:55,970
whatever the first name that comes
to my mind or the names of movies,

1711
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:59,970
like my boy, I called that movie the last
days of Dracula. What was the name of,

1712
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:03,800
whoa. What was that movie
interview with the Vampire?

1713
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,010
I called it the last days.
The last day is a Dracula.

1714
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,780
That was a classic. We have a lot of fun
out here. Don't wait. Seals at the gym.

1715
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:18,040
All right, well we're gonna wrap
up the podcast. Look up cute.

1716
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:22,010
Cleo is over there with the ears
down. Yeah, she's a cutie. All right.

1717
01:43:22,011 --> 01:43:26,420
That's the it. That's it for the podcast.
She got a little bonus interview. Um,

1718
01:43:26,421 --> 01:43:28,790
and that's it. I want to thank, once
again. Everybody came out in Sweden.

1719
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:29,840
I'm definitely going to come back.

1720
01:43:29,841 --> 01:43:33,170
They were always talking about bringing
me back there and everybody in Philly,

1721
01:43:33,171 --> 01:43:36,110
I run a new hour. I'm going to be
there. Please sign up for my, my, uh,

1722
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:40,130
my website and a, yeah, if there's girls
out there was fake tits. I'm telling you,

1723
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:42,170
you don't have to ask too many
questions and I'll find, you know,

1724
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:46,040
there's actually a good chance they'll
take them out if you're in like a ground

1725
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:46,460
round,

1726
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:49,430
one of those kinds of restaurants where
in that restaurant where it was like,

1727
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,040
I don't know how they
didn't shut down by the

1728
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:56,100
health department with all those crushed
peanut shells on the floor. You know,

1729
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:58,370
you walk into a barbershop,
they get a sweep up the hair.

1730
01:43:58,371 --> 01:44:01,470
How about you sweep up the peanuts?
You fucking disgusting cuts. All right.

1731
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,770
Have a good week. I'll talk
to you later. Bye. Bye.

1732
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:19,683
Yeah.

1733
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:34,793
Okay.

1734
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:21,870
Yeah.
