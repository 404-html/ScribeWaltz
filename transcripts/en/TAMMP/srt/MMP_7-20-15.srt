1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,790
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:06,210
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,850
I don't know. A fucking day. And it was a
July 20th is that what it's going to be?

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,990
Is that what it's Gunna be? Pow. Yeah,

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,690
that's what it's going
to be at Sunday night.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,440
July 19th one I'm doing this.
I am an Ottawa.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,350
I'm in my hotel room. I am stone
sober. They have Cuban cigars here.

8
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,520
I have not smoked one.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,420
And I'm sitting in bed right now with a
plate full of raw vegetables that were

10
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:40,080
supposed to come with hummus but
came with ranch dressing instead.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,560
So I'm trying to avoid that so I can hum
somehow make my goal of being down to a

12
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,070
buck 80 this week, which I
think I am. I think I am,

13
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:54,630
but I don't have access to a fucking
scale here. Uh, that's what it is.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,250
That's where I'm at.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,240
This is what Busan and eating pizza and
bear and all this other fucking horse

16
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:03,780
shit. This is where it
gets you. At some point,

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,260
you got to pay the Piper and sit here
with a bunch of vegetables eating.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,110
There's fucking crap.
Oh,

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,020
or a punch or rabbit right now. I don't
even know why. It's not their fault.

20
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,670
It's not their fault that I ate the
way I have a like a fucking rabbit.

21
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:24,670
Then you know.
Oh fucking no.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,650
I don't know. I was so excited
like a minute ago. Now I'm
just fucking, you know,

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,290
I'm just so,
what's the point of living

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,670
if you're not killing yourself slowly,
what is the point of live?

25
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:43,150
What is the point of living? It's,
think about it. All this shit that,

26
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:46,570
you know what that's going to kill you
someday. That's the best fucking time,

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,170
right? Smoking, drinking, eating.

28
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,930
Fucking some whore. Raw. No, sorry.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,410
I need to watch my mouth here because
I'm in a nice hotel. I just don't want,

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,090
I don't want to disturb
the people around us.

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,673
So anyways,

32
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,260
there's just one of these deals. This
sucks right now, but in the morning I'm,

33
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,480
I'm going to be psyched. You
know? Oh, I wanted a burger.

34
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,590
Oh Billy fucking pasty.
Flabby tits. Wanted a burger.

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,380
No Burger for you. There will be no burger
for you. I'm not going to eat or drink.

36
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:24,680
The entire podcast, but I
just had some salary. Right?

37
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,781
Which salary?

38
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:31,040
I think this chemical makeup is like
air and water as far as I know with some

39
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,960
green dye number five.

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,550
But I got one of those salary hairs in
the back of my throat right now. Ah,

41
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:42,230
you fucking Veggie cons. How do you guys
do it? You know, like a true vegetarian?

42
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:46,100
Well, they don't sit around eating this
shit. They actually have better meals. Um,

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,850
you know, I love when you
meet like a fat vegetarian.

44
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:53,210
It's just like you're fucking
yourself over on two levels right now.

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,553
You know what I mean?

46
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,760
It's like you're not eating meat and that
sucks and then you're not even eating

47
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,340
good food. You just sitting
there eating like Doritos.

48
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,270
It's actually good. Don't tell them
you know, it's too many fucking people.

49
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:07,530
Let them die.
That's what I say.

50
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,220
Okay.

51
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,510
Is that what you say? Oh, that's what
I say on my podcast. That's what I say.

52
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,530
Let the fat vegetarians who don't
know how to eat right, let them die.

53
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,310
I implore the next leader of our great
nation of the United States of America,

54
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,900
of the Americas of America,

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,800
please just let him die.
Okay.

56
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,300
I don't mean people, diseases,
let's try to help that shit.

57
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,970
But if you just shove and she,
well wait a minute,

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,050
maybe that's how you got the disease.
Cause he kept shoving shit. Okay.

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,690
Down your fucking throat.
Let them die.

60
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,660
That's what I've always running for
president. That would be my campaign,

61
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,430
a message.
And I would,

62
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,020
I would contact hootie and the
blowfish and I would get those.

63
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:58,790
Ask him if I could have the rights
to uh, let her cry. And I would just,

64
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,400
uh, I would just have it, let,
let them die and said, and I,

65
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,740
I'd contact the black dude who's name
is not hoodie. Was it Frank Gifford?

66
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,990
I don't know his fucking name is what?
I think Frank Gifford,

67
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,270
Dustin something or other,
uh, what is this fucking name?

68
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:18,870
I have it. Darrius Rucker, right? I did,

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,890
I'm go and if Mary Parker and Shit,

70
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,520
Oh,

71
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,010
you did a lot of fucking wine in the raw.

72
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,170
What a fucking genius that guy was.

73
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,050
He saw the writing on the wall and
he was just like, you know what,

74
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:39,760
we made our money. I'm fucking out and
I'm African American and I am going,

75
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,790
I am steering my creative ship into
the overt heart of white racism and I'm

76
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,270
going to put out a country album. The
God damn it, I'm going to be successful.

77
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:52,630
And he did it.
The fucking guy did it.

78
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,281
They did.

79
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:58,540
The white version of that is if you
played a Ukulele and one of those fucking,

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,020
you know those,
those bands were chicks with dirty feet,

81
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,950
sit there and watch them after they
take off their boots and you fucking,

82
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:09,730
you just put out like a,
a rap album and crushed it,

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,820
you know? And all you did
was said he like he just put,

84
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:15,160
he put on like a trucker cap.
Like that was his big thing.

85
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:19,360
So you'd still dressed the way you dressed
and you just put on like a do rag or

86
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,860
something, you know, and you went from
singing about the Appalachian trail

87
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,820
to wrap it up. [inaudible] what
would you rap about dope? Yeah.

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,680
Ukuleles.

89
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,730
You face airbrushed on the back of
it, you know, and just come out,

90
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,070
you know,
I want to see so many do that.

91
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:45,250
Go down on one of those eight mile open
mikes and I want you to come down with a

92
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:49,330
custom Ukulele. A do rag.
Why does health you gotta be,

93
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,090
I was going to say at least as wide as me,

94
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,950
but I mean at that point
going into albinos border.

95
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:57,910
You've gotta be super white and I want
to see you go to and just how long you

96
00:05:57,911 --> 00:06:02,590
can fuck in La, which is all they're
going to do is Bo. Come on man.

97
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:04,000
You can take a good boy and right.

98
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,830
Go down there and fucking
have one of your buddies.

99
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:08,230
Airbrushed yourself in an arm,

100
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:12,940
the shit pose and just come walking out
what you do rag and you fucking Ukulele

101
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:16,090
and just have it flipped over so they
can see your face and just have a dead

102
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:21,091
serious look on your face like you are
about to blow everybody's fucking minds

103
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,660
and then wrap over the Ukulele. It
just see how long you can go. Why not?

104
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,240
Okay.

105
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,040
Why the fuck not, oh, I'm
babbling. I'm babbling. And Ottawa.

106
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,750
Is that a Meg Ryan movie?
He's Tom Hanks. Is he lonely?

107
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,210
Is he going to come up and bang
her out there on the canal?

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,960
They never show the bagging and
those Tom Hanks. Meg Ryan movies.

109
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,810
That's why they never rang true for me.
It's like I get it.

110
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:50,310
You're finding love and all that,
but at some point you do got to fuck.

111
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,460
And I'm not seeing it,
so I'm calling bullshit.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,260
You know more reducible.
Oh yeah. Kim Coleman,

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,770
I call bullshit.
I don't think,

114
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,620
I don't think that's sleepless
in Seattle story ever happened?

115
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,313
No.

116
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,360
Why am I eating vegetables
on fucking pocket?

117
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,320
Okay.

118
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,600
Do you know a lot of the train
conductors say eat while they do the

119
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:18,980
announcements?
That's why you can't hear him.

120
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,230
Can you just shove a bunch of
food in the mouth like no. No,

121
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,780
no.
Wow.

122
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,490
Is there anything worse
than no fucking tomato?

123
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,820
Maybe they were in season up here. I
don't fucking fuck fucking tomatoes, man.

124
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:41,000
Unless you pull them out of your
yard. What are you getting? All right,

125
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,360
don't worry.
I'm gonna

126
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,890
take it away from the microphone.
If you're still listening to this,

127
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,920
I want you to call suicide hotlines.

128
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,940
Oh fuck.
Am I sober and awake?

129
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,600
Jesus Christ. You don't want you,
first of all, I had, I had a lunch.

130
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,070
I had a rough one coming in here.
Um,

131
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,660
I left lax.
Oh my God.

132
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,820
I went down to lax to get on Air Canada.

133
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,150
We have a leaf on the tail that represents
what a nation's about throw when some

134
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:32,560
syrup and some mild racism and a couple
of terrorists trying to cross the

135
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:34,990
border.
We play hockey.

136
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,910
And that ice shovel board that
I can't remember the name of.

137
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,420
Who is our president.

138
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,210
No one fucking cares.

139
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Keep heading north and your mates
Santa Claus or good mauled by a fork.

140
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,360
A polar bear, that fog
to grizzly bear. Great.

141
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,570
That's everything I know about Canada
next year. Polar bears and grizzly bears,

142
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:04,890
they have fucked at this point.

143
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,940
Like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan never
did in sleepless in Seattle.

144
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,450
And they had a, they had a
goal of bear or a, uh, uh,

145
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,010
a fucking pissy. You gotta
go, go, go. They're busy.

146
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,903
That's a bad one.

147
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,580
That Kit's going to get that little cubs
going to get the shit kicked out of him

148
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:28,570
at school. All right. Hey, you
fucking different man. Right? Um,

149
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,970
anyway, what am I talking
about? So I want to fly in,

150
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,400
right or ride in?
Pilot flies.

151
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,400
I just sit in the back riding in and uh,

152
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,440
we got out onto the tarmac.

153
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,970
That's the word you never want
to hear during your flight.

154
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,860
The second they used the word tarmac,

155
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:51,540
you're going to be delayed
at least two hours. Um,

156
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,410
this, you may have noticed the pilot
is pulled over onto the tarmac.

157
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,851
We're going to be sitting.

158
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:59,970
What do you mean shutting the
engines down here on the tarmac?

159
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,470
I don't even know what the fucking tarmac
is. I have no idea what the fuck it is.

160
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,890
All I know is that means you're going
to sit there for two hours. But, um,

161
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,980
there was all this crazy what?
This crazy fucking

162
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,890
all this thunder and lightening
and all that shit. So I'm like,

163
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:21,270
absolutely Paul over to the side.
I'd rather sit here.

164
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,220
So, um, I sat there and I don't
even know what the fuck I did,

165
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,290
but basically I was supposed to connect
to Toronto to get here to Ottawa and I

166
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,980
miss that connection. And, uh, I was
supposed to be in Ottawa by eight o'clock,

167
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,370
and when I missed my connection so bad
that where they hooked me up on the

168
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,180
flight, the next flight I
left at 10 35 out of Toronto.

169
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,700
Um, so it was brutal, but I didn't die,
so it's fine. You know what I mean?

170
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,310
And at the end of the day,
as long as it was,

171
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:53,610
I still went from La to
Toronto to Ottawa in one day,

172
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,690
which was impossible up until
a couple of decades ago,

173
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,110
right in the 70s. You couldn't do that.
They were, they had to pull over and stop,

174
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,723
you know,

175
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,800
fight off some of indigenous people as
they tried to refuel in some God forsaken

176
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:12,000
place,
like nonstop flights from La to Toronto.

177
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,940
I don't think that started
until the early 90.

178
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:18,390
[inaudible] as far as my Wikipedia
page says, obviously I know that. Well,

179
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,320
when was the last time that you,

180
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,280
what did they first be able to go from
like New York to La without stopping?

181
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,920
I don't know. Bill, why don't you look
it up? Like I said, I don't give a fuck.

182
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,020
I'm just talking filling up fucking time.

183
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,520
I'm filling up your little ride to work
right now. Huh? How's your car doing?

184
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,330
Is it sputtering along? Is it
running good? What is it doing?

185
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,460
Why did you buy that?
Cool. Um, so anyways,

186
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:44,160
on the flight out there,
uh, I watched, uh,

187
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,610
the Maltese Falcon whenever they have
that on there. I loved Humphrey Bogart.

188
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:50,400
And if you're a,
a big Frank Sinatra fan,

189
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,310
frank was a huge fan of Humphrey.
And when you watch Humphrey Bogart,

190
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:59,810
you see a lot of, uh,
elements of his swagger, uh,

191
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,440
in s Sinatra's style.
And I have to tell you right now,

192
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:05,900
if you're trying to quit
smoking and drinking,

193
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,730
do not repeat.
Do not watch the Maltese Falcon.

194
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,530
Do Not Watch that movie.

195
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,420
Humphrey Bogart makes smoking and
drinking look like the greatest thing ever

196
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,050
before you like, Oh, you sure you
know that guy died of lung cancer?

197
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:25,280
I know he smoked camels
unfiltered like a fucking chimney.

198
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,930
Do you know what else he did? He became
one of the biggest stars in Hollywood.

199
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:34,490
Has ever known any fucking,
was he hooked up with the,

200
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,570
was it bogeying Bacall Lauren Bacall
when she was like 19, she was like,

201
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:42,230
that is a fucking stellar human being.
He was in his forties

202
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
and they will fuck it.
Inseparable.

203
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,370
They loved each other and he never
wanted to go out. She always,

204
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,630
there's two couples that I fucking,
I that I love.

205
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,750
Bogeying Bacall and a Paul
Newman and Joanne Woodward.

206
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,330
They somehow they fucking made it.
Now obviously Bogart died.

207
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:00,740
So that really helps to marriage,

208
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:04,100
but fucking Newman and
Woodward fucking made it. Um,

209
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,710
put anyways, this fucking guy is
just rolling his own cigarettes,

210
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,150
which wasn't bad.

211
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,540
But at one point in the movie when
he sits down with the fat man there,

212
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,000
he and he hands him a fucking torpedo
cigar. And if you look at the master,

213
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,770
the master shot,
which is basically a,

214
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,120
how do I describe it? Jesus Christ, I've
been in a couple of movies I should know.

215
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,430
This is the master shot is
like whatever the scene is.

216
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,430
That's the wide shot where you see the,
where they are.

217
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,580
Everybody that's basically in the shot.
That is the master shot.

218
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,760
They usually shoot that first
and then they go, all right,

219
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:41,320
coming around to your point of view,

220
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,300
his point of view we're
going to do is to show,

221
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:46,300
we'll do a three quarter of
dual fucking close up and all,

222
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:48,460
it's all up to the director,
but the master shot,

223
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,240
if you look at the other shots that,
not smoking but in the master shot,

224
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:54,340
they're actually smoking cigars,

225
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,660
well acting and make it one of the
great movies of all fucking time.

226
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:00,471
It's one of the,
I just,

227
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:04,590
that's all I think of when I see that I
want an acting gig where I just get that

228
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,600
on the master. I get to smoke a fucking
great cigar that so that they, ah,

229
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,460
it's so fucking phenomenal movie.

230
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,280
And I think one of the most
underrated actors of all time,

231
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:14,510
even always a considered a legend.

232
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:17,060
I think he's one of the best actors of
all time is a, I hope we say his name.

233
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,580
Peter Lawford I think is awesome.
And,

234
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:24,110
and the guy who plays the fat man in the,
I should know all these people's names.

235
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,580
He's fucking amazing. Just the sound
of his voice, the way he plays it,

236
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,100
the way he's just such an even keeled
emotional person with everybody else's

237
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,200
kind of erratic and a,
it's a fucking awesome movie.

238
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,900
But if you stopped smoking and drinking,
I mean it's fucking brutal.

239
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,780
That's back in the day.
Can you imagine back in the day,

240
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,380
like if you just walked in to get car
insurance and the guy sitting to cry,

241
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:50,350
you want to drink? Yeah, let's
fuck. That's fucking Dylan.

242
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,300
I just gives you a shot.
There's no drinking and driving.

243
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,260
There's no laws against it. There's
no breathalyzer. There's nothing.

244
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:01,890
There's no airbags.
Fucking water's fine.

245
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:06,690
The fucking food hasn't been genetically
altered. You just walk in places, hey,

246
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:10,200
you want something to speed?
Was doing smoker drank back then?

247
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,340
You weren't an addict,

248
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,270
you would just consider it an adult if
you couldn't get your shit together.

249
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:18,510
[inaudible] he's a drunk. He's the
town drunk. It's a fucking wine.

250
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:21,930
I'll get your shit together right now.

251
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:25,860
Everybody's a fucking addict in
it isn't their fault. I Dunno.

252
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,760
I guess I understand that. Um, with drugs,

253
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,800
I certainly understand that
with drugs and alcohol.

254
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,880
I've lost some friends to that shit,
but I got to say what the food stuff,

255
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,200
you know, I don't, I
don't know about that one.

256
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,810
It's just kinda like,

257
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,630
okay,

258
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,080
just eat a salad. My
oversimplify. It really is,

259
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,510
I guess that's say who an
alcoholic just don't drink.

260
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,490
But you really just got like,

261
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,900
I'm trying to say this in an empowering
way to like tonight I wanted a burger.

262
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,330
I wanted to fucking ribs.
I wanted all of that shit.

263
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,680
And you just got to get past
that dumb thought and think like,

264
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:08,270
do I really want to have to do,
do I like going to the gym now?

265
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,480
Do I want to go on the elliptical
for the rest of my life? No.

266
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,980
Just throw a couple of celery sticks
down your fucking pie hole and then that,

267
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:18,680
that craving will be good. Like right
now, I'm not even thinking about a steak.

268
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,140
All I'm thinking right now is how awful
vegetables taste. But you know what?

269
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,220
That'll be fine. What I'm looking at my
options call a, if I was a vegetable,

270
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:32,720
I'd be called a flower. Isn't that sad?
Like the ugliest vegetable there is?

271
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,400
I had a green one the other day. You
know something? If I wasn't so stoic,

272
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:38,840
I'd start fucking crying right now.

273
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:43,490
Just the last couple of days of eating
has been fucking brutal. However, um,

274
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,930
that's not what I came here to talk about
everybody. I came here to talk about,

275
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,423
um,

276
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,700
okay,

277
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,140
how I was in Ottawa tonight.
And it's hilarious. My agent
goes to me, he goes, hey,

278
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,580
before you do the Montreal comedy
festival on Monday, there's this Gig,

279
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,690
um,
there's Blues Festival in Ottawa.

280
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,760
Deep Purple's going to be there, Yada
yell at type of Shit. So I go, yeah man,

281
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,370
fuck it. I'll do that. When I was
in Reno, there was a blues festival.

282
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,690
All of a sudden, I don't know about
a week, it was like months ago,

283
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,220
about a week out.
I,

284
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:22,140
the fucking word comes in that a dead.

285
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:26,280
It's actually, it's outside and I'm
going to be going on in between bands.

286
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,250
I'm like, what the fuck was, I call
it my age and I was just like, dude,

287
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,380
I'm not trying to be a diva here, but
uh, then we already pay these dues.

288
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,970
I thought I already,
I already did these.

289
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:40,710
I did these gigs to not have to do
them again. Right. He's like, no, no,

290
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:43,440
it's going to be great. It's going
to be great. Saget did it last year.

291
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,480
He had a great fucking time. And I'm
like, this thing is outside. Yes,

292
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,320
it's outside. I go on
in between bands. Yes.

293
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,670
You go on in between bands and I'm
like, and it's good. And he's like, yes,

294
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,440
it's good. Trust me. It's good.

295
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,400
Now I assume most of you guys will
listen to this or not stand up comedians,

296
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:05,960
but any standup comic who is listening
to this right now is like going either

297
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:10,280
laughing or going, no, don't take
the Gig. So I fucking show up.

298
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,850
Okay.

299
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,730
And, um, you know,

300
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:19,731
weird Al Yankovic had gone on like at
like five in the afternoon when it was hot

301
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,040
as shit. He's putting on all
these fucking costumes and stuff.

302
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,940
So he's laughing about it and we're
having to fight and I'm standing there

303
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,630
looking out in the crowd and uh,

304
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,790
Bachman Turner overdrives
play it on the other side.

305
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,680
It's one of those things where they got
two stages going when they finished,

306
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,180
then I go up and then the next band,

307
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:41,070
so they are out there and I'm just
looking at a bunch of, there's no chairs.

308
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,360
It's the summer, so it's
still fucking, you know,

309
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:49,860
broad day light and it's
fucking McGee as shit, you know.

310
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:50,900
And Bob Bachman,

311
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,090
I guess Bachman's the only guy left and
he's on the other side of the fucking

312
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:54,924
parking lot

313
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,800
from alarm clocks border.

314
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,540
Well, I'm just sitting there
taking this all in and going,

315
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,840
I am going to eat my fucking ball.
I'm going to bomb.

316
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,150
This is going to be a fucking nightmare.
And I was gone out of that. Good.

317
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,020
They're good. So, uh, anyways,

318
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,700
they ended up bringing me up. This radio
guy brings me up fucking amazing voice.

319
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,270
What I want to fly. I'm like,
guys, sounds like amazing, right?

320
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,590
Brings me up.
And I come walking out there and uh,

321
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:33,591
the whole crowd cheered and it was ended
up being this fucking amazing show.

322
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,360
And I was really kind of waiting for two,
uh,

323
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,590
in the first eight minutes I was waiting
for it to go bad and it was fucking

324
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:44,820
amazing. And then I was outside and I
started thinking about Robin Williams.

325
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,610
Uh, all those shows, he did perform
for the troops. Those were outside.

326
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,490
And uh, I don't know, I'm middle of
it. I got like about 10 minutes in,

327
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:58,290
I got inspired to like really quit
being a fucking baby about this thing.

328
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,820
Um, cause you know, you get out there, you
know, if you think somebody's coming at,

329
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,430
you want to start fucking lashing
out of people before they get you and

330
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,810
everything. And uh, reminds
me this, this faith,

331
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:12,300
there's this famous story about
Robin Williams. Um, Joe Barton.

332
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:17,100
Nick told me it and um, you
know, he was royalty. Um,

333
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,350
Robin Williams in San Francisco.

334
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,830
So I guess there was some sort of
concert that was supposed to happen,

335
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,710
some huge band and everyone's
standing outside, you know,

336
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,310
some giant fucking venue
waiting to see this band.

337
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,550
But it started raining and lightening
and all this shit's of the band couldn't

338
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:34,860
go on and everybody was getting upset.

339
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:39,480
But I guess Robin Williams was in the
crowd was there for the show and he just

340
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:40,440
said fuck it.

341
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,560
And went on stage for like an hour or an
hour and a half and just did a off the,

342
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,160
you know,
the top,

343
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,060
his head comedy show fucking destroyed.
And in the end of his show,

344
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:55,660
the sun started coming out,
the crowd went fucking nuts.

345
00:20:55,661 --> 00:21:00,040
And then he brought the band on and um,
I don't know,

346
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,530
he told me that says that that's one
of the coolest fucking things ever.

347
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:05,180
You know, somewhere in the middle of it.
And I started thinking about this, that,

348
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,520
that story. But anyways, I want to
thank everybody from Ottawa and in,

349
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,280
in and around Ottawa who came out
to the show. You guys had no chairs.

350
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:16,730
You stood up for an hour. I had
a fucking great time. And uh,

351
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,040
while I was doing it, the sun was
going down in the sky was amazing.

352
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,660
I kept making fun of that. Like I'd be in
the middle of a joke. Right? Tell a joke.

353
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,990
Yeah. It's my fucking wife of Blah Blah.
To Go, Oh God, how great was that breeze?

354
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,020
I was saying all this shit I'd
never said in 23 years on stage.

355
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,310
How great was that?

356
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,340
How great is the breeze
a look at those clouds?

357
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,760
Somebody take a picture and shy. That was,
it was unreal. It was a phenomenal gig.

358
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And to make it even even better was a,

359
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,300
believe it or not, the, uh, um,

360
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,570
the company that we hired
to animate F is for family,

361
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:59,350
which is coming out in December,
is actually in Ottawa.

362
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,300
So I went over there today and I met
everybody and they were all cool as hell

363
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,570
and young and they thought the
show was fucking hilarious.

364
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:12,430
And it wasn't like anything they had
ever seen. So, and I, and I met this,

365
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,420
this one woman who was, I'm not,
I'm not giving away any of the show,

366
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,670
but was animating this
really fucked up scene.

367
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,500
And I was laughing that she got to see
just because of what the scene was about

368
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,780
and her being a woman. And
she said, and I was like,

369
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:28,450
how did you end up getting this?
She said, I actually requested it.

370
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:31,720
I wanted to animate this scene.
And I got to tell you guys,

371
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:36,100
I don't talk to any shit. I'm not as
well, who's kidding, who I fuck around?

372
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:39,250
But I'd like when I talk about my career,
I don't talk about any ship,

373
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:41,710
but I will just say this,
I was very,

374
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,390
very excited when I left those studio,

375
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,590
that studio today. And I think,
I think this show's going to be,

376
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,980
I think this is the one is far as I found
the right thing where I can be funny

377
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,110
the way I'm funny and standup
and funny on the fucking podcast.

378
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:06,880
I can be that kind of funny on TV.
Um,

379
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,310
so I don't even feel like I'm jinxing it.
I'm one of those fucking old ladies,

380
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,990
like don't say that. Then you're going
to fucking jinx it. I think it's fucking,

381
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,780
it's really coming out.
Well,

382
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:21,010
I'm trying to fucking not be
too fucking excited, but uh,

383
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,790
just do me do me a solid you guys.
When that fucking thing comes out,

384
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,400
just watch it on Netflix.

385
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,720
Just fucking watch it so we
get good numbers because,
uh, and then if you like it,

386
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:32,920
please tell some other people.

387
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:35,380
I don't think I'm going to have to
ask you to do that. Ft. Watch it.

388
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,610
I'm just saying that right now. Oh,
Billy is talking a little shit here.

389
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,980
Talking a little bit of Shit then
that's all I fucking need, right?

390
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,110
I do stand up and then I do this
fucking off the wall cartoon.

391
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,830
I call it a day.
Call it a day,

392
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,020
do a good five seasons of that.
And then I fucking happy trails.

393
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,240
I go by my fucking ranch in Alabama.

394
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,610
I'll see you get the NHL package,
the MLB package, the fucking,

395
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,900
uh, the fucking, one of the basketball
one is, I'll get the college one too.

396
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,560
I'll get the fucking end league pass,
NFL pass, whatever the fuck it is.

397
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:16,940
I'm getting all of those. All right.
And then I'm getting me a case.

398
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:21,710
A fucking bear. That's it.
Get me a case of fucking beer

399
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,500
and then I'm going to fucking,

400
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,870
I'm going to join the Klan when I'm
down there and I'm going to see,

401
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,430
I'm going to be like,
see if I can like talk people out of it.

402
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,030
Just show up to meetings and sort of nod
as people are talking and just sorta be

403
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:40,830
like, damn, I ain't know me. I'm just
doing it. Then that, that back of mine,

404
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:44,930
you know, just, I'm just saying, I'm
just saying and you know, it's funny.

405
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:47,510
That's what every group needs.
Even if you have a good cause,

406
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:50,480
you need somebody in there that does not
share your point of view because if you

407
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:54,820
don't, you go off the fucking
rails. That's what the Klan needs.

408
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:59,821
The Klan needs some members that don't
hate black people just to fucking spin

409
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,840
them back into reality.

410
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,570
Yeah.

411
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,510
When should think like these feminists
groups, that's what the fuck they need.

412
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,000
They need some fucking jerk off guy
like me in there just to fucking,

413
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:16,050
you know the kid. You can't be in a group
where everybody thinks the same way.

414
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:17,550
You spin off down the fucking wheel.

415
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,540
It's like when conspiracy theorists get
together a fucking eyebrows shoot up to

416
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,820
the ceiling. Next thing
you know, we're, we're,

417
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,550
we're talking about ad
everything was an inside job.

418
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,160
You need somebody there to
be like, guys, guys, guys.

419
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:34,050
Do you realize how many people would
have to be involved to pull that off?

420
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,990
And everybody keeps their fucking
mouth shut and then you can be all,

421
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:41,270
you know what? You're right. You're
right. We got a little out of hand there.

422
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,340
We got a little out of hand.

423
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,750
Maybe I'll drive by heckling
clan meetings in the south.

424
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,100
Just drive by it. Not that bad.
If you get to know some paypal,

425
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,350
I wouldn't agree with that.
I have experiences that are like that

426
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,160
anyways. Um, I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

427
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:08,920
Let's do some reads this week.
Um,

428
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,130
fucking draft kings has
been breaking my balls.

429
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,960
Just breaking my fucking balls.
I love draft kings.

430
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,700
I don't know what they're fucking play.
Don't like that.

431
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:22,960
I make a joke that they're a fucking
gambling website. They don't like it.

432
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,340
I keep getting the, like I got a text they
said earlier this week, just, you know,

433
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:30,700
we love the reads. Just don't say
that we're a gambling website.

434
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,040
Just say that we're, it's more of a
skill based thing. It's just like what?

435
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:40,360
What are you talking about? It's
like you're, you're gambling.

436
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,010
You've combined a fantasy
fantasy football with,

437
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,880
with the Vegas sports book.
We're all adults.

438
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,970
I don't have a problem with it. Why can't
you just be who you are? Draft Kings.

439
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,260
This is the fucking letter I
got here. Where is it? Here.

440
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,990
All right. Uh, okay. Just,

441
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:08,040
just sent saying the advertising. Did
you see the email regarding draft kings?

442
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,490
Please remind bill not capital,

443
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:14,580
not to compare draft kings to gambling.

444
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,470
Well Dad, I don't, I don't fucking
get people that, first of all,

445
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,130
gambling is legal. It's legal.
What you're doing is fucking legal.

446
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:24,660
Why are you a shit that's like saying,
you know,

447
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:28,820
we're not having sex with just seeing
how our bodies fit together. Right.

448
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,840
That's probably a bad example.
I gamble.

449
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,270
You don't the Pete Rose Joke. Not only
is it funny, it's fucking make sense.

450
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,350
So I'm going to continue to read it the
way I always fucking read it and then

451
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:45,210
you know, if you don't like it then I
guess you know, go to another podcast.

452
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:48,020
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
This isn't like radio.

453
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:50,120
I can't get fired from
my own fucking show.

454
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,370
Fucking skill based thing.
Yes.

455
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:59,390
What kills me that you're sitting there
is fucking adults and you could just sit

456
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:03,950
there and say that lie. Unless you sat
there in the meeting and you went like,

457
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:04,581
listen guys,

458
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:07,880
this is just bad for business to
say that this is a gambling website,

459
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,360
so let's hope bill is dumb
enough to go along with.

460
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:15,680
It's more of a skill based fucking thing.
Well,

461
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,240
I'm going to keep reading
it the way I read it.

462
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:19,760
What about the Howard Cosell thing
that I do? You don't like that.

463
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,720
If I don't make these things fucking
entertaining advertising people,

464
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:28,721
people just going to fucking fast forward
through said if me undies can roll

465
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:34,430
with sweaty balls and no sweaty clam,
I think he can handle a Pete rose joke.

466
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,040
We're all adults here.
We know what they are.

467
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,080
It's more of a skill based fucking thing.

468
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,200
That's what they used to say in the
football card when I was in high school,

469
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:45,410
when they'd had known that the bookie
give you that on the back it says not to

470
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:49,190
be used for gambling. It's just a skill
based game. We all know what's going on.

471
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,020
All right,
there we go.

472
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,020
That's like the two people at the office
who were fucking and they think nobody

473
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:57,170
knows. Everybody knows that, right? Just
fucking drop your pants and go at it.

474
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,580
All right. Dollar Shave club,
everybody. I got to tell you,

475
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:05,150
shaving the old way sucks a lot.
It hurts.

476
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,660
You lather up with cheap foam wincing.

477
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:12,500
His hair is scraped from your face.
With those old worn out razors,

478
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,370
you won't throw away because
they cost so much goddamn money.

479
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,980
Not Any more dollar shave
club sends amazing razors
for a few bucks and when you

480
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:26,600
use them with their, with their
members, only Dr Covey's easy shave,

481
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,750
it's completely changes the game. Forget
foam. This stuff is the real deal. Yeah.

482
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:36,830
You can't be shaving with foam
mat. You can't do that. It's magic.

483
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:40,940
Something happens when you put it on. It's
hard to describe, but it feels amazing.

484
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,830
It's the most gentle,
peaceful shave imaginable.

485
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,490
Jesus Christ. I want to do this
naked while watching a sunset.

486
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,650
You barely know you shaving other shaving
products can leave your face feeling

487
00:29:56,651 --> 00:30:01,230
dry and tight. It's awful. It
is awful. But Dr Covey's easy,

488
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,800
Shea, it's high quality
stuff. Just like their razors.

489
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,120
It's got organic.

490
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:11,800
All natural ingredients like pear
cactus and black willow bark.

491
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,960
So your skin feels fresh,
smooth and moisturized after every shave.

492
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,350
It's funny if you rubbed any one of
those things up against your face,

493
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,800
you wouldn't like it.
Pear cactus and black willow bark,

494
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,850
but you put them together.

495
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,700
It's like a Reese's peanut butter
cup except it's for your face. Um,

496
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,160
it's great if you have sensitive skin.

Guys,

540
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,510
it's almost fucking August and that
means you're too busy firing up the grill

541
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:34,370
and sunning in the sand to even think
about s setting foot in a mall. Artisans.

542
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:37,670
Does that sound great? If I went to
a barbecue right now, I'd have to,

543
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:42,490
can I get the grilled
veggies? No sauce. Um,

544
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:47,560
the problem is you still need
to look fresh. Oh, Jesus.

that was one of the worst ones ever.
That was one of the worst ones. Deborah.

Um, anyways, you know,

598
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:51,280
it's funny as I'll probably get
complaints from a gay rabbit group.

599
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:57,060
Did you mean that? Will
you being theory? Um,

600
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,980
what am I doing right?
Dollar Shave Club.

601
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:02,620
I got to get to the fucking questions
for this week. Where are we anyways?

602
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:03,970
37 minutes in.

603
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,470
I'll tell you a time flies when you
just stone sober eaten vegetables at 10

604
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:12,000
fucking 52 at night.
Jesus Christ.

605
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,790
Oh my God. What am I, I'm a two weeks in,
two weeks in. It's just hard at night.

606
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,790
If you notice when I do the podcast
in the morning or in the afternoon,

607
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,670
then in that damn bendable bull,
I'm going a good fucking mood.

608
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:25,950
This is when it's the hardest.
You know,

609
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,900
your body starting to shut down and the
devil starting to wake up like, Hey,

610
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:33,460
what are we doing?
What are we doing?

611
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,120
You're born in your goals.
[inaudible] um, all right,

612
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:40,770
let's read,
let's get to some of the reeds here.

613
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,710
Have I talked about everything
I wanted to talk about here?

614
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,220
The fuck else did I
want to mention? Um, Oh,

615
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,080
oh, Jesus Christ. I almost forgot, uh,

616
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,090
one of the guys that basically taught
me how to be a comedian unfortunately

617
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:01,960
passed away a 73 years
of age. Bob Cybele. Um,

618
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,740
it was laid to rest today and,
uh,

619
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,680
I just wanted to make sure that
I took time to mention, uh,

620
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,010
what a fucking great guy.
He was meant to such a great guy.

621
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:15,410
He was always cool to me when I
started out and just such a, um,

622
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,780
I mean, I didn't even know all this
shit about, I'm going to read this,

623
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,840
this link here when they talked about,
um,

624
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,170
Bob Site Bell,
uh,

625
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,980
he started in 1979.

626
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,780
That was the start of a 36 year career
in standup comedy from a guy whom his

627
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,340
good friend and fellow comedian,
Mike McDonald,

628
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:41,341
who is another fucking hilarious comic
called the fantastic maniac on stage.

629
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:45,430
Bob made you laugh offstage. He was
gen, he genuinely cared about people.

630
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,200
And uh,
this,

631
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:52,190
this is what I found amazing about this
guy and actually I kind of relate it to

632
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:57,160
it where he was into a bunch of
different shit. Um, let's see.

633
00:38:57,161 --> 00:39:01,720
Where the fuck is it Christ bill,
why don't you given a tribute to the gain?

634
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:03,340
You're going to fuck this whole
thing up. Well, you know what?

635
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,880
You're going to have to deal with
me reading out loud here. Uh,

636
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,850
those are new Cybele are aware that his
life was lived in two distinct parts

637
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,760
with January 5th,
1977 serving as the,

638
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:15,940
as the line of demarcation.
I hope I said that right.

639
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,440
That's the day he gave up drinking,

640
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,150
driving into an occupied parked car
on market street was the final Straw.

641
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,220
And while his post drinking life was
not much longer in years, 38 versus 35,

642
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,850
he was determined to live every day like
it was like he was trying to make up

643
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:35,140
for lost time. Uh, they've see the,

644
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:37,240
basically the gay and that
does sec is commercial.

645
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,810
The most interesting man in the world
doesn't have anything on Bob. Say Belt.

646
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,000
Now you know what you're thinking. What
the fuck does that mean? Here you go.

647
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:46,240
Where do you start?
Cybele ran more than 30 marathons.

648
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,980
This is a monster headline comic.
He also ran more than 30 marathons,

649
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:53,500
including the Boston marathon 17 times.

650
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,000
He was a certified scuba diver who
dived, you know, he did cruises. He did.

651
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:01,780
She fucking dove all over the
world. An artist, a musician,

652
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,460
an airplane pilot. He hiked the
Appalachian trail several times,

653
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,280
climbed mount, kill him, kill him.

654
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,100
Agero he went on transatlantic cruises,
uh,

655
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,940
though,
not in the traditional manner,

656
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,150
he would travel on cargo in steam ships
and was often the only one on the ship

657
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:25,620
not working. It was his economical
way to see the world. Uh,

658
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,380
that was far from the only traveling he
did in the last 11 years since he and

659
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:31,810
his loving companion reconnected.

660
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:34,600
They dated in high school
and lost touch for 44 years.

661
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,070
The pair of traveled to
China, Italy, Morocco, Greece,
Turkey, Ukraine, France, Spain,

662
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:43,210
England, Ireland, Iceland,
The Bahamas, and Canada. Let
me tell you something to do.

663
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,220
That's the way to be a fucking comedian
is once you're a headliner comic and

664
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:52,330
you're telling fucking jokes and
people are coming out to see you,

665
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,540
why you would ever get yourself sucked
into the industry when you can do all of

666
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:01,040
this shit.
How fucking amazing is that?

667
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:05,230
He fucked around for the first 35 years
of his life and was still able to do

668
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:08,830
that. And I gotta tell you, man, he was
one of the greatest fucking guys. And, uh,

669
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:12,090
when I started out, I know
I've mentioned this before, um,

670
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:18,070
I started out in March in 1992 and the
big eighties common comedy boom was

671
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:22,240
crashing hard. And there was a lot
of guys that worked in the 80s.

672
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,220
They basically,
they had more,

673
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,930
more rooms than actual bonafide comedians.

674
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:32,500
So what happened was I came in
during the trimming the fat years.

675
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,940
So obviously I did not start off from
the greatest rooms and I ran into some of

676
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:41,090
these bigger guys that were coming
back down and had to get day jobs.

677
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:41,924
And they were,

678
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,220
some of them were some of the worst
fucking people you'd ever want to meet.

679
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:49,610
I forgive them because they were
fucking dealing with, you know,

680
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:51,530
what they were going through.
But some of them, I mean,

681
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:55,040
I know guys who would be like, hey,
you know, look at this, look at this.

682
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,630
It's Wednesday night.
You know,

683
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:59,090
fucking three years ago there'd
be a line around the block.

684
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,500
There's barely anybody here. And I had
a guy one time say that to me and say,

685
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:06,260
you know what a file if I was
starting out, Nah, I quit, man,

686
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,960
I get into something else.
It was literally trying to discourage me.

687
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:15,170
That's how desperate this person was.
And um, Cybele was not one of those guys,

688
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:18,310
man, he was just a great guy.
Really was interested in,

689
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,430
in who you were and what you did and all
that. And uh, he lived a hell of a life.

690
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,650
Uh, that's another great thing.
I'll post the, the uh, this article,

691
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,110
one of the coolest things
anybody could ever say about you.

692
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,030
They said Bob side bells
bucket list was empty. So, um,

693
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,720
I dunno, I definitely just wanted
you guys to know who that guy was.

694
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:42,120
He was a fucking great dude,
man. All right. So anyways,

695
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:46,190
let's get onto your questions here for
the week, for the week, for the week,

696
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:49,220
for the week. Where the hell do
I go here? Sorry, I'm on my iPad.

697
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,240
I'm on my mini iPad. It's like, it's big,
but it's small. You know what I mean?

698
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,490
All right. Um, okay. Once again, people.

699
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,280
Um, if you want to email
me and ask me questions,

700
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:07,140
the email is bill@themmpodcast.com.
Um,

701
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,250
Boston posters are still on sale
as of now. There's 175 left.

702
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:14,700
I know I had a lot of problems with the
website, but you know me with technology.

703
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,290
I'm also, I'm supposed to remind
you guys about be the match.org.

704
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,690
Be The match.org. It's the bone
marrow registry. You give bone marrow,

705
00:43:24,691 --> 00:43:27,090
you can save somebody's life.
Uh,

706
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,230
we've had a few listeners that
respond that joined the registry, uh,

707
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,530
at the [inaudible] match in tweeted
us at what a great experience it was.

708
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,980
All right, there you go. That's, that's,

709
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,440
that's good Karma to whatever
horrific thing you do this weekend.

710
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:44,250
You want to balance it out. You can
go do that. All right, galaxy search.

711
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,380
As I mentioned,
I was looking for a Ford Galaxy.

712
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:49,450
My wife has kinda making me being a
little more smart about it, but uh,

713
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,340
I already have one fucking old vehicle
that I got to get fixed all the time.

714
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:57,960
She's right. But you know, maybe
it needs a friend. Anyways,
this guy said, hey bill,

715
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:01,440

nationwide for that galaxy,

717
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:09,660
Whatever the fuck you [inaudible]
looking for a www.searchtempest.com.

718
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,690
All right, here we go. Let's get
into the questions for the week here.

719
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,820
A new fan from Norway.

720
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,330
J UPP jump. That's right. New
Fan. It's possible. Great podcast.

721
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:24,640
Great shows. Well thank
you sir. Or ma'am, uh,

722
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,690
I've seen all your clips on youtube
and the last couple of days now,

723
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:31,770
summer holidays at the cabins
raining. So thank you. You saved it.

724
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,150
A pardon my English. But how's your
new Norwegian? Right? You know what?

725
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:38,250
You got me there.
You're way better than I am.

726
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:43,140
I don't know anything other than
Tuck, which means thank you. Um,

727
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,480
so somebody could be like, hey, can I
shoot you in the head? I'll be like,

728
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:49,530
thank you. Yes, absolutely. Keep on
doing whatever you're doing at works.

729
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:53,780
And when you come back, when
are you coming back to Oslow?
Uh, because I know you,

730
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,950
I see you've been here. I've been there
twice. My friend next time call me,

731
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,960
he gives the phone number and he goes, not
gay. I love when guys do that. Not Gay.

732
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,530
Like what if you were that they like,

733
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,150
I like whatever move you made, I
would. Hey Dude, I'm not gay. Yes,

734
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,790
sorry man. But you know, I'm flattered.

735
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,280
Then it would be over. Let me go
cross country skiing or whatever.

736
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:24,930
I can handle it. If he gay, no big deal.
A promise. He said, I promise I can.

737
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:30,090
I can take you on a local to a local
soccer game. Anyways, best regards,

738
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:33,570
blah, blah blah, blah blah. Uh Oh,

739
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:38,490
his name is Glenn named after Glen
Anderson from the Gretzky line from his

740
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:41,730
Edmonton Oilers years.
True. My, uh, my dad's work.

741
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,910
What? Valerie go red sox
rangers, New York giants,

742
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,770
l Beckham Jr. We'll own
2015, 16. You know what dude,

743
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:55,440
you went off the rails with your, your
English. I don't know what happened there,

744
00:45:55,441 --> 00:46:00,330
but you know, what most important thing,
when am I going back over there? Uh,

745
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,710
probably next year.
Um,

746
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,040
I think the last time I was there was
the end of 2013 so I am more than overdue

747
00:46:08,581 --> 00:46:11,940
cause I could go there right now and give
you guys all brand new hours worth of

748
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:15,870
jokes. So, uh, and I think this
team, this time when I go over there,

749
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:20,670
I'm going to add some eastern
European countries and uh,

750
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,060
I don't know. I'm looking forward to
it. Definitely looking forward to it.

751
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:27,870
Last time I went to Oslo, met this
fucking Badass dude who was shredded.

752
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,660
It was this little guy who had
the most sickest fucking beard.

753
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:34,440
He just did not shave. And his
beard went from just under his eyes.

754
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,840
Downton met his chest hair.
This guy was a fucking animal and uh,

755
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:42,720
he had just come back from Thailand.
We're two months out of every year.

756
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:47,370
This guy goes over there and it just
gets taught by these masters and gets the

757
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:52,080
shit kicked out of them and comes back
here like a fucking cause back to Norway,

758
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,280
just absolutely shredded and even more
of a deadly weapon than he was when he

759
00:46:56,281 --> 00:47:00,810
left. Um, those are the
kinds of people that I like.

760
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,540
Those are the kinds of people that you
should meet because that's the kind of

761
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,430
shit like you listen to
like, dude, you can do that.

762
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,310
You can just leave what you
live for two fucking months,

763
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,930
go to the other side of the planet in
fight for two months. And it's like, yeah,

764
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:16,080
if you set your life up,
always working towards that,

765
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,880
your life ends up going around that shit.
So if you're young right now,

766
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,930
you know when you're sitting there,

767
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:25,920
you're getting ready to get out of college
and the whole cubicle life is scaring

768
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:28,230
you. You could set it up
however you want to set it up,

769
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,220
just doing the shit that you want to
do and then you'll life sort of builds

770
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:36,400
around it. All right. So
anyways. All right. Weight loss,

771
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:39,280
challenge a,
they have freckles.

772
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,470
I love the podcast and I've been trying
to get motivated to at least not be that

773
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:46,480
fat.
I'm from Wisconsin,

774
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:51,481
so beer and cheese curds are like
appetizers before more beer and meets with

775
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:56,480
fried cheeses. Ah God dude, you know
hard. That is the read right now.

776
00:47:56,481 --> 00:48:00,550
And you know how fucking
great that sounds. Oh my God,

777
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,980
I'd kill for any of that right now.
He goes, I'm five, nine 218 pounds.

778
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:06,820
Big Boy.

779
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:08,840
Okay

780
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,630
Dude, you are, you're, you're
like fourth and goal weight.

781
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,780
Give it to you. You'll get it
in there, man. Five, nine to 18.

782
00:48:17,781 --> 00:48:21,490
That's pretty fucking solid, my
friend. And he said, I bet I've, oh,

783
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,960
how many fucking hoodies do you want?
He goes,

784
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:26,390
I've always been active
in play sports they ago.

785
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:27,870
So there's muscle underneath there.
You,

786
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,730
you're going to fucking destroy somebody
if you start playing rugby. Um, you said,

787
00:48:31,731 --> 00:48:36,410
I've always been active and play sports.
After your last Monday morning podcast,

788
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:41,411
I was asked by some coworker if I wanted
to be there fourth in a relay marathon

789
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,120
because of your recent fat motivation
towards yourself and challenge.

790
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:49,880
I am doing it. All right,
good for you. Said this.

791
00:48:49,881 --> 00:48:54,881
Chubby John Stockton Pot paps beer loving
bastard is already ran 13 miles this

792
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,220
week already and it's cut down on the PBR.
Switching to PBR light.

793
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,640
Ha ha ha. Thanks for the encouragement.
All right. Good field. Yeah, dude,

794
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,230
that's the one thing I have noticed since
trying to lose weight is a runners are

795
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:12,020
fucking,
they're all fucking skinny.

796
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,220
You don't see a lot of fat runners unless
somebody is fat and they decided to

797
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:19,340
run. Other than that, it just
sort of melts off of you.

798
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,500
My only thing is I don't know how their
feet and knees can take it and their

799
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:25,970
back and everything like that.
Um,

800
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,060
I got this weird thing where I could
sort of run on a treadmill a little bit,

801
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,670
but if I run outside,
if I run on a sidewalk,

802
00:49:31,671 --> 00:49:34,670
like I'll go half a block on my knees
are like, hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy.

803
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,430
What are we doing here? What
are we doing? All right,

804
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,710
get on the grass and start walking.

805
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,870
So my biggest thing that I'm doing
is I'm just changing the way I eat.

806
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,420
Um, whose kid? No, I'm taking
a break from the way I eat.

807
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,720
I'm always going to have steaks
and shit like that. But uh,

808
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,140
God dammit. Look at this. I have
three pieces of cauliflower.

809
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,110
I get like
two carrots,

810
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,300
three little those round fucking tomatoes
and a couple pieces of Broccoli is,

811
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:09,430
there's nothing.
I love Broccoli if it's steamed,

812
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:13,660
but if it's completely fucking raw,
it is practically impossible to eat.

813
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,570
And you know what's even harder is
to eat it. And actually do you know,

814
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,380
do a podcast.
I bet this has never been done.

815
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:29,250
Has anybody ever just taken a big fucking
thing at shoved it in their mouth and

816
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:33,800
tried to read an email on a podcast?
Podcasting is so young, you know,

817
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:34,820
I don't think it's been done.

818
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,080
This is like eating a fucking raw
broccoli with nothing on it. This is like,

819
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:42,350
you know that cinnamon challenge and
like a vegetarian way. Here we go.

820
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,730
This is so gross. Look at the
top of Broccoli. It's like,

821
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:48,620
you know those people with gross tongues,

822
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:54,110
all those little bumps on the
fucking tongue. It's just,
this is fucking nasty. Ah,

823
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,350
all of our golf,
I don't know,

824
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,540
an eight an ironing board, but I think
this is what it would fucking tastes like.

825
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:04,880
This wasn't even full.

826
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,780
This is a fucking gross and think,

827
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,090
oh my God.
Oh,

828
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:18,030
it's fucking horrible.

829
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,970
Broccoli. Two thumbs down. You know what?

830
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,470
Broccoli is like part of a comedy team.
Like I live in comedy.

831
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,610
They'd had to be part of a team.

832
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,570
There's no fucking way this thing could
go on stage by herself and hold a crop.

833
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,543
Holy Shit.

834
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,820
I tools that never fucking,

835
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:39,870
then you will chew Broccoli
for like four fucking hours.

836
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,110
Oh God.
All right.

837
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,520
Jesus Christ. Um, anyways,

838
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:55,590
why don't I do this? I still have
to fucking cheek smaller. The ship

839
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,260
will be a ballplayer in the fucking
seventies and eighties said, it's tobacco,

840
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,250
it's Broccoli. That'd be great
if you joined a baseball team.

841
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,640
They're all putting my fucking dip in
back in the day and just sticking like

842
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:11,280
Broccoli. And they're like, why are
you doing? Oh yeah, I still broccoli.

843
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:16,080
It's good fiber. It's good for
your prostate, keeps things moving.

844
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:19,590
He's a good for your prostate. I don't
know. It's not good for your mouth,

845
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:21,540
I can tell you that.
Wow.

846
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,083
Correct.

847
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:31,350
I never make noises like this one. I'm
eating steak. That's all I'm saying.

848
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,433
You know,

849
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:38,510
you eat steak yet. Ah, you fucking
drop the fork. Unless it's a shit one.

850
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:40,743
You know what I mean?

851
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,110
Here's a good,
is a good rule of thumb.

852
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:45,780
If you walk into a steakhouse and
they have steak sauce on the table,

853
00:52:45,781 --> 00:52:50,610
you turn around and you walk the fuck out.
All right,

854
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,750
good steak. Just not, it's a
fucking month ended already.

855
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,480
How long does this take?
Come on.

856
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,500
All right.
There we go.

857
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,520
You know, it's funny that man versus
food. I never saw him eat broccoli.

858
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:10,780
I know why. I know it sucked
towards the end of the challenge,

859
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:13,140
but he always enjoyed the beginning.
All right. Sorry about that guy.

860
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:14,530
So that was a bad fucking idea.

861
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,723
Holy Shit.

862
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,460
Oh, the only thing worse than that
would be eating like a mouthful of hair.

863
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,090
All right. Bad Ass Russian pilot.
Oh, you guys got to see this video.

864
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,640
You guys see this video?
Um, I actually got her name.

865
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,170
She's um,
her name is Svetlana.

866
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:38,650
How great is that named Svetlana Nina.

867
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,410
Svetlana Kappa Nina, right. Um, dear bill,

868
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,580
the red bar on, oh, like the red
baron. I get it now. It's not bad.

869
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,720
Since you're a pilot now I thought
you might find this video interesting.

870
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:56,280
Even though I had my license, I do not
consider myself. I am a novice dude.

871
00:53:56,281 --> 00:54:00,240
I'm still fucking learning here obviously.
Okay. The Russian pilot is considered,

872
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:05,130
uh, the pilot of the century. Um, oh,

873
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:09,630
she's considered the pilot of the century.
According to our t news,

874
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,820
she is one of the world's most honored
aeronauts. Check out the video below.

875
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:19,350
It's a cockpit view of her flying
acrobatics around the Black Sea.

876
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,250
Um, look wise, she is a Russian seven,

877
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:28,420
but when you factor in her pilot
skills, she becomes a perfect 10. Um,

878
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,770
more Russian seven is a fucking at
least an eight and a half or a nine.

879
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:33,360
Anywhere else in the world.
They're gorgeous.

880
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,750
I'm seriously though this video
shows that the Soviets were,

881
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,790
we're on to something when they used
women as combat pilots in World War Two.

882
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,150
I didn't know that by the way.

883
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,680
The Germans didn't have a chance
against the night witches.

884
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,800
I got to look some shit up on that.
Hope my internet came back.

885
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,630
He's fucking dickheads. I paid for
it here. Let's see here. Night,

886
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,720
which is, I got to read about
this, but I watched the video,

887
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:00,060
we'll post it and I'm,

888
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:06,020
the shit that this person is
doing is like just the level of,

889
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:07,570
Jeez,
I give us the,

890
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,480
those guys like when they just auditioning
to see if they can be a jet pilot and

891
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:15,600
you know, they, they sent him around
that fucking whatever. It's like that,

892
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:18,740
that carnival ride that you
always go on except dates.

893
00:55:18,741 --> 00:55:21,720
It's way faster and they end
up like passing out and shit.

894
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:24,690
How she doesn't pass out and um,

895
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,240
and knows where the hell she's going. I
actually got dizzy watching it. She's,

896
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:33,790
she's fucking unbelievable. All
right. Night witches, everybody, um,

897
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,710
name,
which is the English translation of um,

898
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,690
some fucking German word that I can't
fucking pronounce or World War Two German

899
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:45,820
nickname. Um, for the female mill, uh,

900
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:50,930
female military aviators of the 588th
night bomber regimen known as the 46th Tom

901
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,830
and guy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
How can they ever made a movie about this?

902
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,020
Cause it's the Russians and the Cold War.
Jesus Christ.

903
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,940
This has Meryl Streep written all over it.
You know,

904
00:56:05,941 --> 00:56:09,600
they wanted to do it and instead they
did a league of their own because the

905
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:14,070
fucking wall hadn't come down in
Germany yet. It's a fucking amazing.

906
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:19,050
This amazing, uh, should be a movie.
They must have made one already.

907
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:21,690
The regiment flew, harass, harassment,

908
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:26,691
bombing and precision missions against
the German military from 1942 to the end

909
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:29,860
of the war. All right. This is creepy.

910
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:32,110
How do the Germans know that
it was a guy or a woman?

911
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,960
You know what happened
is they shot one down.

912
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,870
They ran over to see if they was
still alive and if they were,

913
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:40,270
they killed him and then in the
end they realized it was a woman.

914
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,070
Okay.

915
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,380
How the fuck did they know?
I never understood that.

916
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:48,190
How he got to know your enemy that well.
Like you knew,

917
00:56:48,191 --> 00:56:51,310
you knew that that was the,
like when they're dropping bombs on you,

918
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:52,470
you're sticking your head out.
Yeah.

919
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:55,270
It looks like the five 88th
night balm or regiment.

920
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,610
So sassy pitches.
All right.

921
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:03,830
The night regimen or I
blahblahblahblahblah they
threw over foreign 800

922
00:57:03,831 --> 00:57:08,590
admissions by the end of the war in
23 having been awarded 23 of them were

923
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,870
awarded the hero of the Soviet Union.

924
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:15,240
Title 30 members died in combat.
Um,

925
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,430
the regiment flew in wood
and canvas by plants.

926
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:25,450
All that's why, ah, Jesus, they fucked him
over. They didn't give him a nice planes.

927
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,101
A 19,

928
00:57:27,101 --> 00:57:32,101
28 design intended for use as training
aircraft and for crop dusting.

929
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:36,820
And to this day, the most produced
by playing in, in all of aviation.

930
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:41,440
Oh my God though Joseph style,
he didn't give a fuck.

931
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,620
Okay.

932
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:48,300
Teach sacrifice at 200,000 fucking of
his own God damn people to get another

933
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,133
hundred yards.

934
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:53,740
You didn't give a shit him put the broads
up in those old fucking plates do it

935
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,080
or I'll fucking have you
killed. It worked. All right.

936
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,430
It worked. He'd beat their fucking ass.
It's couldn't beat the people in Finland.

937
00:58:02,431 --> 00:58:03,264
Now Cuddy,

938
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,150
I still have those fucking Broccoli Shit.
My mouth.

939
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,370
I'm gonna read more about that,
man. That's very interesting.

940
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:14,670
Thank you for that email. All right.
What are we up to? 58 minutes. All right,

941
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:16,110
let's get in the last fucking thing here.

942
00:58:16,111 --> 00:58:18,930
Let's get the last fucking read in here.
Um,

943
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:25,170
[inaudible] all right,
girlfriend with too many guy friends.

944
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,040
Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry.

945
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:33,270
I'm still doing what the Broccoli here
girlfriend with too many guy friends. Hey,

946
00:58:33,271 --> 00:58:34,560
old doctor bill.

947
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,630
I'm a 21 year old Kyle College student
and I started dating this girl at my

948
00:58:39,631 --> 00:58:42,570
school five months ago.
Things seem to be going great,

949
00:58:42,571 --> 00:58:45,990
but unfortunately we've been away from
each other this summer because we're from

950
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:49,020
different states.
We talk almost every day,

951
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,810
but there are some days when
I never hear from her at all.

952
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:55,620
I just see her posting different things
she does with their friends on social

953
00:58:55,621 --> 00:58:57,810
media.
I would have a problem with,

954
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,770
I wouldn't have a problem with
it except hang on a second.

955
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,800
What the fuck? Broccoli.
It's just never done.

956
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,140
Okay.

957
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,860
I'm sorry guys. I promise I won't eat
again on the podcast. It's really rude. I,

958
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:15,200
I know, I know. It's horrible.
Sorry. Uh, we talk about Bubba.

959
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,900
I wouldn't have a problem with except the
majority of the time it's with a group

960
00:59:18,901 --> 00:59:19,734
of dudes.

961
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,670
She's always hanging out with five of
her friends who were all guys and then a

962
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:26,160
handful of times there's
other girls there.

963
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,170
Every time I see her post
something about them,

964
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:31,740
I feel jealous and angry that she's
spending all his time with the other guys.

965
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,000
Not only that,

966
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:37,740
but her most recent posts was on a boat
with all these guys wearing prob wearing

967
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,320
probably her most revealing bikini.

968
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,120
I haven't met any of these guys,
so I definitely don't trust any of them.

969
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,310
And whenever she's with
them and I text her,

970
00:59:47,311 --> 00:59:51,060
she takes hours to respond or
even weights to the next day.

971
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:54,750
I want to bring it up
how I feel about that,

972
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:58,860
but I don't want to make it feel like
I'm telling her who she can and can hang

973
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:03,180
out with. So what do you think
I should do? Bring it up? Um,

974
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,370
that I don't like how she
hangs out with other guys.

975
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:08,960
It just shut the fuck up and trust
that she's not up to anything. Uh,

976
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,870
it would be great to hear from
Nir. Thanks. Uh, what, Nia,

977
01:00:12,871 --> 01:00:17,850
thanks to get a female perspective too. I
wish she was here right now because, uh,

978
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,720
you're going to get my perspective.
Um, anyways, sorry for the long email.

979
01:00:21,721 --> 01:00:25,740
Hopefully it didn't, I didn't use too
many big words for Yag. Go Fuck Yourself.

980
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,750
Um, what do I think about that? Uh, yeah,

981
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:33,180
that's kind of weird.
I mean,

982
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:37,440
what would she think if you were fucking
hanging out with like five other broads

983
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,340
and you awareness speedo when he got,
didn't get back to her the next day,

984
01:00:41,341 --> 01:00:44,700
she probably thinks that you were
fucking around, right? So I would just,

985
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:48,930
I would just say to us, hey, listen, I'm
not trying to be a jerk here, but, uh,

986
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,110
you know, when you post, you
know, when you're hanging out,

987
01:00:52,111 --> 01:00:54,890
you seem to only be hanging out
with other guys. You were on boats,

988
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:58,350
you were in skimpy bikinis. It's, it's
making me feel uncomfortable here.

989
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:03,630
All right. She's like, you
know, try it. Just go, look,

990
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:08,160
I'm just communicating that it,
it kind of makes me uncomfortable.

991
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:14,160
Um, yeah, this is real difficult.

992
01:01:14,161 --> 01:01:17,370
Without, you seem like you're fucking
checking in on her and being like a jerk,

993
01:01:17,371 --> 01:01:22,070
but just, just ask her just so let me
ask you this. If you know, if I didn't,

994
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:23,970
if I text you and I didn't get back,

995
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:28,140
if you text me and I didn't get back to
you for a whole full fucking 24 hours,

996
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:30,063
all right.

997
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:34,860
And then you see a picture on Facebook
and I'm standing there with my ball bag

998
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:36,840
all in a bunch,
you know,

999
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:40,470
all watered up like a
fucking pack parachutes

1000
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:49,680
hanging out with like five chicks on a
boat. I mean, when you kind of be like,

1001
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:54,390
you know, dude, what the fuck? Just
ask her, am I out of line here?

1002
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,550
Then also tell it to, and
please tell me, you know,

1003
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,970
if you're not feeling it anymore and
you want to hook up with other guys,

1004
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:09,370
just let me know early on. So you
know, the heartache is way less.

1005
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,940
Just let me know. All
right? But, uh, I, dude,

1006
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:15,550
I don't think that it's weird that
you're uncomfortable with that.

1007
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,780
That is fucking weird.

1008
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,673
MMM.

1009
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:20,821
You know,

1010
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:24,360
hanging out with five guys and you're
most revealing fucking Bikini gimme it.

1011
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:28,800
You know what the fuck you're doing.
No, those are just my guy friends.

1012
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,260
All right. Now I'm getting annoyed. How?
What are you a fucking attention whore?

1013
01:02:32,261 --> 01:02:33,960
What's, I'm going to say all the
shit that you can't say to her.

1014
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,690
This is all the shit you're thinking and
you're totally justified to think of it

1015
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,600
and don't listen to any fucking brides
would tell you anything different because

1016
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:42,570
if you were doing it, they give you
the exact same fucking shit. All right,

1017
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:46,380
I got my foot nine. This
one. All right. Just ask her.
Just ask her what is, what's,

1018
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,610
you know, don't stone at a time
tone than I'm doing a bigger,

1019
01:02:49,611 --> 01:02:53,670
you've got to ask what the fuck's
going on here? You know, honey,

1020
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,940
with all due respect,
yeah, me, you fucking,

1021
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:59,670
it looks like you're in a
sausage factory there. You know,

1022
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,660
wearing your little skimpy fucking
outfit. What's going on? Be One thing.

1023
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:06,450
If you were there with one of your
girlfriends and even then I'm thinking a

1024
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:11,100
little five on to action, right? What's
going on? I don't know what to tell you,

1025
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:15,370
dude. That's, that's a
fucked up situation. Uh, it
might be just how she likes.

1026
01:03:15,371 --> 01:03:16,200
She may be honest.

1027
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,360
I don't like other girls that
don't get along with another girl.

1028
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,950
She may be one of those
fucking people all really,

1029
01:03:20,951 --> 01:03:23,490
you're like hanging out with guys or one
of your door with some fucking clothes

1030
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:27,060
on. How about that? You know, how about
this, can we, can we make a rule that a,

1031
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:27,541
you know,

1032
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:30,180
you gotta put on some fucking clothes
when you hang out with these guys.

1033
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,760
How about that?
Cause you know,

1034
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:34,890
you're just going to get pissed and
then you're gonna start hanging out with

1035
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:36,350
some checks and just to piss her off.

1036
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:39,510
You're going to start taking fucking
pictures and now return her fucking texts

1037
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:42,630
for a day and you start doing
that childish shit rather
than just getting right

1038
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:45,990
to the fucking media. The
heart of the matter there.
Right. The meat of the matter.

1039
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,150
I'm looking at it. That's
how much, instead of saying
the hardest said the meet,

1040
01:03:48,151 --> 01:03:53,030
that's how much I'm fucking hate. And
these vegetables, no know Gigi here. Um,

1041
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,700
anyways, people, if you enjoy
this podcast, all right,

1042
01:03:56,701 --> 01:03:59,010
and you'd like to donate
without having to donate.

1043
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,380
Next time you're going to
buy something on amazon.com.

1044
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:05,640
Go to [inaudible] dot com click on the
merchandise page, click on the Amazon, uh,

1045
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:08,160
fucking link and it just
takes you right there.

1046
01:04:08,161 --> 01:04:11,310
And I get credit for driving traffic to
their site. They kicked me a little doe.

1047
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:14,400
It doesn't cost you any extra fucking
money if you don't want to do it.

1048
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:19,390
I completely understand. Um, so anyways,
that is the podcast for this week. Um,

1049
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:22,280
I'm happy to be fucking stone
sober and getting in shape. Uh,

1050
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:25,530
the today was a bad one and I probably
should have been more uplifting for

1051
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:27,960
people who are trying to do it.
You're going to have these fucking nights,

1052
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:28,830
but I will tell you this.

1053
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,290
I'm going to finish this fucking plead
a fucking Broccoli and cauliflower and

1054
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:37,770
all that horseshit. If tomorrow morning,
you know what? As much as this sucks,

1055
01:04:37,771 --> 01:04:40,950
I'm going to feel like 1 million bucks
and my stomach's going to be a little

1056
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:45,270
flatter, right? You gotta
be willing to sacrifice

1057
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,120
Jesus Christ. I, you know what,
I'm so fucking bummed out. Rain.

1058
01:04:50,121 --> 01:04:52,820
Oh Kitty even fucking, uh, I actually,
you know, it's funny, once you,

1059
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:55,530
the English people told me that bummed
out means you got fucked in the ass.

1060
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:58,580
I can't even say that anymore.
Well what, what's, what,

1061
01:04:58,581 --> 01:05:03,090
what is the real word that I'm trying to
say? I'm a little melancholy right now.

1062
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,080
A melancholy with the cauliflower.
Um, anyway, sorry about that. Uh,

1063
01:05:09,081 --> 01:05:10,860
that's a podcast for this week.
As always.

1064
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:13,260
Thanks for listening everybody in
order, whether it showed up, man,

1065
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:16,260
that was fucking cool as shit,
man, to actually perform outside.

1066
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:21,020
I have a whole new um,
perspective on it.

1067
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:23,390
It made me think of that cool
fucking story. Joe Barton,

1068
01:05:23,391 --> 01:05:27,230
Nick told me about Robin
Williams and it actually, uh,

1069
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,830
and I know, kind of reminded
me like, Hey, you know, yep,

1070
01:05:32,831 --> 01:05:35,680
you were put here to do this,
so quit your fucking whining.

1071
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:37,420
Okay.

1072
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,880
You know, what's a matter of,
it's not a perfect situation.

1073
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:43,030
Your fucking baby get out there and
give him a God show and then you have a

1074
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:45,640
great fucking time. It was
awesome. It was fucking awesome.

1075
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:49,060
So thank you to everybody in Ottawa
and a now it's onto Montreal,

1076
01:05:49,061 --> 01:05:50,290
the Montreal comedy festival.

1077
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:54,370
And I'm doing three goddamn comedy
jams and I'm doing three standup shows.

1078
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,150
Um,
and uh,

1079
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,980
we going to be up there with the lovely
Nia and we're going to be enjoying

1080
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:06,670
Montreal. I'm doing three songs,
playing drums for three fucking songs.

1081
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:09,850
And I was actually putting my support
and pressure on myself for that,

1082
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:13,210
like fucking practicing and all that shit.
And then I finally remembered like,

1083
01:06:13,211 --> 01:06:15,520
Hey, he's in playing drums. Just
something you do for fun, Bill.

1084
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,940
Why don't you work a little more on the
standup act to k instead of the fucking,

1085
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,770
so whatever.
So I'm probably going to fuck up.

1086
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:25,540
I know I'm going to fuck up the
songs, uh, in some way, shape or form,

1087
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:29,470
but I'm going to have a good
time. So, uh, that is it a,

1088
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:33,100
that's a podcast for this week. Go fuck
yourselves. I'll talk to you next week.

1089
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:37,450
Draft Kings fucking grow up. Don't be a
bunch of God damn babies. If you're smart,

1090
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:42,070
you'll continue advertising
here and you'll make some
money. If not, uh, you know,

1091
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,850
thanks for being here for the time.
You were all right. Go fuck yourselves.

1092
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:46,330
Everyone.
