00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:48,390
So if you guys can do something for me,

16
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:49,920
I would really appreciate
it by watching it.

17
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:53,220
December eight teeth on Netflix there.
I got it out of the way.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,800
All right. Um, and any
ways, and also thank you for
everybody who watched the, uh,

19
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,870
the pie crust video, Huh? Oh,

20
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:05,340
Billy Baker got over 600,000 hits,
you know,

21
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:07,650
and I learned some shit.
Some people like don't use CRESCO,

22
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,820
you should use fucking Lod. And you know,
it's funny, it was somebody bought me,

23
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,130
got me a thing of lard and
I keep forgetting to use it,

24
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,360
so I'm going to try that next time.

25
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,810
And then also people set a better way
to pick up the pie crust is your fucking

26
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,030
slowly roll it over with the uh,
the rolling pin.

27
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,370
I didn't know either one of those,
but the guy who told me,

28
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:28,230
I read it on some fucking
website, he just goes, oh bill,

29
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:33,160
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill. Like 20 bills.
You were doing so well. The, the,

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,670

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,850
so you know how to pick up a
fucking pie crust better than I do.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,040
Why don't you just fucking
tell me how to do it?

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,190
Why do you gotta to act like the
fucking sky just fell. It didn't,

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,840
my pie cross came out fine.

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,220
Everybody is such a fucking cunt.
You know,

36
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:55,140
what amazes me about adult is that whole
fucking thing that he just did. Oh,

37
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:57,300
Bill. Bill, Bill. You
know what that really is?

38
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:02,160
That is literally his fucking inner child.
Literally going,

39
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:06,330
mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy. Look at me.
I know how to do it better. It's like,

40
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:11,150
just fucking grow up.
Am I being a Katrina?

41
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,420
I don't think I am. Oh, Jesus is showing
the fucking highlights of the Patriots.

42
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:17,730
Special teams.
So fumbled another fucking punt.

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,090
Gave these jerk off Texans and
other, no, that chance here.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,770
I'll tell you right now, I don't buy JJ
watts intensity. I just don't buy it.

45
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,700
I think he's just hammered it
up for the fucking cameras.

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,480
He's got a fucking scowl on his
face before the game even starts.

47
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,800
You know what I made? What are you mad
at? Jumping Jacks. Touching your toes.

48
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,700
That's stupid.
Fucking commercial with a blue grass band.

49
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:45,150
Starts spraying water on his face and
then he yells at his locker and then

50
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:49,620
there's nobody there. I get it.
He gets up for games. You know?

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,550
Gimme Ray Lewis. Anytime. I would rather
have ray Lewis screaming and yelling.

52
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,923
You know what I mean?

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,150
Did that fucking supersized astronaut at.

54
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,203
Gotcha.

55
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,970
I've just fucking with you. He's a great
player and I'm so psyched. Half his hand,

56
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:09,890
his fucking one of his
hands is wrapped up.

57
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,020
Thank God we would have been
in fucking trouble this game.

58
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:16,520
Hopefully you're not sitting there with
some fucking caddy to canary smile on

59
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:19,790
your face knowing that I'm going to do
the rest of this podcast watching the

60
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:24,380
Patriots somehow blow a 14 point lead. I
know that's not going to happen, right?

61
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,390
Get Out. Ah, you fucking
cunts over the middle.

62
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,380
Um, so anyways, I uh,
I got here on Thursday.

63
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,320
I've been doing some stand up,
um,

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,210
getting ready for these talk
shows and Shit I got to do,

65
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm doing a tonight show,

66
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,340
Jimmy Fallon on a Tuesday
and then Wednesday I'm in
La Doing Conan and then I'm

67
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:50,900
on fucking, I'm officially
on God damn vacation. But um,

68
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,980
I had a great week, dude. Had a great
time being back here in New York.

69
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,190
It is unsettlingly warm.

70
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,520
The only thing more scary about how
fucking warm it is back here is people's

71
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:07,280
reaction to it.
They fucking love it.

72
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:11,630
These east coast people have to take
it it in the face old man winter every

73
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,640
fucking year day.
You know,

74
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:18,020
the overwhelming response to global
warming up to this point is like,

75
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:22,190
yeah, bring it on. I'm
loving this. I literally,

76
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:25,670
I saw a woman and a fucking half shirt,
not a half shirt.

77
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:29,540
She had a belly show and like
she was going to be a dancer,

78
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,600
bind a one of them fucking chicks.
It can't really sing, you know,

79
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,450
and they use the auto tone since they
got to show their tits a little bit,

80
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,261
you know,

81
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:39,110
showed the little naughty little bits a
little better than naughty bits. Right?

82
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,900
She's walking down the street and
I'm like, I was like, oh my God.

83
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,540
When I saw she was gorgeous, then
I was just thinking like, dude,

84
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,390
it's four and have the fucking half.
I was like, this is December 10th.

85
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,200
She's walking down the
street like it's uh,

86
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,120
April applause of leave in May.
And um,

87
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,700
I was, I, you know, so
then I went on stage.

88
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,680
I was joking about it at the stand in
this fucking lady in the front row.

89
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:05,750
Just all she could talk about, she was
just nodding and nodding and nodding.

90
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,470
I was just going,
you know,

91
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,850
you realize just how fucking
cities going to look like Venice,

92
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,770
it's going to be underwater. Right.
And she was just going like, yeah,

93
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:17,690
I know what I love. So whether
it's just it's over, it's fucking,

94
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,990
I, I have, I am convinced
of it. It's fucking over.

95
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,880
People will choose that convenience right
in front of their face and they won't

96
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:29,000
see the volcano fuck interrupted.
You know, in the distance.

97
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:33,800
They don't give a fuck if in that
moment they hand in the face is going to

98
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,060
fucking be more soothing.

99
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:37,790
That's what the fuck they gonna
look at and who's getting no,

100
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,340
I don't have any solutions and a
part of the problem, but at least,

101
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,640
at least this is the
only thing I could say.

102
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,860
At least I have the decency to be afraid

103
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,230
I'm not,
I'm not

104
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,810
doing anything about it.
I'm trying to eat less fish.

105
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,480
I feel bad for the base board.
Am I going to do?

106
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:56,780
Just me walking around being alive.
I'm contributing to this shit.

107
00:05:56,781 --> 00:06:00,860
Not a mention of flying halfway across
the fucking slowly across the country to

108
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,250
promote a fucking cartoon. Get on the
ball. That's a live ball. Fuck you.

109
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:08,090
That's not an incomplete pass.
Fuck you.

110
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,260
Oh,
you fucking bastards.

111
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,150
Okay.

112
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,870
Anyways, um, now they're saying
now that having a discussion,

113
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,770
now they have a discussion.
What happened? He went back out.

114
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,350
It's clearly an incomplete. Ah, I duNno.

115
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,930
This is going to be one
of the ones that it,

116
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,000
he stopped his hand motion going forward.

117
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,940
He stopped the throwing motion
and grip the fucking ball.

118
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,233
Yeah.

119
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,730
These stupid fucking replace in the
NFL. You know, going to the, uh,

120
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,230
the video booth.
This is like,

121
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,410
yeah,

122
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,270
it turned all of these moments like this.
This is why I hate NBA basketball.

123
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,060
Yeah.

124
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,350
Is the timeout, the timeout, the timeout.
How fucking long it takes. By the way,

125
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,860
congratulations to the Golden
State Warriors winning 28
fucking games in a row.

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,190
I don't think that, that, I'm trying to
think of what that could ever be broken.

127
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:06,270
I mean that's, that is insane. And as
much as they didn't break the Lakers,

128
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,680
um, the, their record,

129
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:13,010
that was still amazing and I wish I
could actually have watched the fucking

130
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:16,370
double overtime game against the Celtics
and it looked like an instant classic.

131
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,300
Of course I was out, uh, you know,

132
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:24,950
telling jokes and that type
of shit. Um, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:27,410
I guess I need you guys, somebody, people
always ask me how to talk about hoop.

134
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,790
I just can't fucking watch it. I
try, I like college hoops. You know,

135
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,910
I actually was going to watch North
Carolina cause once again they got a great

136
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,540
team. They're fucking ranked second
the fuck it tie heels right in.

137
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:43,370
I came in there but we, you know, my
wife always sits down and she wants,

138
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,550
she wants to watch a dumb TV. She goes,
can you just sit down and watch dumb TV?

139
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,050
Is that fucking Kardashians Shit?

140
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,940
Which has been on a God damn loop
that shit the other day. Okay. And um,

141
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,420
it was on, you know, they
got an f episodes now.

142
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,700
It's like the fucking Simpson's whether
you can just do a whole weekend of

143
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,550
nothing but the Simpsons,
you can do that with the Kardashians.

144
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:04,460
Not so she just kept watching them
and watching them and I literally,

145
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:08,240
I had to get up and walk into the bedroom
and closed the door. It that the show,

146
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,590
it literally puts me in a fucking
bad mood. Um, I know that there's a,

147
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:16,550
there's a clip I just saw on
Facebook. Of course, I'm on Facebook.

148
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm a white gay in my forties.
I love Facebook as much
as the youngsters hate it.

149
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,770
Everything they hate about it. I
fucking love about it. But anyways,

150
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:28,760
this some local news show or whatever,
and this guy just,

151
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,820
he just fucking sums up.
He snaps.

152
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:34,190
He completely loses his
composure and just says like,

153
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:37,990
nobody gives a fuck about this
stupid fucking family. And the,

154
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:41,030
these two chicks laughing, one of
them agrees and then the other like,

155
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,750
just breathe. Just breathe.
Like that makes it better.

156
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,890
It's like just enough already.
I,

157
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,650
my, my wife has it on so
much. I'm actually starting
to understand like the dude,

158
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,150
you know who looks like a fucking
mannequin, he's got perfect hair,

159
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:04,620
perfect white teeth. He's always walking
around in a suit, but he's never at work.

160
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,740
And I finally just sit there. I go, what
the fuck does that guy do for a living?

161
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:12,240
And they're like, eh. You know, nobody
really knows. Nobody knows what he does.

162
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,410
You know? He's always walking around like
a dress like Bud Fox, and then I'm like,

163
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:18,330
oh my God, I'm getting sucked
into this thing. So I just,

164
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,560
I just went into the other room.

165
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,430
It's just an endless fucking pursuit.

166
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,100
They just constantly traveling.

167
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,770
I love like when they go to
the Dominican Republican,

168
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,510
did they interact with the people?

169
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:34,320
They go right to the fucking resort
and there's sitting next to a fucking

170
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:39,240
infinity Paul. You know what I mean?
It's just, it's like, why did you,

171
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,630
why did you just stay home? You already
live in that climate. You're dumb fucks.

172
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,140
Let me tell you about the time I
went to the Dominican Republic.

173
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,930
I went there and they took us nice, oh
fuck, fuck. Get that mother. Fuck you fat.

174
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:56,340
Fuck, it's not yours. Goddamn that
fat fuck. He landed right on it.

175
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,130
Okay.

176
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,050
Probably thought it was a pork shoulder.
Oh Great. When we get hurt. Wonderful.

177
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,250
Ah, for fuck sakes. Anyways, so
I got to Dominican Republic, um,

178
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,580
with the wonderful lady
I was dating at the time.

179
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,240
Fuck that relationship up as I did
everyone and until I met my lovely wife,

180
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,160
um, and we stayed at a resort, right?

181
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,480
We show up and I got there. And what
then? Too far like east, you see what,

182
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:29,350
how people are living as you drive
in there and you're like, holy fuck.

183
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,410
It was my first time and I a
so called Third World country.

184
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,870
I didn't know what the fuck that means.

185
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,570
It just always means it's a bunch of
broke people. I don't, I don't know.

186
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,470
Fucking like staggering. You know,

187
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:43,330
I saw a couple of nice
houses and everything else.

188
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:47,950
It was like a fucking tin shack and
we're fucking blowing by all this poverty

189
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,520
and you're taking it all in.

190
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,610
It's an absolute shock when you're
spoiled ass fucking American.

191
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:55,940
All right,

192
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,490
now I'll give a fuck what your situation
is in this country for the most part,

193
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,580
you'll live in like a fucking king
compared to this stuff, right?

194
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:07,420
So we end up getting to the resort and
then all of a sudden everybody has only

195
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:11,560
these fucking Hawaiian shirts saying
hello, asking to take your bags.

196
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:12,071
And it's like,
well,

197
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,240
am I supposed to forget what the fuck
I just saw still the entire time I'm on

198
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:20,950
this a vacation.
What's funny about the resort is this,

199
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:24,550
like literally like a prison wall all
the way around the whole fucking thing.

200
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,950
And he just feel it.
You just felt it like late at night.

201
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,580
If I get too close to that wall,
somebody is going to reach over.

202
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:34,150
It yanked be over it and no one's ever
going to see me again because that's the

203
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,750
level of desperation down here.
And um,

204
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,550
my favorite part slash the
scariest part of the trip was a,

205
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,980
we actually went horseback riding and we
went to a, a cave where there was water.

206
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:50,500
You went to the water and he had to go
underwater and then come up to the other

207
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,650
side of the different cave. I know this
sounds like a fucking hardy episode,

208
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:57,790
but we actually did it and I remember,
uh,

209
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,960
the tour guide,
the tour guide that took us,

210
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,660
I had to stop at his fucking house.

211
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,320
So I am sitting there and
the front passenger seat

212
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,440
of his car as everybody is looking at me,

213
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,730
basically the widest motherfucker
on the planet. And, uh,

214
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,850
and I had to sit there like,
are they looking at me like Jesus Christ?

215
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,840
How often do you see a redheaded white
dude down here where they looking at me

216
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:29,670
like a white elephant? Oh, are they
looking at me like a, you know,

217
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,010
God knows what our foreign policy did
then. Now they're in that situation.

218
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:35,920
I had no fucking idea,
but it's definitely a,

219
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,650
I dunno, I, but I was
glad, still glad I did it.

220
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,820
I still went out to interact that it
actually gave the horseback thing and the

221
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,200
Cave Shit, I actually was given money to
people outside of that fucking resort.

222
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:53,200
It just, it didn't feel right.
Does that make any sense?

223
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:57,440
I don't fucking know watching the
fucking game here. But anyways, um,

224
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,140
nay, I'm talking about
the Kardashians. I late,

225
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:05,530
they go to all these impoverished places
and they just still end up next to an

226
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:09,370
infinity pool, which to me is
like, why the fuck would you leave?

227
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,050
You're not interested cause she'd
starving and he got food. Right. Okay.

228
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,840
She just went like 20 fucking times.
Um,

229
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,410
she asked me a win.

230
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:23,080
This game was going to be over
because she wanted to watch dumb TV.

231
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,720
And I was like, I wanted to be like,
we know what this is my dump TV.

232
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,350
This is my keeping up with the
Kardashians. I watched the Patriots.

233
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,090
Come on Neil, look at Tom
Brady. Isn't he dreamy?

234
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,440
He looks like that guy with no job on
the, uh, the Kardashians, doesn't he?

235
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,540
Except he's a man. Um, anyways, so,

236
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,640
uh,
today in New York,

237
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:50,641
I actually went to the premiere of a
movie called Daddy's home starring Mark

238
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,050
Wahlberg and uh,
will Ferrell it a,

239
00:13:56,051 --> 00:14:00,130
that comes out and then go on Christmas
Day. And if you blink, you'll miss me.

240
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,390
I have a small part in and
I got to go there, EH, fuck.

241
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:09,220
Alegria Yard my way through this whole
fucking thing. I imagine I am. Um,

242
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,180
oh first he's on his way verse.
He's on his way. I think I'm in.

243
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:16,720
This is going to be a two parter. There's
going to be the first part I do today.

244
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,770
You know what? Who's kidding
who? This point, you know what?

245
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,410
This podcast just became late.

246
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,380
I was hoping I could finish this
thing before verse he got here.

247
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:26,260
I got media all day tomorrow and I told
Paul is going to go out and go get a

248
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:27,094
beer with them.

249
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,860
I'm going to do that so nia can watch
dumb TV and we'll go out to a bar.

250
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm going to watch the rest of the game
there. I confess, but you know what?

251
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,160
I did make the pie crust video. I
hope it helped you guys out. And uh,

252
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,830
it's got over 600,000 hits that fucking
pikers videos got more hits than most of

253
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:42,664
my specials.

254
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,440
And this week I actually finally was able,

255
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:50,650
those ribs that I was smoking I was
telling you about, they came out fucking,

256
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,710
and what I learned was it doesn't
matter at least on the green egg,

257
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,940
the big green egg, like, uh, as long as
you got smoked that first hour and a half,

258
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,770
something like, um, ribs. Not,
I'm a total fucking novice.

259
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,630
This is a second time ever tried it.

260
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,900
It's the first time I ever
did it successfully. Uh,

261
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,100
the other time I had to finish him off
in the oven, which isn't necessarily bad.

262
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,040
Um,
oh good.

263
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,030
Nia just got fucking two ply toilet paper.
Three ply.

264
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:25,840
You got the most ply toilet
paper, right? Oh my God.

265
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,820
I can't tell you who stayed here.
I'm not going to tell you stayed here,

266
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:34,270
but he stayed here and he fucking
loaded this place up. It's not even,

267
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:39,250
it's not even one ply toilet paper. It's
like literally almost see through, um,

268
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,380
I don't know what he was trying to do,

269
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:48,280
but all I know is I would rather wipe
my ass with sandpaper there. I said it.

270
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,960
All right. Look, I understand if you're in
a financially rough place, but you know,

271
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,030
can you put a price,
you know what I mean?

272
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,270
I might as well take
a belt sander the car.

273
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,300
Yeah,

274
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,880
there's a crack of my ass. It's like,
what are we doing here? You know,

275
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,090
it's very easy to go steal some
Kleenex out of these fucking stores,

276
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:12,560
give you ass a fighting chance.
Anyways.

277
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,000
Um,
so I found what the big green egg,

278
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,610
what I did was, uh, I followed all the,

279
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,120
the videos basically of how to
start the fire. One of these guys,

280
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:26,570
they always make these fucking videos
on how to smoke something and all they

281
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:28,910
talk about is there rubs and
how long they leave it in there.

282
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:32,690
And the most important fucking thing
on the big green egg is do what is your

283
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,690
fire look like? What's
the percentage, you know,

284
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,880
those burned up fucking coals versus
your year, your wood. So I did,

285
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:41,714
uh,

286
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,420
I did like half of that or not the shit
that's got the chemical on it before.

287
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,530
Everybody gives me a rough time.

288
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,160
It's the shit that looks like how a
tree looks when it's in the middle,

289
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:55,040
after a forest fire and it's put out.
I use that natural shit.

290
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,150
And then I had these big blocks
of Hickory that I'm told,

291
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,050
it doesn't make a difference if you soak
them or not. Um, so I didn't soak those,

292
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:06,110
but then I had a bunch of those,

293
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08,090
just the chips that you soak overnight.

294
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,170
I soak those things overnight and I had
an insane amount of smoke for the first

295
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:15,710
about hour and a half of the cook.
And um,

296
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,620
I kept it roughly at about two
50 the entire time. And uh,

297
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,170
some people might think that's a little
high. I don't know what they came up.

298
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,880
So rather than doing it for four hours,

299
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:30,170
I took it out about three 43
45 they came out great. A Post,

300
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,870
a couple of pictures of it, but, uh,

301
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,830
one of the most exciting parts of my week
was Nia tried them and came out to the

302
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:45,470
kitchen and fucking high five me and
did a little dance. It's the fuck was,

303
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,340
you know what the, that was the highlight,
you know, cause I know we don't,

304
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:50,960
I made the ribs and he
actually enjoyed them.

305
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,130
No, no, but I was trying something new.
All right, thank you. Do you know what,

306
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,960
there's one of the little,

307
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,890
sometimes you just know when
you're not supposed to talk to you.

308
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,720
I fry now she's focused on something else.

309
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:06,660
So maybe I know it the shit out of
her earlier. I have no fucking idea.

310
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,200
But let's get all of the budget's been
like fucking running my yap here. Let's,

311
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:14,550
uh, what do we got now? I've got to
type in the fucking password. Go.

312
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,300
Uh, Jesus Christ. What?
You know what I love?

313
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:24,160
How fucking difficult you have to make
these fucking pot, these a passwords.

314
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:28,440
You know what I mean? Like, do you have
like governmental secrets in here? Um, oh,

315
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,930
Friday night or Saturday nights,
you guys watch the fucking UFC.

316
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,160
How insane with those fights?
I don't know anybody's fucking name.

317
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:40,390
How do they go on? I'm at Greg. Um, did
you see that one fight? That dude was,

318
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:43,540
he was like this. I didn't know
what the fuck to call the guy.

319
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,130
He's got to have some sort of nickname.

320
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,900
He just got on this guy's back
and he wouldn't get off of him.

321
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,780
Every time he did like go to shake
them off, he'd keep getting back on.

322
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:56,410
I mean it's like, you know you ever
have like a fucking, I don't know.

323
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:59,080
Your fingers are wet and you pick up a
hair and you're trying to get it off.

324
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,080
You've got to wipe it on something else
and then somehow it just comes back to

325
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:06,610
you. You know what I was like, can
you take out cellophane but whatever.

326
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,110
The dead Saran wrap shit,

327
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:10,840
it just starts sticking to
itself and he tried to fucking,

328
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:13,960
I get and do what I can save it. I can
save in the, I have to fuck this piece.

329
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:16,510
Right. That's what he was, he
was like the human version.

330
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,170
That's not a good nickname
for fucking a fighter. Is it

331
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,230
human cellophane?
I don't think that's too intimidating.

332
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,150
He was just on this fucking guy and that
dude could not get them off and he was

333
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:36,090
named after it was Gunnar Nelson
for half a second.

334
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,500
I thought he was the son of the Nelsons
who are the son of Ricky Nelson who went

335
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:44,280
to that garden party, right. To
reminisce with his old friends.

336
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:48,990
Remember that I went to a garden party,
reminisce with mild France.

337
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,840
Do you like Ricky Nelson?
Nia.

338
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,583
Yeah.

339
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,990
You like the simplicity of
those old songs. The sound,

340
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:02,620
the sound of thunder in the background.
That's one of my gloves.

341
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:06,190
Come over here and talk to
me for two seconds. Let me
sing you some Ricky Nelson.

342
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,230
Maybe. Maybe this, this'll, this'll ring
a bell. Hang on one second. Hold on.

343
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,750
Hey Forsee. Where are
you at? All right, dude.

344
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:18,670
I'll be downstairs in like 10 minutes.

345
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:21,310
I'm wrapping up my podcast where
the first half of it or, right.

346
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,210
Okay.

347
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,490
All right buddy. I'll see you in a
minute. All right, bye. All right.

348
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,880
Let me send you a little bit of Ricky
Nelson. Maybe this Ricky Nelson is,

349
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,520
I know who his sons are. They had long,
blonde hair. Do you know the songs?

350
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,990
No,
it was probably like,

351
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,443
Eh,

352
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,110
like I'm talking and I'm talking
about his dad dead dad. Oh yeah.

353
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,690
He was some like,
oh,

354
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,460
walking is indeed very simple song.

355
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,370
Listen to the rhythm of the fouling.

356
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:57,050
Rain telling me what a fool I've been.
Yeah.

357
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,570
And then as something got away again,

358
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,610
it's up to an assumpted something.
Okay, Ray, please tell me.

359
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,500
Does she love me? So why are you
talking to me? You know what?

360
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:13,350
Cause this is my odd ways. Show
showing that I love you. I love, well,

361
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:14,850
I love you too.
We are torturing me.

362
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:18,000
I want to eat my Thai food and watch
my dumb TV. I love you very much.

363
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:18,811
Do you want me to get out of here?

364
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:22,080
What are you gonna Watch you to watch
the car dash out? It's Sunday night.

365
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:25,700
It's a big night in reality television.
I need you to leave.

366
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,210
Whereas your question, why
do I always have to get the
fuck put balls? My Dumb TV?

367
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:34,870
How come I always have to fucking leave?
You know what? That's a great point.

368
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,340
And that's why I love you. Do
you know how few women? Yeah.

369
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,900
If you fucked that cue and beings
can actually be like, you know what?

370
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:44,560
That's a good goddamn point. Yes, I do.

371
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,760
Yeah,
it is like get out.

372
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,700
Oh, all right. Beat it. I
beat it at, yeah, you paid it.

373
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,190
I'm going to wrap this
up right now and I'm,

374
00:21:56,191 --> 00:22:00,270
I'm Paul [inaudible] waiting for you.
Oh, you're a terrible friend. Yeah.

375
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,350
You know what? You know you're
a terrible person actually.

376
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,990
You're actually concerned
about Paul Versey.

377
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,650
Your first concern is me getting the
fuck out of here so you can watch old

378
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,580
fucking chock teeth there.
Pretend like he has a job.

379
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,510
I Love Barbara Z and I don't want to be
waiting to be waiting around for you.

380
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,470
Very listened to the rhythm
of your fucking bullshit.

381
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,380
Acting like you care about my friends.

382
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,740
You just want me to fucking lead this
place so you can watch those stupid twats

383
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,860
Nini.
Please tell me why you watch that show

384
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,560
something. Something, something
with the mistletoe. I get it.

385
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:40,561
You have a big round ass stop greasing
it up and putting it on the legacy inc

386
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,140
I'm sorry. All right, I'll
be back. Maybe tomorrow.

387
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:47,410
We'll finish this fucking thing up.
Jesus Christ. Can you fucking block?

388
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,960
We don't have anybody left.
All right.

389
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,950
I'm going to say that we were
going to fuck this game up.

390
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,660
This is what's going to happen.
They're going to come back.

391
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,060
They're going to make it,
what's it 20 to 60?

392
00:22:58,061 --> 00:23:01,510
That's going to be 20 to 20 and we're
going to have to drive down the fucking

393
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:05,830
field and hopefully a kick another
long field golf. Jesus Christ,

394
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,840
they all spin. Move. Good
Lord. He didn't even touch him.

395
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,500
All right, I'll talk to you
guys in a minute. Well, you
know, it'd be two seconds.

396
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:17,500
All right?
Okay.

397
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,373
Okay.

398
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,890
All right. Anyway, so as I was
saying, as I was saying, um,

399
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,060
it's still Sunday night, the Patriots
fucking win and it'd been 27 to six. Okay.

400
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:34,200
So I overreacted. You know, what do you
want from me? So what did I leave off?

401
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:38,270
I left off with the human cellophane,
right?

402
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,560
I was talking about those fights.
I saw, um, the fucking guy,

403
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,570
let me,
let me back pedal the hell was a gunner.

404
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:49,780
Nelson couldn't get the
human cellophane off of.

405
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,090
And then there was the guy who fought
the guy who comes in like a spider and he

406
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:58,060
stuck his face out and got knocked out
and then he kicked him in the leg and

407
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,720
broke his leg.
That fucking guy fought Jesus Christ.

408
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,780
I don't think I've ever seen a guy
get hit that many times in the head.

409
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,360
I thought the fight, I thought
the fight was over. I didn't know.

410
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:10,930
I didn't realize that the referee
jumped in because the round ended,

411
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,870
but he took the, there was like a
fucking watching like a rocky fight.

412
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,620
You know when you watch a
rocky fight going to do,

413
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,910
there's no way anybody could take that
many shots to the head. You'd be dead.

414
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,980
You'd be on your ass to the fight would
be over. This fucking guy took it. Um,

415
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't know what I'm saying.
I didn't ever know the names.

416
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:33,530
And then the bird can guide their fucking
a Conor McGregor who's fighting as

417
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:38,450
Brazilian dude. He's got this crazy scar
and the, he's already Brazilian Sarah.

418
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:41,660
I already know. He sees a
fucking nightmare. He's going
to take it to the ground.

419
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:43,160
You're fucked.
Right.

420
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,930
Was he not kicking people in
the phase to this guy? He would.

421
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,880
He could kick your ass. No. Oh
yeah. Why don't give a shit.

422
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:52,640
You're sitting in a chair or
fucking running down the sidewalk.

423
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:55,850
He's one of those guys. The guy can,
he can't kick the shit out of it.

424
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,060
So I've taken, wow man, this is going
to be a fucking unbelievable test form.

425
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,090
Hey Fuck. Any just ran right
at him. The ball wrenched up.

426
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,760
Yeah.

427
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,410
And I kinda did the old right there.

428
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:12,411
Fred Bam guides is a face plant he took
to a judge's decisions to the face after

429
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,690
their, whatever, their hammer fist.
So what is that, what they call it?

430
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,430
Took the old gavel
to hits the gavel and that was it.

431
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:25,140
It was fucking over. And um, I, like
other guys said afterwards, he goes,

432
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:28,180
you know, we've got to fight
again. That wasn't really a
fight. It's like, no. Well,

433
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:30,840
it was a fight. You got
knocked out, dude. You know,

434
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,550
that usually indicates that was some
sort of a fight. It's like, you,

435
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,470
you fucking slipped.
And fell and he had on a desk.

436
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,340
There was no desk in that octagon. That
was a, uh, that was his left hand. Um,

437
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,500
but Jesus Christ, man,
that was fucking amazing.

438
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,380
I was actually talking to some of the
guys I was watching the fight with. I go,

439
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,230
how much tension is going to be in
Dana White's house over Christmas?

440
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,730
If Conor McGregor loses too
after fucking what's her face?

441
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:04,620
Lost female, female Tyson, right?
Then you're going to have Irish Tyson.

442
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:06,480
If they both go down,
then who you're going to,

443
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,280
who's going to fucking sell a fight?
You need them the way they talk. Shit.

444
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,530
The how much fucking money is sitting in
fucking Dana of mine that's sitting in

445
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:21,520
data white sock drawer right now because
you got to fucking amazing athletes

446
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:24,730
like that who also not a sell a fight.
You know what I mean?

447
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,510
There's deaf other guy won 90 to get.

448
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:31,720
Now you get a guy who needs a fucking
interpreter for me to understand it,

449
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,540
to sell the goddamn fight.
It's over.

450
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,960
I don't even like fucking
watching movies with subtitles.

451
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:42,980
I gotta I gotta fucking, I got to deal
with the guy that he's got to have a,

452
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,630
you know,
he's typing a fight.

453
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:50,160
I look like I'm watching a senator
testifying is fucking lawyer keeps coming

454
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:52,590
over whisper in his ear. I
don't want to see that. Right.

455
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,950
I don't even know what I'm
saying here. Um, anyway,

456
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,800
so I forgot to tell you guys this shit.
I almost forgot this fucking story.

457
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:02,010
So I've been trying to work out
when, uh, when I've been here,

458
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,580
two or three days I've worked out,
right? So we go to the gym the first day,

459
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:08,340
it's right down the street from my
apartment. There's no fucking problems.

460
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:12,000
I walk in, the guy behind the counter
is cool. There's nobody else there,

461
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,790
no manager. Just some cool guy goes,
hey, by the way, it's 15 bucks.

462
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:17,100
But if you go on the Internet
and you look this shit up,

463
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:21,300
it only costs you five bucks.
I said, dude, I'm old. I
suck at the Internet. Okay.

464
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:23,910
Just generally speaking, I'm not good in
that. He goes, I'm just saying, you know,

465
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:25,230
it's money. And I was like, Hi man, I'll,

466
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:27,870
I'll try to find the fucking page
and I'll come back the next day.

467
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:32,250
I'll only pay five bucks. So he goes,
cool, no problems, no fucking problems.

468
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,470
I have a great workout. I fucking troll
the weights around. Classic Shit Comedian.

469
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:39,360
I go to the gym in the middle of the day.
It's great.

470
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:42,330
There's nobody fucking there.
Okay.

471
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,060
A couple of trophy wives on treadmills,
you know,

472
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:49,650
fucking looking at their Instagram as
they walk fucking half a mile an hour and

473
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:54,030
then you come walking in and I don't give
a fuck what time of day you walk into

474
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:54,864
a gym.

475
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,650
If you have to do chest that date this
to all the benches are going to be taken

476
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:02,580
up. You know what I mean?
Nobody's ever doing squats.

477
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,150
You can walk into a gym Saturday,

478
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,850
fucking Saturday.
Like what's,

479
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:11,530
what's a busy like early in the
morning when people come in, wherever,

480
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,400
19 when it would have fucking the
busiest time right after work.

481
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,660
Six o'clock at night.
Okay.

482
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:21,990
You can go walk into a gym and you can
just immediately just start doing squats.

483
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,520
Nobody's ever done. Nobody does
fucking legs. Everybody does the bench.

484
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,000
So I walk into this five people,
they have three benches,

485
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,620
there's like five people working out.

486
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,570
Three of them are guys fucking
bench pressing God damn consul.

487
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:38,940
I get to sit there and pretend
like I'm fucking really stretching.

488
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm not really stretching. I'm
waiting for you to finish, right?

489
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,620
So anyways,
that was the first day.

490
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:49,050
So the second day I go to go
back and Oh my God, here we go.

491
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,260
You know I'm going to run into
this guy again. He's going to say,

492
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:55,140
how can we didn't get the fucking thing
that only makes you pay five bucks and

493
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,680
be like, because I suck at the Internet.
Remember I'll pay 15 I don't give a fuck.

494
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,330
Right? And I come showing
up, he's not there.

495
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,090
There's some lady there and then this
fucking manager buzzing around, hey,

496
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,540
how long you in town for Josie?
Good membership level. I said, no,

497
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,760
do I just want to work out today? He
goes, all right, fill out this form.

498
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,380
So it's name, address,
phone number, email,

499
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,880
all of this shit.

500
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:18,870
So I write down a fake name and I say
I'm from Alaska and that's it, right?

501
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,891
So he goes, no, I'm sorry,

502
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,130
so you've got to fill out the rest of
this where all the addresses now all I had

503
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:26,790
to do, which just fell out
of fucking fake address,

504
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:30,270
but you know it's not how I'm wired.
I got to make a point. I go, dude,

505
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,610
I have to give you my home
address. He goes, yes, I go to a,

506
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,550
I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I'm
not going to give you my home address.

507
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,460
Am I going to tell you where I live
so I can work out one day at a gym?

508
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,230
And he goes, well, you know you have
to fill it out a little. And I go, why?

509
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,410
Why do you need to know where I live? And
he hems and haws and I just keep going.

510
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:59,090
Why do you need to know where I
live? Okay, it's $15 to work out.

511
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:03,350
I have the $15 I'm going to give it to
you and I'm going to work out at the gym.

512
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,980
Why do you need to know where I live?
So finally goes, well, sure, you know,

513
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,450
God forbid if you have some sort of
incident happens and we need to get in

514
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:14,300
contact with somebody.
I said,

515
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,360
so you're telling me that God
forbid to use your expression,

516
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,800
God forbid I Keel over on the elliptical,
you're going to,

517
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:28,940
you're not going to dial nine one one
you're going to go drive to my house and

518
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:33,500
knock on the door and hope somebody there.
That's what you're gonna do.

519
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,870
You're not going to do that. He's going
to call nine one one like everybody else.

520
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,480
He just keeps going, well, well, you know,
what are we going to contact? It's like,

521
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,050
what the fuck do you care who to contact?

522
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,100
You know, eight I just said, look,

523
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:57,630
if you could tell me why I need
to put down my home address,

524
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,953
okay,

525
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,300
I'll write it down by the,

526
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:05,040
now I'll give you a phone
number of somebody to call
if something happens to me,

527
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,320
but don't call them. They're not a doctor.
Call nine one one tell you what. Yeah,

528
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,450
that's the deal. Call nine one
one and here's a number. You know,

529
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:16,170
if you want to let my wife know
where the hell I'm going, that's it.

530
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:19,800
You don't need to know where I live
to. The guy finally goes, what?

531
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:24,420
You have to fill it out. And
I go, why? And he goes, it's
protocol. And I go, exactly.

532
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,820
You cannot logically defend
why you want my home address.

533
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,610
You get in my home address.

534
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,250
So the people in corporate
will have that information.

535
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:39,720
They can sell it to other people, right?
So I go, I'm not working out here, right?

536
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:43,260
So I would go to walk away and then
the lady behind the desk, she goes,

537
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:46,830
have a nice day, sir. And
I'll say anything, keep
walking to the bus. She goes,

538
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:50,370
have a nice day, sir. And I turn
around and go, I understand sarcasm.

539
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,750
Get not telling me to have a nice day.
You're telling me to go f myself.

540
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,290
I got in the elephant.
I know a lot of you guys like to,

541
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,250
why don't you just fucking do you write
a fake address? That's what I fuck.

542
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:05,250
You know why? Cause at some point
there's gotta be some sort of pushback.

543
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,560
Somebody has to fucking
complain about this shit.

544
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,590
When you walk into those places
and they go, do you have an id?

545
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't ever hand them your Id.
You're holding

546
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,980
and just say, here you go.
I'll hold a wrap your fucking
face. You want to read it?

547
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:24,180
Go ahead and read it. She not type it
and shit from my id onto my Auntie,

548
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:29,180
your fucking computer. Every time you
put down my name and my address yet sets,

549
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,680
you've added another layer where I
am vulnerable, Thai identity theft.

550
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,190
And I'm not going to do that just
to go work out at a fucking gym.

551
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,990
I'm not having a kidney transplant.

552
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,190
You con I'm going to go
do some fucking pull ups.

553
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:43,910
Okay.

554
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,910
Give you all my fucking information. I
know you guys probably think I'm a psycho,

555
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:49,250
right? I'm not. I'm right.
I'm right on this one.

556
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm wrong about a lot of other shit.

557
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,290
Okay.

558
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,350
Whatever. This is stupid me. Just sit
here and tell you that I'm writing.

559
00:32:55,351 --> 00:32:58,920
I'll really build. Do you agree
with yourself? That's amazing.

560
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,230
Um,
anyway,

561
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,830
so we don't just want to say I have
fucking worst goddamn stupid cab driver

562
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:09,210
today. Fucking jump in this fucking
thing, right? We're coming from the, uh,

563
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,560
the premiere, right? So you don't need,
it's gonna fucking high heels on it.

564
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:14,281
She's not a quitter.

565
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:16,980
So she's keeping those on and I'm not
going to make her walk with heels on.

566
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,660
What am I a fucking animal,
right?

567
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:20,820
So we get in this cab when
we fucking drive down,

568
00:33:20,821 --> 00:33:24,270
and this son of a bitch drives
right down fifth avenue,

569
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:29,380
fifth avenue during Christmas where every
mouse breathe and fucking moron wants

570
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,930
to stand there and look at the Christmas
tree that people skating. Yeah.

571
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,640
Okay.

572
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,370
Okay. And he drives down. Then all
of a sudden you can't make a right.

573
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:38,950
This guy's acting like he's dumbfounded.
He can't fucking believe it.

574
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,890
And then he ends up cutting over
through fucking times square.

575
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,730
He did everything but try to go through
the Lincoln tunnel to drive like fucking

576
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:50,620
10 blocks over. Um, and
I was sitting there. Um,

577
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,200
I get aggressively exhaling
the way that,

578
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:00,900
the only way I could put it and my
wife, she's just fell asleep. She just,

579
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,730
that's something I could do about it.
And she just took a nice nap, you know?

580
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,990
I wish I could be more like
that. Um, all right. Anyways,

581
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,440
let me, yeah, let's start
reading. Oh, you know what?

582
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:15,240
I haven't done any advertising
for this week. Have I?

583
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,390
I read some of these stupid fucking thing.
So who's getting it?

584
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:23,070
Why don't I make an attempt?
All right. Uh, oh Jesus. Great.

585
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:26,670
Boop, boop, boop. Me. Andy's, I can't sing
too loud because it's late at night here,

586
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,980
but I brought up, yeah, Andy's me undies.

587
00:34:31,981 --> 00:34:36,630
Sticky balls in the snow boot doot doot
me on days we undies now that cold day,

588
00:34:36,631 --> 00:34:39,570
you go take them out,
put on the undies.

589
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,770
Now they're all dry and they feel
nice and soft. You balls are so great.

590
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:47,700
Don't forget about your te Dan.
You're assholes come into, oh yeah.

591
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:51,450
When you have the undies,
your crotch feels great.

592
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,400
Even if you're a fucking wrestling and
somebody gives you the fish hook and the

593
00:34:56,401 --> 00:34:58,140
butthole me undies.

594
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:01,710
We all know how sexy confidence can be
and that confidence comes from being

595
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:02,460
comfortable.

596
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,490
But how great can you feel if your
underwear's Franklin or riding up beyond

597
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,240
Andy's gets it?

598
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,140
And that's why they've created the
world's most comfortable underwear for a

599
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:14,340
daily dose of confidence. Uh,
you wear underwear every day.

600
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:16,740
That's turned 65 days a year.
Rain or shine.

601
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,070
You need it to be extraordinary
without an insane price. Tag me.

602
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:22,980
Andy's understands this and that's
why they've created the world's most

603
00:35:22,981 --> 00:35:27,720
comfortable underwear. Luxury at half the
retail price you'll find anywhere else.

604
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,170
When you look good, you feel great. It's
a Cliche, you know, why? Cause the stroke,

605
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:31,800
the,

606
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,710
he's understands this and that's why they
designed underwear that makes you look

607
00:35:34,711 --> 00:35:37,890
and feel fantastic. Um, no.

608
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,780
Modelle is pronounced modal. Mandy's
is made for modal, modal, modal,

609
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,330
my mantle a fabric that's
twice the softest cotton.

610
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,030
That's twice as soft as whatever
underwear you're wearing right now.

611
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:49,850
Unless you already have a
pair of me undies on me.

612
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:53,610
And he says tons of colors and styles
and then the only place to get matching

613
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:56,460
pairs from men and women.
If you're that pussy whipped,

614
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,820
they even rely released
a new design every month.

615
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,380
I wear whatever free pair they fucking
get me. My balls have never been happier.

616
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,140
Plus we all know that paying
for shipping sucks, man,

617
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:09,240
so me and he said remove
that from the equation.

618
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,260
All orders in the U S and Canada

629
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:46,080

dropouts with the idea to make quality

starting at just 95 bucks and sold online.

631

bullshit retail markup.

632

A supposedly movement sent some
watches over here. Yeah, they did.

And I'm going to throw a nice fucking
chunk of change in on top of that.

669
00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:02,140
You guys did a wonderful thing
and uh, it amazes me, man, that I,

670
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:06,670
I did this podcast this long
and I didn't realize that a,

671
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,770
you could make an impact
like that. So, uh,

672
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,370
you guys were all part of a great thing
and I really appreciate how much you

673
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:16,720
guys all stepped up. You were very,
very generous, extremely generous.

674
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,490
Um, you know, it's not even Christmas
yet. You already did your good deeds.

675
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:25,690
So now you know you didn't get spike the
Eggnog, you can get hammered, you know,

676
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:29,290
and treat the people and it family like
shit. Right? Take them for granted.

677
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,620
Fuck them. Right? That's
what they get for showing up.

678
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,480
They knew what they were in for,

679
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:37,210
how many Christmases that they got to
spend with you before they realize what

680
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:42,100
you're going to be doing. Um,
alright, let's read some letters. Hey,

681
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:44,710
this one might be a little short because
it's already one in the morning and I

682
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:49,540
got to be on the fucking radio
at 7:00 AM oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.

683
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,850
All Right, tool for the egg.
Hey Bill, I've been running,

684
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,040
running an egg for several years now.

685
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:59,070
Your podcasts about no smoke
on ribs had me captivated.

686
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:04,030
I would suggest my tool to
stir up the coals and bring,

687
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,960
bring into context slash smoking hardwood
chips slash chunks kind of fucking

688
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:15,481
sentences that I would suggest my tool
to stir up the coals and bring into

689
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:22,381
contact slash smoke and hardwood chips.

690
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:26,230
Slash chunks.
That's a fucking cent.

691
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:29,500
You know something I would suggest getting
off a sentence tool. How about that?

692
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,890
They still make that hooked on
phonics and way back in the day,

693
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:34,420
there was a classic stand up,

694
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,440
a reference us simply purchase a piece
of three by 16 by 36 pieces steal from

695
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:46,510
home depot, Home Depot
place, and Ben 90 degrees,

696
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,680
two inches from the end.

697
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,950
Use this to unplug slash stir the coals
from the inward vent on the bottom of

698
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,540
the egg. Ah, okay.

699
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,950
I will utilize this tool during long
smoking to invigorate the smoke.

700
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,360
This also works to bring air oxygen to
the fire to increase the temperature.

701
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,850
Simply Polk,
who several of the fire,

702
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:11,800
great holes at the bottom of the egg
to increase the air flow. Ah, okay.

703
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,530
Do you have any issues
or just need a pick?

704
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:17,380
Just ask the least I
can do for your podcast.

705
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:19,210
So why didn't you fucking send a picture?

706
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,720
Now you've got to sift through
a thousand fucking emails. Now,

707
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:25,510
you know what I did was I
layered in some charcoal,

708
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,230
then they had the chips
with the chunks of Hickory,

709
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,510
and then I did another
layer on top of that,

710
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:36,320
and then I just put in one
little firestarters square
and I did it from the side.

711
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:41,300
So it just slowly burned across and down.
It was plenty for ribs,

712
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,270
but like if I was ever going to do a
pork shoulder, we, you know, you talking,

713
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,420
I don't know how long,
it depends on how big it is,

714
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:53,421
but it seems on average people that
that's like six to 10 hours to God knows

715
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,940
what. So that, I don't know how
I would continue to do that,

716
00:41:56,941 --> 00:42:01,160
but I think I would just take it off and
I'd lift the grate, the plates center,

717
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,900
and I would just throw the shit
in there and then put it back on.

718
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:08,280
I think it would be fine.
Um, that's what I would do.

719
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:11,130
You know what the reality is when I just
buy a fucking smoker and be done with

720
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:16,080
it. All right. Traveling with girlfriend,
slash. Fiance. Hey Billy board.

721
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:16,590
Dane.

722
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:21,590
I have to disagree with your advice from
last week for the guy with the sound

723
00:42:21,601 --> 00:42:22,830
engineering job.

724
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,760
He said he was a sound engineer
in the letter you read out loud.

725
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,180
Then later in your response you mentioned
something about building bridges and

726
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:34,710
then again on Twitter. Just a heads up
dude, this guy is fucking relentless.

727
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,140
Some of you guys, you fucking relentless
like reprimanding me. All right,

728
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,570
so I fucked this fucking thing
up, so let me guess. Okay,

729
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:45,270
well I think if he's planning on Spi,

730
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,970
I like how you think that being a sound
engineer, even though I fucked it up,

731
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:50,370
like that's not a,
that's not a quality job.

732
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,840
You know what I mean? What do you know
what to, you would be working in films,

733
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:59,260
right? Isn't that what that
job is? Recording bands.

734
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:02,100
That's a fucking great job and
it's a hard, you know what?

735
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,920
I'm going to look it up right now
before I get another fucking 20 God damn

736
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:10,570
tweets and emails from you.
Sound engineer.

737
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,823
Yeah.

738
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,890
And audio engineer working with tentacle
aspects of sound during the process of

739
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:19,770
recording, mixing and reproduction
audio engineers often with sisters,

740
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:23,400
record producers and musicians to help
give their work to sound they are hoping

741
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:27,150
to achieve. Yeah, that's a fucking
bad ass job that people want to do.

742
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:32,090
All right, let me get
back here. So here we go.

743
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,890
I think if he's planning on spending
his life with this girl traveling and

744
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:41,360
having a great time would be a
make or break deal for marriage.

745
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,610
She said she wanted to travel a year,

746
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:48,430
suppose it's only seven months and they
go to seven continents even go to us and

747
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:51,050
we'd go to the fucking Antarctica.
Okay. Over the course of a year,

748
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,890
they get to bang in seven continents
in a year, eat amazing food,

749
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:58,910
see amazing things and pretty much
lived their lives like it's a movie.

750
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,310
You looked at the negative side,
which is fair,

751
00:44:01,311 --> 00:44:03,440
but also how often did
these things happen?

752
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,130
I hate to be the guy that didn't take
that chance. If it were presented,

753
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,960
God knows I would.
Of course.

754
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:12,950
It all depends on their attitudes and
if they're fun people with positive

755
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:17,780
outlooks and good communication,
food for thought, hey dude,

756
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:21,470
just because I don't agree with you
doesn't mean I want the negative route.

757
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,690
I was giving him advice from my hat,
which is fucking positive.

758
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,440
I'm saying he's got a great job that
he was nervous about fucking leaving.

759
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,530
Those are his words,
not mine to then to end.

760
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:42,300
This is another thing too, dude.
You're a fucking man. Okay?

761
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,010
If you're not making money,

762
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,410
it's now that he can make a baby other
than dump your Jizan somebody you need up.

763
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,520
Like women can literally create life.
Okay?

764
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,730
You liked the butter
and the fucking pants.

765
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,080
I Dunno. Maybe I'm old school. I feel
like the man should make a fucking living.

766
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:07,830
You've got to come home and you got to
make enough money that you're a woman in

767
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,800
your family is fucking comfortable
and if you're doing that,

768
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,350
you're a fucking man.
All right?

769
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:19,380
If you want to go travel around the world
on some woman's fucking dime and leave

770
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,170
your career behind for a fucking year,

771
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,220
a critical God damn year and
have to start all over again.

772
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,610
I think that's nuts.

773
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,610
Yeah,

774
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:36,290
I think that's fucking nuts.
All right. Agree to disagree.

775
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:39,460
I can tell you this dude,
when I started out doing stand up,

776
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,440
I was doing this shit
every single fucking night.

777
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,620
Every night I had a singular focus.

778
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:49,220
What I was trying to do was a job
that a lot of people would like to do.

779
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:53,660
So it took a ridiculous level of
commitment and I watched people who didn't

780
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:58,280
fucking traveled the world,
didn't even have that fucking option,

781
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:03,370
but I watched people not work at it
as hard as they could have in 20 years

782
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:09,680
later. I see the results
of that. So that's all I'm
saying with this guy to, uh,

783
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,780
you know, to put play before
work is just not how I'm wired.

784
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,340
You know what I mean? Um, you
making it seem like this guy,

785
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:21,620
if he takes the sound engineering job,

786
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,130
will never have the money or
never have the option to do,

787
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,330
to go around and travel the world.
I Dunno.

788
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,160
I just feel like as as me personally,
if I was going to travel the world,

789
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:38,370
it's got to be on my fucking dime,
okay.

790
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:42,900
In my eye and my life has to be in a
place where I can leave it for a fucking

791
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,400
year. If I'm just getting started in a
career and I'm just starting to push that

792
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:51,360
fucking rock up the hill and I'm going
to go fucking leave and play footsie with

793
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:56,100
some chick even she's going to be the
chicken I'm going to fucking marry for an

794
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,460
entire Goddamn year, then I'm going to
come back and start all over again. Um,

795
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,670
I would be going out of my fucking mind.
I had to be honest with the two.

796
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,620
Uh,
as much as I've traveled,

797
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,890
there's always a point and it's usually
anywhere between seven to 10 days ended

798
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:17,860
the trip where I just want to go home.
I want to sleep my own bed.

799
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,100
I want to be fucking, you
know, hanging out with my dog

800
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,510
and not to mention that I love being
a comedian. I want to do some shows.

801
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,930
It's fun.
So agree to disagree.

802
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,560
Agree to disagree. All
right, food for thought.

803
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,930
Did you typed out wearing a sweater
with candles on in the background?

804
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,970
Candles on candles lit. Okay. He
said and go to Cape Carp Yourself.

805
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:48,530
Car Pay I don't want to do is go sees
yourself like car paid diem. Okay,

806
00:47:48,531 --> 00:47:49,460
go carpet K.

807
00:47:49,461 --> 00:47:54,020
I just can't bear to have you not get
the reference and hope someone writes in

808
00:47:54,021 --> 00:47:56,810
about it next week. Sorry. Thanks.

809
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,840
Oh go car. Pay Yourself. Oh, I thought
it said go to carpet. Go carper yourself.

810
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:07,040
Carpe Diem. Yeah. See I
love how seize the day is.

811
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:10,910
Just fuck off to your life and go travel
around the world and like seize the day

812
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:12,050
isn't like,
you know what,

813
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:17,590
I've made inroads in this really difficult
line of work and I'm going to stick

814
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:20,240
with this dude. I fucking,
you know something.

815
00:48:20,241 --> 00:48:24,740
I started out with comics who did that
and stayed home with their family and

816
00:48:24,741 --> 00:48:27,800
watch the fucking patriots game instead
of going out and going and doing a hell

817
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:32,210
Gig. I'm telling you, it
all fucking matters. It all
matters. Wait, why would I know?

818
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,210
What the fuck do I know? You know,
I did it the way I did it. I'm not,

819
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:38,044
I'm I,
yeah,

820
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,350
but fucking traveling the world
on somebody else's inheritance.

821
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,090
Kind of a fucking Bama.
My,

822
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,110
I'm not fucking doing that of one of my,
you know what,

823
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:54,080
I'll do that if you get me a pair of
fucking gold digger and pumps and I'll

824
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:57,130
fucking walk that walk around in
those all God damn year. Well,

825
00:48:57,131 --> 00:49:00,250
I want to travel the world.
I'm fucking pay for it. Um,

826
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,630
I think that says something about you
too. If you feel like you, you know,

827
00:49:02,631 --> 00:49:05,270
you don't have any problem going around
the fucking world on somebody else's

828
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:09,620
dime, I want to earn it. All right.

829
00:49:09,621 --> 00:49:12,740
Face of sponsorship. Uh,
Billy Butterworth. Uh,

830
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:16,430
would you ever do a major
sponsorship for a big brand?

831
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,910
What are your thoughts in the
following coke, Pepsi chilies.

832
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:24,980
Sizzler Wilson tennis rackets or
I guess I'm doing it right now.

833
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,980
Um, what I, I mean though,

834
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,320
it's more with they. Um, and
how long would it last? I mean,

835
00:49:33,321 --> 00:49:37,640
I can't even get these fucking jerk off
podcast advertisers to stick with me.

836
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,200
They're so fucking dumb.

837
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:42,770
They don't realize that if I fuck around
and I curse and I be a fucking idiot,

838
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,120
you guys actually will listen to it.

839
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:48,530
My philosophy is just cause I'm reading
advertising doesn't mean the show stops

840
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,950
if to show stops and he just pat
you just fast forward through it.

841
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,720
It's so fucking simple.

842
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,280
The such idiots that don't see that about
our product people and start believing

843
00:49:58,281 --> 00:50:03,170
it like, like you guys
actually take anything that
I say seriously. Um, anyways,

844
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,850
plowing ahead here girl.
Quit Job Lady.

845
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,130
This lady quit her job
and traveled the world.

846
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,010
Um, all right, here we go. My girl quit.

847
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,010
My girl comes home.

848
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,950
Why don't you feel like there
was something else in there?

849
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:28,140
Did I miss one of these
things? Maybe not. Right.

850
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,820
My girl comes home early the other
day and tells me she quit her job.

851
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:35,330
I worked full time in a metal shop.
Jesus Christ would be a blacksmith.

852
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,670
And I go to school full time
for engineering. Uh, we also
have two beautiful kids.

853
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:45,590
We cannot afford our houses, our houses,
cars, et Cetera, without her working.

854
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,760
And she acts like I'm a bad guy.
When I say when I get on or about it.

855
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:54,020
Oh Jesus.
I don't know what I should do.

856
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:57,500
I'm thinking of leaving her because this
is not the first time she's done this.

857
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,920
And then the total seven
years we've been together,

858
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:05,870
she's worked about two and a half feet,
two and a half years of around 10 jobs.

859
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:11,390
Wait, she has worked about two and a
half years of around 10 jobs. You mean?

860
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:15,770
And I'm guessing you're saying she said
10 jobs and collectively work two and a

861
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:20,480
half years. Can't take the financial
stress anymore. What's your advice?

862
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,470
Um, uh, first thing I would do,

863
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:25,730
I have downsize your life.

864
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:28,230
Yeah.

865
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,540
Just be like, all right, well look, if
you're not going to work, then we got,

866
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:35,440
we got to do something here. Um,
that's incredibly selfish. And, um,

867
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,170
look, she obviously doesn't want
to work. She wants to be at home.

868
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,510
She wants to be with the kids. So you
need to make enough money to basically,

869
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,130
you know, treat her like a third kid. Um,

870
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,420
so your lifestyle is going to have
to go down then if that's what she,

871
00:51:54,421 --> 00:51:56,460
I would just sit down and be like,
can I shoot question?

872
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,420
Do you want to just stay
home and be with the kids,

873
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,391
you know,

874
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:06,020
and let her fucking flip out and scream
and yell and all that and just don't

875
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:10,610
lose your cool. Just say to her,
is that what you want? Okay.

876
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,710
Because I need to know that.
Okay.

877
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:16,950
So I don't keep thinking that,

878
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,770
that we're going to be dual income and
making financial decisions that way.

879
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,570
I can already tell you right now,
dude,

880
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,960
that the fact that you're working full
time and she's working full time and if

881
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:33,230
the second she fucking quit,
you're fucked.

882
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,480
Do you guys are living beyond
your lifestyle? Beyond your means?

883
00:52:37,481 --> 00:52:38,820
You shouldn't be living like that.
You.

884
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:43,450
So you're basically the two of you guys
are spending all the money that you're

885
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:48,040
making. That's, that's no
way to live. All right.

886
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,970
You need to be,
you need,

887
00:52:51,971 --> 00:52:54,050
you need to downsize
your life is basically,

888
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:58,990
yet I would drive a Toyota or a Honda.
Those fucking things never die.

889
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,470
I'd get one of those. I
downsize. And then, you know,

890
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,600
I mean, I don't think he just quit on
our relationship and walk out on to kids,

891
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,970
but the stress has to be fucking brutal.

892
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:15,190
And if she's being a fucking
baby about it, um, you know,

893
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:18,250
that's, uh, you know, this is one of
these fucking things, say, you know,

894
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,770
be a nice change and one of
those chicks shows, you know,

895
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:23,500
a four broad sit around and fucking
talking about women's stuff.

896
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,830
They never talk about this type shit.
Cause this,

897
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,270
this would probably be considered
sexist if you brought it up.

898
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,710
That's a hell of a fucking thing
for her to be doing to you.

899
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,243
MMM.

900
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,560
I would just, you just gotta lay it on
the line. Just sit her down and just say,

901
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,000
listen,
is this what you want to do?

902
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,853
MMM,

903
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:46,340
I need to know that because I'm
not going through this again.

904
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,420
All right.

905
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,830
And I would just say you've had 10
jobs in the last seven years and you've

906
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:58,420
worked collectively, collectively about
two and a half of those seven years.

907
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,750
Okay. When you quit a job like that,
just quit a job and have no other job.

908
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,290
It puts unbelievable stress
on me and it's not fair to me.

909
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,953
Okay.

910
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,720
So I need to know,
do you not want to work?

911
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,570
Do you just want to stay home
with the kids? Because if you do,

912
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,570
we're going to have to downsize
our lives dramatically.

913
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:20,490
Okay.

914
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,350
If you want to keep living like this,
you need to get a job.

915
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,300
All right.
And

916
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,220
if she flips out about that type of thing.

917
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:30,953
MMM.

918
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,510
I mean that's a tough one.
I guess I would be like

919
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,280
yeah,

920
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,160
once she flipped out and be like, all
right, you know, something screaming,

921
00:54:40,161 --> 00:54:41,720
yell and get it out of your system.

922
00:54:41,721 --> 00:54:46,721
But you have 48 hours to sit down with
me and discuss this like an adult and cut

923
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,284
a plant.

924
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,740
Okay.
Or

925
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,290
I need to make a decision.

926
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,330
Okay.

927
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,170
Cause I'm not gonna,

928
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,710
I'm not gonna live my life with
this level of financial stress.

929
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:01,743
MMM.

930
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,370
Something along those lines.

931
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:08,730
Cause that's how you do what she's doing
to you is unbelievably immature and

932
00:55:08,731 --> 00:55:12,620
fucking selfish. When you need dual
income and you've got two kids at home,

933
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,550
you just don't quit a fucking job.
All right?

934
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,530
Jesus fucking Christ. What if you
did that? You know what I mean?

935
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,150
See I'm telling you this right here.

936
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,170
What'd that fucking guy was sitting
there talking that guy saying like, oh,

937
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:31,650
you should fucking leave your job and
go travel around the fucking planet.

938
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,200
This is why you don't do that.
What's your doing?

939
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:37,110
Serb busting your ass trying to get ahead.

940
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:41,220
That's what you do when you fucking young.
Okay.

941
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,940
It makes your life a hell of a lot
fucking easier and you get older. Okay.

942
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,600
Cause the older you fucking get, you
gotta be somewhere. You know what I mean?

943
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,690
Like the alley. They want to hire young
people generally fucking speaking,

944
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,510
you have to be at, at a certain
place by a certain fucking age,

945
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,530
generally speaking, or they're not
going to give you a shot. Okay.

946
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:05,820
It's like that old fucking thing about
the fucking, what was it? What was it?

947
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,190
Those two animals,
one of them was stored away food.

948
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,290
The other one was running
around like a fucking jerk off.

949
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,630
And then the storm finally hits in,
the ants fucking eaten.

950
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:16,350
And then though the turtles, uh, beat
the Hare, however the fucking story goes.

951
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,933
Um,

952
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,140
yeah,

953
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,160
I gotta tell you this,
you know,

954
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:25,920
I sacrificed lot to get where I'm at
and I missed out on a lot of shit,

955
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,220
but the shit that I on the back end,

956
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,970
then I ended up getting to do okay.
You know,

957
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:37,230
there was a whole bunch of
stuff that I missed socially,

958
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:42,840
just fun stuff. So called regular
shit that I missed because,

959
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,650
and I slept on a Futon, like I've told
you a zillion times till I was about 36,

960
00:56:46,651 --> 00:56:47,880
37 years old.

961
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,830
All right?
But

962
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,260
the outside of that was,
I got to perform at Madison Square Garden.

963
00:56:56,370 --> 00:57:00,240
I got to fucking play drums was
slash and duff and guns and roses.

964
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:03,300
You know what I mean?
It's fucking insane.

965
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:05,723
But

966
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:10,140
you gotta be willing to stay on the
fucking Futon till you, you're pushing 40

967
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:16,290
and laying there in the loneliness of
that with the fucking voices creeping in

968
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:20,070
your head of doubt. And you have to beat
those things down and said, telling you,

969
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,070
did I did I make a
horrible fucking mistake.

970
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:24,823
MMM.

971
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,880
So what you're doing sir,

972
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:33,910
you're working full time and you're going
to school full time for engineering.

973
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:37,940
Okay?
If you fucking wife,

974
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:42,970
no offense could just fucking ride
it out for a couple of fucking years.

975
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:50,010
All right? Until you get your engineering
degree, you get on your fucking feet.

976
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:53,790
This is what old school
couples used to do. Okay.

977
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,120
They worked more as a fucking
team because generally speaking,

978
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:01,560
divorce was looked down upon and
they always try to make it look like,

979
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,520
and there was all these women getting
beaten and they just stayed in there like

980
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:08,940
every fucking woman was getting the
shit slapped out of her. All right.

981
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,940
I'm not saying there wasn't
women getting fucking, you know,

982
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,740
the shit kicked out of them. All right.
But there's a lot of fucking people too,

983
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:18,990
just to throw in the fucking
towel because it's hard.

984
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,330
And then you're going to get
with somebody else and what?

985
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:25,530
It's going to be fucking easy. It, it is
hard. But this is, this is like some shit.

986
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:29,220
You need the iron this out and she
needs to get her fucking head screwed on

987
00:58:29,221 --> 00:58:33,330
straight and realize that she's got his
fucking support you by keeping up her

988
00:58:33,331 --> 00:58:35,940
end of the bullshit while
you become an engineer.

989
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,590
And then you move up the fucking ladder.

990
00:58:37,591 --> 00:58:40,620
And at some point she's going to get
what I think she wants, which is what?

991
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:42,120
She's going to get to stay home alone.

992
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,733
MMM.

993
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,760
Niggas kick. Can you come over? It
just helped me finish off this podcast.

994
00:58:47,761 --> 00:58:50,250
I know you don't want to your
shoulders blue. He just slumped.

995
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:55,610
I read this really quickly. I know
you're tired, Nia. We're all tired.

996
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,280
Are you going to sit there like, I'm
going to scold you like a little kid now.

997
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:06,150
I'm just tired. I know. It's one
15 in the morning. All right.

998
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,570
This guy, uh, his girl
comes home. He's in this,

999
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:12,380
not even your wife? No. We got two kids.

1000
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,830
The girl comes home early the other
day and she tells me she quit a job.

1001
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:20,470
I work full time in a metal shop and
I'm going to engineering school, uh,

1002
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,640
going to school time for an engineering.
We also have two beautiful kids.

1003
00:59:23,641 --> 00:59:26,460
We cannot afford our houses and our
cars, et Cetera, without her working.

1004
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:29,400
And she acts like I'm a bad guy.
When I say when I get on her about it,

1005
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,840
I don't know why I should do,

1006
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,290
I'm thinking of leaving her because this
is not the first time she's done this.

1007
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,880
And the total seven years
we've been together,

1008
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,810
she's worked about two and a half of those
years and had about 10 different jobs.

1009
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,750
I can't take the financial stress anymore.
What's your advice? Renee Hill? Yeah,

1010
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:48,350
I mean I think you should definitely
talk to her about it and if you feel like

1011
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,630
she's not pulling her weight in your
situation, then that's a problem.

1012
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,150
So yeah, it's stressful. If
he's carrying the burden,

1013
00:59:59,151 --> 01:00:02,070
they have like two kids and whatever.
I mean,

1014
01:00:02,071 --> 01:00:05,930
is she just lying around the house all
day? I mean, is she at least, you know,

1015
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:08,870
taking care of the kids and make sure
they have lunches and all that stuff?

1016
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:12,830
Or is it just all falling on him?
You know? That's really, yeah,

1017
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:16,810
well they need the money. Yeah. All
right, so I'm all right. So, okay. So

1018
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,070
if that's what their financial situation
is where they both need to be working

1019
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:23,690
and then they both need to be working,

1020
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,850
but I don't know how leaving her is
going to alleviate the financial strain,

1021
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,770
but now he's got kids,

1022
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:34,250
he's fucked and then she's going to
bleed them dry because she'd be pissed,

1023
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:39,080
I think. Yeah. I don't know. But
yeah, she needs to get it together.

1024
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,320
I'm sorry. Yeah. All right.

1025
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,960
All right. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. Jesus Christ. All right.

1026
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,550
Sorry. Why I should have known better
when I asked her since shows loose slumps,

1027
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,700
you just literally who came out of the
bedroom to grab something and just going

1028
01:00:57,701 --> 01:01:00,850
back to going to sleep in like, Oh, you
want to answer a fucking podcast question?

1029
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,700
