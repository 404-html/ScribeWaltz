1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:01,930
Okay.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,010
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,400
December 23rd, 2013. How the Hell Oh yeah.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,200
Yeah.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,460
It's the holiday season.
Doobie Doobie.

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:21,560
Do at school to lead Ba ba
Ba da ba though book God,

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,800
go fuck yourself at the mall.
Um,

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,550
two days before Christmas.
Have you finished your shopping yet?

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,410
You know what? I have and I've
been traveling so much. Um,

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,570
I actually drove to a mall the other day,

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,560
but doodler dude and I looked
inside Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah.

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,100
I literally pulled up to this
fucking thing and there was so many,

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,470
I can't even say it's just so many fucking
people who are in the same situation

14
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,930
I am, that they just had
to go out and go buy shit.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,050
That they actually had
people directing traffic.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,520
Okay.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,410
You know,
like there was some sort of flood.

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,090
They had those same sort of jackets on
like I can see you from Mars kind of

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,360
official.
Please don't run me over.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,420
I know where the supplies are.

21
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:17,530
Jackets to direct people
in to the fucking baby gap.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,950
And I was trying to make the light
and I couldn't make, if I, you know,

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,730
if I went to go make the light than I
would have blocked the road cause I wasn't

24
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:28,360
getting in. So I just had to
wait. And I was sitting there,

25
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:32,230
I was the first car and I just
looked at the guys in the coat.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,750
I looked at people not moving in line

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,103
and

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,960
I just said, fuck, I'm not
fucking going in there.

29
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,320
And I drove away and it felt good.
I felt good like the way when you used to,

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,240
you know,
when you skipped school,

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,390
you'd be there on the way to
school and you didn't want to go.

32
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,660
I don't want to fucking do they
fucking hate this. I hate it.

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,100
I don't want to do it. All right. I don't
need to be taught beyond sixth grade.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,873
All right.

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,460
And I knew it when I was a kid. I know
it. Where I around sixth, seventh grade,

36
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,720
I'm like, yeah, I got it.
I got it. This is, this is,

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,330
this is all I'm going to need in life.
I'm not going to design a bridge.

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm not going to make a rocket ship,

39
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,223
you know?

40
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,980
Oh, not to manage finance.
I'm not going to use my brain.

41
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,010
I'm just going to be walking around
reading signs it, figuring out,

42
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,210
you know how much a pack of gum at a
fucking doughnut costs though. Right?

43
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:35,810
I don't need Algebra two and trigonometry.
I don't need this shit.

44
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,610
So then you just go,
fuck this,

45
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:44,290
I'm not going to school and you
leave and it's fucking great. Great.

46
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,980
Initially and then as that coming
dread of like, you know what,

47
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:49,060
now I'm going to go back tomorrow.

48
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm going to have twice as much
fucking work than it did today.

49
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,590
Why did I just do that?
And that's what I felt like when I,

50
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,000
when I drove away from the mall.

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,623
Yeah.

52
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,510
I felt just like when I used
drive and I was driving to school,

53
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,680
my piece of Shit car,

54
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,150
and I look at my high school and I
would be fighting my fucking hand.

55
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,760
My whole arm is, it was trying to turn
into the school. I would literally,

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,200
I guess I would be fighting it to not
just hold it straight and keep going.

57
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,140
That's exactly how it felt at that mall.
And I drove away.

58
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:25,000
I drove away from that son of a bitch.
All right. And here I am Monday,

59
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,350
two days before Christmas.
And what have I learned?

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,400
If you don't fucking go into
that fucking Goddamn Cesspool,

61
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,980
yeah, you're not going to have any gifts.
And I know what you're thinking. Oh Boo.

62
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:42,280
Why did you show up as line?

63
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,140
We'll don't you show up on life because
I can't see it. I can't touch it.

64
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,180
It's just a fucking picture. I'm not doing
that. And how much shit on here is, uh,

65
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,620
is bullshit on the Internet. My
podcast is bullshit. All right?

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,400
Okay.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,930
Does that even make sense?
I don't know what it means.

68
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,780
I'm gonna fucking going
on virtual shopping.

69
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,660
I get God damn.
Kids sound like a fucking old man.

70
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,000
So now, like the fucking asshole I
am, I have to go to the mall today,

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,080
December 23rd when I should be sitting
around with a nice sweater on drinking

72
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,250
some spiked eggnog.

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,730
Okay.

74
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,330
You know, leaning up against the
counter. I'm not getting choked up.

75
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,110
Just smoked a cigar yesterday. Leaning
up against the counter. All right.

76
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,590
I Dunno fucking just leaning there.

77
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,190
You know people coming over and talking
to me. Loud music in the background.

78
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:42,550
It's fire on the talking to
me and I'm not listening,

79
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:45,580
but I'm smiling and I'm not.
And you know one of those smiles,

80
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:46,630
we don't show your teeth.

81
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,970
You know you had the same smile is when
a kid draws a smiley face on a stick

82
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,030
figure. You just have that smile on your
face and you just nod your head. Yeah.

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,080
App. Yep. You're talking and I'm
listening and I'm agreeing. I'm agreeing.

84
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,380
I don't give a shit what you're saying
cause I'm not fucking listening cause I'm

85
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,690
happy right now because
of drinking eggnog.

86
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,380
I'm getting a little glow going
little fucking glow going.

87
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,250
I don't have to go to the mall.
Everything's wrapped. It's under the tree.

88
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:15,670
Go Fuck Yourself.
I don't have any standup gigs.

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,220
Ain't got shit to do until new years.

90
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,000
You keep talking and I'm going to keep
sitting here with my little pinky stuck

91
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:26,530
out as I drink out of these fancy little
fucking teacups that has my spike deck

92
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,880
knock in it, that my friends is
what I should be doing. But no,

93
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,580
not all freckle face,

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,600
freckle face has to go back
down to the fucking mall today,

95
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,690
hoping that there's enough pork sons of
bitches out there with such evil cunt

96
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:47,170
bosses that they actually have to go to
work on December 23rd they got to show

97
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:50,410
up at their cubicles.
And maybe with a little bit of luck,

98
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,090
I can go down there between
their half a fucking day,

99
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,530
run in there and buy some shit that
I then have to take home and wrap up.

100
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,423
MMM.

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:03,801
You know,

102
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,650
and if you're a political prisoner
right now and you're listening to this,

103
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:07,750
okay.

104
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,031
You know,

105
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:12,190
it's just scratching other day on the
wall trying to not lose your mind.

106
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:15,990
I know what you're thinking. You're
probably thinking, you know, well,

107
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:19,050
I would love to have some
problems like that. You know?

108
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,280
And you know what I say to you?
I say to you, ah, you know,

109
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,590
walk a day in my fucking shoes. All right.
They're just stuck in a prison cell.

110
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:32,040
Haven't seen loved ones in 12 years.
Okay.

111
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,640
You know,
if your present self so bad,

112
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,750
how the fuck did you get a fucking
device to download this podcast?

113
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,390
So you had to listen to it. Once you
explain that one political prisoner,

114
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:46,970
did they give you a keyboard to writing
some questions here to make me feel

115
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:47,804
fucking bad?

116
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,180
MMM.

117
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,530
I just did that before somebody
went first. World problems.

118
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,130
Okay.

119
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,520
You know what I hate more than anything.
I hate fucking expressions.

120
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,490
Not expressions like a
stitch in time saves nine.

121
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,630
Okay.

122
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,500
Which actually makes sense, which
I can kind of equate to, you know,

123
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,790
by the present today.

124
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,550
So you don't have to fucking wait
nine hours in line on Monday.

125
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,090
I just hate when a,

126
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,440
okay.

127
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,630
I Dunno like a boss.

128
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,250
Okay.

129
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,700
Shaking my head. I just fucked.
I don't mind them. I just,

130
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,790
I hate how they're just
continually used to the point

131
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,550
I that, that people are still
expecting a laugh. It's like,

132
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:36,990
how many fucking times
have you heard that?

133
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,690
How many times you've heard that
come into your own fucking mouth,

134
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,970
right? Oh my God, I am in a fucking
mode today. And you know why it is.

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,090
It's because I have to go
Christmas shopping. Um,

136
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,230
and also because I bought him new mixer
and I bought a more compact one that

137
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:54,990
would be better for travel.
And the guy goes,

138
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:58,080
do you have all the wires that you need
that Mike? Yeah, I got all that shit.

139
00:07:58,081 --> 00:07:59,130
I'm good.
Thank you very much.

140
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:03,000
And I come here and there's just a little
bit of a different setup and I pressed

141
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:03,661
every button,

142
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:07,260
I plugged the wire and every place I could
fucking plug it in and I can't figure

143
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:11,100
it out. All right. For
you tech people out there,

144
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,630
I have the Mackie four oh two
V as in Victor, l as in Lucy,

145
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:19,980
Z as in Zebra, four. And I can't figure
out how to fucking use it. So whatever.

146
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,750
I'm holding this up like a microphone.

147
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,130
I'm starting to like this
to be honest with you.

148
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,543
MMM.

149
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,110
Anyways, for those of you who, uh,
you know, we're out there shopping,

150
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:34,250
doing what you should be doing,
building snow forts and whatnot. Um,

151
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,090
I did a very special podcast this
week with one of my favorite people,

152
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,500
not only in this business but also
in the world. Uh, Dave Kapner,

153
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,910
David Kempner from the hilarious
new site last night. Uh,

154
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:50,270
anchorman two,
the legend of Ron Burgundy continues.

155
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,350
Um, I interviewed him this past,
uh, was it Friday, I think?

156
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,390
Yeah. Friday uploaded
it just in case you, uh,

157
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,800
didn't check to see,

158
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:04,620
check your Twitter account or ever the
fuck you find out that there's a new

159
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:08,760
podcast. So I interviewed him, we talked
about anchorman and all this other stuff,

160
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,060
hanging out, getting drunk together
and singing holiday songs and all that,

161
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:15,240
which had a great time and uh,
and was recorded.

162
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,530
It was recorded live at
the new all things comedy,

163
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:24,330
a podcast studios.
So with that,

164
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,110
eventually,

165
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,650
hopefully I'm going to occasionally
have a guest and they'll just be bonus

166
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,390
podcast.
All right.

167
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,990
I'm not going to be reading any fucking
advertisements and all that shit.

168
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,820
It's just going to be,
oh well I say that now.

169
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,540
Who knows what if I throw out
my funny bone and I'm like,

170
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,960
I can't do my standup anymore,
then maybe I'll have to do with why.

171
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,790
As of right now,
I plan to do it and a pure fashion,

172
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,090
I'm not reading any shit
about chocolate covered fruit.

173
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,460
I'm not reading any shit
about fucking how to,

174
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,330
how to have your own goddamn lemonade
stand in your bedroom. I'm not doing that.

175
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,900
I'm just going to enter a
interview some people. Um,

176
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:02,190
so David Kenner is the first one
and uh,

177
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,250
Jay Moore is going to be my 72nd guessed
now in between him Kepner and Jay more.

178
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,940
I don't know what I'm going to
have, but that's all that, that's,

179
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm just giving you guys the
heads up. Okay. There we go.

180
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,090
Um,
so anyways,

181
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:21,150
I don't have a lot to talk about this
week for the simple fact that I'm off the

182
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:25,060
fucking road and other than the fact
that I have to do my Christmas shopping,

183
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,360
I am excited that the, uh, the year's
over, but I also have to keep, uh,

184
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,760
got to keep the act tight,
got to go to the local clubs,

185
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,220
got to do my little song and dance
because I have a big new year's Gig.

186
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,030
New Year's Gig.
New Year's.

187
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,790
New Years Eve.
Everybody,

189
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,500
if you're fucking botox ass
is in the Los Angeles area.

190
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,670
I am playing at the
mighty Wiltern theater,

191
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,220
a theater that I drove by for years.
And I told my lovely wife,

192
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,120
Nia, I said, someday I'm going
to play that fucking place.

193
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,730
I'm going to sell it out and afterwards
we're going to get drunk and I'm going

194
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:18,020
to kiss you on the forehead. Now. God
dammit, I have booked a gig there,

195
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:22,400
but there's a few tickets left to make the
dream come true. And you're like, Whoa,

196
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,970
wait a minute.
Why do I just want to go and see you?

197
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,530
Can you sweeten the pot a little bit?
Is there anything else that you can add?

198
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,560
It is a new year's show is just something
else that you can add to the pot to

199
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:38,180
make me say no.

200
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:41,810
I'm not going to stay home and jerk off
to internet porn with a silly hat on

201
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:46,370
blowing that fucking trumpet. Okay. I'm
going to come down to the Wiltern theater.

202
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,490
What else do you have for me?
It's a buyer's market.

203
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,940
Everybody's trying to get me out to go
fucking twinkle toes around the God damn

204
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,720
fucking tiles.
All right,

205
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,850
well I'm going to be down there with the
entire crew of knuckleheads that I go

206
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,470
to the rose bowl with,
um,

207
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,520
every year through all doing about
10 minutes in front of me. Um,

208
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,020
we have rose boat droves,
bolt, tailgate legend,

209
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,380
the mean Joe Greene,
the Jack Lambert,

210
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,540
the Mike Wagner of fucking a tailgate.

211
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,470
Mr. Joe Barton. Nick. All right.

212
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,240
With this new comedy CD salute,
but we hyped right here on the podcast.

213
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,440
He's going to be there.

214
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,720
Joe Aka Joe Aka.

215
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,050
You need fifth. You need to lose 50
pounds before you talk to me. Bitch, Bart.

216
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,630
Nick will be there.

217
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,730
We have master chef and a and a heater.

218
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,420
Xtrordinair Jason Law
head is going to be there.

219
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,480
J Law head fan of all Cleveland Sports.

220
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,650
You cannot talk to Jason lie at about
sports anytime you it about your team.

221
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,410
He immediately just says,
I have no sympathy for you.

222
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,060
You won a championship in
1972 because he's never seen.

223
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,960
He's never seen any of his professional
teams to win a championship.

224
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,820
Therefore therefore he doesn't want to
hear it from you. And last but not least,

225
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,710
we've got Andrew feminists down there.

226
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Andrew Feminists who brings other
spirits that will not be mentioned to the

227
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,563
tailgate.

228
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,830
He's also the one that has to sift through
all your fucking emails every week to

229
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:32,770
this podcast. And he
has mentioned to me, uh,

230
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,130
he wants to do it a little
more efficiently. All right,

231
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:40,600
so here's how we can do it. Um, if you
want to send in an email to this, uh,

232
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:43,660
this podcast,
the low technology Monday morning podcast,

233
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,980
this is where you send your emails
to, all right, you send it to bill.

234
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,660
That's bravo illness,
Lupus, lupus. Uh, Bill

235
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,050
bill@themlmpodcast.com.
All right.

236
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,550
And the MMP in Mlm podcast
are all capitalized.

237
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,720
bill@themmpodcast.com. All
right. And he would please,

238
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,790
he's asking you nicely to just say,

239
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:13,990
please make the subject be reveled
relevant to your email. All right?

240
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,860
Just don't write like a hey can face
or whatever. I mean, he could do that,

241
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:21,310
but unless you're, if, if you're not
writing about Khan faces, then you know,

242
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,880
if you want your shit read,
help us out here.

243
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,710
Please make the subject be
relevant to the email. And he says,

244
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:33,910
I read emails that are great, but they
have shitty subjects and vice versa.

245
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,180
Oh, so in other words, don't give
a great subject to a shitty email.

246
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,020
Email number two,
please keep them less than 10,000 words.

247
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:44,260
Some people write great stories,
but they are too long for the podcast.

248
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:49,210
In other words, I suck at reading
out loud. And last but not least,

249
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:53,570
I know a lot of people ordered some tee
shirts and, uh, we're doing a bang up job.

250
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,470
Andrew is getting everything out there.
Um,

251
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,710
unfortunately this is a crazy
time of year. Occasionally

252
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,130
merchandise has gotten lost.

253
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,780
99% of it has not gets
lost or stolen in the mail.

254
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:10,460
Who knows what the fuck
they're doing out there.

255
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,830
I'm out of the 2000 plus orders that we've
had. We've had like what are we up to?

256
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,664
I Dunno how many,

257
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,710
I think we've had maybe like 10 or
11 that had a problem out of 2000.

258
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,700
So, and know this. Okay.
If for some reason,

259
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,320
whatever you ordered doesn't get there
in time for Christmas and anything,

260
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,070
just let us know in a nice generally
lady like way. And I swear to God,

261
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,960
I'll send you some extra
shit. I'll autograph it or
whatever. Okay. There you go.

262
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,340
Anyways, so on back to
the podcast here. Um,

263
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:44,950
okay.

264
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,720
Speaking of reading out loud, I only have
a, we only have two reads this week, so

265
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,100
yeah,

266
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,170
you guys don't have to worry about me.
Annoying the shit out of you with my,

267
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,830
my reading out loud, my lack, my lack
layer of, of reading out loud scales.

268
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,460
Um,
so I'm doing New Year's eve and uh,

269
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,810
I was actually thinking the other day on
a buddy of mine who was going out to go

270
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:11,050
do a new year's give giggers coming up
there and we were talking about how funny

271
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:15,970
it is when they give out the noisemakers
before the show starts and just who is

272
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:19,990
the fucking asshole who came
up with those fucking trumpets?

273
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,050
Those things that just hit that note,

274
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,530
Hey,
hey,

275
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,790
I think it was so many, just hated new
years or never got invited to a party.

276
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,410
And he's like, all right,
you got to go out to a party.

277
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,670
I'm just gonna make this fucking horn.

278
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:37,990
That's gonna annoy the
shit out of everybody. Um,

279
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,720
which reminds me to tell every comedian
out there, whatever Gig you do,

280
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:45,840
make sure they don't hand out the fucking
noise makers before you go on stage

281
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:50,370
because there is no comeback to,
hey, I'm all right. Here we go.

282
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:54,060
The advertising for this
week, man. Great. Everybody,

283
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,610

284

285
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,490
Cast iron grilling grapes that are
revolutionizing the way people grill named

286
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:13,260
one of 2012 best grilling accessories
by men's health magazine. Man.

287
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:17,550
Great man. Grades are the perfect gift

Those were,

312
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,210
those were two very nice reads
if I do say so myself. Um,

313
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,760
all right. What are we going to talk about
this week? You know, I, I, like I said,

314
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,680
I don't have a lot to talk about and um,

315
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,210
yeah,

316
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,770
I did watch some American football
for the first time since, uh,

317
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,540
okay.

318
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,750
I guess the last three weeks and I
actually sat down and watch some,

319
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,670
I had had no idea that the cults
were in it. I thought the colts,

320
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:18,360
we're like beating every good team in
the league and then shit in the bed

321
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,700
against bad ones and they were all
going to be about eight and eight.

322
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,810
Evidently they're gonna make
the playoffs. Playoffs. Um,

323
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,400
I still like the Seattle Seahawks despite
the fact that they lost to the Arizona

324
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,130
cardinals.
Um,

325
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,440
okay.

326
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,850
I still think it is. There's
the loose. Um, anyways,

327
00:19:37,851 --> 00:19:42,851
I watched the Patriots Ravens game
yesterday and I was embarrassed by that

328
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:47,690
officiating. Jesus Christ. What
the fuck did the ravens do?

329
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,830
That was like watching an NBA game.
Um,

330
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,120
and sad to say a lot of the calls,
it's not even the rep's fault.

331
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,650
Those are like the new rules.

332
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,140
Yeah.

333
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,790
I think for our first touchdown,

334
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,690
what happened was one of
the Ravens cornerbacks, um,

335
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,670
had the nerve to look our receiver in
the eye as he escorted of down the field.

336
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,710
And uh, thanks to Jim or say
that is, that is illegal now.

337
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,290
Okay.
After five yards,

338
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,100
you cannot put your hands on
the receiver and in no way,

339
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:24,730
shape or form after seven yards are
you allowed to look at the receiver.

340
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,550
You can't look them in the eye,

341
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,740
you can't look them in and
in his general vicinity.

342
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:33,790
You supposed to keep me in your peripheral
vision without touching them. Okay.

343
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,720
And if you sense that he is
looking back at the ball,

344
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:39,790
you then also have to
look back at the ball,

345
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,710
but not in the direction
of the receivers head.

346
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,190
You have to turn your head the same
way the receiver turned his head.

347
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,620
You know what they should do
at this point? They should put,

348
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,710
give like penalty flags to the wide
receiver and just have like anytime the

349
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,920
perceiver gets touched,

350
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,880
he can just reach in and fucking throw
the flag because that's what every

351
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,050
fucking receiver does.

352
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,860
Now when the ball sails over his head
as they're falling to the ground,

353
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,790
if he noticed the receivers
are our miming throwing a flag,

354
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,210
they throw their fucking hand up. I
don't know. It's annoying as hell.

355
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,350
So,
um,

356
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,040
okay.

357
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,420
I hate when I was actually surprised.

358
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:21,290
I thought we were going to lose
to the ravens. I, um, you know,

359
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,240
it's just,
I don't like winning like that.

360
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,440
We're like 20 calls all go in your favor.
I mean,

361
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:31,680
I actually saw what's his face
Harbach at one point, like watch.

362
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,430
And I agreed with them.
I laughed.

363
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:37,550
I felt bad for the guy and I'm
rooting against his fucking tape.

364
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,323
MMM.

365
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,230
I Dunno. This is just, it's all this
fallout of I think the concussions.

366
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:49,670
And I also think it's the fallout of
when a Peyton manning and Jimmer say had

367
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:53,810
their fucking crybaby fest when
they lost to the Patriots yet again.

368
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,600
And they made the tape and they went
to the NFL and the NFL was going,

369
00:21:56,601 --> 00:22:00,350
that's legal. It's legal. And then they
bitched again. They bitched during the,

370
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,260
the fucking pro bowl.
They bitched at the pro bowl.

371
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:04,760
They pitch during the
week of the Superbowl.

372
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,820
They pitched right up to the
fucking draft. And then Jim or say,

373
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:12,380
who sits on the rules committee,
spearheaded all these new, uh,

374
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,160
fucking rules of coverage.
And I dunno,

375
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,060
it's not the game that I grew up with.
I still love watching it.

376
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,713
MMM.

377
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,930
I was fucking great yesterday.
Had a couple of buddies
over, got the fire going.

378
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,920
Uh,
unfortunate that I didn't,

379
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:31,180
it didn't get to watch the packers
Steelers with the snow on the ground.

380
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,250
I was watching what I watch.

381
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,510
I say watch the Patriots Ravens and then
I watched some of the eagles late night

382
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:40,180
game. Um, and I guess
they're playing real well.

383
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:42,820
I don't know a lot of shit that's going
on and getting caught up in hockey.

384
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,930
I watched a couple Bruins
sabers games, you know, one,

385
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:51,820
one we lost one and uh,
I dunno,

386
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,900
it's funny, a lot of, I saw what
Sean Thornton did, you know,

387
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:58,570
against the penguin's Penguin's
fans are fucking hilarious.

388
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,400
I think they actually have a lot of guilt
with some of the absolute animals that

389
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:08,401
they've had on their team because they're
really trying to compare going like

390
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,390
act like Sean, what Sean Thornton did
and everything that Matt Cooke did.

391
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:18,340
Like that's a wash,
like penalties offset like one disgusting,

392
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:21,280
horrible piece of Shit.
Move by.

393
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:26,281
Thornton washes out cooks entire three
year terror run before he turned his game

394
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:29,110
around.
Which I do give him credit for now.

395
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:31,870
He plays the game a lot
cleaner or whatever.

396
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,573
MMM.

397
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,300
I can really listen to it from any other,
anybody else other than penguins fans?

398
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,090
I mean you guys have all
Samuelson in your ring of honor.

399
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:44,510
I really think you're making a statement
when you do something like that.

400
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:47,630
When you put a like that up there
next to fucking Mario Lemieux.

401
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,640
I mean it's just, it's unbelievable. Ah,

402
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,450
and I was actually talking to somebody
about some of the most dirtiest players

403
00:23:55,451 --> 00:24:00,050
I've ever seen since I've watched the
game all the way back to the Claudine

404
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,870
Claudel amuse the Dale hunters and all
those, uh, you know, in my top 10 list,

405
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:07,180
like two of them are
our Pittsburgh Penguins.

406
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,183
MMM.

407
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,840
And I think to make that list,

408
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:16,841
you have to have that reptilian sort of
brain where you can end the guys career

409
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,540
and like in between periods,

410
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,060
just sit there eating a sandwich
and you're not nauseous at all.

411
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,320
You just don't give a fuck.
That's scary.

412
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,270
That's scary fucking thing where people
on the ice have their head on a swivel.

413
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,150
Like, where is he, where is he? Um,

414
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,210
and there's a very special few,

415
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,820
okay.

416
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,930
That have debt of a,

417
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,860
that have done that have just
brought that vibe to it. But anyways,

418
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:49,030
I'm just like to get back into watching
hockey and that type of stuff. And uh,

419
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,320
there has to be a happy medium medium
with this file yet another record, uh,

420
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,040
Peyton Manning, congratulations. He
just threw for 51 fucking touchdowns.

421
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,580
But does it eve? I mean it's
these phenomenal, but with,

422
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,140
you can't cover receivers anymore,
so I think that they have to have,

423
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,180
they should just, since these new rules,
almost like the steroid era, right?

424
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,240
You have to have a new wing
as far as records go because

425
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,630
okay.

426
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,230
If you essentially couldn't
cover a fucking receiver
past five yards. All right,

427
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,020
Dan Marino all day long. I didn't want
to fucking hear it. That guy would have,

428
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,670
he'd had 60 touchdown, 70 touchdown.
He throw for 6,000 fucking yards.

429
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,420
He played when you could still mug a
receiver and he's still all these records.

430
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,520
I don't know.
These are all Dan Marino was the records.

431
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,220
It's bugging me that they
made the game easier.

432
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,540
Okay.

433
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,320
Maybe it's harder. Another layer. I don't
know. I'm just a grumpy old fucking man.

434
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,071
So anyways,

435
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:48,790
I don't have shit to talk about this week
and somehow I've managed to still talk

436
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:52,380
for 25 minutes because I'm
a God damn wind bag. And um,

437
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,070
so I was doing my usual shit.

438
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:57,910
I was going on the Internet when I
don't have shit to talk about. And a,

439
00:25:57,911 --> 00:25:59,480
I was trying to find a,

440
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,070
okay,

441
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,500
get caught up on some stories.
I guess everybody from the uh,

442
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,500
Greenpeace 30 have been let go and uh,

443
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,080
okay.

444
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,940
Two of the pussy riot members go free and
Russia, Russia, you know, I swear to God,

445
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,030
if you're hippies or you're singing
in a band, they stick you in prison.

446
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,380
Really old school,

447
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,940
new prison amnesty's seemed by critics
as an attempt to ward off criticism of

448
00:26:24,941 --> 00:26:29,260
human rights record ahead of
the Winter Olympics. Oh yeah.

449
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,630
I guess they spend a ton of
money on the Winter Olympics.

450
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:35,800
Like they bought a bunch of fake Snow
Vladimir putting in or whatever the fuck

451
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:36,281
his name is.

452
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:40,660
He bought a bunch of fake snow just in
case there isn't snow in the posh area

453
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:44,760
that they want to have the
Olympics. So, um, you know, it is,

454
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,710
you can put anonymous people in prison
and uh, nobody really pays attention,

455
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,740
but a, if they're a bunch of
hippies attached to Greenpeace,

456
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,830
everybody pays attention. And if they
were in a band called pussy riot,

457
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:59,670
people give a fuck. So, uh, one of
the pussy too of the pussy riders,

458
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,100
that's the name of the
band just got out of jail.

459
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,490
The third member of the Russian punk
band pussy riot. I what did she do?

460
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,860
Two and a half years,
uh,

461
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:12,861
released from custody following an
amnesty law passed by parliament and that

462
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:16,010
they start [inaudible].
Um,

463
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,780
I mean at least try to do my last name
toll of Kona Cova to Lakota rover Toilet

464
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,860
Kournikova nudge nudge, nudge, Duh.

465
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,840
No [inaudible] Tolla
Kona Cova left prison,

466
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,900
left a prison colony in eastern Siberia.

467
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:38,400
They put something in a fucking bat in
a punk band in Siberia on Monday hours

468
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:42,930
after another band member,
Maria, normal name Allah Kina,

469
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,050
I don't know how to say it was
released in another region.

470
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,270
The amnesty that enabled they're released
is seen as the Kremlin's attempt to

471
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:54,570
sued criticism of Russians
human rights record.

472
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,470
I had of the Winter Olympics
in Sochi in February.

473
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,260
I don't know if I'm saying any
of this right? A one. Okay.

474
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:06,090
The one of them was 25 the other 24 were
convicted of hooliganism for performing

475
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:11,091
a crude punk prayer and it could thedral
against Putin ties to the Russian

476
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,290
Orthodox Church. The two women have been
doof had been due for at least in March.

477
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,000
How much time did they do?

478
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,210
Okay.

479
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,550
I don't fucking know. Was that
even remotely exciting? Well,

480
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:26,240
if you thought that was boring, here's
another one. Here's another Russian guy,

481
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:32,860
college coalition. Nick Cough,
collision off coalition. Nigga,

482
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:35,100
what the fuck is what the
12th consonants in a row?

483
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,100
K. A. L. A. S. H. N. I. K. O. V.

484
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,140
I'm good with the cal ash.
All there is countless to cough,

485
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,800
assault rifle designer dead at 94
and you're probably like, Bill,

486
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:53,390
why do I give a fuck about this guy? Who
is this guy? All the rednecks know him.

487
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,560
This guy was the inventor of the AK 47,
um,

488
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:03,090
the assault rifle designer of the AK 47
assault rifle that killed more people

489
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:08,070
than any other firearm has died.
I'm the designer of the salt rifle.

490
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:12,800
They killed more people than
any other. He died at 94. Um,

491
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,290
he was in his twenties when
he created the AK 47. Well,

492
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,780
there is a go getter
just after World War II.

493
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,440
He died in his home city
of, uh, well, you know,

494
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:25,230
something that I don't feel bad for
him after what the fucking Germans did

495
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,430
coming into their goddamn country.
Okay,

496
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,120
yeah.

497
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,100
Here's a, here's a real
patriotic guy. He said, well,

498
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,400
we gotta be able to mow down these crouch
next time they come over the border.

499
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,270
And he made the AK 47.
So my hat's off to him.

500
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,780
Um,
and last,

501
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:44,920
but least this is what's going on in the
world according to my fucking skimming

502
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,330
thousands rally against racism in Sweden.
I was just there.

503
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:53,620
I didn't realize that they had
a neo Nazis and Sweden. Oh,

504
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:54,430
that's disgusting.

505
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,690
Thousands of Swedes demonstrating against
racism and Nazi-ism have gathered in

506
00:29:58,691 --> 00:29:59,480
Stockholm,

507
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,480
Stockholm suburb a week after a smaller
rally in the same district was attacked

508
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:06,040
by neo Nazis.

509
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:10,450
What kind of a jerk off joins
a fucking neo Nazi group.

510
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,500
What is it about Hitler that
you're looking at going, oh yeah,

511
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,620
there's the guy that makes sense.

512
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,400
And what is it is they have nothing else
going on in their life other than the

513
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:28,020
fact that they're white. Um,
you're white, you're a white male,

514
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:31,890
heterosexual. How much further down the
track do you need to start the race?

515
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,480
And you still lose?

516
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,170
So then you got to blame somebody else
who starts nine miles in the other

517
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:41,810
fucking direction and they catch
up with you. Ah, you're whiny cuts.

518
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,950
Okay.
So crowds marched on Ivy.

519
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:48,951
Evidently they had an antiracism
march and these neo Nazis attacked.

520
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,340
You know,
is,

521
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:56,250
is there ever an uglier look on
somebody's face when they're pro racism,

522
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,850
when they're attacking somebody?
It's the fucking most hateful look.

523
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,320
Look at that son of a bitch.

524
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,540
So crowds marched on Sunday towards a
spot in car tarp in the south of the

525
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:11,910
Capitol where music performances
and speeches were held.

526
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:16,170
Organizers of the event said 16,000
people attended the rally. Well,

527
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:20,730
thank God for those 16,000 about a hundred
uniform police were deployed at the

528
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:24,540
event. A police spokesman that's
good. One person for every six,

529
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,110
1600 people. What could go wrong? Um,

530
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,850
and I was that right or 160.
Oh Jesus belt.

531
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,290
Don't be doing math in your head.

532
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,530
I've been to many demonstrations in my
life and this is one of the biggest.

533
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:39,090
That's great.
That's great.

534
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:43,710
Said some fucking person
that I can't pronounce their
name. It shows how we many,

535
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,490
uh,

536
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,850
how many we are fighting for the equal
value of all human rights and that we are

537
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:49,860
many in comparison to the extremist.

538
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,240
I think many people are worried about
the rise of the far right in Europe and

539
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:57,930
want to show that in Sweden
we are taking another route.

540
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:59,460
How about you're taking a new route,

541
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:04,230
then you let the Nazis user train
systems to go into fucking Norway.

542
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,760
Yeah. Jesus. I actually,

543
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,540
it's just always going to be around.
It's just always going to be around.

544
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,600
And I guess how do you,
how do you think you combat that shit?

545
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,130
Do you have to fight it with violence?

546
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,710
Okay.

547
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,650
How else do you do it?
I these guys,

548
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:28,160
I don't understand them. I,
you're not eating every day.

549
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,760
Do you not have a roof over your head?
What is the fucking problem?

550
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,290
Okay,

551
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,660
that's depressing. All
right. Why did I read that?

552
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:39,010
That just put me in a bad fucking mood is,

553
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,270
is there anything worse
than fucking Neo Nazis?

554
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:42,660
Okay.

555
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,410
The sons of neonazis. Um,
anyways, let's, let's, let's,

556
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:51,150
let's read some shit here. Christmas
shopping. I talked about my new mixer.

557
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,610
I talked about penguins
fans. It talked about, uh,

558
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,770
NFL football. I don't know what
else to tell you. You know,

559
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:01,290
what is the sweet people?
I just have unbelievable anxiety.

560
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:04,890
They have to go out and shop.
And you know, it's funny,

561
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,810
when I actually went out
browsing the other day,

562
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,270
I actually saw a bunch of shit from me.

563
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,610
And if that isn't the ultimate sign
of what a selfish cunt you are,

564
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,393
mmm.

565
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,620
I can't find anything for
anybody. Oh, I would like that.

566
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,960
I would enjoy that.

567
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:25,930
Okay.

568
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,550
Um, all right. Anchorman two. Bill
broadcasters saw anchorman two.

569
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:35,050
It was brilliant. The whole cast is great.
Yeah, I just saw it. I fucking loved it.

570
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,990
Um, and went with the
Lawhead and Nia last night.

571
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:42,840
We all had a great time. Uh, they
said the whole cast is great,

572
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:45,300
but there is a level of trust
when it comes to will Ferrell.

573
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,950
He always makes the right decisions. Love
listening to you. Talk to David Kempner.

574
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,870
You definitely have to have
Jay more on. It's sometime, uh,

575
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,280
the running joke with Jay Morris.
He gave me shit for, not he,

576
00:33:56,281 --> 00:34:00,060
I was on his podcast and I haven't
had him back on my podcast. All right.

577
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,920
And there is a method to my madness.

578
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,100
I don't think he should go on somebody's
podcast and then fucking two weeks

579
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:06,140
later you have to,

580
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:09,180
you just talked to him for God damn
hour about comedy and every other,

581
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:13,290
the other thing under the sun. You
got to let some time go by. You know,

582
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,130
you got to let it marinate. You got to
let it heat up. You got to let some shit,

583
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,680
some water go under the bridge
before you haven't back.

584
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:23,370
Plus I never have guests on this podcast.
I just don't.

585
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:27,630
But now we have a studio so I will do it.
So David Kempner was first.

586
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,310
Jay Morris 72nd,
so I got to have another fucking,

587
00:34:32,311 --> 00:34:35,130
what does that 70 guests? Um, anyways,

588
00:34:35,131 --> 00:34:37,320
he said you definitely have
to have Jay more on some time,

589
00:34:37,321 --> 00:34:39,510
but don't let the whole guest
thing get out of control.

590
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,480
You're the master of the monologue.
Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, in other words,

591
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:46,770
keep doing what you're doing. All
right. Need an NFL team. Hey William,

592
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,870
I've really gotten into the NFL this
season, but still don't have a team.

593
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,590
I really follow being Irish
with no allegiance to any state.

594
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,260
I have the choice of
any team in the league,

595
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,010
so can either be a glory hunting
fuck and go with the Seahawks.

596
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,430
See even this guy in Ireland knows
that the Seahawks have the favor or the

597
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:09,960
Broncos or being long suffering cunt
to go with the Raiders of the jets.

598
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,290
Any thoughts yourself?
Um,

599
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,520
I would definitely not be a
jets fan because there is,

600
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,650
there is a one sip of glory

601
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,120
in their and their entire victory
chest there. Uh, but the Raiders,

602
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:32,810
they've won three super bowls.
They do have a great logo,

603
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,950
although their fan base has kind of made
a left turn with the up and all that

604
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:42,680
type of shit. The same way we kind
of have the sweet Caroline stuff. Um,

605
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,300
I try and block that out. I like
the Raiders, the Raiders. Also,

606
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:46,710
if you're going to listen
to them on the radio,

607
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,110
I think have one of the best
announcers in all the sports.

608
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,280
MMM.

609
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,010
I don't know. Just pick a team
and have a good fucking time.

610
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:57,590
I don't give a shit who you pile on
with. I mean, I wouldn't pick a team.

611
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:01,400
It's sucks. If I was trying to get into
the sport, you know what I would do?

612
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:03,920
I would pick a team that's
just underneath the favorites.

613
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,933
MMM.

614
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,510
Like, I dunno, I'm trying to
think of the premier league.

615
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:11,400
Who the fuck I would pick.
I don't know who I would pick,

616
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,950
but I definitely wouldn't
pick like a man United.

617
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,653
MMM.

618
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,290
I would more go man city, I
guess. I don't fucking know.

619
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,860
I'm going over my goddamn head.
Uh,

620
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,090
but I would definitely
say do not pick the jets.

621
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,943
Okay.

622
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,730
You don't want to pick
the judge, right. The jet.

623
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,220
I am a 45 year old man that jets have
not won a Superbowl since I was one years

624
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:38,510
old. Walking around with my
big pasty, hairless head,

625
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,190
pissing and shitting myself. Okay.
So that's, that's that option.

626
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,260
The Raiders have not won a title since,

627
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,460
uh, my voice just started
cracking as I was hitting puberty.

628
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,870
Like, do you think they're
going to be the red skins?

629
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,410
That's the last time that they want.

630
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,500
Ronald Reagan was in his first
term as president. All right.

631
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,210
I'm just letting you know
what you sign up for.

632
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,480
Let's go around the league a little bit.
The Miami Dolphins,

633
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,810
the Miami Dolphins have
not won a super bowl since.

634
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,073
Uh,

635
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:16,960
okay.

636
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,610
I got a cowboy outfit.

637
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,430
I got a hat and I got some guns,

638
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,490
some cap guns for my birthday and then
the big kids is, I was standing there,

639
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,460
came walking by,

640
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,110
took both guns out of my holster and it
just smashed him on the fucking driveway

641
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:35,870
and continued walking away
walking up the street.

642
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:37,340
They just came walking up the street.

643
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,270
They saw me standing there dressed
like Billy the kid, and they like,

644
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:44,720
that's not Billy the kid.
That's not even Billy the teen.

645
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,210
That is Billy the toddler.
And they walked up to me,

646
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:50,690
they took my guns out of my holster
and they smashed him on the ground,

647
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,290
laughed and continued walking.
I picked him up.

648
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:59,150
I walked into the house and I handed it
to my mother and she said, who did this?

649
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,460
And I said,
I said big kids.

650
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,360
And then she made me a sandwich.
All right.

651
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,113
Okay.

652
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,330
Peanut butter and Jelly.

653
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,370
And she left the crust on because she
didn't raise any fucking finicky pussies

654
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,250
when it came to food. All right.
I made you the sandwich. So,

655
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,720
uh, you, you, you remember
that when you were a kid,

656
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:28,220
you were going to sit there until you
finish that. Was that a dying thing?

657
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,560
Is that considered abuse
now and you just sit there,

658
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:35,120
you fucking legs falling asleep. And it
was her way to just keep you stationary.

659
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,100
She went around and clean the fucking
house. So then what did you end up doing?

660
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,040
You ended up taking most of the food.

661
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,300
Yeah.

662
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,710
And you fucking threw it behind the
stereo that was at giant wooden thing that

663
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,750
they had it on.
And you just throw it back there.

664
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:57,190
Did you finish it? Yes. Died dead
aid at all. And then that was it.

665
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,530
But you were too stupid to wait.

666
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:03,430
Does she walked away and went to the
store and just grab the sandwich and throw

667
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:03,791
it away?

668
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:07,930
You just left it there till all the aunts
came and then she figured it out and

669
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,340
then he got sent to bed anyways,

670
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,110
possibly beaten with the fraternity
paddle that your dad kept. All right.

671
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,150
I'm gonna have to go to,
you know what?

672
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:19,660
I'm going to nfl.com I'm going to go
buy all the fucking teams right now.

673
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,730
I'll give you a little
bit fits for the holidays.

674
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:27,390
I'll give you a little childhood
story during the holiday season.

675
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,510
Scooby dooby Doo and silvery bells.
Get on the fucking sleigh,

676
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,340
but go to grandma's senile house.
Um,

677
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,390
I went to the nhl.com sorry,

678
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:43,100
force of habit and F l.com.
Here we go.

679
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,210
Loading, loading, loading. Get
those teams go in. All right.

680
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:53,380
The buffalo bills have
never won a championship,

681
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,010
so there's no story for you.
That's one team.

682
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,460
Okay.

683
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:03,320
All right. The Baltimore Ravens
have not won a super bowl.

684
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,780
Okay.

685
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,010
Since January,

686
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,340
I don't have any childhood
stories cause I was an adult.

687
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,740
So that's a man's team right there.

688
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:19,240
The Cincinnati Bengals have
never won a super bowl.

689
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,380
No story for you so far.

690
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:27,381
The buffalo bills and the
fucking Cincinnati Bengals
zero titles and you want to

691
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:31,680
add to that no fucking childhood story.
The Cleveland Browns,

692
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,960
you take all three of them.

693
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,530
You stick them in a burlap sack like
a bunch of kittens you can't raise.

694
00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:39,390
You throw them over the
bridge in the fucking river.

695
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,280
The Pittsburgh Steelers have not
won a fucking title since what?

696
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:47,040
2009 that's a good team to jump on.

697
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,230
They get a head coach and
they fucking stick with them.

698
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,340
The Houston Texans expansion franchise.
Wait a minute,

699
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:58,340
before you throw those kittens over the
bridge, we got another one to stick in.

700
00:40:58,341 --> 00:40:59,450
A burlap sack.

701
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,940
The Indianapolis Colts used
to be the Baltimore Colts.

702
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,650
They have not won a super bowl.

703
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,990
Okay.

704
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,510
Since I had just stopped pissing myself,

705
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,950
I just learned how to sit on
that little plastic toilet,

706
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,393
you know,

707
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,410
urinate or defecate.

708
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,880
Standup excitedly scream at my
mother and point at it and I got,

709
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:27,700
y'all got fucking shit right.

710
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,860
The Jaguars never won one.
The Titans,

711
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,260
Aka the Houston Oilers never won one.
Jesus.

712
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,120
There's a lot of teams that
haven't won a Superbowl.

713
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:44,050
The Denver Broncos have not
won the Superbowl since I
didn't realize I was going

714
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:49,280
to go bald and
start balding.

715
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,130
I still have some left.
Um, in the late nineties,

716
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,560
they have not won a Superbowl till
somebody said for the first time. Hey,

717
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:00,830
have you heard of this
guy, m and m? By the way,

718
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,270
if you guys heard his new album yet,
Jesus Christ Jesus Christ.

719
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,200
Oh, fucking inspiring. Is that if
you're in any sort of entertainment,

720
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:14,590
the Kansas City chiefs have not
won a super bowl since 1970 1970.

721
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:20,850
Since Nixon was not
exposed as a fucking lie,

722
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,550
the Raiders already did.
The charges have never won one.

723
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:26,960
They wanna fuck an AFL title.

724
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,560
The Dallas cowboys have not
won one since people will win.

725
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:34,430
And Z Kava Ricci fucking pants on.
Oh, they want to want to like 95.

726
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,510
Right as grunge was dying.
And for some reason people thought that,

727
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:42,200
that those guys who sang,
sang glycerin was a good band.

728
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,750
The giants have not won one since they
broke my fucking, uh, for the second time.

729
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,420
Am I really going to go
through the whole league?

730
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,350
I think I am the Philadelphia
Eagles have never won a super bowl.

731
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,320
Throw them in that burlap
fucking sack with the kittens.

732
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,810
The Redskins have not won
a Superbowl since, uh,

733
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,330
since z cavalry.
She pants.

734
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,590
Okay.

735
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,950
The Chicago bears have not
won a Superbowl since 1985.

736
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,090
What was going on then since Cindy
Lopper was actually relevant?

737
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,210
The Detroit lions have not even
want to fucking championships.

738
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,990
I think black people weren't even allowed
to play in the NFL who maybe they were

739
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,780
since 1955 with Bobby Lane.

740
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:31,110
Green Bay packers is a good team to
jump onto the a Minnesota Vikings is an

741
00:43:32,531 --> 00:43:36,070
adult cat that acts like a
kitten loser of four Superbowls.

742
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,610
Stick them in that burlap sack.
The fucking Atlanta Falcons.

743
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:43,090
Why do you have a team? I don't give a
fuck that you change uniforms to black.

744
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:46,930
Nobody gives a shit. You get
in a burlap sack, the panthers,

745
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,240
you're an expansion franchise.
You get in,

746
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:52,120
but you're on the top of the sack and
we'll give you a chance to crawl out.

747
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,010
The saints won one in 2010.

748
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:57,940
I think the bucket name
is one one in like 2002.

749
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:02,620
The cardinals have never won one.
Getting that burlap sack shut your face.

750
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:07,621
Get the sec rams have won one since
[inaudible] 99 the San Francisco 40 niners

751
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,350
great franchise. That's a great
team to follow. The 40 niners,

752
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,030
the Seattle Seahawks,

753
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:18,180
despite how loud they scream on purpose
have never won a fucking Superbowl.

754
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,860
They can also get into
the fucking burlap sack,

755
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:24,100
but they're also at the top of it cause
I think that they might fly out and when

756
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:28,600
one this year. So there's your
league. Those are your teams, I hope.

757
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,770
Makes Sense. All right, back
to the fucking questions. Um,

758
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,930
new Christmas tradition,
dare belly stove,

759
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:44,160
top pipe. Uh, how about
instead of Mistletoe,

760
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,820
which encourage you to, which encourages,
look, this is kind of the guy, right?

761
00:44:48,821 --> 00:44:51,760
This guy writes this.
How about instead of Mistletoe,

762
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,780
which encourage you to another
person while standing under under it,

763
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,380
which encourage you to kiss another
person while standing under it.

764
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,920
There is a new berry and
a shrub combination that
suggest you go fuck yourself.

765
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,190
What Barry Shrub Combo would
you suggest is appropriate.

766
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,240
Thanks and have a jolly Holly jolly.
Go Fuck Yourself.

767
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,570
Jesus Christ. Dude. I
actually liked Christmas.

768
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,060
I thought he would say have a fucking
combination like Barry and shrub.

769
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,910
That means that someone, uh, you know,

770
00:45:24,911 --> 00:45:29,590
some female has to drop and blow
you or a fellow if you're into that,

771
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,180
you know, or if you're a lesbian,
maybe you just put the shrub update.

772
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,080
You just have a Bush hanging from
the ceiling. Equal opportunity,

773
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:40,660
however you want to do it. But a failure,
if you got the berries on the side,

774
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,020
the shrub will you just sorta cut
it like a dick sort of a shape.

775
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:52,240
And then there's your unit.
I Dunno what to do with that.

776
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,660
Yeah. Lesbian. You just have like a shrub.

777
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,780
Why don't you like the missile till sir?

778
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,190
Yeah,

779
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:06,800
it is kind of fucking perverted, right?
Some creepy guy hanging out around it.

780
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,910
Nia keeps telling me to hang
up the mistletoe. It's like,

781
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:15,450
why don't you just come over and give me
a kiss? I mean, I'm glad to do it. No,

782
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:19,680
it's the truth. I should, ah,
fuck. I got to go out to the mall.

783
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,290
That's what I'm doing. Just go out to
the mall. I'm just going to buy shit.

784
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,910
I'm just going to see shit.
I'm going to grab it,

785
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:27,990
I'm going to buy it and then I'm just
going to have like do they feel like it?

786
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,610
That's just what I'm going to do.
All right.

787
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:33,120
Then I'm going to get some fucking egg
nog and I can only drink one glass of it,

788
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:34,470
but they don't sell just a glass.

789
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:37,650
You got to buy the whole court of it
and I'm going to get some bourbon.

790
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,990
I'm going to stick it in there and
I'm going to get fucking drunk.

791
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,820
That's what I'm going to do. Leaning
against the mantle with the fire going.

792
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,780
Um, ah fuck. I gotta wrap this podcast
up cause I have to go shopping.

793
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,520
Shopping. Do you believe
that? How do you guys do it?

794
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,980
How do you do the Internet thing?
Where do you go for next year?

795
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,610
Can you help out other older fellas
like myself that don't understand the

796
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:05,600
internet unless you're talking about porn
or trying to find out who won the game.

797
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,670
Did he do that for me?

798
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,240
Okay.

799
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,310
I, I did order a couple of things
off the Internet by fucking though.

800
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,650
I'll go to Mitchell and ness
and by myself at Jersey.

801
00:47:15,651 --> 00:47:17,710
It's like I'm some make a wish kid.
But other than that,

802
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:20,050
I don't know what the fuck I'm
doing. All right, here we go.

803
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:24,490
Another creepy email yet
another creepy email. Uh,

804
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,870
interested in younger girl of
legal age. Okay, dear Billy blue

805
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:36,850
and your last podcast and many others
you talked about what you think is an

806
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:41,260
acceptable age gap between
people in a relationship. Oh,
by the way, that, you know,

807
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:45,220
divide by two and add seven that
that guy was taking credit for.

808
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:49,660
I like to do this. You fucking
hack the French came up with that.

809
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:54,070
Those stinky, smelly sons of
bitches came up with that one. Um,

810
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,230
actually the younger friends,
people don't smell.

811
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:01,530
It's the older ones instead of just
not giving into good lord those smelly

812
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:03,340
menage a trois.

813
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:04,950
Okay.

814
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,380
Um,
is that you or me?

815
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,800
I currently have a moral dilemma that
relates to the topic in which as a 20 year

816
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:16,340
old, I'm thinking about pursuing a
relationship with the girl who's 16 dude,

817
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,940
w w w what were in the fucking world?
Is she legal?

818
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,610
She asked me out recently and I'm toiling
with the decision as to whether or not

819
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:29,960
I should take her up on her offer.
Uh,

820
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:33,650
I'd like to know what your thoughts are
about this before you jump to conclusion

821
00:48:33,651 --> 00:48:38,000
and start hating my guts. Let me give
you a little backstory where I live.

822
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:42,590
The age of consent is 16.
So this is 100% legal.

823
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,061
You know what?

824
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:47,450
I would do a search to try to figure
out where that is cause you conveniently

825
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:49,460
didn't tell you,
but if I did,

826
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:52,100
I'd end up on some list
because I would be searching,

827
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:54,530
where is 16 legal to fuck somebody?

828
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:00,740
If you go with the French divide
your age and half, that's 10.

829
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:04,990
You add seven 17,
you're coming in under the fuck in a y.

830
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:07,210
Okay.

831
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,830
Uh, um, uh, very young
looking 20 year old.

832
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,480
So what Ralph Machio ought to be able
to fuck a 16 year old. What the fuck it.

833
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,080
Oh my God, what did what, when
did this become to the, the uh,

834
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,760
to catch a Predator podcast.

835
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,770
I'm a very young looking 20 year old
and can easily pass off as a high school

836
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:31,760
student. You fucking creep.
If you didn't look at my id,

837
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:34,310
you'd think me and this
girl of his same age,

838
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,760
she's highly intelligent and very mature.

839
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:39,060
Yeah.

840
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,810
What is mature in your world?
There aren't just pictures in her book.

841
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,750
I know pedophiles like to use this
phrase a lot to justify their actions,

842
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:53,760
but I can have better conversations with
this girl than most girls my age and

843
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:55,710
older.
I wait a minute,

844
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:59,700
this is a lady I just turned 20.

845
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,350
And for much of the time we
are only three years apart.

846
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,880
Okay.
Wait a minute.

847
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,470
You're going to expose me for
being a sexist individual here.

848
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,260
All right, so you're both women. I I need,

849
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:26,730
I need and he is still sleeping.
I need a fucking females advice here,

850
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,770
you know, because, uh,

851
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,370
the way you're set up physically,
this is how dumb I am. Okay.

852
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:39,330
And don't judge me here.

853
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:43,350
Helped me because of the way you set up
physically for some reason it doesn't

854
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:44,400
seem as bad.

855
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,940
You know that you can,
uh,

856
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,740
you're not going to fuck him.
You know,

857
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:58,200
you just got to kiss him and pat them,
laugh at them.

858
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,730
So fucking creepy. Um, I'll
wait. There's more excuses here.

859
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,540
I'm sorry.
I'm,

860
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,170
I just turned 20 and for much of the
time we're only three years apart.

861
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,730
She's probably much more
experienced sexually than me
as she had previously been

862
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:15,850
in a serious relationship for
quite some time. Jesus Christ,

863
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:17,140
one of these girls start fucking,

864
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,550
and I've never had a relationship
that lasted more than a month or two.

865
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,760
Never in my entire life,
including grade school.

866
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,690
Have I ever had a relationship or gone
on a date with someone younger than me?

867
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,530
This is an entirely new territory
and I guess you can see why I'd be

868
00:51:32,531 --> 00:51:35,560
apprehensive.
You keep painting yourself as the victim.

869
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,860
I really liked this girl
and she must like me,

870
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:42,040
but I don't know what
my next step should be.

871
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:46,690
There's no one I can really talk to
about this without them jumping to

872
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:50,470
conclusions. So any advice you can give
me would be health helpful. Thanks bill.

873
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:54,190
And Go fuck yourself. Ps, please come
to Saskatchewan. Okay, there we go.

874
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:59,590
Uh, sometime during your travels you've
got fans up here and were aching for some

875
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:01,390
high quality stand up.
Um,

876
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:02,950
okay.

877
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:06,630
All right, well what's weird
about this email is where I live.

878
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,520
16 is not the age of consent. All
right? So this is creeping me out.

879
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,200
Um, let me make sure you are a
female. I didn't read that wrong.

880
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:17,830
She's highly intelligent.
I know plenty of positives use phase,

881
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,810
but I can only have better concentrations.

882
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,670
Where did I think that she was a woman?

883
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,850
I'm a very young looking 20 year old
and can easily pass off as a high school

884
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:34,530
student if he didn't look at my id. You
think me and this girl are the same age.

885
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,710
Where did I think that this was a woman?
Am I out of my fucking mind?

886
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:51,650
Jesus Christ.
No,

887
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:53,930
I don't know. I don't know
what the fuck to think. Look,

888
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:58,370
if you're a guy and you're going to
make this fucking move, uh, it just,

889
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:02,150
I don't, I can't get out of the fact
that it's fucking illegal in my world.

890
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:05,180
And I used the French thing
cut in half plus seven,

891
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:12,080
whatever you are, man, woman
hermaphrodite just be like, look,

892
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,710
talk to me in 11 months.
All right.

893
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:20,711
When you turned 17 and I guess that's
legal up even more legal and I,

894
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:25,920
I don't know. I don't fucking
know. You know, go make a
snowman with them her. Okay.

895
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,300
I don't fucking,
I don't,

896
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,950
I don't want to read these anymore.
All right.

897
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:34,720
I don't want to be like giving
people examine it. You know,

898
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:39,550
it was a year old down the street and
I'm a young 14 year old and I was,

899
00:53:39,551 --> 00:53:42,490
you know,
I don't like doing this stuff.

900
00:53:42,491 --> 00:53:46,090
People my age do I still like playing
with matchbox cars? Fucking creepy.

901
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,490
All right. Cut it out. Accidentally.
Racist Story. Accidentally racist, racist,

902
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:56,460
racist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, hey bill,

903
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,760
love the podcast and I enjoy your work.
Well thank you very much person.

904
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:02,440
I don't know if it's a man or a woman.

905
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,740
All I know is that they're just going
to be talking about being racist and not

906
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:09,340
trying to have sex with somebody
who's potentially or not underage.

907
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:14,020
I'm the guy that wrote in last week
about the accidental racist thing was

908
00:54:14,021 --> 00:54:15,520
probably full of shit.

909
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:16,860
Okay.

910
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,251
He said,

911
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:22,251
I read that same subject and that accepts
exact same story on reddit over four

912
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:25,380
months ago.
No Way.

913
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:29,730
If it is the exact same guy that started
the reddit thread, then cool. If not,

914
00:54:29,731 --> 00:54:32,250
then fuck him anyways.

915
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:36,540
Have you ever dealt with someone
stealing your material on stage? Thanks.

916
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,410
Um, ah yeah. Yes, I have. I've had,

917
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,760
I've had that happen not that much,
maybe like a half dozen times.

918
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:46,650
Okay.

919
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,010
And I just walk up to the
person, I just say, hey,

920
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,590
that's my stuff and I've
seen you see me do it.

921
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:52,930
Okay.

922
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,020
And then they never make eye contact goal.

923
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:58,900
You're going to make a big deal of
this. Yes, yes I am. And then they stop.

924
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,570
Um, but I think people who
aren't in this business,

925
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,420
uh,
they steal shit all the time.

926
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,440
Yeah.

927
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,900
You know, if you look
at like a, I don't know,

928
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:16,450
regular people can be hacky
just because there's no,

929
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,250
then there's nobody's judging their work.
So there's a freedom to what they do.

930
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,180
Uh, but passing off the Louis
Ck did a great bit about that.

931
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:27,100
Did anybody ever tell
you a really funny story?

932
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,360
And then like two weeks later you're
telling the story like it happened to you

933
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,300
and then you get halfway through the
story and you realize that you're telling

934
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:38,260
the story back to the guy who
told it to you originally? Um,

935
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,540
yeah. I mean, I guess people do shit
like that. I don't fucking know. Wow,

936
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:49,010
that's disappointing. That's like twice
that guy stole from them. You know,

937
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:53,000
I got this little theory
that I, uh, I like to do.

938
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,610
I remember one time I worked at the
comedian, he, and he said, you know,

939
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:59,810
I have this saying that I like to say,
and it's free.

940
00:55:59,811 --> 00:56:02,180
Your mind and your ass will follow.

941
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,390
And it was like either our
parliament or funkadelic.

942
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,180
Yeah.

943
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,150
George Clinton or something came up and
this guy actually was selling this on

944
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:13,660
bumper stickers. I have a saying that, uh,

945
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,290
you nailed two of the hand is worth,
you know,

946
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,580
one of the hands were two in the bush,
but,

947
00:56:18,581 --> 00:56:22,450
and I put it on his tee shirt and
I'd like to sell it. Alright, dear.

948
00:56:22,451 --> 00:56:24,850
Mr [inaudible] [inaudible] face,
sorry,

949
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:29,620
the new secretary in my office is a black
woman and bake cookies for the office.

950
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,330
I sarcastically said,

951
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,050
I hope you slaved over these all night.

952
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:36,210
Okay.

953
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:39,390
She stared at me and I saw
a pure evil in her eyes.

954
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,780
The question now is do I eat one or is
it unspoken that they're now off limits

955
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:46,314
for me?

956
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:48,550
Uh,

957
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:55,010
I don't, well, yeah, you made a joke
and they doubled. It wasn't funny.

958
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,160
I sarcastically said, I hope you
slaved over these all night. Oh,

959
00:57:01,161 --> 00:57:04,560
slaved over these all night.
He's has like three L's.

960
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,193
MMM.

961
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,990
Jesus Christ. Dude. Um, I,
I that make you a question.

962
00:57:11,991 --> 00:57:13,910
You should buy a joke book
is what you should do.

963
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:17,430
Maybe watch some standup and
learn how to deliver them.

964
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,773
The only way you would,
that would,

965
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,300
could ever be funny as if you
knew that person really well.

966
00:57:24,301 --> 00:57:25,980
And that was the
relationship you guys had.

967
00:57:25,981 --> 00:57:28,710
Like you joked around about shit
like that. But to say that for,

968
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:32,730
of all the people at the office,
uh, I don't know what to tell you.

969
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,270
Okay.

970
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,850
What's your, you've matured a
selfish cunt. You don't give a shit.

971
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,080
You don't give a fuck about people
because all you care about now is should,

972
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:44,080
can I eat one of the cookies or can I not?
You know,

973
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,440
and you're probably going to be a
terrible father and have awful unexamined

974
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:51,220
children. That's what I
get out of all of that. Um,

975
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,030
okay.

976
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,280
Yeah. You're one of those people
that kind of likes hurting people.

977
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,000
Maybe I'm wrong,
I'm judging you on the paragraph,

978
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:02,360
but like the person that I'm picturing,
I don't fucking know. Um, anyways,

979
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:06,620
number three, hey bay there.
Billy goats gruff. Oh,

980
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:10,520
this is all the accidental racist shit
here. Uh, that wasn't accidentally racist.

981
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,110
That was on purpose.
Racist.

982
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,143
MMM.

983
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:19,160
Cause I think if it was funny,
it would have been funny and I don't,

984
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,190
you don't give a shit on any level
that you might have hurt that person's

985
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:25,240
feelings. All you want is to know
is if you can have the cookie CSE,

986
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,330
you're a cunt. Um, that's an, that's an,
that was nothing accidental about it.

987
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,510
Um, number three, a Billy goat gruff.

988
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:37,460
My white friend used to go to
temple university in Philly is back,

989
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,450
as you probably know,
it's a highly populated black area.

990
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,260
Now how the fuck would I
know that? Uh, I guess I,

991
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:49,800
cause I've done shows in Philly. I don't
know which areas are what. Anyways,

992
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:55,550
he was at a house party with this
chick and most likely a wee bit tipsy.

993
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,210
They were heading out to leave when
his gal realized she forgot her black

994
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,200
handbag in the other room.
Oh,

995
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,400
my friend told her to sit
tight and he'll go get it.

996
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:09,180
He stormed back into the
room and yelled out, hey,

997
00:59:09,181 --> 00:59:13,160
is there a black person here?
Uh,

998
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:18,170
the room fell silent as he found himself
staring at an entire room filled with

999
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:20,970
black people.
When he realized,

1000
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:26,140
he said he quickly snatched a purse
sitting on the couch and held it up and he

1001
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:31,220
said, no, no, a purse.
It's a black purse. Yeah,

1002
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:34,340
I don't understand what is a,
how did he offend people?

1003
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,750
You said everybody figured out
what he meant and they all laughed.

1004
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,410
He slinked out and told
all his white friends.

1005
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,810
Did you get it? Bill? Is there a black
person here? Oh, what? Like Pussy.

1006
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,220
Okay.

1007
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:54,080
Person. Is there a black person here? Oh,
person. Ah, is there a black person here?

1008
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,340
Ah, that's hilarious. I didn't get it.

1009
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,760
Hugs and kisses.
That's fucking let you know.

1010
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:06,380
What I love is that you realized I'm too
stupid. That if I'm reading out loud,

1011
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,150
trying not to fuck that I wouldn't be
able to fuck in a an now you know what

1012
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:14,540
that seems to fucking convenient.
Is that an old fucking story?

1013
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,570
Did you steal that one? Two a?
Is there a black person here? Ah,

1014
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:23,630
Jesus. Jesus Christ. People.

1015
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,880
Do you not have enough
funny stories in your life?

1016
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:30,881
You've got to start making them up a
number for a group of people from work,

1017
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,610
including myself,
this is all accidentally racist,

1018
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,690
raises a group of four people from work,
including myself,

1019
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:43,550
were sitting at the front of the light
rail parentheses above ground version of

1020
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:47,780
the subway in North Carolina
and drinking all day at a pub,

1021
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:48,890
crawl at a pub crawl.

1022
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:53,330
A group of black people came up to
sit behind us and our drunk, ditzy,

1023
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:57,380
blonde coworker says,
welcome to the front of the bus.

1024
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:07,270
I gotta tell you something
that's actually fucking funny.

1025
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:14,300
I think that that's, I don't know. I think
that that's funny. She didn't meet. Oh,

1026
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:17,810
she didn't mean it in a bad way. You guys
would just partying and she just said,

1027
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:21,650
welcome to the front of the bus. I got
to tight. That is fucking hilarious.

1028
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,390
Yeah,

1029
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:27,920
that's, that one is fucking
hilarious. Oh my God.

1030
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:34,190
All right. One of them was
funny. I like it. There we go.

1031
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,350

Sorry,

1041
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:15,110
I was looking at the clock to see if I
had enough time to tell you this quick

1042
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:15,740
story.

1043
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,740
I have a pet peeve as I was walking
through the the other day and uh,

1044
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:23,280
I was hating my life.
Um,

1045
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:28,290
this other mall that I ended up going to
that was more like a, it wasn't a mall,

1046
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:32,370
it was like this strip of stores on
a street. So you weren't stuck there.

1047
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:36,600
And there was this Christmas
tree and I have a new pet. Oh,

1048
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:41,580
Cleo,
you got fleas all baby.

1049
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:45,540
I like my dog old baby.
I like my dog.

1050
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,620
What's up buddy? Huh? What's up?

1051
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,470
I actually got this dog
to like one of my friends.

1052
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:57,660
I got a new thing that I do. I just
take her for a walk with all my friends,

1053
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:02,310
with one of my friends and
after three walks, three hours,

1054
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:07,020
she starts to accept him and then I have
her give her some water and then I have

1055
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:10,980
little treats and she starts looking
at them like they're a food source.

1056
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,570
You do that for another five hikes and
then you gradually taper off with the

1057
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:17,670
food,
you know?

1058
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,940
And it's more just sort
of patting the dog.

1059
01:03:20,941 --> 01:03:24,300
And then I gradually let the person
with my dog in the front yard.

1060
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:27,570
We hang there for a couple of hikes
right at the end of a couple of nights,

1061
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,420
they can take a 15 day process.
You know,

1062
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:34,110
I'm sorry somebody beat you and
that you don't trust anybody Cleo.

1063
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:38,370
But we're going to turn this, this
apple cart around. Are we now?

1064
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:42,630
I'm trying to have mister j law had
become friends. We'll work on it. Right.

1065
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,290
Okay. Fucking love this. Talk. Anyways,

1066
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,040
so people is sitting there and they're
taking pictures in front of this

1067
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:53,130
Christmas tree. This is such a
dumb thing to be annoyed with,

1068
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,810
but I hate people who take pictures
with their fucking, uh, iPad.

1069
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,540
You know,
it's just look stupid.

1070
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:03,360
Like you sitting there holding the
food tray up in front of your face.

1071
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:07,140
I really wish somebody would
just step in and give you a hook,

1072
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:10,110
like a fucking left hook
right around your tablet,

1073
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:14,280
right to your face and knocky Goddamn
dentures right out of your mouth or your

1074
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:18,390
partial something.
It's just,

1075
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:21,960
it's just annoying.
That big stupid fucking thing.

1076
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:26,640
Why you walking around with that thing?
You know, you don't have a cell phone.

1077
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,870
What are you doing with the thing?
I just want to fucking break it over.

1078
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:35,070
My God damn knee. Sorry. Hey,

1079
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,770
maybe that's a new segment we can
get away from the fucking, you know,

1080
01:04:37,771 --> 01:04:40,470
semi pedophile questions.
What is it?

1081
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:43,080
What is something that it
just annoys you and you know,

1082
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:46,900
it's stupid and it shouldn't
fucking ignore you lesbian.

1083
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,940
I'm throwing my hat in the ring.

1084
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:51,930
People who takes pictures with their
fucking IPAD, a tablet. I don't like it.

1085
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,510
It bothers me.
It shouldn't bother me.

1086
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:58,140
People are free to do it and I don't
fucking like it. All right. There you go.

1087
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:03,240
Hey everybody. Merry Christmas. Just
hear those sleigh bells. Ring a link.

1088
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:08,080
Tink, tink, tink link too.
Merry Christmas to a Christian,

1089
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:11,260
a Muslim or a Jew.
I don't care.

1090
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:15,400
I don't care if it's offensive to you.
It's by holiday.

1091
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,180
I like saying merry to you.

1092
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,900
I'll take some rouge and put it on your
fucking Jakes and make it seem like

1093
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:27,901
you're happy to stop paying a fucking
con and get over by the Christmas tree.

1094
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,370
Stop fucking content.
Get all about a Christmas tree and park.

1095
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,300
You gift though. Sorry. Um,

1096
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,250
Thank you everybody who came
out to my shows this year.

1097
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:43,330
This was the greatest fucking year
I've ever had as a goddamn comedian.

1098
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:48,220
Um, got to play all these wonderful
venues and I'm going to next year,

1099
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:53,290
next year I'm going to do another
special. Oh boy. Oh boy. Um,

1100
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:58,300
probably in the April, may time a
year. I'm going to tape it recorded,

1101
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,700
fucking put it out there,

1102
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,840
and then I'll work on my next hour
and I'll do another fucking tour.

1103
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,680
And I go even more fucking cities
because I don't know what else to do with

1104
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:13,420
myself that said, go fuck yourself.
Merry Christmas. Happy Kwanzaa,

1105
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:16,330
happy Hanukkah.
