1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,930
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:04,890
It's bill burn his time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday, January 19th.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,950
No, January 9th, sorry, 2017.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,440
January 9th, 2017. You know,
that's how bad I am at math.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,600
I can't even fucking say that date.
Right. Um, how's has a goal and how?

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,940
Oh,
the summer wind,

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,810
it came fucking blowing in
because of global warming.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,440
It's fucking cold for about
two weeks and then it's hot.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,910
My fucking house is gonna Melt and
then it will slip into the sea.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,990
I don't give a fuck that it's
snowing and Massachusetts.

11
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:52,980
[inaudible] Hey, what's
going? What's going on?

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,380
It's already getting hot
as fuck out here. Uh, dude,

13
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,840
you should be a meteorologist.
Yeah, it's going to be,

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,460
he's fucking fucking Los
Angeles. Um, how are you?

15
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,860
How's it going? Are you out there?
You're fighting the good fight.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,990
You're trying to be a better person.

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,060
You're trying to turn around your
fucking childhood. Well, join the club.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,190
Had a little setback yesterday,
you know?

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,380
Oh fuck a knew Billy was running around
an old William showed up less today.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,930
Just I, you know, whatever. I just got to
keep fucking, you know, moving forward,

21
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,010
you know, moving forward like
the Celtics and the Bruins. Okay.

22
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:36,630
When I went and championships this year,
but you know, we're trying, all right,

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,040
I'm not going to get rid of all
of my anger in fucking two weeks,

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,920
but you know, if you can just
chop away even a half a percent,

25
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,180
you'll be a half a percent better
today than you were yesterday.

26
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,030
Jesus Christ,
you know,

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,450
you know what's fucked up is knowing that
you fucked up and then actually really

28
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,080
analyzing yourself and you're like,
Whoa, I didn't know it was that deep.

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,950
Um, anyways, so what do you do?

30
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,780
What do you do when you know you're
fucked up and you can't really fix it?

31
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,390
Then Day, what do you do? Well, you know,

32
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:13,950
what you do is you fucking crack open a
beer and you watch some God damn sports.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,940
That's what you do to distract yourself
from all this shit that's going on.

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,590
I love this whole fucking story about
the Russians hacking into the fucking

35
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,510
democratic national fucking convention
committee, fucking websites and all that.

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,940
All these fucking Hillary supporters.
Yay.

37
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,440
It's why are you fucking Trump was
able to eke it out. It's just like,

38
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,810
I can't even fucking,

39
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,850
I can't listen to any. And then you
look at the Trump supporters are like,

40
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,550
what's the big deal?
It's just the Russian.

41
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,430
The bottom line is you either give a
fuck or don't give a fuck about what the

42
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,910
Russians allegedly did
or didn't fucking do,

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,700
depending on whether you wear a
blue tie or a fucking red tie.

44
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:02,980
And I love how in the end of all this,

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,900
like I was supposed to listen
to the fucking CIA. Like
they don't have an agenda.

46
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,150
Everybody in this story has a fucking
agenda. So it's like, all right,

47
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,820
who the fuck do I listen to?
You know,

48
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,250
good fucking Lord.

49
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,630
You think Obama would give a shit if
the hacking led to Hillary winning?

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,070
We'll uh, we'll do something a when the
time is right and we'll blah, blah, blah.

51
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:33,910
Why?
Cause The lady with the Blue Bra lost.

52
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,400
What if she weren't Obama? When
then, what the fuck would you do?

53
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,770
Give right off into the sunset.

54
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,060
Get ready to do your fucking speeches
for fucking 300 grand a clip to the exact

55
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,960
people that get you in the
White House. It's all, I
can't, that's why watch sports.

56
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,850
That's why I watch sports because other
than a couple of mobbed up refs here or

57
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:56,290
there, you know, it's pretty fair.
It's about as fair as it can get,

58
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,670
which means it isn't fair.

59
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,140
So anyways,
um,

60
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,850
I love that people don't like the Trump
is friends with Vladimir Putin obviously

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
since is Putnam Putnam.

62
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,480
You know that Ted not being friends with
the Russians the first time it didn't

63
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:20,950
work out too well with the whole thing
almost blew up in her face. So, uh,

64
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:24,550
you know,
why don't we try to hold hands this time?

65
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,850
I Dunno. I I, this is, I
don't get into port to eight.

66
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,970
I think war should be illegal.
I think war is literally,

67
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,650
it's the temper tantrum of the fucking
Illuminati and then everybody else has to

68
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,020
pay the fucking price.
You know,

69
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,670
and those rich loafer wearing counts will
never step one foot into a battlefield.

70
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,340
Uh, you know that they all
make the fucking money off.

71
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:52,510
It's just a bunch of fucking bullshit.
And when are they going to grow up?

72
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,220
I love how I can't go all over my
fence and just take a bad out in,

73
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:01,300
beat the fuck out of my neighbor because
of, I dunno, whatever the fuck they did.

74
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,340
You know,

75
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,300
the apple trees on their property and I
want the apples on my fucking property

76
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:12,301
and I can't just fucking try to force
them to fucking give me their apples and

77
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:13,901
when they don't,

78
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:17,350
I can then just fucking come up with an
eye down and I was some sort of angle,

79
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,530
a bullshit that I tell the rest of my
neighbors and I go over there and I

80
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:24,940
fucking smash up his house and kill a
few people in it. I don't, why can't,

81
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:28,030
I can't do that on a fucking local level.
But as a country,

82
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,320
countries can do that to one another.
It's just fucking beyond me.

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,610
The kids sit down at a
fucking table and hash it out.

84
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,150
Give us the oil.
No,

85
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,730
just sit there at the
table for fucking years.

86
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,890
Just doing different
reads. Give us the oil. No.

87
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,020
Um,
all right.

88
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,260
There's my fucking wing nut
fucking conspiracy theory
horseshit for you're right

89
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,190
out of the gate. So let's go right
back to bread and circus. Okay.

90
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,540
Bread and fucking circus.

91
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,780
You guys watch any of the play off
play off fucking football games.

92
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,241
I'll tell you right now,

93
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:16,241
the two luckiest teams in the NFL right
now with the Seattle Seahawks and the

94
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:19,370
New England patriots.
Why you say,

95
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,530
because the other two best remaining teams
in both conferences are going to play

96
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,960
each other next weekend.
You know,

97
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,500
while the Patriots played the Houston
Texans and the Seattle Seahawks play the

98
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,160
Atlanta Falcons. Now I'm not trying to
disrespect the Texans or the falcons,

99
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,910
but who's kidding who, if you see
Atul and you've got the cowboys,

100
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,080
the packers and the Falcons left,
which is the best game for you,

101
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,440
which gives you the best chance at
moving onto the next round. Wow.

102
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,900
Those fucking dirty birds
down there in Atlanta, uh,

103
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:57,000
with the real housewives and
the download brothers. Um,

104
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,950
and if in the AFC I would much rather
as a Patriot fan watches play the Texans

105
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,130
without JJ what?
Right.

106
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,740
Okay.

107
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Playing a home game while the Kansas
City chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers

108
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,240
beat the shit out of each other.
You know,

109
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,890
cowboys and Green Bay are going
to eliminate one of them, right?

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,450
You know the deal.

111
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,560
So rather than Seattle having to go
through fucking Greenbay and Dallas,

112
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:32,950
the only got to go through one of them
and the Patriots rather than having to

113
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:34,740
play the Steelers and the fucking chiefs,

114
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,840
we only got to play wonderful thank
Christ the way that worked out.

115
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:41,590
So both of us,
if we play the game that we should be,

116
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:44,740
fuck that we know how to play
should easily, not easily,

117
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:49,630
but we should make it to the, uh, to the
fucking and IFC AFC championship game.

118
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:51,670
And the fucking patriots had a buy.
So we're fucking,

119
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,300
we're wearing flip flops to the AFC
championship game. Having said that,

120
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:57,640
I have no idea who's going
to win the super bowl.

121
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,240
I like many people I think were amazed
at how easily the packers handled the,

122
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:08,800
uh, the New York football
giants in As a patriots fan.

123
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,600
I did not enjoy that outcome
because I wanted the rematch,

124
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,360
you know, I said dead fucking for
the last five weeks. I want to see,

125
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,600
I want to fight, I wanted the
patriots play the giants again.

126
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,780
I wanted to see if it definitively,

127
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:28,470
if the giants just fucking own us.

128
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,040
Yeah.

129
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,930
You know, for the trilogy or
could we get some revenge?

130
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,730
You know what I mean? That, that's
what I was looking forward to. Um,

131
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,690
okay.

132
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,360
So, you know, when I also love Eli
and I actually loved the giants,

133
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:43,860
believe it or not,
as a patriots team,

134
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:47,310
I don't understand like as much
as those two losses were painful,

135
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,860
what is there to hate?
They were a great fucking franchise.

136
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:54,560
They always have a great fucking defense
and a couple of tough years. But, um,

137
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,900
I wanted the rematch. Oh my God, that
would have been huge fucking ratings.

138
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,010
Although rematch patriots, a Seattle
could also be a good thing. However,

139
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,030
how many times have we beaten the
Steelers in the playoffs? Playoffs.

140
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,480
We've beaten them up. I don't know
every fucking significant. God Damn,

141
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,350
I don't even know. I've lost count
this. Would this be number four?

142
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,583
MMM.

143
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,650
So you can't tell me this Steelers aren't
do and I don't know shit about Kansas

144
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,600
City other than people telling
me that they're really good.

145
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,690
So it's not going to be an
easy AFC championship game.

146
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,670
And if you're asking me if I'm
looking past the Dallas Texans, uh,

147
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,320
I kind of am, but only as a fan. I
don't play for the New England patriots.

148
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:41,580
So I think the Patriots will be fine
that I'm kind of looking past that.

149
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,250
The Houston Texans going into
New England without Jj. How

150
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,510
um, how about that fucking
catch by Richardson?

151
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,390
You probably should say which one,
but that one in the fucking end zone.

152
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:57,570
That was like one of the best catches I've
seen since. So Dell backups, you know,

153
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,060
it wasn't anywhere near as good as that.
But Jesus Christ,

154
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:03,180
fucking lily reaching around
below the guy, you know,

155
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:05,210
around his junk past Tate,

156
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,300
they throw a flag for an interception
is still fucking catch it.

157
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,910
How many fucking times is
there a flag in the end zone?

158
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,200
And the offensive team gets to deny it
because the fucking wide receiver reached

159
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:20,460
around, you know, that sounds fucking
perverted. But around the defender,

160
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:20,971
you know why?

161
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:25,971
Cause I stopped at reach around Rachel
around Jack reacher route fucking reached

162
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:31,680
around the defender. They probably
teach you that in broadcasting school.

163
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:32,790
You know,

164
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,790
and one of the main things you have to
look out for other than staying away from

165
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:44,391
advocacy of domestic violence against
women is when you're going to use the

166
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:49,710
expression that the, the,
the, the wide receiver,

167
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,670
how reached around the defender.
You got to get,

168
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,340
you can't pause after a rant.

169
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,820
You got to go ride to defendant reached
around the defender and then continue

170
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:04,560
with your idea. Um, anyways, sorry. So,

171
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,630
um,
I don't know.

172
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,500
A lot of people thought some of
those playoff games are boring.

173
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,530
I know I did the Steelers dolphins Forney
and that was a fucking snooze fest.

174
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:18,090
But it's, it's the early rounds, zero
early rounds. Everybody's evenly matched.

175
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,300
I think next week's will be, uh,
we've agreed. We'll be great.

176
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:24,270
We'll see what the fuck happens.
Who Do you like? Who Do you like?

177
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:28,770
I think a lot of people are on Seattle's
fucking a beak as they say, right?

178
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,320
Everybody's fucking looking
at them like, oh, you know,

179
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:35,190
they were just there and are, they played
pretty good against the fucking lights,

180
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,260
you know, and then Green Bay, Green Bay's
been there and everybody's like, ah,

181
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,580
you know,
fucking all of a sudden here we go.

182
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,410
Erin fucking Rogers look like a
beast in the second half. Right?

183
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,300
And then there's other people go,
oh, what about those fucking cowboy?

184
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,040
That's

185
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,580
why I don't fucking watch pre or post
game analysis. And probably why you got,

186
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,000
well actually,

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,670
maybe you shouldn't fast forward through
this because I'll honestly tell you,

188
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,710
I don't know what the fuck is
going to happen. I have no idea.

189
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,800
I don't know what happens.
I haven't watched Kansas City all year.

190
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,280
I just know that, uh, uh,
the, uh, what the fucks is,

191
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,570
Andy Reid is their coach in the last
time I watched them was the first time I

192
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:17,500
saw him in a red jacket and he looked
like a big fucking tomato. And I said,

193
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,660
you know what,
I'm done with this franchise.

194
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,530
And the only other time I paid attention
to was when Paul Versey kept telling me

195
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,520
that US trading Matt Castle or letting
them go to the chiefs who was a huge

196
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,420
fucking mistake.

197
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,490
And do you think he ever apologize
for me to me for making that sort of a

198
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:38,280
comment? I don't think he did.
Ah, I don't think he did. Um,

199
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,680
anyways, so I'm continuing
to try to do the impossible,

200
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,540
which is watch every home game of the
Boston Celtics and the Boston Bruins while

201
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,760
sustaining a healthy marriage.

202
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,831
It's not easy.

203
00:12:56,831 --> 00:13:01,270
You know what makes it really fucking
hard is this Bruins and Celtics a lot of

204
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,340
times play on the same day.
And I for some reason never think,

205
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:07,300
but why don't you just watch one of them
and then watch the other one on the off

206
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,860
day? That's what I have to do. But I
watched, um, you know, I watched the,

207
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,050
uh,
the Celta I guess I take the Pelican game.

208
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:20,051
So I watched the Celtics beat the Pelicans
and then I watched the Bruins fucking

209
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,080
play the Goddamn Hartford
whalers via North Carolina. And,

210
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:28,930
uh, every time we play the fucking
hurricanes, it always goes into the lab.

211
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,740
We played them three times in the last
month and always goes into overtime and

212
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:36,040
we usually, we usually lose to those
cuts. I don't know what it was.

213
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,870
We used to own the Hartford whalers,
but every,

214
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:42,340
once they become the fucking Carolina
hurricanes, we always lose to them.

215
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,470
They're reminded me of what used to
happen when the Patriots would go into

216
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,090
Denver. We always lost, you know,

217
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,060
granted they had Craig Morton
and then into John Elway.

218
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,560
What do we have? We had Tony,
he said we had Steve Grogan's,

219
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,500
we couldn't match up the
orange crush defense.

220
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,750
And then John Elway was better than,
I'm sorry we gave you,

221
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:05,890
is better than Tony Easton and uh,
but he wasn't still on the draft board.

222
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,580
And I know you think we should have
picked and marina. Well, you know,

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,340
we didn't like everybody else.
We fucking did it.

224
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,750
And you know who paid the price
more than anybody else. Dan Marino.

225
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,320
Cause he went to fucking Miami and
they never got him a running game or a

226
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:20,861
defense.

227
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:25,120
And to this day people fucking trash them
saying he couldn't win the fucking big

228
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:25,480
one.

229
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,480
And meanwhile they had to change every
possible fucking rule in passing and tip.

230
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,610
It's so totally forward to the fucking,

231
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,500
the scales to the Office for Dan Marino's
records to finally start falling.

232
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,220
Yeah, I'm a big Dan Marino fan.
Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um,

233
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,590
and I've been watching the,
uh,

234
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,680
the Celtics just having a great
fucking time watching both of them,

235
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,060
the broads know the hanging in there.

236
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,640
We were out of the playoffs for
a game play offs and then we won.

237
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,950
I don't even know who the
fuck we beat the watches.

238
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,970
So we fuck agaves we'd be buffalo twice
and then we fucking lost to Edmonton and

239
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,700
then we'd beat somebody and then we
fucking lost in overtime tow. Uh,

240
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,640
still the fucking hurricanes.
I believe, I don't know it.

241
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,710
It gets crazy to try to
watch 162 fucking games.

242
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,040
MMM Benny

243
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,261
ways.

244
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:22,290
They're both fucking that we play the
blues and then the fucking Celtics got a

245
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,380
huge game against the Toronto Raptors.
Now,

246
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:30,210
if you're not watching the Celtics of
Boston, this is all you need to know.

247
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,290
I'm going to read you their wins and
losses and you tell me if you can fucking

248
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:39,000
pick up what's going on. We'll go back
to them beating. They beat the, uh,

249
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,020
all right, here we go. December 16th,

250
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,310
we beat the sh we beat the fucking,

251
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:48,960
yeah.

252
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,130
Does that say the Hornets?
One of the Hornets stopping the bobcat's.

253
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,230
The horn moved to New Orleans,

254
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:58,730
then they became the Pelicans and then
that name freed up and then the bobcat's

255
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,100
like, all right, it's really, you know,

256
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,980
not enough bobcat's out here in North
Carolina. Can we go back to Hornets?

257
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,120
Cause their mother fuckers are everywhere.

258
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,920
My overalls and shoo fly North Carolina.
All right.

259
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:14,490
Then we beat the Miami Heat.
Then we beat the Memphis Grizzlies,

260
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,120
then we beat the fucking Indiana Pacers.

261
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Then we played the Oklahoma
City thunder and we lost that.

262
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,190
We played the Knicks.
We beat him.

263
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,590
Yeah.

264
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,210
Then we played the grizzlies.
We beat him.

265
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,510
Then we played the Cavaliers and we
lost you seeing a pattern here that we'd

266
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,730
beat the heat. Then we beat the
jazz, then we'd beat the sixers.

267
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,120
Then we beat the fucking Pelicans.

268
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,970
And then Tuesday we're playing the Toronto
Raptors. So if you look, we fucking,

269
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:50,270
we beat all the fucking regular Joe teams.
Lunch pail Larry's,

270
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,630
but we can't beat the cavs were not be
fucking Okc and now we got fucking uh,

271
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,153
yeah,

272
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,970
we got Toronto. So I dunno. I'll
be very excited if we fucking, um,

273
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,210
I'd be very excited if we fucker when
they came cause we haven't really been a

274
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:11,200
contender yet since I've
started watching them. Um,

275
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,770
okay.

276
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,860
But anyways, they've seen the Celtics
are like one fucking player away.

277
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,030
Then that one player way,

278
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:20,630
if you really watch the Cavaliers and
you watch the golden state warriors were

279
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:22,190
at least two fucking players away,

280
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,240
the fact that they want to move like
fucking Marcus smarter fucking Jae Crowder

281
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,270
for that white kid who used to play
at Butler for Brad Stevens. You know,

282
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,741
I'll tell you right now,

283
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:37,340
I'm reverse racist when it
comes to fucking basketball
to w we're going to trade

284
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:41,210
a black guy and draft picks for
a light guy who plays in Utah.

285
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,370
I Dunno for as he's telling
me the guise of beast,

286
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,740
whatever the Hawthorne or some shit like
that. I don't, I don't know about hoop.

287
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:50,700
I just started watching.

288
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:54,150
I'm like a fucking housewife that
finally got her Celtic Apron in.

289
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,520
His stop making ham hocks is
peeking into the living room,

290
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:59,790
so I don't have no idea what I'm talking
about. All I can tell you is that, uh,

291
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm loving watching the
games during the Pelicans.

292
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,140
Got a great fucking announced it too.

293
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:07,380
I was so pissed because I love listening
to Tommy Heinsohn and the other fucking

294
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,240
guy. I don't know. It was
God damn name. I should,

295
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:14,060
he's been doing the Celtics games
forever, but a, the pelting dealt with,

296
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,630
see that that was the Pelicans and the
Celtics, the Pelicans or the pelvics.

297
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,123
Umm,

298
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,780
they actually combined her in World
War II and they played the struggles.

299
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,050
Um,
they get a great announcer,

300
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,220
old school fucking uh,
I don't know,

301
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:35,640
had a lot of elements of a Vin Scully.
I thought he was a class act.

302
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,520
He could tell he was rooting for
the Pelicans, but he gave, you know,

303
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,990
when his team committed files, he said,
all right, that's a file. You know,

304
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,800
he wasn't a total homer.
I like guys like that.

305
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,580
And I also like total Homer's like
Tommy Heinsohn. Um, all right,

306
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,370
I'm going to talk to stop talking about
fucking basketball cause that's about as

307
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,920
deep as I go. Uh, let me read a couple of,

308
00:18:55,921 --> 00:19:00,660
a couple of advertisements here.
All set back.

309
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:05,190
Billy, you know, thought I
came out of the fucking clouds,

310
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,690
right? Okay. Dollar Shave Club.
Everybody. Oh Jesus. Here we go.

311
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,610
Dollar Shave Club gives you a close,

312
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,760
smooth shave and you can't beat
the convenience or the price.

313
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,820
What is convey all convenient
cause they bring a teeth.

314
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,100
There's nothing convenient about shaving.
It fucking sucks.

315
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,550
And when you were a kid, all you want to
do, you'd be get old and fucking shave.

316
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:31,200
It's the fucking worst. It's so
ridiculous. Mad that you didn't,

317
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:35,250
you didn't have to shave for
like the first fucking, I dunno,

318
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,310
1314 or 10 if you're one of those
fucking hairy people years of your life,

319
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:45,420
you want at least a goddamn decade,
12 years without having to fucking shave.

320
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,780
Although you never know today with the
other horse tranquilizers that they put

321
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:52,380
in their fucking food. You've seen
kids today, you know what I mean?

322
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:55,710
There'll be like some fourth grade boy
with a beard talking to some fucking

323
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:58,300
fourth grade girls who's beginning
to have titties. You know,

324
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,690
we'll be there like nine or 10 years
old. You just sucked at it. But that,

325
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:04,530
those fucking, and those little
people now they've just bring,

326
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,920
just been drinking the milk from the
cows that have been fed or the cows.

327
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:12,760
And that's the result. Then make
it a little fucking adults. Um,

328
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,290
you don't have to choose between settling
for a cheap bag of disposables are

329
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:21,291
paying out those out the nose for raises
with a laser pointer and 17 blades

330
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,250
awful than dollar shave club broke
onto the scene with a smarter choice.

331
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:28,410
Before Dollar Shave Club,
there was no middle ground.

332
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,730
It was either saved money and get a
painful shape from a disposables. Uh,

333
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,490
like the ones that give
away for free at the gym,

334
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,830
which felt like shaving
with a piece of glass.

335
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,610
I will tell you going from one blade,
the two blade was great. Everything else,

336
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:45,800
three, four, five is all been
fucking complete bullshit. Um,

337
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,180
two blades is the perfect one.
That's the one you want.

338
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,930
The third blade one became too thick
and you can't get under your cute little

339
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:54,160
button nose to shade there.

340
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:56,380
So you've got to start fucking
grabbing and pushing it up.

341
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Giving yourself a pug nose like that
completes fucking Psycho Orange County

342
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:06,560
wife. When are they going to
retire? Those fucking broad my,

343
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,170
every day there's like a,
they're like unseasoned 98.

344
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,530
I walked by the TV and I'm like,
that fucking lady still here.

345
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,810
She hasn't gone to the loony bin.
Her fucking nose looks like the,

346
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,640
it's like the Lincoln and the fucking,
uh, what's that other tunnel in New York?

347
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:25,250
Have I, did I move away that
long? It wasn't the Hawthorne,

348
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,070
the Holland.
Brooke.

349
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,460
What's the one down there by a fucking
Deniros restaurant to the Holland tunnel.

350
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,680
Jesus.
I guess that joke's over.

351
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,280
It's going to say her fucking nose looks
like the Lincoln and Holland tunnel,

352
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,730
but you know when you can't remember
the other name of the tunnel bill,

353
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:45,560
can you just complete the raid?
Okay.

354
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,600
Dollar Shave Club is the best of
both worlds. You get premium shave,

355

356
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,130
If you haven't tried dollar shave
club yet, you're missing out.

357
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,830
It's an amazing shave
at an affordable price.

358
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,270
There's no smarter choice in the market
and right now they're giving away a one

367
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:34,810
Okay.

368
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,360
I could never sit there and read the whole
speech. I couldn't do it. I'd be like,

369
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:42,220

putting on a new pair of
underwear isn't just fresh.

410
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,510
You're stepping into a better day.
Think about it under,

411
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:11,000
where's the first thing you put
on in the last thing you take off?

412
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,510
Why would you settle for anything less
than the best feeling underwear on the

413
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:18,980
planet? Um, maybe because
you're satisfied. I don't know.

414
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:20,120
Maybe cause you don't think about it.

415
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,940

Me undies focuses solely on producing the
most comfortable underwear you've ever

Flatter me or Putnam wears him.

418
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,600
He wears him when he hacks into the
Democratic national fucking convention.

419
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,310
And you know what,
if Hillary had been wearing them,

420
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,330
maybe she would have won the election.
You know,

421
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:40,910
I was watching a little bit of the
Golden Globes last night and Jimmy Fallon

422
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:44,150
made a joke about the popular vote
versus the electoral vote. You know,

423
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:47,600
it's so funny watching all these liberals
having a problem with that fucking

424
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,090
like,
why do you have a problem with it?

425
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,410
Because you think it's fucked up or
because your person lost. I can't,

426
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:57,550
I can't fucking like literally
watching that politics shit. It's like,

427
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,270

red sox,

428
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,260
my friends at [inaudible] sent me a
few pairs a while back and now I can't

429
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,620
imagine wearing anything else. Well,
I can't imagine where I can, you know,

430
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:07,880

431

you know what?

448
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:13,050
Somebody came up to me the other day,
Bill due to to do it, and they go, hey,

449
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:17,490
did you see that story about the pit bull?
These peep,

450
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:22,410
this family tried to put a Christmas
sweater on the pitbull and it fucking just

451
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:26,310
snapped and mauled this woman and
you know what I said? I said, hey,

452
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,600
did you hear about the Cocker Spaniel?
That bit, that little girl's ear off?

453
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,710
And then the person goes, no, I didn't.
And I said, of course she didn't.

454
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,120
It is. They don't report on
it all the other shit first.

455
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,190
So I look up this whole pit bull thing
is once it all people just going like

456
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,720
these pitbulls man, too crazy.
They're licking your face and,

457
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,350
and they love their owner. And then one
day they just killed them in their sleep.

458
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:53,580
All this bullshit. I looked
it up. Okay. Two things. One,

459
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,950
the dog's name was Scarface.

460
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,320
Repeat the dog's name was Scarface.

461
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,390
Number two, they lived in Florida. Okay,

462
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,880
can we quit blaming
the fucking breed here?

463
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,590
Jesus fucking Christ.
They're poor fucking dog.

464
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,150
I can't imagine the abuse that that dog
went through. The dogs named Scarface.

465
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:20,250
What kind of dog do you
think they wanted it to be?

466
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,640
What do you think they trained it to be?
That's what the fuck they did.

467
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,770
Do you know when I was a kid, we had
a west Highland white terrier. Okay.

468
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,850
And me and my brothers teas,
the fucking shit out of that dog.

469
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,290
And it bit us routinely bit me in the
face one time. And I almost lost my eye.

470
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,450
You know why? Because we were
horrible to the dog. That's why.

471
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,220
Okay.

472
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,390
If you get a pit bull and you name it
fucking scar face and you start feeding it

473
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:51,990
fucking raw meat and making
it a shit eventually,

474
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:53,860
you know when you,

475
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,910
I guarantee you they abused the
fucking shit out of that thing.

476
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,580
And what happened is when
you put a sweater on a dog,

477
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:03,270
at some point its head is underneath
the fucking material and it probably

478
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:06,930
flipped out. And then what
happens is you've abused the dog.

479
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:10,110
And rather than it being a little west
Highland terrier that you can push off of

480
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:11,100
your fucking face.

481
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,270
You've done it to a dog that is in a way
class that you cannot fucking handle.

482
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,550
But then what happens is,

483
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,470
is they blame the dog because human
beings are so fucking precious and fucking

484
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:23,880
make no goddamn mistakes.

485
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,530
It's fucking ridiculous that they
keep blaming those fucking dogs.

486
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:29,910
And I know what you guys
would think of what bill,

487
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,760
didn't you just give away
your pimple? Yes, I did.

488
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,230
Because I understood that I didn't have
the capabilities as a fucking owner

489
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,560
because of the abuse that happened
to my dog. You know, my dog,

490
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,400
when I first got it,

491
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:45,930
I picked up a hockey stick to fucking
stick handle and my living room and it ran

492
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:50,050
to the other side of the room and
started shaking uncontrollably. Okay?

493
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,700
I don't know what the
other people did that,

494
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:55,660
but you know when you do that to
a fucking dog, you know, I dunno,

495
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,470
I still love pitbulls and I hate that
people come up to me with those fucking

496
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,230
stories. I don't give a fuck. You know,

497
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,660
dogs bite people all the fucking time.

498
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,470
All these different breeds bite
people all the fucking time.

499
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,810
Every day a dog bites somebody.

500
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:14,680
You're bringing a fucking animal
into the fucking house. Okay?

501
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,010
And if you're not a good owner and you
don't know what the fuck you're doing,

502
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,270
you could get bit, you get
a hamster, you're going to
get bit, you get a pet snake,

503
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,450
you're going to get bit. You're bringing
a fucking animal into the house.

504
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,020
My whole fucking life pit
bulls were biting people,

505
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,460
but it didn't get brought
up until somewhere in the
nineties when I was growing

506
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:37,990
up. It was one German Shepard, one
Doberman Pinscher after a fucking nother,

507
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,260
you know,
meanwhile,

508
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:44,350
Dalmatians are out of their fucking
mind because they're pure bred yet I,

509
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:47,650
you know, I don't know. All right, let's,
let's get back to the fucking podcast.

510
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,890
I just, I don't, I don't
buy into it the same way.

511
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:54,010
I don't buy into the fact that there's
people in other countries, you know,

512
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:57,670
just sitting there and more evil than
what the fuck is down the street from me.

513
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,690
We're all fucking human beings. Some
of us are good. Most of us are cunts.

514
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,580
You know, I don't even, what the fuck I'm
talking about at this point. All right,

515
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,870
let's continue on. Let's continue
on with the podcast here. Um,

516
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,550
as you might've guessed at this point,
still no baby.

517
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:19,360
So we're still fucking waiting. We are
still waiting on pins and needles and,

518
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,870
uh, I am getting to the fucking
point where it's just like, it's,

519
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,770
it's like enough already.
This is just like,

520
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:29,380
it's like waiting to go on
stage in front of a rowdy crowd.

521
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,191
He's just want to be like,

522
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:34,240
can you just bring me up already so
I can fucking get this over with?

523
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:38,020
Um,
oh my God.

524
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:43,050
And I'm because I become an expert at
talking people out of the vortex of them

525
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:49,240
giving me, giving me advice
about what to do on the day,

526
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,100
um, because they just start telling me
their stories and that'll just be like,

527
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,840
hey, did you see that fucking
nor'easter they just had Becky,

528
00:31:56,841 --> 00:32:00,520
you've got family back east. And I just,
I waltzed them out of the conversation,

529
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,950
uh, because I've tried being blunt with
people being like, listen, listen, listen.

530
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:10,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I don't care. I don't want
to hear your fucking story.

531
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,280
Your fucking story is
not going to help me.

532
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,600
Your story is all about you and you just
talking about yourself in everything

533
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:21,040
that you learned. I don't give a shit.
I've talked to a thousand fucking people,

534
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,850
it seems like in every one of you tells
me a different story and a different

535
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:25,810
thing for me to expect,

536
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,720
which makes me feel like every fucking
thing's a little bit different.

537
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,320
So for the love of God,
can you please shut the fuck up?

538
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:37,120
Can you please stop with
the verbal home videos? Uh,

539
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,220
I can't wait to be a dad and,
and not tell other people how to be a dad.

540
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:50,120
That is my goal as a parent.
I probably won't do it.

541
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,720
I'll probably fucking follow the herd
right over the cliff. It'd be like,

542
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:58,610
you know what? You got it though. Tell you
right now. Look out for this. You know?

543
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,190
Yeah.

544
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,320
Do you know? This person told
me the other day that fucking,

545
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:05,930
I would never play drums again.
The second my kids sport.

546
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:09,290
Can you fucking believe how
ridiculous setters? Yeah.

547
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,060
You won't be playing drums anymore.
Oh really? Well, you know, fucking uh,

548
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,100
Dave Grohl plays drums.

549
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,650
He plays guitar too and he sings
in a band while touring the world.

550
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,240
As far as what I've read, he's got a
couple of kids. I think he's doing fine.

551
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,060
John Bonham had a kid when he was fucking
19 his band didn't even make it yet.

552
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,210
He had a fucking kid
before his band made it.

553
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,020
He was a teen dad before MTV and he went
on to become arguably the greatest rock

554
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:45,620
and roll drummer of all fucking time.
You know,

555
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:48,920
one I think old freckles could
sneak in a couple of paradiddles.

556
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:52,070
What do you think?
You don't really think about parents.

557
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:57,070
I think that there's certain people that
know how to be a parent and not lose

558
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:02,741
themselves in it and actually still have
a balance in their life where they have

559
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:08,120
a card game every once in a while.
Obviously your life is, it has to adjust,

560
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,360
but these fucking people that just like,
they just,

561
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:15,560
they have no life and they just sit
there staring at their children.

562
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,750
You know honey, honey, honey,
don't tech. No, no, no, no, no, no.

563
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,430
They never let their kids fall down.
They don't let him fucking do everything.

564
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,720
They just sit there

565
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,240
like a fucking penguin with that
Goddamn egg underneath them.

566
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,990
Except the kids already born.
I don't think, I don't know.

567
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,840
I don't want to do that. I don't want
that to be my life. You know what I mean?

568
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:42,850
I think if a kid is inside,

569
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,140
considering that we were cavemen and
we used to have babies and they were in

570
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,340
caves in at any point,

571
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,760
a saber to tiger can come in and fucking
just take the kid from you and then

572
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:55,421
that's it.

573
00:34:55,421 --> 00:35:00,421
The fact that you're fucking inside
with put fucking central air heating and

574
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:02,110
food.
You don't have to hunt.

575
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:04,810
You can go right down the street
and go to the grocery store.

576
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,370
I know I'm over simplifying this,
but I ha I have to be honest with you.

577
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:13,900
When I talked to other parents,
all they do is just give me anxiety.

578
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,870
I'm so excited for this thing to happen.

579
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:19,870
And then I talked to people that
have kids in and they, they,

580
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,920
they just dump all this anxiety on you.
And I swear to God,

581
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,120
I might be reading into this,

582
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:30,121
but there's like a certain like 30% of
them that take like a certain perverted

583
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:36,931
joy and making you feel
not feel well about this,

584
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,000
that's allegedly the greatest
experience you are ever going to have.

585
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:45,010
Like they actually take this perverse joy.
Um,

586
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:50,070
and I think that those people are
actually bad parents because I think, uh,

587
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm,
I'm totally guessing here.

588
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:55,440
I think that they resent their children
and what they took from them and they

589
00:35:55,441 --> 00:36:00,150
still wanted to do blow and go around
and fucking have random sex with people

590
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,970
and their,
their state never quite get past.

591
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,440
They didn't quite fuck enough
broads or jump on enough dicks.

592
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,980
I don't know what it is,
but I found it equally with men and women.

593
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:15,981
Like 30% of them will take a perverse joy
and trying to infuse some sort of like

594
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,580
preemptive misery into your fucking life.

595
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,720
Because I can tell you this right now,
I'm still gonna play fucking drums.

596
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,110
I have to, because if I don't, I
will go out of my fucking mind.

597
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,440
I'm not saying I'm going
to play as much as I play,

598
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,760
but to sit there and if you fucking think
that I'm going to sit here with the 71

599
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:39,180
green sparkle fucking Ludwig Drum pad
and I'm not going to keep fucking play in

600
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:43,530
this thing. Uh, you know those people
out there who play an instrument. Okay,

601
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:46,110
but you don't make a living off of it
and you stopped playing it because you

602
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:48,420
have a kid. Do you ever
think about maybe, you know,

603
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:52,080
just playing the instrument in front of
your kid and maybe that they'll take to

604
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:55,140
it or maybe they'll play an instrument
that they could play in the Ted together.

605
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,850
You could have your own little
fucking, you know, good time together,

606
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,684
bonding through.

607
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,130
Okay.

608
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,990
The, I dunno, the wonder of having music
as a fucking hobby. Who you hurting?

609
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,790
They right now, you better play that
Ukulele. Cause once they kid comes,

610
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,260
you're never going to play the meet.
What is this kid like?

611
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:19,520
Some little Donald Trump and he's going
to fire me as a dad if I continue to do

612
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:23,570
my little rudimentary on my practice pad.
Um,

613
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,810
how bout I watch less TV and the amount
of time I spent watching all the Bruins

614
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:30,411
and Celtics.

615
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:34,970
Why don't I take that out of my life and
then put that towards watching the kid

616
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,080
and then continue to play drums? I mean
there's this adjustment you can make,

617
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,790
right? Um, oh fuck. I got to
tell you this story. I um,

618
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,420
I always look at houses, you know,
I'm not going to sell my house.

619
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:49,220
I love this fucking place
as much as I pitch it.

620
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:52,610
That's why I bitch about it because
I love this fucking house and um,

621
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,770
and I'm going to continue
to fucking repair it.

622
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,870
Then I want to do the
fucking homeowner three 60.

623
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,240
And when I have the whole thing fixed,
I'm going to start over again.

624
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:03,680
And the first job, cause then now
it's going to be fucked up. Uh,

625
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:07,620
whenever I repaired at that point, we'll
then be fucked up. So anyways, I um,

626
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,640
there was his house for sale
and uh, I went to go see,

627
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,680
I went to go see it and it basically had
everything that you do could ever want.

628
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:24,390
Right. It's a beautiful house,
you know, from the outside.
It was a beautiful house.

629
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:29,340
It had a fucking pool, add garage detached
from the house with a room above it,

630
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,080
which to me is like, oh, there you go.
I got the kid, I got the house with the,

631
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,360
I got the garage with the fucking
room above it. I put my drums up.

632
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:40,900
They're turning into a drum room
slash podcast room. There you go.

633
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,370
That is my fucking dream. So I go over
to go look at this fucking place, right?

634
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,331
Knowing full well,

635
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:50,440
I'm not going to fucking buy it
because I can tell at this point.

636
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,860
Having bought a fucking house that
needed all the work it does as,

637
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:55,270
as I'm driving up to it,

638
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,140
I can already see the fucking windows
need to be replaced and it needs a new

639
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:00,970
roof.
Even though they told me,

640
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,970
we know we checked out the roof
day and we had some inspectors.

641
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:07,690
They said it's fine. Oh
yeah. Is that what they said?

642
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,810
Why are all these water stains all
over this side of the fucking house?

643
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,370
What's that about? I like how
the windows don't fucking quite,

644
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,680
they're not flush.
Look at that.

645
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,380
Look at the rot around all
of those fucking windows.

646
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,840
This House I can tell you right now is
already a borderline tear down and I

647
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:32,710
haven't even gotten into it yet. So I walk
into this fucking house and Holy Shit.

648
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,400
Holy fucking Shit, dude. I
took a tour of this house.

649
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,070
There was three separate times that I
thought I was going to get murdered.

650
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,813
All right.

651
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,290
Okay.

652
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:42,651
First of all,

653
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:45,560
we go to look at the room above the
garage first and there's just this,

654
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,470
this moss growing on
the side of the house,

655
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,680
which I don't know if it was mold or
if it was moss, it was fucking green.

656
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,020
And,
um,

657
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:54,880
okay.

658
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,640
The guy trying to sell it is, you know,
he's doing his best gun. You know,

659
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,700
it's a mother in laws suite. He can
fucking do this. You could do that.

660
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:04,510
There's rum to add a little more under
the garage. And I just point to the,

661
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,600
I'm like, what is that? And
he goes, yeah, he and I need,

662
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:12,190
need to definitely needs a little bit
of work. And, uh, so I go into the house

663
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,220
and this random guy live in
there who isn't the owner,

664
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:23,050
Reza a polo pony tail. It's sparsely
furnished, was made the 1920.

665
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:24,220
So it's already like creepy.

666
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:28,690
You can already feel how many people
have lived there and are now dead. And,

667
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:32,990
uh,
we just walk around the house.

668
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,880
It got remodeled sometime in the 90s.
He had it still had the fucking, uh,

669
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,210
you know,
Lon Chaney Jr vibe of it from the 20s.

670
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,890
And, uh, I go downstairs,
it was like a basement,

671
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:49,970
which they just don't have out
here. And, uh, the guys like,

672
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:51,470
he can make this into a TV.
Roman,

673
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,550
there was all like these fucking files
and film and all this shit down there.

674
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:56,871
And like,
you know,

675
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:01,550
that was the first time I was thinking
about like a saw or the Blair witch.

676
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,040
And I'm like, all right, uh, can we go
back upstairs? So we go back upstairs,

677
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,290
we go all the way upstairs and there
was this random like teenage girl living

678
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:12,650
there that was the daughter of the
dude downstairs who wasn't fucking,

679
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:15,320
who lives there, but I don't
know, it's not as house.

680
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,860
And we look up there and
this is stuffy fucking smell.

681
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:24,200
And then as we go down to go to the master
bedroom, they said, oh, the owner is,

682
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,130
uh, the owners, just to let you know,
the owner is there. He's in the house,

683
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:31,790
which usually they fucking leave.
There's all these people just there.

684
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:36,791
And this fucking cat just sitting there
looking at me and I do the after you to

685
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,150
go to the master bedroom and
he does the after you to me.

686
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,380
And then I did want to be rude.

687
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:47,240
So now I'm walking towards the master
bedroom down this creepy fucking

688
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:51,620
Transylvania Hall with
the, the, with the fucking,

689
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,730
the guy, Smiley real estate agent
behind me who, you know, he's still,

690
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:58,490
I'm sitting there going like,
he's regular looking good looking guy.

691
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,570
That was to make me feel safe and now
I'm fucked and I'm walking towards this

692
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:03,680
fucking door.

693
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,360
Okay.

694
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,370
And I opened the fucking door

695
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,830
and I look in there and I swear to God,

696
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:14,880
this is guy with like gray skin,

697
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,780
totally fucking bald, like the landing
strip. And then like, you know,

698
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,860
like the little fucking,
uh,

699
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,500
Mr whipple fucking hair around the side
that he's Sorta died at some point,

700
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,930
but now it was like this gray,
he was totally gray.

701
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:31,690
You could see the veins in the side
of his head, like Clint Eastwood,

702
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,770
but not like, I wouldn't
want to fight Clint Eastwood
more like, did this guy die?

703
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:38,830
And then come back and he was
sitting down, hunched down,

704
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:42,040
I think he was typing
on the side of his bed.

705
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,840
The place was a mess and he just
sort of looked over me and say, hey,

706
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,840
he looked like the fucking dad and uh,

707
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:53,920
the Texas chainsaw massacre.
And I was just like,

708
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,610
what the fuck? So I only
like, hey man, how are you?

709
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,630
I sort of stepped around him and then
when I went to look into the bathroom,

710
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,480
which I did for fucking two seconds,
you know,

711
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,440
trying to feel the backside
pressure by the way, you know,

712
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:10,810
they're going to quarterback doesn't
feel the rush of trying to fill that

713
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:12,700
fucking axe.
It was about ready to go into my back.

714
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,620
I look into the bathroom
and all along the bathtub,

715
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,000
this guy had knee high
dress socks drying on the,

716
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,090
and I was just like, and
I was just like, hi man,

717
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:28,960
I'll fucking see you later.
And I did.

718
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,620
I like give us see that
walk racing that they,

719
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:35,200
that was a big fad in the 70s I did
that right out of that fucking house.

720
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,160
And I told, I said it real
state guy. I go, Jesus Christ,

721
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:41,650
I can see why this has been on
the market for so fucking long.

722
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,160
How the fuck he supposed to sell it
when the goddamn creep kipper keepers is

723
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,750
creek keeper, the crypt keeper.
I'm like verbally dyslexic.

724
00:43:52,751 --> 00:43:56,710
Forget about trying to read.
Um, is sitting up there.

725
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:58,800
I didn't dare look,

726
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:03,190
you know I was standing there and I said
all this shit and all those old houses,

727
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:04,450
you can hear everything
when you're outside.

728
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,330
I was standing right underneath the
fucking bedroom window and I didn't dare

729
00:44:07,331 --> 00:44:09,670
look up there cause I had a feeling he
was going to be standing in the window

730
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:13,900
staring at me and I was going to have
fucking nightmares and a, and I just,

731
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,580
I just,
I fucking left.

732
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,800
I left and I have this creepy fucking
feeling that because I went into that

733
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:24,520
house, I got exposed to something and
at some point today, my home phone,

734
00:44:24,521 --> 00:44:25,540
which I never use,

735
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:29,350
so it never fucking rings is going to
ring and I'm going to pick it up and it's

736
00:44:29,351 --> 00:44:32,010
going to be that guy's
voice go and day age.

737
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,380
And then I got to somehow expose somebody
I know to it so I don't fucking die.

738
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,280
Having said that, it was a great
house that had a lot of potential.

739
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,323
Oh my God.

740
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:47,260
Okay.

741
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,190
Jesus Christ at that house needed a giant
fucking hug needed to get that guy out

742
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:52,030
of it and just the,

743
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:57,420
you needed to buy all the sage in the
state of California and fucking set it on

744
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,040
fire. And if one thing, he either happens,

745
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:03,880
either burns out all the spirits or it
burns down the house and you start over

746
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:07,720
again. Um, having said that though,

747
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:12,520
despite how fucking creepy it was, uh,
the fact that it had a room over a garage,

748
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:13,451
that's,

749
00:45:13,451 --> 00:45:16,450
that's the only way I would ever leave
this house as if I could find a fucking

750
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:20,290
house. You know? I Dunno.

751
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,160
I got to get out of this fucking state.
I got to get out of this fucking city.

752
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:27,070
It's so fucking stupid. Every fucking
house. I don't care how nice it is.

753
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,750
You can literally stick your hand out the
window and before your hand completely

754
00:45:31,751 --> 00:45:34,210
extends,
you can touch your neighbor's house.

755
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:35,910
Yeah.

756
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,640
It's unbelievable. It's like
where the fuck do you have to go?

757
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,680
There's just too many fucking people.
Um, anyways, plowing ahead here.

758
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,263
Um,

759
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,460
yeah.

760
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,760
Should I do some breeds for this week?
Let's do some rates.

761
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,500
Why don't we get here? I got a little
more advertising to go. Uh, who,

762
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,980
who the fuck wants to listen to me
read out loud anymore? Let's, ah,

763
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,860
let's read some of the, uh, some
of the questions for the week.

764
00:45:59,861 --> 00:46:02,200
I read two of these and then the last
two advertising's. How about that?

765
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:04,270
All right. And then I'll read the
rest of the questions. All right.

766
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,220
Polish invention. Hey
Bill, I saw this on reddit.

767
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,670
Kind of fucked up. People
go to read it, by the way.

768
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:15,730
How do you even figure out what's
going on? It looks like computer code.

769
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,380
People always tell me
you got to go on Reddit.

770
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:22,510
It's like I put it looks like the
fucking declaration of independence.

771
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,790
I'm not reading all that shit.
I saw the on reddit.

772
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,810
It was a machine made by
some Polish guy to cut wood.

773
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,740
Does knowing it's Polish make
you double guests yourself?

774
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,140
Double guess yourself as to whether or
not it's good invention because of Polish

775
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:42,400
jokes. Double guests yourself in this
guys making fun of Polish people.

776
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,230
I definitely did. I'm at the point
where I have no idea your thoughts.

777
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,550
Um, well I don't know how to clean. I
got to go back here to click the link.

778
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:52,950
I can tell you this.
We don't,

779
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:56,230
I don't think we need any better
way to cut down fucking trees.

780
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,150
Do you ever see that fucking invention,
right?

781
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,700
It looks like a fucking bulldozer without,
without the bulldozer front end.

782
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,350
And the thing just reaches out, grabs
the tree, rips it out of the ground,

783
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,560
turns it fucking horizontal and it goes
right up one side down the other and

784
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:19,640
completely strips it down.
And it does this within like fucking

785
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,430
okay.

786
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:23,140
I Dunno it within 10 seconds.

787
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:27,280
And literally one man in that machine
could do the work of like an army of

788
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:30,070
lumber jacks for a year.
It's a,

789
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,800
it's terrifying when I sought
to be honest with you. You know,

790
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,790
as I talk about looking at a house
that I don't need and then redoing it,

791
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:37,870
what are you going to Redo it,
bill?

792
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,530
What are you gonna Redo it
with the fucking would that,
that machine cut down? Um,

793
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:44,420
all right. Let me see
if I could find the, uh,

794
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,000
all right, here's the link. Let
me look at this thing. All right.

795
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,710
Oh Gosh.
Well,

796
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,410
you know what?
I know you're making fun of Polish people.

797
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,140
This is just some guy in his
backyard came up with this.

798
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:09,440
I bet you couldn't come up with this
fucking thing. And to be honest with you,

799
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:13,400
I just had to cut up my Christmas
tree for this year. Sorry.

800
00:48:13,401 --> 00:48:18,170
I'm sure that was really annoying
to listen to. Uh, that's great.

801
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,060
Let's see what people say underneath.

802
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,740
This is way better than the a
thousand degree knife videos.

803
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,510
I'm irrationally angry at the completely
different sizes of cuts of the second

804
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:32,540
log short out of fire load.

805
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:35,240
We specialize in short firewood.

806
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,930
I don't even know what this guy
put on there, but he basically,

807
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:46,140
he hooked it up to his,
uh,

808
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,150
what's that thing between the
transmission and the differential? Uh,

809
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,120
passed a universal joint.
I'm going fucking blank here.

810
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:59,340
He basically just hooked it up to that
and he's using the engine turning of the

811
00:48:59,341 --> 00:49:03,420
engine. Um, why, why,

812
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:06,180
why do people just hate on
everybody out there? Good for him.

813
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,220
I don't know. Fucking why does I
suppose to trash Polish people?

814
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,630
I like Polish people.
I liked their food and uh,

815
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,020
I dunno. I mean, I'm, I'm sure
they've made movies about it,

816
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:23,130
but not here in the United States because
we're so focused on our own fucking

817
00:49:23,131 --> 00:49:24,600
point of view.
Like most countries,

818
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:29,601
but Poland I'm fascinated with
because during World War II,

819
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:34,110
they were sandwiched between two
of the biggest mad men of all time,

820
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,350
Adolf Hitler,
Joseph Stalin.

821
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,680
They were stuck in
between the two of them,

822
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,610
the most precarious fucking position
of any country that I can ever fucking

823
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,200
think of and they somehow
fucking survived. So I don't
think they're dumb. Um,

824
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:54,590
and I look forward Sunday to going
there and seeing that beautiful country,

825
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,540
eating their food and doing the fucking
shelf, having a couple of fucking beers.

826
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,990
All right. From Turkey, I'm sick
of being called a delusional

827
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,420
Spirasi see theorist by
my family and my leg.

828
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,180
He said,
I live in the Republic of Turkey.

829
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,610
Maybe you've heard that there was a
coup here last year. Yes, I did. Uh,

830
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:20,420
I put it in quotation because it was
the most pathetic attempt in Turkish

831
00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:22,580
history.
Uh,

832
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:28,220
so it didn't go down like
the Ukraine. Um, long short,

833
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,530
your guys were losing control of our guys
who may installed here to have a nice

834
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:38,770
little proxy to the loves to the lovely
oil desert downtown deserts downtown.

835
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,440
I already loved how this
person is thinking. Uh,

836
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,490
so they try to pull the carpet from
under our guys cause God knows they can't

837
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:49,460
pass aggression wars in
your congress anymore.

838
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,540
Since you American citizens
are woke as fuck now,

839
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,980
thankfully I guess we're not cause
I don't know what any of this means.

840
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,560
By the way,
you don't write like you're from Turkey.

841
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,120
Like this is your second language.

842
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:06,170
You're using like really high level
slang for someone who lives on the other

843
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:08,390
side of the world. Um, anyways,

844
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:12,650
this pathetic coup attempt to created
a lot of turmoil here. I mean,

845
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,680
it would be less destructive
if it succeeded because
now through their paranoia

846
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:20,420
they are going full apeshit,

847
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,660
which turns Turkey to a bittersweet heaven
for conspiracy theorists like myself

848
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:29,030
with all this stuff going
on. Um, all right, well I'm,

849
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,000
there's no fucking way I'm reading your
name so you don't end up in a jail if

850
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:34,370
you actually are from Turkey.
Um,

851
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,230
I can deal with my family's indifference
to all this and my friends are most

852
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:41,930
likely are most like me
regarding these subjects.

853
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,000
But the fact that my girls
stonewalls me goes, mm, yeah, doll.

854
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:50,180
Okay. Really annoys me down
deep. Of course it does.

855
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:54,710
Anytime you're passionate about an
opinion and somebody just goes, oh really?

856
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:59,300
Okay sweetheart, forget about it. If
it's a woman that you have feelings for,

857
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,070
um, she is a totally dope
chicken. Every other aspect, dude,

858
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:07,580
you not from Turkey, you're not from
Turkey. But I'll, I'll continue with this.

859
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,020
Fun to hang out,

860
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:14,050
hates the movies and music I hate has c
Cup fund pillows that were sculpted by

861
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:15,800
God himself from my palms.

862
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,510
But I can't help lose respect for her
when it comes to her not giving a single

863
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:22,190
shit about politics and stuff.

864
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,300
She's convinced she doesn't get effected
by them for some reason and it doesn't

865
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:29,690
matter. I'm curious how you
dealt with this feeling. Also,

866
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:34,691
I'm very interested in how you reach
information about the world and what news

867
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:39,470
outlets you trust, uh, from Turkey with
love to you in the, uh, all right, well,

868
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:43,910
let's say you're from Turkey. Very
impressive. Your English and your slang.

869
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,860
You're actually better at my
language than I am. Um, all right.

870
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:53,510
Here's what you have to understand as
a conspiracy theorists is that you're,

871
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,610
you're really,
uh,

872
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:01,430
you're a lot to deal with and
you really wear people out.

873
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:04,310
This is what I learned when
I went down the rabbit hole,

874
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,620
which I got out of a good two,
three years ago,

875
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:12,430
is that as much as you don't trust
what the fuck people are telling you,

876
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,840
which is really common sense.

877
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,320
And I'm not saying there's a bunch of
fucking crazy people live in under a

878
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,480
mountain pulling the strengths.

879
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:25,380
But what I'm saying is that everybody is
spinning the shit because everybody has

880
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:28,290
their own agenda. So you can't,
you don't, like if you just,

881
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,240
if you fucking showed up to
a two car accident, okay,

882
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,600
both people are going to spin it in a way,

883
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,620
even if one person was 100% right,
there's still going to spin it.

884
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,920
So there's no fucking way that,
you know,

885
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:47,550
they can be perceived dig it has
spinach just because the other person is

886
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:49,350
spinning just to offset
their spending of it.

887
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,440
It's like listening to that whole
fucking Russia tapped into a, you know,

888
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,890
hacked into our shit. You're going to
listen to the Democrats spinning it,

889
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,930
the Republican spinning at the CIA,

890
00:53:57,931 --> 00:54:01,410
spinning it and then fucking Russia
their spin on it. So at the end of it,

891
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:05,680
who the fuck knows what happened?
I just love how it,

892
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:09,530
our country is acting like we don't spy
on Russia and we don't try to influence

893
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:13,190
elections around the fucking world and
we haven't placed people in power taking

894
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:15,470
people out and all of that.
It's fucking hilarious.

895
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:20,210
All of a sudden it happens to us and
it's a big goddamn tragedy. So, um,

896
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,670
I would say

897
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,150
respect the fact that
she's not into politics.

898
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:32,160
I'm envious of people that can then, you
know, I kind of did that after a while.

899
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:36,040
Like after awhile it's just like
you're screaming into a tornado.

900
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:37,763
All right?

901
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,470
It's way bigger than you are.

902
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,013
MMM.

903
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,320
There are people out there that have the
ability and the influence to fucking,

904
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,170
I guess turn shit around.
But I'm not that guy.

905
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:53,040
I'm just some fucking guy
ruining your beer at a bar

906
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,640
by bringing all my delusional
paranoid fucking thoughts,

907
00:54:57,641 --> 00:54:58,810
whether I'm right or not,

908
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:01,870
which I was probably right on a few
things like Mel Gibson in that movie where

909
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:05,380
he drove the taxi cab. I was probably
right about a few fucker. Thanks.

910
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:06,700
But I don't know what they are.

911
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:10,240
So all you're doing is just
annoying the shit out of people.

912
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:11,560
And I have to be honest with you,

913
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:16,590
if your girl actually loves you and
she's to the point of responding of yeah.

914
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,830
Darl okay.
I think you've probably worn her down.

915
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,630
I bet she didn't say
that in the beginning.

916
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,750
She probably listened to
it and you probably freaked
her out and you don't have

917
00:55:28,751 --> 00:55:29,590
a solution.

918
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,580
You're just saying all this fucking
shit that's just gonna ruin her day.

919
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:38,170
So maybe that's her defense mechanism
and I'm, what I'm doing is I'm not being,

920
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,730
I'm not going doctor Phil here and just
siding with the woman because I don't

921
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:46,520
have a female audience. Unlike
that fucking dishonest con. Right.

922
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,660
You need today what Shay says.

923
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,793
Wow.

924
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,630
When you look ladies,
when you look at Doctor Phil,

925
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,890
when you honestly look at that man,
do you see somebody do honest?

926
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,770
Do you not see how volatile
the human being that guy is?

927
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:10,470
Can you just imagine living with
that man when he loses his shit?

928
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,180
His Shit.
Just imagine,

929
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:13,830
okay,

930
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:18,180
that semi bald head and face
just beat red screaming at you.

931
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:23,830
His spittle getting caught
in his mustache. Just imagine
that. And he's a man too.

932
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,970
Okay.
I'm telling you,

933
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,320
I know he's got that southern drawl and
you just think everybody's a fucking

934
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:33,490
gentleman. You know the way women
love of foreign fucking axe.

935
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:37,720
I guess guys like it too. I Dunno. I
don't what the fuck I'm talking about.

936
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:39,400
Anyways, let's get back to this guy. Um,

937
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,260
to lose respect for the fact
that somebody is not into,

938
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:48,970
what the fuck you're into is,
uh, ed, that's a sign. You know,

939
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:56,120
it'd be one thing if she just didn't
give a fuck about a ma. I don't know. I,

940
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,700
I'd have to know who the fuck she was.

941
00:56:57,701 --> 00:57:00,670
That could just be a defense mechanism
where it's just like, whatever,

942
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,860
it doesn't affect my life.
You know,

943
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:05,320
I've done that with global warming
and all of that type of shit.

944
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:10,321
I've just started to block it out because
there's nothing I can do to get people

945
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,550
to, I don't, and I don't even know what, I
don't even, what the fucking solution is.

946
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:21,070
The only solution I have is too
fucking exterminate. Most of us,

947
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:25,210
90% of us, and they're just
fucking, everybody sits in
a ball and hopes that, uh,

948
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:28,570
everything that we've put into the
earth and into the air kind of goes away

949
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,370
after a while.
That's the only solution I have,

950
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:37,660
which I don't think that
that's going to work. So, um,

951
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:42,730
I dunno, I just, you know, I, I try to
fucking do whatever the fuck I could do,

952
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:46,740
which is, you know, I dunno. See, dude,

953
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,680
this is why people don't
like could see you, Lee,

954
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:52,630
you literally bringing this up is Brent
brought me to a dark fucking place and

955
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:56,500
your email alone just told me that
just got me to say that we need to

956
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:59,890
exterminate 90% of the people on the
fucking planet. How insane is that?

957
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,430
How are you going to do that, bill?
You're going to do that to babies too,

958
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,080
or you're not going to do babies,

959
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,240
but you're going to kill all those
fucking parents and then what you're gonna

960
00:58:07,241 --> 00:58:09,580
have the most giant fucking
nursery like it all.

961
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,580
It all unravels the whole fucking thing.

962
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,040
That's why I kind of stopped
doing the conspiracy theory thing,

963
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:18,400
even though I still throw it out
there because it's fun. And I,

964
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:22,060
and I also don't believe a fucking
word anybody's telling me, um,

965
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,150
when it comes to that shit,
you know, one on one. You know,

966
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:28,060
if I sat down with somebody and there's
not cameras around that I could feel

967
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:31,090
like they can really be honest with me.
But the second year on TV, you know,

968
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:35,770
there's only so honest
you could be. Um, so

969
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,490
yeah,

970
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,031
I dunno,
I,

971
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:43,031
I would probably guess that on some
level you're a lot to be around during

972
00:58:43,551 --> 00:58:46,970
certain new stories and uh,

973
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,270
I think you should lighten up a
little bit. Take your girlfriend out,

974
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:54,020
go get a fucking ice cream and enjoy
the fact that someone is beautiful as

975
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:58,460
you're saying is she is actually
can tolerate you and your,

976
00:58:58,461 --> 00:59:03,440
your fucking theories. All right. Having
said that, if I ever go to Turkey,

977
00:59:03,441 --> 00:59:05,720
I'll definitely have a beer with
you and then I'll fucking, I'll go.

978
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:10,450
I'll go fucking Tofa toe with you
Helen. Conspiracy theories. Um,

979
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,220
all right. And thank you for
listening to the podcast. Okay.

980
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:17,240
Girlfriend was unwillingly married.
What?

981
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:22,340
All right, dear Billy psycho tits. I don't
know what that, but I liked that one. Um,

982
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:26,750
25 years old and finally found out the
girl of my dreams and finally find the

983
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:29,390
girl of my dreams. Well, good for
you dude. You found it pretty young.

984
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,580
She's 23 years old,

985
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:36,670
smell super attractive and we have been
in a relationship for the last nine

986
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:41,660
months. I don't even have the urge to
go to bars and sleep with women anymore.

987
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,680
She has me all types of screwed up.
It's amazing. My family loves her,

988
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:50,480
especially my father who never gives
a shit about my relationships. Um,

989
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,730
she's from Yemen and is
Muslim and although she hit,

990
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,300
she doesn't really follow the religion.
She is forced.

991
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:03,260
She's forced to by her parents. That
being said, one weekend last month,

992
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:08,210
she told me her sister was
having an arranged marriage
and she was headed to the

993
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:12,920
wedding. I did not hear from her for
three days. She finally contacted.

994
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:13,783
Oh No.

995
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:19,270
She finally contacted me back after I
constantly reached out to her and she told

996
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:23,420
me we had to talk.
Oh No.

997
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,920
Once we met up,

998
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:29,921
she told me she was unwillingly married
off to a man from Yemen and that she had

999
01:00:31,581 --> 01:00:36,340
no idea this was going to happen.
Oh my God.

1000
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:37,203
Is this real?

1001
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:39,620
Okay.

1002
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,000
This is a lifetime script.

1003
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:44,900
She told me that sends her parents
sign the marriage documents.

1004
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:49,160
She really had no choice in a
religion, in God's eyes. She was,

1005
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:50,150
she's married.

1006
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:56,600
She made it clear that she was in love
with me and that she wanted to be with me.

1007
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:59,780
Is is that fucking chick who punches
herself and the chest going to start

1008
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,800
singing at this point.

1009
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:02,590
Okay.

1010
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:06,250
What's her name? She does the
casino gigs. She's from Canada.

1011
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,820
She sang the titanic song.
Right.

1012
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:11,940
Okay.

1013
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:15,090
Leonardo Dicaprio

1014
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,240
ship, whatever the
fucking song. No, that's,

1015
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,030
that's in the arms of the angel.
That's about rescue dogs.

1016
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:30,180
What fucking song? Oh yeah. Nina fall.

1017
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,630
Woo.

1018
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,350
Ugh.
How much does she fucking hate that song?

1019
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:40,940
Having to sing that to a bunch of
casino dope sitting there and flip flops

1020
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:46,400
getting teared up, you know?
Anyways, she made it clear with me.

1021
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:50,780
She made it clear that she was in love
with me and that she wanted me to be with

1022
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:55,340
me only she told me she pleaded with
her parents, but they wouldn't budge.

1023
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,570
We then came up with the date that
if her parents still wouldn't budge,

1024
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,040
she would just move in with me out of
her parents' home and we would figure it

1025
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:04,874
out together.

1026
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:10,030
During the during the week after text
messages turn to about three messages a

1027
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:13,070
day and I did not get to see her at all.

1028
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,190
Okay.

1029
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,950
All right. Then this, you
know, even if you made this up,

1030
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:17,570
this is an incredible story.
I think.

1031
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:20,870
Got a message from her best friend
and she told me that her debt,

1032
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,110
my girlfriend was lying to me. Oh, now,

1033
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:26,370
now who do you believe?

1034
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:30,480
She told me that my girl had been
engaged since she was 16 years old.

1035
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:35,481
Her new husband is forcing himself to try
to fuck her and she is threatening her

1036
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,980
and is threatening her with
violence. All right, dude,

1037
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:39,640
this is going outside the realm of,

1038
01:02:39,641 --> 01:02:43,980
of my silly little podcast
here as well as taking her,

1039
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,890
taking her f a way or phone.

1040
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:48,600
Okay.

1041
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,100
Um, she does make it clear that my
girl does love me with all our heart,

1042
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:57,870
but we'll never leave due or a parent's
disowning her if she decides to leave

1043
01:02:57,871 --> 01:03:01,560
this marriage. What the
fuck? Oh, what period?

1044
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:03,090
The period fuck period.

1045
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:06,420
I immediately contact my girl and
she admits to everything she told me.

1046
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:10,080
She knew about the wedding beforehand and
doesn't think she could do that to her

1047
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:14,460
family. He's trying to have sex with her,
but she cries and then he just stops.

1048
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:18,150
Oh boy. Well, you know what? I commend
that other guy. You know what I mean?

1049
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:20,580
Any guy who can plow
through a woman crying.

1050
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:25,380
That's just a fucking animal that needs
to be shot in the back of the fucking

1051
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:27,870
head.
So this guy is actually not a bad guy.

1052
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:32,250
I don't think he's just wrapped up in
the fucking custom. Ah, Jesus Christ.

1053
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,460
Gotta love religion. Everybody,
I have no idea what to do.

1054
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:39,600
She won't go against her parents,
but she loves me and she's just given up.

1055
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,380
Uh,
she was such a strong and tough person.

1056
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,600
Now she just going with the unwilling.

1057
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,310
Maybe she should just keep prying and
that guy's decent enough to do due to just

1058
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:53,010
be like, all right, you
know, fuck this over tea.

1059
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:56,520
Or a friend told me she's depressed. It
doesn't have the fight in her. Currently,

1060
01:03:56,521 --> 01:03:58,560
she's blocked by friends,
our mutual friends.

1061
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:00,120
And our family off from social media,

1062
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,790
by family and friends
had been calming me down.

1063
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:07,791
This guy who thinks he owns my girl
would get American history x curb stomp.

1064
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,890
If I find out he lays a hand on her.
All right.

1065
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:16,500
This stop being funny like
at least nine paragraphs ago.

1066
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:19,050
Like I usually have like lighthearted,
funny shit here.

1067
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:20,610
Okay.

1068
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:24,270
But that might also complicate things
for her. Yeah. If you murdered the guy.

1069
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:26,340
Absolutely. Anyways, I love your podcast.

1070
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:29,130
Don't stop what you're doing and go
fuck yourself. I don't believe that.

1071
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,300
I don't believe that story. I'm not
saying Shit like that doesn't happen,

1072
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:36,720
but I don't believe that someone would
write this level of serious shit into me.

1073
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:41,720
Um, yeah, I don't put that deck.

1074
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:43,770
That got a little too
fucking sensational for me.

1075
01:04:43,771 --> 01:04:46,950
Not saying that shit like that doesn't
happen, but know if that actually is true.

1076
01:04:46,951 --> 01:04:48,810
I don't know why you're
writing to this podcast.

1077
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:51,930
Okay.

1078
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:56,760
I think at that point you need to
write to a, I'm going to say is wrong.

1079
01:04:56,761 --> 01:05:01,410
Is it Niamh Lisa Ma, Liam Neeson,
that fucking guy you need.

1080
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,420
You need to write to that guy and find
out who wrote the scripts and the words

1081
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:07,170
that he said,

1082
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:12,090
and then find out what they base that
off of and gradually go back and find

1083
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:16,380
whoever the fuck Liam Neeson,
namely some is pretending to fucking be.

1084
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:18,250
I should know who that guy
is fucking name is, right.

1085
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,860
Considering I act every once in a while.

1086
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:26,140
I should know who one of the
best guys out there. Liam Neeson.

1087
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:27,663
Oh,

1088
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,200
Liam Neeson is born in 1952
Jesus Christ deck guys like 60

1089
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,340
63 fucking years old and I
still wouldn't fuck with them.

1090
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,800
Not even remotely. You know,
certain actors that play a
character and you're like,

1091
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:46,330
hey,
he's just pretend to be a tough guy.

1092
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:48,460
Then there's other people where
you're just like, you know, you know,

1093
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:51,850
I think that guy could really
beat the shit out of me. You know,

1094
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:55,430
you just saw on the ground,
where does this seat all right,

1095
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:01,270

time was my next door neighbor.

1099
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:16,780
Okay.

1100
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:19,560
All right. I was just thinking about
the Beatles. I got to strike that.

1101
01:06:19,561 --> 01:06:23,130
Let me read this a month back
a recently.

1102
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,700
Oh, Jesus Christ. You know

1103
01:06:26,701 --> 01:06:29,760
Those are the two advertising's. I know
you guys like, what the fuck? I know.

1104
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:34,320
Just just let me just knock these out
really quickly. Can I just do this here?

1105
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,870
All right. I did me these. Oh, wait
a minute. Why don't we have one left?

1106
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:38,690

1112
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:58,010
Think about how much time you've wasted
going to the post office. Driving.

1113
01:06:58,011 --> 01:07:00,980
They're finding parking,
fighting. Old Ladies.

01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,410

fucking smelly old people.

1120

Crazy people going up there and having
the wrong envelope being told that you

1121
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:27,420
have to go back to the,

1122
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,300

sign up next window please. And
there's no windows open, right?

1124
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:40,280

1129
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:51,891

1145
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:44,450
banged friends.
Virgin X.

1146
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,690
All right, let's start it
again. Dear Strawberry,

1147
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:53,610
Billy pubes forever started
Billy pubes forever. There we go.

1148
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,840
A month back.

1149
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:59,130
A recent recently acquired friend was
at my house and unbeknownst to me,

1150
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,560
his girlfriend at the time
was my next door neighbor.

1151
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:04,890
A few weeks later they had broken
up because she wasn't putting out.

1152
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:07,500
Apparently they had dated for three
months and he couldn't take it anymore.

1153
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:12,060
Here's the thing of Jesus. One thing
led to another. Next thing you know,

1154
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,550
long story short, a week ago, I
was drunk with a different buddy.

1155
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,150
One thing led to another, sorry. Uh,

1156
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,690
and we decided it would be funny to
invite her and her roommates over to play

1157
01:09:24,691 --> 01:09:28,410
board games. I was pretty buzzed and
had all the confidence in the world.

1158
01:09:28,411 --> 01:09:31,740
I walked over to her house and it just
so happened she was the only one home

1159
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,750
though Jesus. She invited me in it
since like some red shoe diaries.

1160
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:38,670
This really happened.
She invited me in for some cookies.

1161
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:41,880
Her sorority made one
thing led to another.

1162
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:49,260
Hey, we go and we ended up
fucking, one thing led to another,

1163
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:54,510
uh, the classic phrase, she
was obviously an experience,

1164
01:09:54,511 --> 01:09:56,430
so it was nothing to write home about.

1165
01:09:56,431 --> 01:09:59,700
This normally wouldn't be a problem
except she's my next door neighbor.

1166
01:09:59,701 --> 01:10:04,530
So naturally I have repeated the process
about a dozen times. My question is,

1167
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:08,700
should I tell my friend?
Normally I wouldn't say anything,

1168
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:12,540
but I think I'm falling for this girl.
He's been kind of distanced lately,

1169
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:16,980
so he might have some suspicions.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

1170
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:21,570
Please come to San Diego and Coco,
congrats on the baby. Uh, he says,

1171
01:10:21,571 --> 01:10:24,840
is there anything funnier
than a young man with a Dick?

1172
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:29,310
You know Jesus Christ, Dude. Have
you think he's getting suspicious?

1173
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:32,220
She lives next door. You've
been over there 12 times. Yeah,

1174
01:10:32,221 --> 01:10:36,070
he's going to figure it out.
Um,

1175
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,500
Bullock, you know, he broke up with her.

1176
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:44,090
He was only there with her for three
months. How well did you, how well,

1177
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:49,270
how much, how are you great
friends with this person?

1178
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:53,650
You know, it gets messy. It gets me, I
don't know what you're asking me here.

1179
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,050
You know,
it's a fucking great story.

1180
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:59,740
Other than they used to be your friend's
girlfriend, but he fucking tapped out.

1181
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:03,300
Maybe that's what you should say to him
when he calls you on it and just bend.

1182
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:07,120
He should have tapped out. Man.
Should've kept mining for gold.

1183
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:10,520
There's gold in them there. Hills. Um,

1184
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:15,720
I dunno the fact that you've been with
this girl for 12 times and you think

1185
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:17,880
you're falling for her.
I don't think you're falling for,

1186
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:20,640
I think you'll love the convenience of it.
If I had to guess.

1187
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,690
You really didn't write too
deeply about your fucking

1188
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,370
bunch of fucking feelings for this girl.

1189
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:32,570
I think you went further into the fact
that how you fucking nailed this girl in

1190
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,430
your, your, your friend didn't. So, uh,

1191
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:38,370
I dunno if you're really
not into this girl.

1192
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:42,420
I would just pull the fucking plug and I
would never bring it up and I'd wait to

1193
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:44,590
that guy as a couple of
Miller high life's into them.

1194
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:49,610
And at that point I would stay out of
his wheel house cause he might fucking

1195
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:52,980
sucker punch you. Cause you
know what happened. All right.

1196
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:57,890
What did he say? Bang.
Friend's ex girlfriend.

1197
01:11:57,891 --> 01:12:00,320
So he didn't say he accidentally
did it. So yeah. Well you know,

1198
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,510
you knew what you were doing and
you did it and now that's the,

1199
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:05,150
that's that's the world you
created it and you're living in it.

1200
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:06,320
So I don't know what to tell you

1201
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:12,050
other than if you're not really falling
for this girl, I would stop fucking her

1202
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,500
day. You Go. I don't care how
good the cookies are. All right.

1203
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:18,600
Colin girlfriend at con a belt.

1204
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,510
Hope Fatherhood is treating you well if
it's finally happened has not happened

1205
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:21,661
yet.

1206
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:26,490
Recently my girlfriend was being very
unreasonable and running her mouth about

1207
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:30,030
something and I said she was being a cunt.

1208
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:34,260
Didn't call her a cunt, rather
acting like one. I, you know what,

1209
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:39,240
there is a loophole there.
There is a loophole there.

1210
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:42,450
But when he dropped the c word,
it's, it's very difficult.

1211
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:47,040
Like I've never called
my wife a bitch ever.

1212
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:51,900
I've never done it the entire time
I've been, I never called it that once.

1213
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,650
One time I did say that she
was acting like one. And uh,

1214
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:01,020
she brought that up for like fucking
three years because she knew how important

1215
01:13:01,021 --> 01:13:04,140
it was to me to never call her that.
And she fucking,

1216
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:08,130
we got into a fight and then she pushed
my buttons trying to get me fucking more

1217
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:11,820
and more mad cause that's what they do.
And they're not doing it maliciously.

1218
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:16,220
That's how they fight. Most of them
were guys go, what'd you talk to say?

1219
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,630
Then you start fucking fist fighting.

1220
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,750
Women usually don't get to that level.

1221
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,480
So their fist fighting is they,
they,

1222
01:13:24,481 --> 01:13:29,481
they've already broken you down psych
psychologically and they just try to make

1223
01:13:29,761 --> 01:13:32,760
you as mad as they can. And, um,

1224
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,850
if you're with a cool woman,
they'll,

1225
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:38,800
they'll take responsibility for that
and it'll eventually forgive you.

1226
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,450
So anyways. All right. So you said
that she was acting like one. Okay.

1227
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,860
Since then she's had her panties in a
twist and thinks I owe her an apology.

1228
01:13:47,861 --> 01:13:48,960
I haven't given her one.

1229
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:53,920
My thoughts are that if anyone male
or female is acting like a cunt,

1230
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:55,120
I can call him a cunt.

1231
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:59,770
What should thought thoughts
on women calling women a cunt?

1232
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,590
And have you gotten into trouble
for calling a woman a cunt?

1233
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:05,740
I've never done that. Uh,
to a woman and I've dated,

1234
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,750
have I ever called a woman a cunt?

1235
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,020
You know, it's funny. Much as I use that
word, I don't think I've ever done that.

1236
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,133
Okay.

1237
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,380
Um, no, I don't do the name calling thing.

1238
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,530
This angry as I am.
If I ever done that.

1239
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,363
Okay.

1240
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:32,750
I've definitely like, yeah, fuck you. You
fucking psycho. I've done that. But I,

1241
01:14:32,751 --> 01:14:37,610
I don't, I don't do the, uh,
I don't do the fucking, the,

1242
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:40,710
uh, those classics. I don't, I don't,
I don't break out the classics.

1243
01:14:40,711 --> 01:14:44,340
I don't say bitch cunt. I
don't say any of that. Um,

1244
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:45,980
okay.

1245
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,830
Yeah, I don't, I just don't, I saw,

1246
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:52,580
I saw that early on in my
life that that doesn't work.

1247
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:57,440
And I saw what it does to a relationship.
I just saw it. Um, you know,

1248
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,710
I had a paper route when
I was a kid, so, you know,

1249
01:15:00,711 --> 01:15:04,880
you get to step into a lot of people's
homes and watch a little movie trailer

1250
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:09,710
and a lot of times you're walking up
to the house and you can hear the, the,

1251
01:15:09,711 --> 01:15:13,100
the director's cut of what's going on
before you went in there, you know.

1252
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:16,760
So I saw a lot of that, you
know, being from Massachusetts,

1253
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:21,110
it was a lot of hotheads
and, uh, I don't know.

1254
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:23,150
Okay.

1255
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:25,750
As much as a, as a dick as I am. Um,

1256
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:30,710
I've never done that and I can
tell you that it gets you nowhere.

1257
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,830
So,
um,

1258
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,233
yeah,

1259
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,061
and the thing,

1260
01:15:37,061 --> 01:15:41,710
the stubborn thing that you're doing
right now that you're not apologizing for

1261
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:44,020
it is going to cause
her to dig her heels in.

1262
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:48,580
And what you're doing is you're creating
this toxic fucking cess pool in your

1263
01:15:48,581 --> 01:15:50,440
relationship.
Okay?

1264
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:51,853
Yeah.

1265
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,870
You could have said a bunch of other
words and you went to def con five or

1266
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:58,960
whatever the fuck is it. One is one
the worst. There was five, the worst,

1267
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:01,240
whatever the worst one.
You went new killer honor.

1268
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:05,500
I think you should apologize
and just say for the record,

1269
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:09,280
I didn't say you were a cunt. I respect
you enough to not call you a cunt.

1270
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:13,540
I just said you were acting like what?
Okay. I won't do that in the future.

1271
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,820
I was wrong. Don't even don't
even defend you, but just say,

1272
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:20,680
I apologize for what I said. I
shouldn't have said it. Just,

1273
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:25,460
just apologize. All right. And
there'll be some residual shit,

1274
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:28,540
but I can tell you, write this right
now. If you're gonna make a real, uh,

1275
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:32,900
a relationship work, when you're in
the wrong, you have to apologize.

1276
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:36,380
You have to do that because
if you don't apologize,

1277
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:38,480
if you always get your fucking backup,

1278
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:42,050
if you fight them every
fucking step of the way, then

1279
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:43,210
yeah,

1280
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:47,140
you stopped being a person to them. He
just, this thing you just, this loud,

1281
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:50,980
annoying fucking thing. Okay?
But if you say you're sorry.

1282
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,180
Yeah.

1283
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:56,230
If he ever, if you say like,
you know what? You're right
in blah, blah, blah, blah.

1284
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:59,530
The Times when you actually
are defending your position,

1285
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:02,500
you have clout because you admitted
that you were wrong when you were wrong.

1286
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:06,970
So there you go. Now I'm not saying
she wasn't being a cunt, okay?

1287
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,193
Now,

1288
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:09,160
okay,

1289
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,090
that's the type of thing.

1290
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:14,050
If you want to say that, that's what you
say when you got you one fucking buddy,

1291
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,170
who for the most part can keep his
fucking mouth shut. But even then,

1292
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,420
he can't depend on that.
Okay?

1293
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,660
If you're ever going to call you
woman a can you fucking do it.

1294
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:27,690
You go for a drive and you do it in your
car by yourself and you yell everything

1295
01:17:29,141 --> 01:17:31,660
that you want to yell because
she's not listening to you.

1296
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,930
You make all your fucking points.
You're fucking crush it.

1297
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:39,550
You give you a closing argument to
the invisible jury inside your car.

1298
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,560
And then in the end,
you know,

1299
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,740
and if they actually stopped
for a second and listen to me,

1300
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:45,820
you don't understand that,

1301
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:49,890
but you can't because
you're such a fucking God.

1302
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:51,913
Right?

1303
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:57,300
And then you look over,
you know,

1304
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,760
at the other person is sitting
there at the red light with you.

1305
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:03,630
And if it's another guy, if
it's me, I'm going to laugh.

1306
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,380
Yeah, no, not at you, but I'm going to
laugh. No one what the fuck you're doing.

1307
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,960
And if it's a woman,
she's probably going to laugh.

1308
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,390
No one what the fuck you're doing.
Or if she's a cunt,

1309
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,720
she's going to fucking squint her
eyes at her and be more of a cunt.

1310
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:25,640
There you go. So, um, yeah,

1311
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:28,550
I do not.
Nor would I ever do that.

1312
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,323
I would

1313
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,380
to the, to the, to my wife, I
would never fucking do that.

1314
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,590
I wouldn't do that to any woman
that I was in business with.

1315
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:41,560
I wouldn't do that with any fucking PR. I
wouldn't do that in general. Uh, but, uh,

1316
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,700
generally speaking,
when I talk about people,

1317
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:45,523
uh,

1318
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,230
I kind of just call men cuts.

1319
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:55,580
I think it's funny to call a man a
contact to call a woman. A con is a,

1320
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:56,690
as the assistant,
funny

1321
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,040
calling a guy at Canton is fucking
hilarious. And I stand by that.

1322
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:05,343
All right?

1323
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:10,670
Not saying God knows that word
exists for fucking reason,

1324
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:14,840
but, uh, it's just too fucking
mean and I'm telling you, you lose,

1325
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:18,830
you lose in the end because, uh, you know,

1326
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:21,920
they could just make your life
miserable in every court of law,

1327
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:25,400
generally speaking, out there is going to
side with them. And next thing you know,

1328
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:29,390
you will never play drums again because
she's going to take them from you are

1329
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,140
right. Not The fucking baby. Okay.
That's the podcast for this week.

1330
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,990
Uh, God bless you. All
right, you fucking cunts.

1331
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:42,530
Uh, go fuck yourselves and I
will check in on you on Thursday.
