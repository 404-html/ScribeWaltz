1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,230
Hey, what's going on is Bill Byrd
is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:07,420
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,960
And I am checking in all of you.

4
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:17,430
Woo. What's going on?
How's your week been going?

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,400
Oh Jesus. That's wonderful.
That's fantastic.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,480
I'm out here in La. It's
overcast, it's gloomy, it's rainy.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:27,860
Okay.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,790
Which is a good thing.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,150
Which is a good thing because we
always need the fucking rain out here.

10
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,840
And I'm so pissed at whoever
the, I don't, it was the mayor.

11
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:36,621
I don't know who it was,

12
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:40,990
but last year it rained like it's never
rained out here and this fucking asshole

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,830
goes, oh good. You know the
droughts officially over.
It's like, it's never over.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,380
There was never supposed to be a city
out here. Okay. So whatever we got,

15
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:52,700
we need to conserve.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:53,970
Okay.

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,150
Because who the fuck knows
when it's going to rain again?

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,250
So what do I see? What do I see the other
day? I see this whole fucking thing,

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,810
this video about how they put
these giant black rubber balls.

20
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:08,640
They just roll them into lakes,
I think.

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,810
And I believe that it's to try to prevent,
you know,

22
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,490
to slow down the evaporation of the
water in the searing heat out here.

23
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:18,390
And once again,

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,260
they're saying that we're in a drought
and does anybody go back to the stupid

25
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,740
ass fucking mayor or the governor or
the lieutenant something, whatever,

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,950
whatever the fuck the person's position
is that makes the ignorant statement

27
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,770
that the drought is over.
So it'd be stupid cunt out here.

28
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:34,590
It goes back to fucking
taken an extra long shower.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,950
Of course not. Why would you
do that? Why would you do that?

30
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:43,150
It's not your job as a politician.

31
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:47,380
You job as a politician is not
to tell people what's going on.

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,370
It's to make people feel that
everything is going to be okay.

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,440
You make them feel like
everything's going to be okay when,

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,360
when everything isn't okay.

35
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,840
And then you make people scared shitless
when there's really nothing to be

36
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:05,190
afraid of. And that is my cynical fucking
view on a cloudy fucking la morning.

37
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,200
Now these people all, they're, they're,
they're coming to catch Ya. Oh,

38
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,760
there's plenty of water.

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,680
Fucking take a nice long shower.
You stupid content.

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,020
Um, well that's not it. That's, you know,
we're getting towards the end of the week.

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,910
Why, why, why, why, why would
I come at you? So in this way,

42
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:31,020
I'm a little grumpy today.
I'm a little grumpy thing.

43
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,100
Get a lot of sleep last night.
And then I got a while.

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,220
I'm going out to Pittsburgh today.
I got Pittsburgh,

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,140
I got to Cincinnati this weekend too.

46
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,900
Fucking towns and people
ain't afraid of work lease.

47
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,150
Their dads weren't and their Dad's dad.

48
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:47,750
But these kids now sit around playing
video games trying to fucking come up with

49
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:52,670
an APP that ain't still working.
Is it? Um, I'm going out there.

50
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:56,930
Some of my great friends that I've met
in this business live in Pittsburgh

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,500
and uh, so I'm going to be doing tomorrow
morning. I'm going to be on the uh,

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,770
the morning show, Randy Bauman
and Bill Crawford, wd v. E.

53
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,040
So tune in if you're in Pittsburgh.
Um,

54
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,830
I always try to make sure that I want
to come back, that I do their show,

55
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,831
cause I rem I member back in the day when
I would go there and I would play the

56
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:21,160
fucking Pittsburgh
improv out at the stacks.

57
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,030
This is small out there and they literally
had the kept to stacks from, you know,

58
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:30,031
when we used to fucking produce
shit in this country and for me,

59
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,890
all steel mills or whatever.
And uh,

60
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:37,090
I used to go down there and I'd
sell low about 30, 35 tickets.

61
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,690
Okay.

62
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,140
I mean it was a fucking hard
ticket to sell. I can't explain it,

63
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:44,930
that God damn mall,
first of all,

64
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:48,710
there was one way in and one
way out on this skinny bridge,

65
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,570
if I remember correctly.
And it took,

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,400
it just took forever to get in
and out of there and a half.

67
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,260
Nobody knew who the fuck you where it
was very difficult to sell tickets.

68
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:00,170
So a Randy used to put me on the show.
He'd be like,

69
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:04,730
don't just come in Tuesday to do
the fucking show every single day.

70
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:08,630
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday. I'd come in. I would
do it. Just sit in for the,

71
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,870
almost the whole show,
all four days in a row.

72
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:16,450
And then I finally started
selling tickets. So, you know,

73
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,820
now that I'm selling tickets,
I don't want to come back to Pittsburgh,

74
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:21,590
like gold belly, big shot. Right.

75
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,480
I gotta go back there and kiss the
fucking ring there. Made me when I,

76
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,290
she and you steal shit.
Um,

77
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,100
and of course they're going to probably
fucking give me shit. I already already,

78
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,450
okay.

79
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,340
Willing to believe that they're going
to give me shit about the last patriots.

80
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,320
Steelers game.
Those poor fucking people.

81
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,950
I can't remember the last
time the Steelers beat the
Patriots. It's unbelievable.

82
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,750
He used to beat the fuck
out of us when we were kids.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,960
I'm just trying to enjoy the last fucking
whatever Tom Brady has left because I

84
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,890
know it's going to be,
it's like dolphin fence.

85
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,550
They're still waiting for the next day.
A marina.

86
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,090
They'd been waiting since 99 and
entire generation has grown up.

87
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,440
Okay.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,380
Watching them lose to the
Patriots in my whole childhood,

89
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:07,730
I watched just lose to the dolphins.
Bob fucking Gracie.

90
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,330
Right. And then he finally retired.
It's like, oh, thank God. Right.

91
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:15,160
And then somehow Don Shula's still
got David Woodley and don Strock

92
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,590
to trade off at that position and they
went to another fucking Superbowl.

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,020
Granted, they lost, they
still kicked our ass

94
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,930
and then they get Dan Marino.

95
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,110
So our lives were fucking miserable for
a good 17 years. So, uh, you know what?

96
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:35,130
That's an interesting question.

97
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:39,240
I would love to see what is the Patriots
that lifetime record against the Miami

98
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,073
Dolphins.

99
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,940
Okay.

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,590
Let's see here.
Patriots first.

101
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,030
Dolphins.
All time.

102
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,090
All right. What did I just say? I
said it perfectly. Lifetime record.

103
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,840
See if we get it here.
This is why the Internet is fucking great.

104
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,053
Yeah.

105
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,440
This is why it's fucking great.
Wait,

106
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:09,131
what do you mean the pate?

107
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:12,700
The Patriots won 11 one 11 and 10 in
the eighties against the dolphins.

108
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:17,700
It's not fucking possible.
Wait a minute.

109
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,720
Okay.
And the 60s that dolphins won,

110
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,910
they won four out of,

111
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:28,911
so there were four and three and
the 70s they were 13 and seven

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,310
in the 80 [inaudible] patriots are 11
and 10 I never would have known that in

113
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,500
the 90s they were 14 and seven

114
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh, we didn't even do that. Well
against him in 2011 and nine verse them.

115
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,080
I didn't even know that
there was that close.

116
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,400
I thought they destroyed us in the 80s
and we won one more game than them,

117
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,110
and I thought we killed them in the two
thousands we were 11 and nine and then

118
00:06:56,111 --> 00:07:01,060
this Dick Decade, we were
12 and four. All right,

119
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:05,680
so who's winning here? Oh,
Jesus. 12 and 11 is 23 everybody,

120
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,260
I can't fucking do this.
This is going to take forever.

121
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,550
You know what I just realized I don't
care to can, can you do give me a total,

122
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:16,740
do I have to fucking think?
I mean, this is the Internet.

123
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:19,980
The whole fucking reason to get on
this is not the thing. All right,

124
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,360
let's see here.
Dolphins,

125
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,390
one 1717 and 10 after two decades

126
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,200
than they were 27 and 21

127
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,701
ah.

128
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:39,701
Then they crushed us 27 and 21 then
they were 35 and 28 my brain's going to

129
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:45,611
explode here at 35 and 28
then they were 44 in 39

130
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,310
then 48 and 51 I believe I
just did the math correctly.

131
00:07:56,311 --> 00:08:00,570
They're 48 and 51 at a time
swap it.

132
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,180
Taper the willow for fucking decades,
so your that right there.

133
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,540
Whenever I gamble on football,

134
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:10,080
I always stay away from division rivalry
because it makes no fucking sense,

135
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,580
but somehow it's like the jets.
As much as the jets suck,

136
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,900
they still are the bills or whatever that
you're still going to go like you know,

137
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,250
I don't know. One of them is going to
get you. You're going to have a letdown.

138
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:26,900
Gay play it twice a year. It's really
hard to beat the two times he said,

139
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,640
David says, say pocket season. All right,

140
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,860
let's get down to what I
really want to talk about.

141
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Dean del Rey's 52nd birthday
party slash tribute to bond.

142
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Scott at the Avalon might've been
the most fun I've ever fucking had,

143
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,370
um, since I got into this business. Um,

144
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,110
it was a standup show slash
comedy show if you don't,

145
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,790
if you didn't see the fly.
And um,

146
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,110
the stand up show was Joey Diaz who should
have been closing and then Mark Marin

147
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:10,560
and then myself, they should have
flipped the fucking order. But uh,

148
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,761
we came out,

149
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:16,761
we did done dean of course hosted
the show was sold out and a,

150
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:18,540
and then in the end,

151
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,520
Dean went up in front of this all star
band and sang the entire power age album.

152
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,890
I got to see Mark Marin play lead guitar
and I got to sit in on three songs on

153
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:32,000
drums and a,
it's the best day ever played.

154
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,310
And I still had a train rector and
fucking livewire. But other than that,

155
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,040
it was fucking great and uh,
thought it was,

156
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,090
I just want to thank everybody who
played in, let me be a part of that.

157
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:46,350
Dean del Ray for putting it together.
Scotty and Nikki Sixx, Mike, Devin,

158
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:49,680
Rudy Sasso.
See Dave pushed her.

159
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,630
Steve Gorman fucking murdered
it on drums. Uh, Mark Marin,

160
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,470
George Lynch, I know, I probably
forgot a couple of people. Um,

161
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,910
whoever the one got all,
like they got like the,

162
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,960
the same amps and guitars in exact
gear that ACDC used back then.

163
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,000
So they had that crunch song sound.

164
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:12,270
I know that we've been posting clips
on Instagram and everything and, uh,

165
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,910
around the, around the internet,
but it was fucking unbelievable.

166
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,780
Unbelievable night. And I already knew
that. I loved Steve Gorman has a drummer,

167
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:26,781
but just watching him fucking
murdering for an entire hour,

168
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,100
uh, it was incredible. I still see, I
still cannot believe that that happened.

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Fucking playing drums and I'm looking
up in this fucking fucking Nikki Sixx

170
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:43,740
playing bass, Scotty and on
guitar. I don't think I'll
ever get over that people.

171
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,900
Um, that was another thing, you know,

172
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,260
and that the part is thing about
doing that is, is sitting there going,

173
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:53,970
how the fuck? What the
fuck am I doing here? Um,

174
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,730
but Jesus Christ, Dean Delray, I've never
heard him sing better. Um, you know,

175
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,580
cause now he got himself
in like ridiculous shape.
You know, it's hilarious.

176
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:02,761
He said,

177
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:07,170
if you can somehow find clips two years
ago and we did it and dean sang the

178
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:11,850
entire highway to hell album and I
believe the next day or two days later,

179
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:15,900
he went to the doctor trying to figure
it out while he was still tired and his

180
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:19,980
levels of something. We're often, and
that's when he, uh, he went on this diet,

181
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,560
you know, his new diet that, you know,

182
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,500
that fucking guy gets locked into
something and he's just into it.

183
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,840
You know what I mean? You know, I
just quit drinking and then, you know,

184
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:31,920
eventually I come back to it. That dude
quits. It's fucking over. It's past them.

185
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,910
And, um, but if you
look at the difference,

186
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,230
he doesn't even look like the same person.
Like two,

187
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,240
two, little over two years ago when we did
the last one, he looked like a fucking,

188
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,610
he looked like he'd been on the police
force with a desk job for like fucking 25

189
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:54,420
years. Um, did undercover work.

190
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,290
He got in a little too deep and then they
fucking, they pulled them out, you know,

191
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,290
can he got rid of whatever drug addiction
he had and he put it into fucking

192
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:05,850
donuts and eat and color for cereal.
That's what this fucking guy looked like.

193
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,640
And like you look at him now, he doesn't
even look like the same person. In fact,

194
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:09,600
he told me the other day,

195
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,840
he ran into somebody and started talking
to them and they will get acting all

196
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:13,674
weird.

197
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,910
And he had to like reintroduce himself
cause they just thought he was some sort

198
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:22,740
of weird fan.
So,

199
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,510
um, he already killed it
a few years ago, but uh,

200
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,600
and he was horrifically out of shape
and now this year he was in unbelievable

201
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:37,570
shape and he fucking
fucking murdered it at. Uh,

202
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,910
and I want to also give a shout out to,
there's one dude in the crowd.

203
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:44,460
The crowd was amazing,
but this one fucking dude,

204
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:49,120
he took me back to the 80s when I used
to see shows that the Worcester Centrum

205
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,210
was the providence civic center.
This guy,

206
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
he had the long hair not styled at all.
Okay.

207
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,440
Not the way after a while they learned
back in the day when you just grew your

208
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:05,580
hair to piss off your parents,
you just didn't cut it. You know,

209
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,470
if you look at like fucking Robert Plant's
hair in like before he got the do in

210
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:13,500
the 80s, right? You just
let it go out. This guy had,

211
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,190
I guess it was more of a 70 circuit.

212
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,320
He just parted it down the middle
and let it fucking go. He had the,

213
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,660
the black fingerless gloves,

214
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,290
the Jean jacket with the
band patches on it and shit.

215
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,130
And he was headbanging
vintage headbang and like,

216
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:34,131
it was like 84 before Glam came in and
he wasn't just headbanging with the beat.

217
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:41,040
He was whatever the guitars were doing.
Uh, like my neck hurt watching him.

218
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,570
And I don't know if he noticed,

219
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,960
but everybody that was on the show at
some point notice him and was pointing

220
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,190
like laughing going like this fucking
guy. I remember guys like this. And, uh,

221
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,030
we actually, I actually ran into him
at the end of the show and, uh, uh,

222
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,000
feminists took a little bit
of video, so hopefully, yeah.

223
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,490
Yeah.

224
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,170
It was just the coolest fucking crowd
ever. Like somebody walked by the line,

225
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:04,711
it's like,
dude,

226
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:09,711
it looks like heavy metal parking
lot meets the comedy store.

227
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,650
It was perfect. So, um, I mean, I dunno,

228
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,330
I haven't heard of Dean's
going to do it again,

229
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:17,160
but I got to feel it was so much fun.

230
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,600
There's no fucking way he's not
going to do it again. And um,

231
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,610
yeah,

232
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,580
you, you, you owe it to yourself.

233
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,220
You gotta come out here cause
people going like, dude,

234
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:30,570
you got to take this show on the road.

235
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:35,520
It's just too many fucking amazing
people that have their own careers.

236
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:36,390
All those musicians.

237
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:38,880
I don't know how the fuck you would
get that on the road somewhere.

238
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:41,760
Maybe you could do a one off somewhere
in New York City or something.

239
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,400
I have no idea.
Um,

240
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,450
but that's another great
thing about living in La is
all these guys are out here

241
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:50,280
in la and everybody's
always shitting on La

242
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,230
[inaudible].
Yeah.

243
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,780
Then that happens. That happens. Um,

244
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,530
and everyone was so generous and I
remember afterwards like a, I don't know,

245
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:04,000
it just,
everybody was just so fucking,

246
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:08,200
everybody like was literally a fan of
ACDC and it was just the greatest night

247
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,610
ever.
So thank you to Dean del Rey,

248
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,330
the all things comedy network.
Um,

249
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,310
let there be talk podcast and uh,

250
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,170
amazing comedian now who gets
sustained rounds of applause. Uh,

251
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,640
um, last couple of dates I did
with them. I'm so happy for him.

252
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,480
It was just a fucking night of my
life of his life too. I should say.

253
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,450
I'm fucking making it
about myself. Um, anyways.

254
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,933
Uh,

255
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,120
I dunno. That's weird.
That was all positive.

256
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,160
Now that's kind of thrown
me off my game here.

257
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,660
I got to trash something now.
Oh,

258
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,160
I actually am taking a connecting flight
to Pittsburgh because he only direct

259
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:55,161
flight is on southwest and I just cannot
fucking handle these standup comedy

260
00:15:56,521 --> 00:16:00,830
that they tried to do on those
things. It just, it's excruciating.

261
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,160
The jokes never work,

262
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,500
at least when I'm on there.

263
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:10,040
And then there's just this awkward pause
and everybody sort of laughs side of

264
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:14,390
the awkwardness and it's just, I find
it unbelievably fucking unprofessional

265
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,480
considering we're all on a fucking
plane. That always, you know,

266
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:22,480
they'd see always the outside
chance this thing could crash

267
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,300
is we going down the tarmac and the
guy's doing a Darth Vader voice,

268
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,350
make sure your seat belt is on
doing this shit and everybody's

269
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,870
fucking lab. It's like, dude,
what the fuck are you doing?

270
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,110
Sorry.
Um,

271
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,310
I don't, I don't know why it bothers me
as much as it does because I actually,

272
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,700
I told you last time I went on the
Internet and I tried to find people that

273
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:51,430
agreed with me and I
couldn't find one post.

274
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:55,780
I went through four pages of the
Internet when I searched, you know,

275
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,570
flight attendant's doing their
comedy routines and all it was,

276
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:02,620
was glowing reviews. So at some point, I
guess I just have to admit that it's me.

277
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,090
That is me. But uh, you know, they have
an incredible safety record over there.

278
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,670
They really do. But I don't think
it's because of those fucking,

279
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,180
those fuck away. I don't know. I
almost made a fucking joke that I,

280
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,033
I,

281
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,910
I'm not gonna do that joke cause we
live in a time that you just can't make

282
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:26,060
jokes like that. But just know
that in involved Mohammed. Atta,

283
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,190
how about those Boston Bruins,
everybody,

284
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,000
they are tied. We just got smoked by the
Tampa Bay lightning four to nothing. Uh,

285
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,180
we are tied for points. We got
three games left, we're paying,

286
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:46,830
playing the panthers, there's
sadness and then the pant is again,

287
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,300
um,

288
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,250
to see who's to have I guess home ice
throughout the whole eastern corporates.

289
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:57,540
Buchard playoffs, congratulations
to them. This amazing season,

290
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,870
this amazing rebuilt,
you know,

291
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,960
since we let all of those
guys go from our 2011,

292
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:06,510
essentially 2011 Stanley Cup team.

293
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,940
The fact that they turned it
around this quick quickly, um,

294
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,250
has been incredible. And the only thing
that sucks right now as a Canadian suck,

295
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,960
you know, cause I would be like really
excited. You know, when we get this good,

296
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:23,940
you want to go play a good Canadian team,

297
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,810
a Montreal Canadiens team and have
a great classic seven game series.

298
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,090
And, um, you know,

299
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,370
it's like if the Yankees suck and the
red sox are good or vice versa, it's,

300
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:36,570
it's not fun for the fence,
you know,

301
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,120
unless you're just a Douche bag and you'd
like to see a one sided event, but, um,

302
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,150
plants to coming up,
Celtics, it's coming up.

303
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,490
I haven't been able to
watch any fucking games.

304
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,660
The amount of times I've had five or six
games, Bruins games is Celtics Games.

305
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,660
Just, you know, back logged. And I, I can
only watch the first period of one game.

306
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:02,070
Like I did the lightning game and then
I got to erase all of them because it

307
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,650
takes up too much space.
I just don't have the fucking time.

308
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,840
You who should be yardy yardy like
the fucking parent I am right now.

309
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,050
Proud to be a parent. But Jesus Christ,
you're fucking, and I, you know,

310
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,720
I got all the packages and I,
I think I'm gonna have to get rid of him.

311
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,140
I don't even, I can't, you know what? I
don't have fucking time to watch them.

312
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:25,230
This is all good reasons why I don't
have time to watch him. But, uh,

313
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
you know, the red sox came out,
I think we're like five in one.

314
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,480
Everybody's excited
about our pitching staff,

315
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:38,460
the Red Sox who are now the evil empire
and the Yankees have this little team

316
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:42,060
that could, that has, you know,
500 zillion fucking dollars. Uh,

317
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:44,550
but the way the Yankees did it
versus the way the red sox did it,

318
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,710
we've literally become them. But, uh,

319
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:49,260
it seems to be working for us
and it's working for the Yankees.

320
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:53,940
So I have a bet this
year with Paul Versey,

321
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,900
the pride of Trenton fee in Newark,
New Jersey.

322
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,260
Paul Versey 50 bucks a
game in the regular season.

323
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,010
And I also have another
50 bucks a game with, uh,

324
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,750
with my agent who books me on the road.
So I figure if I,

325
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:13,250
if I put some money on it,
I'll be able to, you know,

326
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,670
at least pay attention cause I don't
want to miss all this shit. I don't know,

327
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,470
become that dad that doesn't know any,
any of the players' names. You know,

328
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,790
it starts talking about Omar
Marino and fucking Dave full, uh,

329
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,520
the Fuck Temp Foley de Felice
from camp kids in the hall.

330
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,860
Tim Foley and all these old guys.
Widleen McGee,

331
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,730
you know, like listen to that guy
doesn't know. You know when I was a kid,

332
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,840
talk still talking about
Stan mutual. Um, right.

333
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,150
Let me read some of the fucking
advertising game and then I got to La.

334
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:48,090
I got to get the fuck Outta here.
I gotta pack

335
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,030
my bags, go out to Burbank,
get on a fucking plane. Um,

336
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,140
where am I going here? Who Do we got here?
We got a, all right. Dollar Shave Club.

337
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:02,790
Everybody. All right. Get rid of all the
junk that's lying around your bathroom.

338
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,300
It give it the cleaning it deserves.
Unless you live with a woman,

339
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,760
then just continue to joy.

340
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,960
You're one eighth of the fucking
counter top in the bathroom.

341
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,840
You probably don't really have any
clutter. Do you freshen it up with,

342
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,370
do you ever try to like
clean up your side,

343
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:21,900
your little fucking third of the House
to try to guilt your wife and to picking

344
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:25,950
up some of her stretchy pants?
It doesn't really work. Does it?

345
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,450
Yeah,

346
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,210
that was my goal. I was just going to
be, I'm just going to fuck it. I'm out.

347
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,380
I'm going to, I'm going to lead by
example. You can't lead by example.

348
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:39,330
He got to lead by example and you'd
have to accompany it with, um, allowed.

349
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,193
Sighing.

350
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,043
Okay.

351
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,470
And then passive aggressive.
What's the matter? Nothing.

352
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,100
What do you mean nothing?
What's the matter? Well, you
know, it's just, you know,

353
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:53,450
you kinda got your

354
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,660
stretchy pants all over
the, Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,250
I mean, I, I didn't do
it on purpose. Um, fresh.

356
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:10,690
Where does that go? Where does it go?
It goes nowhere. It goes nowhere. Okay.

357
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:12,820
That's why God invented the garage.

358
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,240
That's the place where you just go out
there where you had the stuff that you

359
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:19,990
really love, that you kind of have locked
out there so she won't throw it out.

360
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,040
A fresh ended up with high quality
products from Dollar Shave Club.

You'll get an amazing high quality shave
every morning using dollar shave club's

365
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:48,690
executive razor.
I can't stop yawning.

366
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,783
Okay,

367
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,970
dear Dr Covey's, you know,
it's going to happen.

368
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,550
I'm going to get on that fucking plane
and everybody's gonna have the shades

369
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:59,510
down except for that one fucking asshole
who not only has this shade open,

370
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,190
also has the overhead lighting on it.

371
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,340
You get an amazing high quality shoe,
uh,

372
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,400
shave every morning using dollar
shave club's executive razor there.

373
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:15,591
Dr Coffee's easy shave
butter goes on clear.

374
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,160
She can see where you're shaving. That
makes no sense, but it goes on clear.

375
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:21,450
How can you see where you're shaving?

376
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,950
You need the fucking white foam to show
that you already did that part of your

377
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:29,010
face, right? You're saying that you
can see through the shave butter.

378
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,510
Okay.

379
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,020
I Dunno. And since dollar shave
club delivers everything to you,

380
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:34,651
you don't have to,

381
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:37,230
you don't have to set a foot in
a store wanting around the isles,

382
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,830
hunting for razors, shampoo, body
wash, toothpaste, none of it.

383
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,050
You can just eat yourself
into an early grave.

384
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,000
Eventually your wife has to
fucking Shavia clean up. Yo. Let's,

385
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,260
how about a round of applause

386
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,240
for all the people that stay with people
that get that big, you know what I mean?

387
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,060
And they got to take them down to
the fucking car wash, you know,

388
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,900

fucking scrubber that the soaps shoots out

389
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:01,734
of,

390
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,273
you know,

391
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,060
tie the person to the fucking front
fender like a goddamned make a shot,

392
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:12,600
an elk and you just scrub them down.
Um,

393
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,650
clean up your bathroom and your morning
and your morning routine with dollar

402
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:54,570
Join the club today. Alright, legal zoom.

403
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,020
It's a fact of life.
Attorneys are expensive.

404
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,140
You're likely to pay around $300 an hour.

405
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,203
Okay.

406
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,753
Fuck.

407
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,400
That's just one reason why smart business
owners turned to legal zoom. Sure.

408
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,040
Over 2 million Americans
have used legal zoom.

409
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:19,020
Just start their businesses with
ls, LLCs, incorporations and more.

410
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,170
I got to take out the fucking Invisalign.

411
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,953
Here we go.

412
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,090
But even right after your business
is set up, legal zoom can help you,

413
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,300
can help you out.
Things like lease agreements,

414
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,840
changing tax laws and contract reviews.

415
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,280
Can you fucking do a postnuptial
prenup with this? I Dunno.

416
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,770
Are all part of running your own business.

417
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,900
Do you promise to love hold and Cherice
and pick up your fucking stretchy pants

418
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,410
when he sighs loudly, do, well, maybe.

419
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:53,540
I don't know why you being mean to me,

420
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,100
but these are precisely the kinds of
legal hurdles that take time and effort

421
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,470
away from growing your business.

422
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,400
That's why legal zoom created
their business legal plan with it.

423
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:09,430
You get legal advice for your business
from vetted independent attorneys vetted.

424
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:13,340
That means they didn't take their dick out
at work. That's what vetted means. Now,

425
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:18,110
at least in Hollywood, right, and tax
professionals available in every state.

426
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,490
You can also raise,
you also receive access to Ndas,

427
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:25,520
lease agreements and more.
The best part is you don't,

428
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:29,750
you won't get charged by the hour.
Since legalzoom isn't a law firm.

429
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,650

say? Do I have anything else to say?

436
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,130
Um,
actually I don't.

437
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:04,390
Let's talk about how I know
how to pack now. Alright,

438
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,680
one pair of jeans, two shirts,
underwear and socks, and that's it.

439
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,840
He Slam it in a fucking bag.

440
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,990
You never have to sit there
at the fucking turnstile.

441
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:17,320
I don't give a fuck if I was, if I was
going on the road for the for a year,

442
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,490
that's exactly what I would bring.
Yeah. Never coming home again.

443
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:25,760
I don't give a fuck.
And you were black.

444
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,030
I sweat Johnny Cash wore black so they
couldn't tell he was wearing the same

445
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,500
fucking shirt every day.
Right.

446
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,583
Okay.

447
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,810
That's it. That's how you gotta do what
you got to wear dark colors. You know,

448
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:37,840
you start walking around
dressing all flashy.

449
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:41,710
All of a sudden you gotta be like Mariah
Carey bringing all this bedazzled shit

450
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:42,640
out on the fucking road.

451
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:46,630
I always think that that's
why she's always in such a
mood. You know what I mean?

452
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,430
Should we seems to be talking yet also
thinking about something else at the same

453
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:55,180
time, I think she's probably
wondering, did I pack those,

454
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,480
the dazzle red bottom shoes,

455
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:01,330
that half my face in diamonds on them?

456
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,480
Can we talk about divas for a
minute? You know, is there a reason,

457
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,730
you know why they're vetting all
these men out here in Hollywood yet?

458
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:15,460
They're leaving the divas alone.
I mean,

459
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:19,540
just stick about how many phones they've
thrown in fucking people that are

460
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:22,390
probably working for free.
You know,

461
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,920
the amount of time they've slapped people
in the face just said horrible things.

462
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,660
At what point are we going to hold the
Diana Ross is fucking high heel shoes to

463
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:32,350
the fire.

464
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,770
That's what I want to know that that's
your homework between now and Monday

465
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:38,050
chain.
When people say that that's your homework.

466
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,830
I took a yoga class the other day.
It was fucking awesome.

467
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,810
I went there with my wife,
you know, and uh, I actually,

468
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,590
I actually, I found this, um, you know,

469
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,250
they have,
they have fake mess must statutes.

470
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:58,300
They actually now have like fake man
buns and I actually had a little fucking

471
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,790
velcro strip strip that yeah.

472
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,640
Glued to my head and I stuck it on
the back of my head, my bald head.

473
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,770
And I went there and it was great. I've
noticed at Yoga teachers for some reason,

474
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:11,380
they can't just take you through the
fucking class. They always have to,

475
00:29:11,381 --> 00:29:12,490
for whatever reason,

476
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:17,230
they always have to tell you a fucking
story about how they fail during their

477
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:18,700
life and then they remembered,

478
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,770
oh look who's hair come
busting through the door.

479
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,603
Hey Buddy,

480
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,260
do you got your AC DC high
voltage rock and roll.

481
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:32,170
1975 one Xeon.
Okay.

482
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,810
I guess I got to put the mic down
because somebody wants to hug

483
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,720
you. Have any idea how much I'm going to
miss you over the next couple of days?

484
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,880
Huh?
Do you know?

485
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,270
That's why I take the earliest
flight back so I can see you sing.

486
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,680
You the itsy bitsy spider.
Huh?

487
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,070
I Bet I can sing you some
ACDC this morning. Huh?

488
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,930
Back in black. He'd said,
I bet you know what?

489
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,940
I had to be back without getting
loose. Probably loose. You know it was,

490
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,740
that was the song for Bon Scott back
in black, like they were at a funeral.

491
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,830
Um, all right, I'm done with the podcast.
What are you guys having for breakfast?

492
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,010
Hi,
you say hi.

493
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,410
Nothing. Hey a Gol. Hi.

494
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,580
All right.
I'll be in there in a minute.

495
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,100
Thanks for helping me get to the last 90
seconds of the podcast, Cutie Pie. Um,

496
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,930
oh yeah,
we got all,

497
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,300
I got all this rock stuff that I
always put her up whenever she,

498
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,180
whenever I dress her, you
know, they've got these things.

499
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:41,380
I got these Motley Crue onesies.
What is it called? Hey, what is it?

500
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,350
What's Somali crew?
One set of shouted,

501
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,890
deviled shout at your Mama there.
They're fucking adorable.

502
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,520
What the hell is it called?
They're all like these,

503
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:55,020
these cute like toddler puns and uh,

504
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,080
the does a level of clothes that kids can
wear now, even as toddlers, I tend it,

505
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:02,920
they didn't have any of that shit when I
was a kid. We had like Choo Choo trains,

506
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:04,780
you know,

507
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,890
some sort of cowboys and Indians that
just completely ignored the genocide that

508
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:11,710
happened.
That's what the fuck we had.

509
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,260
We didn't have all these
cool rock onesies, you know,

510
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,280
but [inaudible] spoiled today. Um, oh,

511
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:22,630
I need to save this.
I signed up for global entry.

512
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,400
You know,

513
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,870
the Illuminati one step closer to me
building my fucking robot replacement when

514
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:32,420
I answer all these fucking
questions. But, um, I just,

515
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,290
I just gotta have it now that I'm
bringing my family and I'm fucking proud.

516
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,960
That makes me feel this to say
that I actually have a family,

517
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,400
you have to just be in this isolated
psycho. It's the fucking greatest.

518
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,750
It's the greatest thing ever. I love going
to the mall. I like going to the park,

519
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,040
pushing my kid on the swing.

520
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,550
I remember looking at people thinking
now I always knew having a kid was cool,

521
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:54,520
but I used to think some of it some level.
I was sad for those people.

522
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,630
I had it totally fucking wrong.
So anyways, I'm going to, uh,

523
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,100
I'm doing a Gig in London, England,
Dublin, and then over to London,

524
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,880
a two in Royal Albert Hall,
which was an absolute dream of mine.

525
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,800
And I'm going to record that night.
Hopefully I'm going to do enough time.

526
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,600
I'm going to make the double album.

527
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:17,860
Then I'm only going to put out on vinyl
after I made fun of people that listen

528
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:20,170
to records only on my last podcast.

529
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,850
That's what I'm going to do is what I
want to do at Madison Square Garden.

530
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:26,200
And the recording got fucked up, so I'm
going to make sure I get it done right.

531
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,010
And,
uh,

532
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,860
I also must try to get a drum kit there
so I can play during the day and hope

533
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:34,390
they can find some fucking somebody
to jam with over there. Uh,

534
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,390
but anyways, afterwards I'm
going to take a little week off.

535
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,060
I'm um, over there in Europe and
I'm bringing the whole family over.

536
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,370
So when he got a little
one flying that far,

537
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:47,370
it's going to be a frigging nightmare.
Uh,

538
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:53,270
so the very least we can lease blow
through the security by giving up a

539
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:56,590
ridiculous amount of privacy by
answering all these questions. That's I,

540
00:32:56,591 --> 00:33:01,080
I just had to do, well, you know what's,
I had to make a sacrifice there. So,

541
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,770
um, that's it. That's
the podcast. Once again,

542
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,090
thank you to everybody
involved with Dean del Rey's,

543
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,560
a birthday celebration and all of that.
I mean that was just,

544
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,730
I can't, I, you know, I, I took some video
during sound check. I got to put it up.

545
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,510
You cannot fucking believe
how good that band sounded.

546
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,340
They are top notch musicians playing
out of all that gear from the late

547
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,330
seventies. It was fun. I was
getting like goosebumps. Uh,

548
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,460
I know I took a couple of MMM.

549
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,860
I walked out into where the crowd
was going to be before they, they,

550
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,920
they brought everybody in
and just listening to those
how fucking good they are.

551
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,510
And I got to tell you too,
Steve Gorman,

552
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:48,750
just watching a professional
fucking drummer is just my favorite.

553
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:52,290
God dammed up that close is my
favorite thing. It's just a sec.

554
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:56,520
How do they make it sound that
good? He was incredible. Um,

555
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,220
okay. So anyway, so I'll
try to post some of that.

556
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:02,280
And after I came down for the sound
check cause I was so nervous that I was

557
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:03,720
going to inevitably fuck up the songs,

558
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:08,160
which of course I did in a number
of areas. Um, but I plowed through,

559
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,490
but I wanted to make sure I had one more
crack at it before the people came in.

560
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:15,330
But, uh, after we were done
with the sound check. MMM.

561
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,290
It was me, Mike, Devin, I think Josh Z.
And we just, we just started playing.

562
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,570
I started playing some bottom beats and
then they just jumped right in and Devon

563
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:30,410
started singing and I put the immigrant
song up there and uh, it was just,

564
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,470
I was so much fucking fun.
Um,

565
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:37,340
so I hope dean continues to do that
every other year or whatever the fuck he

566
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,340
wants to do. And anytime he wants
to do it, if they'll have me on,

567
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:44,730
I would be honored to be there. Cause
uh, that really was, it's perfect.

568
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,721
It's perfect.

569
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:50,310
My dream of being a stand up comedian
and then my dream hobby that I was never

570
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:53,940
good enough to do professionally cleaned
drums. It's just fucking awesome.

571
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:57,600
So a thousand thanks to him. All
right. With that. Here's some,

572
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:02,080
here's some music picked out by Andrew
Feminist before we give you another half

573
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,000
hour from a Thursday afternoon podcasts
from earlier this year or a year gone by.

574
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:09,930
I don't know what, but that's it. Have a
great weekend. I'll talk to you on Monday.

575
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,110
This youtube video of this week.
You really have to watch it. Okay.

576
00:36:02,111 --> 00:36:04,750
It's one of those shows. It's
basically, it's a rip off of the view.

577
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,440
It's for broad sitting around and they
got, you know, the same thing. You know,

578
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,780
they got the older one,
they got the sexy one,

579
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:14,060
they got the one who was fat and then got
her fucking stomach tied up like a God

580
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:18,250
damn balloon. Not now. She's dropping
weight faster than a junkie. Right.

581
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,190
I don't even know if that's true. I
just looked around them. You know,

582
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:26,500
they've got the racially mixed chick
and they all got on their fucking shoes

583
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,120
right there. Little outfits.
Uh, hang on a second.

584
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:33,310
Hang on a second. Someone's knocking.
I'll let you know what this is.

585
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,100
Okay.

586
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,380
All right.

587
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,740
You guys aren't going to believe this
shit that was security and they just said

588
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:44,440
that they had a noise complaint
anyways. You know what?

589
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:47,680
Some rich counsel on the other side of
the door with the fucking piece of one of

590
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:51,250
those really fancy glasses that they
think came from France but actually came

591
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:55,510
from a fucking pottery barn.
Um, if you can hear me,

592
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,330
go fuck yourself. This is what you get
for nuke in the economy. Um, anyway,

593
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:02,260
so these four fucking
broads and are on TV, right?

594
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,030
And they ended up there talking about
that guy there doing that story.

595
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:09,880
You know that story where that
dude get his dick cut off.

596
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,710
Brace yourselves because we're about
to go there because this woman,

597
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,760
this woman that allegedly did, according
to the Orange County DA's office,

598
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:26,990
Katherine Q.

599
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,990
Becker is accused of cutting off her
husband's penis with a nice taking his

600
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:36,170
penis and throwing it
into the garbage disposal.

601
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,320
So talking about that guy who
got his dick cut off his wife,

602
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,860
dragged him, tied him to
a bed, cut his dick off,

603
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:52,200
threw it in the garbage
disposal and turned it on.

604
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,870
And it was basically because

605
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,010
he wanted to get a divorce from her

606
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,690
police, say back or attacked him
because he filed for divorce,

607
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,170
she mutilate and um,

608
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:11,770
she ended the guy's fucking life
and he saw of quality life is over.

609
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,210
Okay.

610
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:18,210
And these women are talking
about it and lo and behold,

611
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,650
it's fucking hilarious to them.

612
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,763
California,

613
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,850
they had all they could do to keep a
straight face during the first minute of

614
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:32,840
setting up the story.

615
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,860
And then all the jokes come and they're
laughing their fucking asses off.

616
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,500
I do think it's quite fabulous.
I mean,

617
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,970
yeah. Cool. I would've just
thrown it in the dog's bowl.

618
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,320
Why does the dog have to
suffer chewing on an old bones?

619
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,330
It's the funniest fucking thing ever.
And this right here,

620
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,120
it's because of that type of shit.

621
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,140
Then I don't feel that I am misogynistic.

622
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,120
I just don't.
I think that I am just like women.

623
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,360
I trash women the way they trash guys.

624
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,230
It's just nobody pays attention
to the broads. They don't.

625
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:29,830
Do you think of a guide mutilated a woman
in any shape or form that four guys on

626
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:34,810
a pregame NFL show would be laughing about
it and we'll hear more of that talk a

627
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:38,500
little bit later as well.
Sharon Osborne was the guest and she goes,

628
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,220
somebody asks, do you think the
guy deserves, and she goes, well,

629
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,120
it depends on what he did.

630
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,270
I think I would have just
depending on why she cut it off.

631
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,270
I mean it does depend on the
reasons why does it, oh yeah.

632
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,100
The reason I'll think of one,

633
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,300
you know I made that fun is
totally overlaps the thought
of those morons in the

634
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,530
Middle East who cut women's clits off.
You know,

635
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,630
it's fucking medieval thought
and it's just considered silly.

636
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,910
I don't know what it is.
I don't know.

637
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,890
But it maintains what I've always
fucking said that women will do it to you

638
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,270
exactly what they don't want you
to do to them. If you let him.

639
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,670
And I think why so many guys are miserable
in marriages is they get married to

640
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:40,750
fucking young before they really
know how to stick up for themselves.

641
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:44,110
In a relationship and that's
why before you know it,

642
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:50,070
you're married and all your shit is
either in the basement or the garage and

643
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:53,050
she's barely touching it and a,

644
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,670
and you're wondering what the fuck
happened to your life. You know,

645
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,490
I dunno.
The video is,

646
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,610
is going to be up on the [inaudible]
podcast.com you know something.

647
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,470
This is actually,
I like this talking like this.

648
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:10,471
This is very challenging to try and
be funny with a late night DJ voice.

649
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:12,750
Okay.

650
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,900
All right. This next chunk of the
podcast goes out to the ladies. Ladies,

651
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:17,970
if you're out there and you're sitting,

652
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,190
hang in, there is a date. Rape is

653
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,650
okay.

654
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,350
Hey,
what's going on?

655
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:09,850
It is a bill burr and this is the
Monday morning podcasts for Monday.

656
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,890
Uh,
I'm going to go with April 4th.

657
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,830
I had no fucking idea
what day it is because a,

658
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,060
I'm doing something a
unique this week where, uh,

659
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,980
people have asked me Saint Bill,
you know, every week, you know,

660
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:24,790
you do your podcast. It's just you
babbling. Sometimes it's funny,

661
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:25,650
sometimes it isn't.

662
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,790
Why don't you have a fucking guest
on there every once in a while.

663
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,160
How about a comedian that people,
uh,

664
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,410
people want to know about
or already know about?

665
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:34,720
Want to hear his views on other shit?
So this week,

666
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,430
this is a very special episode
of the Monday morning podcast.

667
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,190
Well I will be doing it with the one
and only Mark Marin. Mark going on.

668
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,250
Thank you for having me go.

669
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:48,040
I didn't realize that I was actually one
of the first guests who've never had a

670
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:52,620
guest. I've had Joe to Rosa who
I do a, I do a show with on uh,

671
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:57,520
every once every, I think a leap year we
do an episode of the show. Uninformed.

672
00:42:57,521 --> 00:42:59,500
We used to do it on x.
How much along fucking story.

673
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:02,320
But you have to have money cause
he lives in your apartment. Yeah,

674
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,150
he peaked there. There you go. That's
it. Part of the contract in his week.

675
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,690
It's basically, yeah, he lets me crash
when I come back to New York to do a,

676
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,410
to do Caroline's. He sees the mixer.
I feel bad. I'm like, all right,

677
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,990
grab a microphone. Here we go. But
yeah, you're the, you're the first.

678
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:20,680
You're the first one outside of the,
uh, the family. You know what you are,

679
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,360
you're Tim Roth and reservoir dogs.
You're the only one. I'm not sure.

680
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,010
So I end up with a gut shot. Yeah. The
media who laying there in the garage,

681
00:43:27,011 --> 00:43:27,940
the whole fucking movie.

682
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:31,570
You're going to tell me you're a cop or
something towards the end of this. Oh,

683
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:35,980
I'm not good to tell you that.
I wish I had that biggest
secret. No, but basically,

684
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:39,250
you know what the funny thing is is uh,
uh, if, if the audio sounds different,

685
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:43,570
which means clear this week is, um,
um, actually this is how I have guests.

686
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:46,480
This is the only way I do guests on
the Monday morning podcast is if they

687
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:50,590
already have microphones and
a mixer. And then I, yeah,

688
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,400
I invited mark onto my podcast and
I'm like, I got a rescue pit bull.

689
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:57,280
I don't want to get sued.
So can half hour into it.

690
00:43:57,281 --> 00:44:00,490
So I'm literally sitting in
Mark's compound out here. Yeah.

691
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:02,680
And you brought your own equipment,
which I thought was very polite. Ia,

692
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:06,270
but I just automatically assume we
just jump on my mix and, oh, I get it.

693
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,440
You don't think I'm a gentleman?
No worries. I brought me on mixer.

694
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:11,290
I brought my own mix and then when we
sit there and I'm sitting there with my

695
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:15,280
little stupid fucking travel
radio show and I'm like,

696
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:17,260
I got a mixer and all that
and then mark smiling.

697
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,510
Oh you know I kind of got that
already set up. You want to use mine?

698
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,770
I got the travel bag. I got the bag right
there for when I have to uh, you know,

699
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,770
you had talked to people on the road in
hotel rooms and make me feel awkward.

700
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,770
Look mark and like a lady
in my relationships on the
rocks and I've officially

701
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:31,990
moved in. You don't realize
that. Oh my God, now

702
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,400
I'm fucking with the car.
Okay. That's all right buddy.

703
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:37,780
If you can just sleep in here and
if you knew how to run a mixer,

704
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,100
you could help me out there. We get, how
can I be your assistant? Yeah, absolutely.

705
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,990
A lot of people trying to
move up in this business.

706
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:45,990
I'm going to try to go backwards. Can I
ask you a question? Absolutely. All right.

707
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:46,561
So I'm in,

708
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:50,070
I'm in Scotland for the Glasgow Festival
for five days and I'm playing pub

709
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:54,160
basements. And I did my one
man show it in, not in a pub
basement, but in a pub, uh,

710
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,710
uh, attic and I see posters
a you, yeah, they're,

711
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,750
they're betting the big money on Bill
Byrd. I talking to them, promoted there.

712
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:03,380
I'm like, is he a big drawn
out here? She's like, I dunno,

713
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,270
we're going to see out of go. Um,
I drew like 200 and then they,

714
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:11,820
they papered another 400 drunk Scott's,
oh, get him in there at the, uh,

715
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:16,490
the king's theater. But it went great.
You know, hopefully, uh, you know,

716
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,420
I'll come back again and I mean, I,
how'd you, I loved it over there. I had,

717
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,630
I actually,
I talked about it on my podcast.

718
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:26,130
I had a great time because I had a
resentment of the Scots and of the UK in

719
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:30,450
general only because the last time I
went there I had a bad experience and I,

720
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:34,510
and I chose to blame them other than
myself. What happened? Well I was in,

721
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,530
I was in Edinburgh for 30 days doing
that fringe festival and I, you know,

722
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:40,440
I was literally three months since
my wife left me. I was miserable,

723
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,330
I was broken and I was on a double bill
with Kirk Fox that we were brought out

724
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:45,541
there,

725
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:48,990
which is the best part of it cause they
paid for our lodging and everything else.

726
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:51,870
Usually I have to pay for your own
shit and I couldn't give it away.

727
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,050
I mean we were drawing audiences of nine
and you'll have to two weeks of that.

728
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,870
You're like, holy crap, I didn't want
to kill yourself. Yeah. It's like,

729
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:01,210
it's like open mic every night. It's like
doing a show in denim. Yeah. It's like,

730
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,000
it's like doing a show at a bar in
Dedham. Who, you know what's funny dude?

731
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:09,240
That's why I never did Edinburgh.
I always wanted to go over there,

732
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:12,000
but it's a fucking month.
Same thing with Australia.

733
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,940
There's some sort of Australia
comedy festival and it's like, well,

734
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:18,450
can I go there for 10 days? And like,
no, you gotta be over here for 30 days.

735
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:20,280
And it's like,
well what will they,

736
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,680
the way they were supposed to do
with my fucking life back here,

737
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,210
you just put it on hold.

738
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:27,150
He gets somebody to watch your dog and
you hope your girlfriend doesn't run away.

739
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,320
That's that tiger woods.

740
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:31,040
Shit I was talking about last week when
I went off on his wife. You know what,

741
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:35,440
how can these fucking women who they
get like a w w where they ha they,

742
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:39,030
they marry these rich fucking guys.
Yeah. They don't have a job. Right.

743
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,360
And then they have kids and they still
get help. They get like a fucking nanny.

744
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,300
There's somebody clipping
the hedges. They, they,

745
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,470
they don't do if somebody
clipping the kid, everything.
Everything. Yeah. So I said,

746
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,340
so as jokingly just fucking around.

747
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:52,710
I was saying the reason why I messed
around on her is because she's lazy.

748
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,990
Oh yeah. And it's, that's a
very, I don't know about you,

749
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:58,700
that's very untrue and
attractive. Uh, uh, quality,

750
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,090
messy if you want to. Yeah. The same shit.
They don't like it. Who knows? I mean,

751
00:47:03,091 --> 00:47:05,410
if you want to talk about entitlement,
you know, I just found, you know,

752
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,790
because I've had the processes over
and over again in terms of, uh,

753
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,510
in terms of what the whole spousal support
thing. I mean, my wife didn't that,

754
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,640
you know, she wrote a book, she
didn't have a job or whatever,

755
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:17,310
and then afterwards done, you think you're
equals, but then they're like, you know,

756
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:19,440
I want support, I want this.
And they can exploit that.

757
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,670
That's the saddest thing about fucking
divorce is that it's set up so the woman

758
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:25,500
can break you no matter what.

759
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,920
And the reason I was put into place
might have been in earnest. I mean,

760
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:31,870
if you think about people when they
first put support, spousal support,

761
00:47:31,871 --> 00:47:35,350
I'm talking without kids, not
alimony, spousal support. So granted,

762
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:38,320
if you're married to a woman for 20
years and she's been doing nothing but

763
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,780
making you feel better
for your miserable life,

764
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,750
and then all of a sudden it's done because
he went and fucked somebody who did

765
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:46,300
whatever and she's got to enter
the world again with nothing.

766
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,620
I understand why you, she owes a euro or
a little payment, you get us off started,

767
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,430
but if you're married fucking 10 minutes
and the chick is perfectly capable of

768
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:57,460
doing whatever the fuck she needs to
do to make a living and then she still

769
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:00,930
busted and takes half your shit. That
shit where it's like when it's a good,

770
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,980
when it,
when there's something good on the table,

771
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,000
they're just as good as you and they're
equals and they want their 50% but when

772
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:08,900
it's something bad,
I'm just the girl

773
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,550
and they get it coming and going because
guys want to fuck them and that's why

774
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:18,250
the judge, the judge half the time
when he's judging against you,

775
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:21,610
was thinking he's going to fucking get
some action with your ex wife by judge

776
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:24,010
towards he throws her little look.
We had this little wink,

777
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,470
you're sitting there like, am I not
fucking sitting here? All right,

778
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,270
so I'm married to this woman. She's
a comic. She's an equal. We always,

779
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:32,880
she's a cunt. I was like, wow,
you're really gonna fucking
Yo Yo. No, no, no. I mean, I,

780
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:36,850
I'm not going to do that.
Look, I will take my side, I
will own my, my shit there.

781
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,450
I had an anger problem. You know, it took
me a long time to learn that, you know,

782
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,250
but I did learn it.
If you're an angry guy,

783
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:45,880
that means it probably with somebody
married to or living with or involved in a

784
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,910
relationship with someone who's a pain
sponge that will deserve, you know,

785
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:51,640
absorb your bile and bullshit
until they can't take any more.

786
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:54,070
And then they'll want to be wrung
out by somebody else. But you know,

787
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:58,390
as an angry guy, I knew that.
What I learned is that, you
know, when you're angry,

788
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,780
you compensate for it in other ways. You
know, like I used to make her breakfast,

789
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:03,910
you know, espresso,
waffles, pancakes, you know,

790
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,450
no one got to me softly weeped in the
corner. That's right. That's right.

791
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,720
This will make up for it. But, but
what I learned, you know, after, uh,

792
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,800
after nine years, there's no number of
pancakes or race said shut the fuck up.

793
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,020
Shut your fucking mouth.
[inaudible] before we get,

794
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,910
I get too deep. But why don't we, uh,

795
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,280
why don't you back up here
for a second island? No,

796
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,800
just cause I've known you so long.
You know,

797
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:30,770
some of my listeners here cross here
just so they know, you know, uh,

798
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,910
how long have you been doing stand up
or where you started out? Oh, well let,

799
00:49:33,911 --> 00:49:37,720
let's, let's get into stand
up inside the actor's studio.

800
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,620
I think that the first time, uh, you
know, I did stand up, I was in a,

801
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,720
I was in college,
I did an open mic.

802
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:48,640
I was in a team with another guy I met
in College Guy Steve Brill when they went

803
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:52,090
on stage with, with, with another,
originally we put the, we put the,

804
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:54,700
I put my first standup together,
always wanting to do it,

805
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,150
but I met this guy in college who,
uh, we auditioned for something,

806
00:49:58,151 --> 00:50:02,470
catch a rising star at that time.
It must've been 80, 83, 82 83.

807
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,590
And that's one in Cambridge in Boston?
No, no, this was the original one.

808
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:07,990
That one didn't exist then. It
was the old, the original catch,

809
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:11,770
a rising star that was still up on the
upper east side in a, in New York City,

810
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,890
the original green kitchen.
Right, right. Okay. So, uh,

811
00:50:14,891 --> 00:50:18,440
so they had posted all these signs
around my college, uh, you know, uh,

812
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,280
catch a rising star live on campus.
They were putting together a show,

813
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,730
like a showcase of college
acts, like new acts. So,

814
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,890
so we put together this team bit and
we auditioned for them, you know,

815
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,820
in a room and they liked it. And then we,
we, uh, audition for them. Uh, what was,

816
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,600
what was the name of it?
Marin in something.

817
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:36,770
And I don't remember if we had a name. I
think it was just Martin and Brill. Uh,

818
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,500
and you know, it was a series of
sketches. It wasn't even real team.

819
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:42,770
It wasn't like teen comedy. It wasn't
like a straight guy and a goofy guy.

820
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,610
We actually had several different sketches
that we did. I kind of remember them.

821
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:51,740
They're the one sketch was, uh, you
know, where the word nigger came from.

822
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:55,370
Oh, it's Jesus. You came right out
bolt. Barrel's well, no, it was like,

823
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:59,180
and I hate to say that word even,
you know, even in the context of, uh,

824
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:03,560
of a casual conversation, even though I,
yeah, cause I get in trouble for that one.

825
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,760
It's when,

826
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,970
what I was trying to have a conversation
about that word with a couple of black

827
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:11,630
comics and I said the word as I just did
now, and a woman in my audience said,

828
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,980
just the fact that you said it, I'm
done with you. See, that's retarded.

829
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,940
That's another word you're not supposed
to fucking say. It's just how like,

830
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,540
you can't even like that. That's when
your, uh, people who do stuff like that,

831
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:26,630
it's like they're not even listening to
you. They just have lists of words like,

832
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:30,270
these words are good. He's lords of
bad debts. There's no like a, right.

833
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,530
But I can't make gate tech feeling that
she had. I mean, you know, if that word,

834
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:37,490
no matter what context it is,
makes her co horrendously upset,

835
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:39,860
then there's nothing I can do about that.
Whether it's right or wrong, I, you know,

836
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:43,750
I can't account for her feeling. So we
did that sketch, which was these two, uh,

837
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,560
these two guys that were like,
you know,

838
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,330
white guys who were working and they
were trying to name the, you know,

839
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,450
the figure out a nickname for the people.

840
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,480
And it was like diggers and it was stupid.
And then we did another one.

841
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,560
We did a Neil Armstrong's,
if Neil Armstrong were on the moon,

842
00:51:57,561 --> 00:51:59,240
the first moon walk if you were on acid.

843
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,330
So my buddy played ground
control and I play,

844
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:04,610
I was doing the bit where I was on the
memo and crushed. Yeah, I would did well.

845
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,610
And then we did another one
that, uh, a Japs funeral.

846
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,820
Like we did these two Jewish girls who
were at a funeral of a friend, you know,

847
00:52:10,821 --> 00:52:13,460
and they were like, oh my God, she looks
so thin. You have that kind of shit.

848
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,340
They ain't go. You kind of got
everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Lacks Jews.

849
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,840
So what happens then is
that, uh, we, uh, we, we, we,

850
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,090
we auditioned him at the comedy
connection. We go to do it live.

851
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:29,120
We had done it in a room and they said,
we want to see you alive. And we bombed.

852
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,650
Bombed. It's just like sucking silence
now. What, what do you think? So the,

853
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,010
wait a minute. Wait, so the first
time you ever did it on comedy stage,

854
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,520
now I've always said the first
time if I bomb the first time,

855
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,360
I don't know if I would ever have the
courage to go back and do it again.

856
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,930
Well that that's the difference
between people that are, are, are,

857
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,350
are hooked on it and people,
yeah.

858
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:52,460
People who are born comics and people
who are just, you know, dabbling.

859
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,390
Is that like really, if you bond you
would have done it again. It would've,

860
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:59,730
it would've taken me a minute. I
would had it been like, just the,

861
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:04,670
the sheer fucking embarrassment
of, uh, of taking the hit. I mean,

862
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:09,020
you can, this is deal with stand up. You
can still eat it today. I'm 18 years in.

863
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:11,150
I kinda, yeah, you can eat
it, but this is the thing.

864
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:15,440
You have years of good shows to be like,
well you know,

865
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,480
I know I don't suck at this.
I had a bad night.

866
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:21,200
But you know right out of the gate. Oh
yeah. The bad night thing is hard to,

867
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,900
to really get around. You had,
cause it still hurts me if I bombed,

868
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:27,270
but when you're up there and you know
you have this whole idea that you know,

869
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,290
it's, it's never, the
audience is bullshit. I mean
sometimes it's the audience,

870
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,720
right. And you know,
like you, you can tell,

871
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,270
you know you've done your shit and you
can see where they're peaking laughter

872
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:37,350
wise and you know,

873
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:40,230
after a certain point that they're
not going to go any further than that.

874
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,363
So I'll get after it.

875
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,580
I'm just going to have to realize this
is the best I'm going to do in this

876
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:48,080
situation and either eat it
and you don't take the hit or,

877
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:50,320
or make light of the fact. Yeah. I've,

878
00:53:50,321 --> 00:53:53,300
I've learned like there's nothing worse
than being angry on stage, but I heard,

879
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:57,000
I actually heard a funny story last
night. I was doing a Gig and uh, this, uh,

880
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:00,810
this book or Jeff Wills from the note
yet. Yeah. He was telling a story.

881
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:04,860
He saw one night said Bill Hicks did
an entire show with his back to the

882
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:08,300
audience. It was like a
Bachelorette party. There was
every fucking thing it did.

883
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,820
Yeah. Those like those Booker's they love
to talk about those stories, you know?

884
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,650
But if anyone else did that now,

885
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,830
they would never fucking work in that
club again. All these guys pretend like,

886
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,320
you know, like, oh,

887
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,330
Bill Hicks was the guy and he went
onstage and angrily tanked and a brilliant

888
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:23,970
inspired way almost all the time.

889
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,210
But if someone existed like that
now he wouldn't have a fucking shot.

890
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,370
It think so. Absolutely. Well, I bet.

891
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,520
I bet he was still selling tickets at
that point because you can't, you can't,

892
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,700
you can't turn your back on a fucking
crowd and everything that you're going to

893
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:36,750
work.
I don't think that's true.

894
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:40,340
I think that the reason he got booked
in this country primarily was to,

895
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,280
to make club owners feel like they were,
you know,

896
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,350
they were at least championing
something terrific.

897
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:50,160
Like I think they innately knew this guy
was special. There was no one like him.

898
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,520
And even the fact that he didn't sell
tickets or alienated the audience every

899
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:57,540
time they were going to have him twice a
year to keep their content straight. Oh.

900
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:01,060
So that can be dicks to everybody else
basically. Yeah. But just sort of like to,

901
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,130
to at least support that.

902
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,860
At least they knew well enough
that he was an inspired guy.

903
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,740
But I've gotten angry on stage. I did
it the other night, dude, not in it.

904
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:10,980
And it had been a long time because I
used to snap all the tabs and I say,

905
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:15,030
that's kind of an understatement coming
from you. Yeah. But that's like me saying,

906
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:19,470
I've snapped. No, but, but you know,
I'm pretty accessible now. No, no. Yeah.

907
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:22,770
You're your way your way. Uh, but
it happened at the store, dude.

908
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,880
It happened how long ago?
Two nights ago. And I, I, I,

909
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,620
I could've done this whole thing. Yeah,
much better now. Much better enough.

910
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,870
I snap one time. One is that 48 hours
ago, I couldn't believe I did it.

911
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:36,330
It's such a different person. You
know, that place brings it out of you.

912
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,560
Come on the comedy store brings
it out of here sometimes. I,

913
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:44,400
that's what I love it though. It's so
fucking so I'm on stage. It is evil.

914
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,880
It is. It's just painted
on heat. You know,

915
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,660
you feel the walls wanting you to lose
it, you know, it's just in the place.

916
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,040
So I'm on stage,
it's like 40 people in the room and like,

917
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,350
I'm already like just right when
I get in there. You have some kid,

918
00:55:58,351 --> 00:56:01,720
that kid David Taylor, you know that
kid, he's a tall guy, used to do comedy.

919
00:56:01,721 --> 00:56:04,800
He's very, you know, cynical and negative
and I just, I wasn't in the mood for it.

920
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:07,710
I hadn't seen him in months.
And then I said hi to him and he goes,

921
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:10,350
I'm staying around just to see you.
You better be good.

922
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,200
And so right away I'm like,
I haven't seen you in a fucking long time.

923
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:16,890
You have no right to fucking talk like
that to me enough with the negative shit.

924
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:20,590
You know what? I bought it, stormed
off, get again and anger for,

925
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:24,760
and I walked back and made me feel
really good about myself by them because

926
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:27,470
usually I sound like the angry psycho.
I can be like the happy person.

927
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,060
Just take a break. Yeah, there you
go. Go ahead. You Go. All right. So,

928
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:35,190
so I get onstage magical one on who
I think is just terrific. I love owl.

929
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,320
He's fine. I think he's fucking hilarious.
Really original, unique stylists,

930
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,970
real storyteller. He does good, you
know? And then he brings me up and then,

931
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,480
you know,
I'm getting laughs.

932
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:46,360
There's only like 30 or 40 people
in the or and it's going fine.

933
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,710
There's an old couple up front,

934
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,680
the Oh maybe in their mid
fifties early sixties and they,

935
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,620
if someone talked to him and
they asked him about religion,

936
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,140
I think Neal Brennan did. They said
they were Jews. I'm like, fine.

937
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:57,820
So I'm doing my show and
they're not laughing at nothing.

938
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:02,020
And I looked at them and I said,
uh, I'm sorry, my two filthy.

939
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:04,810
You want me to talk some political
stuff, you know, is, is that what it is?

940
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,400
And then the old man looks at me, he
goes, you're not funny. Yeah. And I,

941
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:12,760
and I just had this moment where I'm like,
all right, dude, all right. And I said,

942
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,800
you know what? I am
funny. I know I'm funny.

943
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:18,310
I'm doing well with the rest
of the audience. All right.
And, and I, and, and I,

944
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,400
I understand what you're saying.
And uh,

945
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:24,130
and then like for some reason
I just looked at him, I said,

946
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:27,880
but the fact that that's what you had
to pull out of your guts to say to me in

947
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:32,070
this situation makes me fucking hate you.
And,

948
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,590
and, and the Syrup punchline there,
mark, now you lose the rest of the crowd.

949
00:57:37,591 --> 00:57:40,150
It's right there. Just quiet in a room.
And I'm like, what? That wasn't funny.

950
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,240
What did I say? Did Not come out funny?
Now you turn on the rest of them.

951
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,130
All right. Then I turned on the rest of
them. And then, uh, and then he goes,

952
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,860
you know, you asked and I said, well,
you could've qualified it. Like,

953
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:52,690
how about you're not funny to me.

954
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,440
All of a sudden you're the god of this
fucking room. You're the Almighty.

955
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,820
You're the one that has the last
word. Fuck that. Right. And so that,

956
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,670
and then like you were in a bad mood
before you got there because you really

957
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:04,540
don't, because I've got to say the
read of this guy saying are not funny.

958
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:07,540
Sounds to me like you said some
shit that he didn't want to hear.

959
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,630
It was more of a subject thing. Not,
not, no, I just, it was a general thing.

960
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:12,070
So then I,
and the rest of the act,

961
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:14,590
I'm doing my act and everyone's
laughing every time everyone else will.

962
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,470
After I looked at him and I went,
Huh, Huh. And then like, you know,

963
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,900
at the end of my set and bringing
up Brenda's is easy and he,

964
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,590
he stands up with his wife and they
walk out at, while I'm still on stage,

965
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:27,700
bring it up Steve. And like a very
powerful statement. Very powerful.

966
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:32,980
I'll see you later, dad. Ah,
Jesus, mark. Cause that's what
I said to him. I said, hey,

967
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:35,830
now you know, it's like every fucking
Jewish guy that has that kind of judgment.

968
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:38,500
That's your rage. It's just some
surrogate for my father. And I understand.

969
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:41,290
I'm translate.
I'm transposing some contempt under you,

970
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,820
but you could have fucking
shows a different way. All
right. All right. Anyway,

971
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:47,620
Mark Marin here on Monday morning
park. But that's not funny. No, no, no,

972
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:50,560
I'm just letting people know I'm
acting northern. I that just did there.

973
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,620
I acted like this was a live show. I
like it. Like we'll take some color,

974
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,630
like when it takes him. We're actually
doing this on Easter Sunday and I,

975
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:01,180
uh, mark asked me what I want to do and
I said, I will do it Sunday. And you go,

976
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:05,230
you do realize it's Easter. And I was
like, yeah, I'm really not into that shit.

977
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,900
But I actually went to church
this morning with my, uh,

978
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:10,090
with my girlfriend and her and
her mom because her mom goes,

979
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:14,710
so I went with her and a dude. You
should've heard the homily. Yeah.

980
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,970
That guy was up there.

981
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,850
The homily is basically after they tell
one of those you're Jewish, right? Yeah.

982
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,360
Yeah. So after they tell like the
little Jesus, diddy, yeah, they have,

983
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,490
they have like an opener.
Yeah.

984
00:59:23,491 --> 00:59:26,240
It tells a couple of little ones than
the pre springs at home. You know,

985
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,500
it's all dressed up. The headliner come
Catholic. A Catholic. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

986
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,310
The whole thing.
Deaf kids looking confused outside.

987
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,440
How is anyone any adhere to that
religion after this? You can,

988
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,020
I even told, I even was talking
to some, some older people,

989
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:44,300
they were saying the same thing. Like
when the collection thing went around,

990
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,180
I wanted to give money for the
fucking car wash or whatever.

991
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:48,500
But I'm thinking like,
yeah,

992
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,740
but isn't this going to go towards a
defense attorney for somebody who did all

993
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:55,540
the fucking deaf kid? I'm not giving
you any more money. Sort that out first.

994
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,220
And now it's like,
it's not an American thing.

995
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,130
It's also in Europe and in the
numbers and this has been going on for

996
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,890
generations. It's almost like it
was a contest with these guys.

997
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,990
Does it count if you do the same kid
twice? Yeah. Do you want to be a cardinal?

998
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,780
You've got to digital at least fucking
three. I have a theory about it.

999
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:15,320
I think I know why there's so many gay,
uh,

1000
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,970
or pedophile priests because I think that
these communities going back, you know,

1001
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,480
hundreds of years,
certainly in this country,

1002
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:25,280
and I imagine other countries that when
a mother or a community saw that one of

1003
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:28,570
their male kids was going the way of the,
the cock,

1004
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,030
then they started to pick up that they
were feminine. I mean the, you know,

1005
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:36,050
communities are gay thing just,
no, no, no, no, no. Wait, let
me go this way. All right.

1006
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,890
I know what you know. What I'm saying
is that when they saw that happening,

1007
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,080
they muscled these kids into the
priesthood. They said that as,

1008
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:46,520
as opposed to live a life of sin as
a homosexual, probably go that way.

1009
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,300
Let's push them towards the priesthood.
Now the,

1010
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,280
and I'm not saying this will offset
the Dick Sucking. That's right.

1011
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,960
And I think what happens,
it'll be safe,

1012
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:57,490
but they couldn't do that in the
priesthood. So I think a lot of them, uh,

1013
01:00:57,491 --> 01:00:59,600
you know, I'm not saying that
they're, they're homosexuals.

1014
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:00,800
I know that they're pedophiles,

1015
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,100
but I think that the guilt compounded
with the idea that they may have been

1016
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:08,390
homosexual and then that actually made
them more evil cause then they would prey

1017
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:12,170
upon these kids that couldn't say
anything that they could terrify and

1018
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:14,880
completely control with this
horrendous urge they have.

1019
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,400
I gotta be honest with you. I have no idea
because it fascinates me because like,

1020
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,650
um, I think cause a lot of people
out there, they confuse, uh,

1021
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:28,280
it being gay with being a pedophile
because it is a guy and a boy,

1022
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:31,730
you know what I mean? So that's completely
different yet because it's like,

1023
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:32,960
all right,
you know,

1024
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:37,670
you could stick me and in that place and
say that I can't hook up with anybody.

1025
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:42,410
Yeah. And, uh, I'm still not going to
fuck a little girl. You know what I mean?

1026
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,980
But I had a file,
but I think that that's absolutely true.

1027
01:01:45,981 --> 01:01:49,280
But I'm saying that I bet you a lot
of them were probably on the, on the,

1028
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,840
on the Troy,
on the train.

1029
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,250
If they weren't abused by
priests themselves on the train.

1030
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:58,430
That's the thing about those guys is what
they've 16,000 it's like not only you

1031
01:01:58,431 --> 01:02:00,500
ruined, you ruin someone's
life. The second you do that,

1032
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:03,800
that childhood is fucking over. You ruined
them. You blow a hole in their soul,

1033
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,480
it's over.
And then this is the thing.

1034
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:09,620
And then they go on to have kids and
even if even if they don't do anything to

1035
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:12,530
them, it's just, it's attach
them. You generations.

1036
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,190
Anytime you're talking 16,000 people
like that old prowl commercial,

1037
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,830
they have five kids, they have five kids
here. They're all affected by that. Oh,

1038
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,190
and you know what?

1039
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,890
That troubled in loss of
their more candidates for the,
for, for the church. Yeah.

1040
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:27,810
They, they become comedians. That's right.

1041
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:32,540
They're actually creating new loss to
people in hopes that they will come back

1042
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:36,530
to the Catholic church. Yeah.
So I think this, this priest,
because it was mandated,

1043
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:40,190
all of that shit was kind of
opened this week. This priest,

1044
01:02:40,191 --> 01:02:41,780
I guess this guy is kind of
like, he's like the, the,

1045
01:02:41,781 --> 01:02:43,100
the instead of the comic's comic,

1046
01:02:43,101 --> 01:02:47,300
this guy's like the priest priests like
the back of the room to the deacons in

1047
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:51,710
the back. This guys great lets the Guy
Great, you know, but he um, he like,

1048
01:02:51,711 --> 01:02:54,500
he's actually admitted that he actually
thought about leaving the priesthood for

1049
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:57,320
awhile. He's actually, he didn't say why,

1050
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:01,450
but today during his homily when
he's surmising the Jesus story,

1051
01:03:01,451 --> 01:03:05,740
he said something, he goes, you know, um,
a lot of people look at this religion,

1052
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:08,950
you know, look at our religion like
we do. We say the, uh, the, the,

1053
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:12,580
the wafer is the body of Christ and the
wine is his blood and they think that's

1054
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:13,270
nonsense.

1055
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:16,870
A lot of people think that because we
think that Jesus dwells in all of us,

1056
01:03:16,871 --> 01:03:18,310
that that's nonsense.
And he kept going,

1057
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:22,450
just kept talking about major cornerstones
that are religion and people thinking

1058
01:03:22,451 --> 01:03:24,250
was nonsense. And I was
sitting there going, oh my God,

1059
01:03:24,251 --> 01:03:27,790
this is like the fucking Domino's pizza
moment where they finally admit that

1060
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:31,030
their pizza sucks. Remember that whole
like, dude, what happened? Fucked up.

1061
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,500
We're not recording. No, we are
recording, but I thought, I think,

1062
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:41,200
see this is why we should have used to
me one. Okay. We're okay. We're okay.

1063
01:03:41,201 --> 01:03:44,650
We're okay. Yeah. There was a little jump
there. I apologize. I think we're okay.

1064
01:03:44,651 --> 01:03:46,420
I thought it had the metric.
We freaked on me.

1065
01:03:46,421 --> 01:03:49,990
We just actually literally for the first
time and the two and a half years of

1066
01:03:49,991 --> 01:03:53,840
the Monday morning podcast, it came.
It's stopped. It never stopped.

1067
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,800
It's alive. God damn show. I just wanted
to make sure that wasn't it. Oh he, yeah.

1068
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:03,280
He thought he thought the metronome was
on. That would be bad. My bad. My bad.

1069
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,580
I just don't. So he was basically
Christ and he's sitting there.

1070
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:08,610
He's having like the Domino's pizza mom,
you know where they,

1071
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,740
they admit that that pizza sucked after
all these years and then they still try

1072
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:13,840
to put out a fucking large
pizza for five bucks.

1073
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,490
What do you think is going
to taste like idiots.

1074
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:19,600
But he somehow spun it around where
uh, it was, it was the clothes.

1075
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,660
You know what he's doing?
He's actually telling the truth,

1076
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:26,910
the way he can tell the truth without
having it be a national scandal.

1077
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:30,360
Just going, I can't explain the way
he did the guy, he's fucking good.

1078
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:34,690
I got a minute. I got admitted. David tell
was a priest. Yeah, this guy, he got ya.

1079
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:39,120
I was like, this guy, this guy is good.
Look, and I got into it this year,

1080
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:41,770
this week with like, I used to
do this, this, this section on,

1081
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:46,771
on the podcast called old g h and I
would talk about a religion and you know,

1082
01:04:47,271 --> 01:04:50,360
for the most part, you know, I was
saying that they, they, ah, I don't know,

1083
01:04:50,361 --> 01:04:51,230
I can't even get into it.

1084
01:04:51,231 --> 01:04:54,280
But every once in a while people listened
to the old podcast where I was kind of

1085
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,950
trashed and organized religion and they
come at me and they drive me fucking

1086
01:04:57,951 --> 01:05:02,630
nuts because they just
make grand statements.

1087
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,180
Like he, like, like I said,
you know, I went like,

1088
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:07,820
I went to church for the first time, 15
years, like a month, like two months ago.

1089
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:11,210
Right. And when I went it was like,
I didn't like what they were saying,

1090
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:12,380
but there was a feeling I had,

1091
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:15,650
I liked the sense of community and
then what they do is they go, yeah,

1092
01:05:15,651 --> 01:05:18,840
that feeling you were feeling how
was, yeah, they always got the date,

1093
01:05:18,841 --> 01:05:20,400
like they own that fucking feeling.

1094
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,220
So then I'm sitting there going like
talking about their fucking stories that

1095
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:26,620
don't even make sense. Adam and eve
forget about how, you know, their,

1096
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:29,730
their kids would then have to fuck and
then we'd be all descendants of retarded

1097
01:05:29,731 --> 01:05:33,390
children. Right. They, they, they don't
even address the dinosaurs. I'm like,

1098
01:05:33,391 --> 01:05:36,390
what about the dinosaurs and all that?
Never addressed that. They always just,

1099
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,040
they never opened the
emails back and forth.

1100
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,990
They will never address the
fucking points you make.

1101
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,390
They just spend it all often to others.
It's okay,

1102
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,420
Jesus is waiting for you and all
this type of shit. And it just,

1103
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:50,220
it drives me fucking nuts. Like, and
then I, I show them were science,

1104
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:51,840
like this is what I can't stand.

1105
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,980
They'll attack scientist and say what
they're saying is wrong until they can't

1106
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,220
fucking deny it anymore.
Like the fact that the,

1107
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:00,840
that the sun doesn't go
around the earth and after,

1108
01:06:00,841 --> 01:06:02,670
if they've tortured and
killed fucking people,

1109
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:06,040
then what they do is then they embrace
it and then they act like it's theirs.

1110
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,840
And then they're like, well, who made the
scientist? Jesus made the same teacher.

1111
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:10,780
And it's like,

1112
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:14,110
it's just a spin thing and they just
hold on to their beliefs until it becomes

1113
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:17,080
irrefutable. And then they sort, it's sort
of like those people like, well, how I,

1114
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,840
what I always thought was
fascinating is that these colts,

1115
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,741
you remember years ago,

1116
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:23,380
there was more of them where you'd have
this cult where the leader would say,

1117
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:27,700
the world is going to end on
this date to tomorrow's the day.

1118
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:32,200
And they get these, these, these followers
frothing that and like ready, prepared.

1119
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:34,390
They're underground, they're
in bunkers, they're gonna go,

1120
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:38,590
they're all strapped in and then the
day comes and it passes and it doesn't

1121
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:42,460
happen. I would love to be at that sermon
because then it's sort of like, well,

1122
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:44,590
you know,
it doesn't mean it's not going to happen.

1123
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:47,880
And now that we've got all
this underground infrastructure
that's right here,

1124
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,210
let's start a mushroom farm.
Let's use this. Yeah. Now
that we're in the basement,

1125
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,360
I just don't understand how they re read,
bought. Tell you why. Because you've got,

1126
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:58,870
people are so fucking stupid. They're
stupid. That's true. That that, yeah,

1127
01:06:58,871 --> 01:07:02,200
you got it. But you're seeing
that now even outside of
religion, even in politics,

1128
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:05,710
that because there's so much information
out there, people, here's what,

1129
01:07:05,711 --> 01:07:09,190
here's what really fascinates me is they
will believe what they believe and you

1130
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,860
can't shake their beliefs
even with facts because now,

1131
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,830
because there's so much information
because the internet, they can just go,

1132
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,190
well that's your version. That's,
that's the spin. The truth.

1133
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:22,330
The facts are the spin and that they,
you know, that you can believe that,

1134
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:22,940
but you're wrong.

1135
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:26,050
No, do it. It drives me,
it drives me nuts in it.

1136
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:29,580
And then they'll just like at one
point, uh, I want to go and like,

1137
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:32,840
and like you guys have persecuted
science. Like basically my, my,

1138
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:37,280
my theory is that science is religion
for intelligent people forward thinking

1139
01:07:37,281 --> 01:07:42,281
people and religion is science for morons
because whatever they can explain they

1140
01:07:42,381 --> 01:07:46,190
just invent fucking bushes talking to
people and albatrosses or whatever the

1141
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:49,790
fuck they have conspiracy theories
and this is what they ended up saying.

1142
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:51,050
She ends up riding back.

1143
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:54,920
Well actually science has proven the
Bible correct over and over again.

1144
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:59,150
So I'm like, okay, what's the, where's
the followup statement to support that?

1145
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:02,600
Nothing. Yeah, there's nothing.
Yeah, there's nothing, there's no,

1146
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:06,530
no followup statement whatsoever. All
they do is they just, they, they, they,

1147
01:08:06,531 --> 01:08:10,700
they like I can actually sit here and
prove to you that the fucking earth goes

1148
01:08:10,701 --> 01:08:13,730
around the sun because of scientists.
I'm too fucking stupid approval,

1149
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:16,130
but it actually on makes sense.

1150
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,000
None of this shit can
be proven on paper and,

1151
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:22,760
and then when you show stuff that can
be proven on paper that disproves their

1152
01:08:22,761 --> 01:08:26,270
shit, then they do that. She'll,
well, God created the scientist.

1153
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:30,830
He created the paper that they
wrote it. Yeah. I actually find,

1154
01:08:30,831 --> 01:08:34,010
I tapped out in that moment. I was like,
you know what? I get it now. You, you,

1155
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:37,850
no matter what I say are going to believe
what you're going to say and I'm never

1156
01:08:37,851 --> 01:08:41,120
going to convince you that's right
of the way that I think so fuck it.

1157
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,420
So I'm done with it.
But we also,

1158
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:45,130
funny thing, I'm done with it yet
you can't, you can't go to it.

1159
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,730
There's no reason to go to war with those
people because belief is impenetrable

1160
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:50,140
no matter how delusional they are.

1161
01:08:50,141 --> 01:08:53,800
It's based in complete ignorance and it's
something, it's something outside of,

1162
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:54,880
of intelligence.

1163
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,670
Yeah. But this is what I don't care,
cause I bought into it when I was a kid.

1164
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,370
We were scared and I was,

1165
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:02,520
I was listening to us scared and
then also thinking like, all right,

1166
01:09:02,521 --> 01:09:05,230
and some of this is good. It was like
my fucking house. It was like my life.

1167
01:09:05,231 --> 01:09:07,030
Someone who was good,
someone was bad at.

1168
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:10,210
But then he's just got to
a point where it's like,

1169
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,250
this shit doesn't make sense and it's so
loud in your head you can't ignore it.

1170
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:17,080
And I don't understand.
I,

1171
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,480
well that's because that's a
real fucking arrogant statement.

1172
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:20,530
I'm going to say only.
Yeah,

1173
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:25,110
you got to be a moron to just continue to,
uh,

1174
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,550
to, to, to block it out.

1175
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,610
That's the difference between free
thinking and thinking based in fear. You,

1176
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,720
you know, cause like the way it
works in my mind is what? Look,

1177
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:38,860
the world is a scary place.
Everything is, is serendipitous.

1178
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,780
Who the hell knows when you're
going to get hit by a truck?

1179
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,630
Who knows when the earth is going to
fall into the sea or start shaking?

1180
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,640
No one knows anything.
There's very little,

1181
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:49,550
there's very few things we have control
over in our wife. Just is, I mean, you,

1182
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:52,560
you know how this, this garage could
slide down the hill at any second.

1183
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:55,030
Who the hell knows very
few things out of our,

1184
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:58,150
are in our control
almost nothing right now,

1185
01:09:58,151 --> 01:10:02,800
depending on how frightening that is. Even
if you understand everything in, in, uh,

1186
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:04,960
uh, you know, proportionately,
like, you know, the,

1187
01:10:04,961 --> 01:10:06,910
the possibility of this
happening versus that having,

1188
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:10,560
even if you're scientific
about the, the how, how, how,

1189
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:13,210
how much fate has to do
with our everyday life,

1190
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:17,490
that is not completely
comforting. So depending on how
overwhelmed you are, right,

1191
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:18,603
you, I, yeah.

1192
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:23,380
So I believe on some level the need
to believe or feel like you're part of

1193
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:24,790
something bigger than you to,

1194
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:29,380
to sort of justify your existence or
make you feel comfortable in the world is

1195
01:10:29,381 --> 01:10:32,220
probably almost genetic.
I just feel that, that,

1196
01:10:32,221 --> 01:10:34,450
that the way communities function
or whatever, but you know,

1197
01:10:34,451 --> 01:10:37,510
you can make it your community,
you can make it a, your television,

1198
01:10:37,511 --> 01:10:39,550
you can make it sports,
whatever the hell it is.

1199
01:10:39,551 --> 01:10:43,150
There's part of our brain that wants to
be part of a bigger thing in order to

1200
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:44,860
feel that were significant.
Thank you.

1201
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:48,790
Just go in the ground and I'm comfortable
with that because that's a whole

1202
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,620
different thing,
right?

1203
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:53,530
But I'm just talking about the
need to believe now you know what,

1204
01:10:53,531 --> 01:10:56,710
you're gonna be able to grow
unbelievable potatoes. That's fine.

1205
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,630
It's my Irish DNA in the soil.
But I think that the people that,

1206
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,410
whose lives are so fucking miserable
that they can't even fathom post us happy

1207
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:08,530
go lucky son's, we got a lot
to be grateful for it. We do.

1208
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:12,010
It doesn't mean we appreciate it. That's
true. That's true. But, but, but there,

1209
01:11:12,011 --> 01:11:14,300
I think there's some people
that handle it and, and the,

1210
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,730
the idea of having to them,
which I agree with you is ridiculous and,

1211
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,570
and frankly boring. I mean the idea
that we live forever, I, you know,

1212
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,060
I can barely get through this
one. Right. And, and, and the,

1213
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:28,190
and the idea of that and the idea that
like it's going to be better because of

1214
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,840
boredom. Oh my God, that
doesn't even make sense.

1215
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:35,040
Like if it's absolute
fucking euphoria forever,

1216
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,700
it would get boring. Oh my God, they
will get boring. And that's like,

1217
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:39,481
at some point you'd be like,

1218
01:11:39,481 --> 01:11:41,760
can I get a day pass the hell I
want to fucking have a good time.

1219
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:44,700
They'd be the hell would be like Vegas
and having a tail. What are you going?

1220
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,440
I'm going to hell for three weeks.

1221
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:50,130
You've got some time off from this
tedious fucking happy bullshit.

1222
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,380
I want to be able to feel happiness again,

1223
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,310
like me on fire for fucking three weeks,
so I can appreciate that it go.

1224
01:11:56,311 --> 01:12:00,360
Have you been to the fifth ring? Awesome.
Awesome. It great. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1225
01:12:00,361 --> 01:12:04,740
We went there. The wife and
I went, it was tremendous.

1226
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:07,060
They had great performance.
You'll all the comics went to hell.

1227
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:10,230
So they're all there. You got to go
to the fifth ring. It's tremendous.

1228
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:14,160
Great shows. Great. Surely the heck, not
even the hacks. You can see Houdini there.

1229
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:17,080
It's amazing. Through speaking
of that Shit, you know, I did a,

1230
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,490
like I did a theater, uh, what was it,

1231
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:22,470
the San Jose Improv recently and uh,

1232
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,080
he allegedly performed there
and all these guys, it was fun.

1233
01:12:25,081 --> 01:12:27,280
It was a classic old theater that had,

1234
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,450
had gone through that a hundred years
of history of like the most beautiful

1235
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:31,051
thing ever.

1236
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:35,070
And people flocked and an opulent place
and then slowly deteriorated to like a

1237
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,680
porn porno movies.
People jerking off.

1238
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:41,910
Somebody like Jackie Onassis
put some money together and
they fucking revive its,

1239
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:45,630
got a colorful history of corruption
and filth. Oh yeah. Great. Absolutely.

1240
01:12:45,631 --> 01:12:49,820
Absolutely. Just like show business
should, yeah. So I went to, I did the, uh,

1241
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:55,110
the Gibson amphitheatre last night for
the Kevin and being show a radio show it

1242
01:12:55,111 --> 01:12:57,810
of this cancer. But I remember
when a bean was in, uh,

1243
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,770
what was the name of the comedy team?
Steven Bean.

1244
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,440
Christina Zito and being from Boston,
is that right?

1245
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:09,770
Fuck you did not even know
that. Yeah. Chris bean or Steve.

1246
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:13,830
I always heard about her. Yeah. Those guys
used to kill. That's that. That's them.

1247
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:18,000
Okay. Ju Ju Ju Ju Ju Ju
they used to open with Ima,

1248
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:21,180
Judah [inaudible] today he's a Waba.
Yeah.

1249
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:28,080
That was either being, yeah,
that was a fucking eighties,
man. That was before, uh,

1250
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:30,290
when, when, when, when
did you start? Well,

1251
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:33,180
getting back to me after
I did the team thing,

1252
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:37,230
I was more thinking how to Waapa Dude
Wapa do would actually get a laugh. Well,

1253
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:38,700
no, no. I might ignore
it to think that shit.

1254
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:39,930
We were talking about
the up the other night,

1255
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:41,790
we were looking at a particular
comedian going, you know what,

1256
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:42,740
if this is a fucking eighties,

1257
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,690
this guy would be famous by now because
it just seemed everybody back then is

1258
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:49,800
completely subjective. If,
if, if you have, like if you
had any sort of a character,

1259
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,950
the glasses you're wearing,
if you always wore those on stage,

1260
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:56,400
if you did back then three evening
at the Improv classes. Yeah,

1261
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,950
but you can't even get a pair of
glasses. It doesn't look like this. Now,

1262
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,770
believe me, I don't want to surrender
to the horn rims, but you really,

1263
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:05,550
you really have to struggle and fight
to find something different. Right now,

1264
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:08,340
buddy Holly's there. They're everywhere.
I mean, some version of them.

1265
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:11,110
I used to wear round glasses member and a,
and I,

1266
01:14:11,111 --> 01:14:14,550
I can find out what's funny about you.
Yeah. You got that whole rock star looks.

1267
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:17,120
So when you were the round ones, you
had the John Lennon look, and now,

1268
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,880
now you're looking a little a buddy
Holly and the crickets. That's all right.

1269
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:24,120
I'd rather be a Peggy shoe then. Uh,
then, uh, no, that's not true. They're,

1270
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:26,920
they're both good. I'm not going to
take anything away from John Lennon,

1271
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,360
but speaking of the eighties,

1272
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,370
it's just quickly cause I
feel like I left it hanging.

1273
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,470
Is that after I did the team thing,
you know,

1274
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:35,450
he graduated and went on to direct
Adam Sandler movies. I, you know,

1275
01:14:35,451 --> 01:14:39,880
I wrote a whatever it
Steve Brill did. Um, but I,

1276
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:43,270
I stayed in Boston and I started on
my own. I started to play it again,

1277
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:46,450
Sam's and the basement doing open mics,
but Kenny Rogers and everybody else.

1278
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:49,570
My last year of college I was doing
open mics that summer and I drank myself

1279
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:52,340
almost to death and was
waiting all night long.

1280
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:56,200
Have those stories when you bring up
Kenny? Yeah. Well I, I mean not with him,

1281
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,690
but I used to just wait. You hit back
then you had to wait to go on to,

1282
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:01,480
everyone else was done for three people.
I couldn't take it.

1283
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,760
And then when I graduated college,
I moved to Hollywood.

1284
01:15:03,761 --> 01:15:05,140
I became a doorman at the comedy store.

1285
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:08,260
I was there for a year and then I hit
the wall and drugs and I went back to

1286
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:11,070
Boston. Started over catch. Well wait a
minute, slow down here. Let's do this.

1287
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,210
Do the behind the music here.
Mark Marin.

1288
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,880
A lot of people know that story already
know you don't want to put it out there

1289
01:15:15,881 --> 01:15:17,250
again. Oh no I don't care. But I,

1290
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:21,250
I mean the people who know me know why I
came out to after I graduated college I

1291
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:24,640
already had a pretty good uh, coke
monkey on my back. So I drove out here.

1292
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,510
I moved in, I was in Culver city living
with Steve. Just out of curiosity,

1293
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:32,890
did you start before the ad campaign?
Uh, cocaine, the big lie. Oh of course.

1294
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:36,530
I started, I, I started when
the ad campaign was a coke.
It's good for you. Yeah.

1295
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,300
Yeah. It was no more addictive
than a caffeine. Good
Times. We were all doing it.

1296
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:43,570
So I come out here and I can
move into a place in Culver city.

1297
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:44,560
Would Steve Brill that guy?

1298
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:47,010
We wrote a screenplay and then I never
wanted to talk to them again cause we're

1299
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:51,730
is unbearable. And then, uh, I auditioned
at the store. Uh, it, uh, you know, to,

1300
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:54,940
to see if I could start doing
comedy and Mitzi, you're funny,

1301
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:57,190
you can be a doorman. So, uh,

1302
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:02,310
so I immediately moved into Crest
Hill and I was a doorman in 1987.

1303
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:07,430
Uh, you know, when Kennison was, uh, was
just starting to come to break. And I met,

1304
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:12,690
I met Carl and Carl was Sam's best
friend and he, uh, Carl, yeah,

1305
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:15,310
he gave me a watch and said, you're
good people. When Sam comes back,

1306
01:16:15,311 --> 01:16:19,390
I want you to meet him and you don't
know the story. No, I'd tell it to you.

1307
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,410
So a fly through it, I can tell you
sick of tell them no, no, I'm not,

1308
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:24,280
I haven't done it that much.

1309
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:26,340
And certainly people on your
podcast might not know it.

1310
01:16:26,341 --> 01:16:27,880
The people that don't
listen to both of ours,

1311
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,690
but they know if they know
Sam Kennison favorites.

1312
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,990
This is a selfish fucking moment. I
want to, I'll tell you what, Harry,

1313
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,790
it's a great story. All right.
Uh, so like I, you know,

1314
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:39,370
I didn't really know that much
about Canada and when I got there,

1315
01:16:39,371 --> 01:16:42,610
I'd seen him once or twice, but I had
really dismissed him as this novelty act,

1316
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:45,670
you know, this screaming guy and I,
I wasn't here nor there with them.

1317
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:48,130
So when Carl said,
I'll meet an introduce you to Sam,

1318
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:50,890
I didn't know what that meant.
So Sam comes in,

1319
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:54,010
you know Carlos like does that guy that's
talking to you, he's talking about,

1320
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:56,690
he's the new head Doorman and San
Jose Guy, the doorman. So you're,

1321
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,920
you're a new guy, you know, am I?
Yeah, yeah. And he's like, Hey,

1322
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:02,680
we should hang out and talk.
And I'm like, all right, so,

1323
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,890
so I'm living in Crest Hill, so
he knows that place too. Right.

1324
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:08,920
So the first night I ever hang out
with Sam Kennison, he, you know,

1325
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,600
he comes up to Cresto,
which is that house Mitzi used to own.

1326
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,110
And I'm standing there,
you and guys,

1327
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,740
she used to live there a lot of pieces
so that, yeah, that's that classic house.

1328
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:19,340
Just to tell my listeners, know when
comics, like you would move out to La,

1329
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:22,250
if Mitzi tapped you on the
shoulder and knighted you,

1330
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:25,340
you then moved into this house where
you had to pay rent and also drive the

1331
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:28,100
fucking jeep and take me, go get
her chicken. Totally. Totally.

1332
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:31,180
But like the amount of Comedians who
lived there? Oh yeah. Dice with their,

1333
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:32,570
the Todd was there to mio,

1334
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,750
this was the tricky thing to
[inaudible] who used to date?

1335
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,790
Sam was the Japanese comic.
I don't know what happened to her,

1336
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:41,630
but she lived upstairs. You know,
I lived in dices old room. Uh,

1337
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:44,860
Todd wasn't moved in yet.
I'm trying to think of who Todd lemme,

1338
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,960
she w w later went on to have,

1339
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,190
he used to call himself that Todd and
he eventually had some sort of aneurysm

1340
01:17:50,191 --> 01:17:53,480
and, and you know, showed up at the club
saying, you know, years after Sam died,

1341
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:55,910
say in Tim's, come in and you
know, he was sent to Florida Bay.

1342
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:59,570
But if that's a Shubert lived there
for awhile, the places evil. Yeah.

1343
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:03,680
Oh definitely. Definitely.
So, so what happens is I'm
living up there and, and uh,

1344
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,720
and Sam says, you know, let's
go up to the house, you know,

1345
01:18:05,721 --> 01:18:08,810
and this is the way it worked
back then as Monday night, uh,

1346
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:13,040
in the late eighties was no cover
night and all the rooms were free.

1347
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,120
So all the freaks from Hollywood and
everywhere came to the store on Monday

1348
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,310
night. And that was Sam's night.
He would show up at about 1130,

1349
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:22,460
12 o'clock on a Monday,
take over the stage and the main room,

1350
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:25,640
which was just filled with rock
and roll drug freaks and just say,

1351
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:29,420
this is like hair, metal, hair metal,
but all different kinds of hair metal.

1352
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:32,000
The end of, towards the end of the
hair metal. Yeah. So like, you know,

1353
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:35,120
the people that would come to the club
where it was pretty spectacular, you know,

1354
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:38,090
and I was a doorman and at that time that
people you'd see on stage where people

1355
01:18:38,091 --> 01:18:43,091
like dice Damon Wayans Kennison prior
was still coming by occasionally.

1356
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:48,230
Riced um, you know, so I was just,

1357
01:18:48,231 --> 01:18:51,650
I just entered this world, right?
So Sam says, let's hang out.

1358
01:18:51,651 --> 01:18:53,930
So we go up to the house,
it's just me and Sam were doing coke.

1359
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:57,590
He pulls out all this coke and we're
just sitting there and he's like, sure,

1360
01:18:57,591 --> 01:19:01,790
you're the new guy, you know? And he's
looking right in my face. He's like, look,

1361
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:04,280
me in the eyes mayor, and a lack of men
who can look me in the eyes. And I'm like,

1362
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,320
Holy Shit. All right, I'm looking right.

1363
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:09,770
So we're sitting there doing coke
and I thought I was Mr Rock and roll.

1364
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:13,670
I can handle coke. So I'm doing coke with
Sam and he's laying out the the world,

1365
01:19:13,671 --> 01:19:16,880
you know, as Sam, you know,
Deq. And the thing, I cannot
tell you how it works here.

1366
01:19:16,881 --> 01:19:20,300
Who mayor and you know, and then like,
you know, I didn't know where he goes,

1367
01:19:20,301 --> 01:19:23,390
Hey Marin, you ever, you ever burned
money? And I'm like, no. And he's like,

1368
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,440
let's burn some money.

1369
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,160
So Sam pulls out these hundred dollar
bills and we start burning money at Sam's.

1370
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:30,740
I'm figuring, fuck, fuck yeah.
Okay, what's burden? Some money.

1371
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,130
So we're sitting there burning money and
we're getting fucked up and it's about

1372
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:38,420
three 34 in the morning and you were at
a coke and Sam's wasted and I'm kind of

1373
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,570
wasting, he's like, we need
more money to no he, yeah,

1374
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:44,530
he shouldn't have done that to me cause
I called that back later and he wasn't

1375
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:47,560
at that happy about it. I mean I
made them do it like the way this,

1376
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,840
I'll tell you what happens is the first
night, so he's like, we're at a coke,

1377
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:51,760
let's go get some more coke. And
I'm like, all right, I don't,

1378
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,930
I don't know where we're going.
So we get in my car,

1379
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,750
I'm driving like pretty much one of
the biggest stars in comedy through the

1380
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:59,900
Hollywood hills at like three
30 in the fucking morning.

1381
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:03,470
He's half passed out in my car like, and
I'm driving like, where are we going?

1382
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:06,980
Where are we going? He like, he like wakes
up and he goes, I don't even know you.

1383
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:09,540
You could kill me. And I'm
like, where are we going dude?

1384
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,280
So we ended up at this guy's house.

1385
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:15,120
Now at this point is he stopped being Sam
Kennison and it's become some annoying

1386
01:20:15,121 --> 01:20:16,680
guy that you're partying with.
No,

1387
01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:19,830
he is still really good at
staying in say still Sam. Okay.

1388
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:23,250
Even when he was like swappy,
you know when it got pathetic,

1389
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:27,300
he still held on to that thing and it was
always sort of men and Sam were burned

1390
01:20:27,301 --> 01:20:30,070
money. Dude, I, I started too
fucking late in this business. I so,

1391
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,910
so we fund was gone so we'd
get to this guy's house,

1392
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:37,980
this guy who as as time went on, I real,
I grew to know was a hairdresser by day,

1393
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,620
but with Sam's coke dealer
at the time and it's out on,

1394
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:43,110
that was done on crescent heights,
wasn't that far from the store.

1395
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:46,530
So we knock on this door, this guy
shows up at the door in his bathrobe,

1396
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:48,780
clearly woke him up from sweeping.
I got Sam there. He's like,

1397
01:20:48,781 --> 01:20:53,340
we need some coke and we barrel into
this guy's house and we're in this guy's

1398
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:56,880
bedroom and Sam just sits on the floor and
crashes on the floor. He goes, got any,

1399
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:59,670
you got any booze? And,
and this guy was like,

1400
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:01,440
I just got these miniatures
I got on the plane.

1401
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,040
So now Sam is sitting there with these
like smear enough bottles of vodka,

1402
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:07,640
drinking the smeared out.
If you look like a giant,

1403
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:10,840
like he should have been surrounded
by into the rock and roll people going

1404
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,050
and then like, you know, he passes
out in this guy's floor and you know,

1405
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,990
the guy gives me the coke,
you know,

1406
01:21:18,991 --> 01:21:21,090
I ended up paying for it
and then I go out there,

1407
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:25,110
an Asian guy throwing fire fireworks.
It should have been, it should have.

1408
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:28,080
So I'm like, well I don't know what the
hell to tell you I'm going to take off.

1409
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:30,420
I guess he'll deal with him. He's like,
dude, you're not fucking leaving him here.

1410
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:34,500
I don't want him to pull a Belushi on me.
And I'm like, what? And I'm like, Oh fuck.

1411
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,520
So now I've got to get him up and walked
him out and throw them in the car and

1412
01:21:38,521 --> 01:21:40,620
he was big and I get
them back to the house.

1413
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:42,560
We go in and he doesn't even do the coke.

1414
01:21:42,561 --> 01:21:44,610
He ends up crawling on the
floor in the living room,

1415
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:46,320
just laying on the floor and passing out,

1416
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:50,460
which is something he did a lot because
that house became the party houses.

1417
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:54,000
He draped in the scarves and
12 fucking head wraps. Not yet.

1418
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:57,270
I mean this is early Sam. So it was still
just a trench coat and the cap dude,

1419
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,970
this is not, this is pre
rock and roll. Sam. He's,

1420
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,530
I don't have any story that can
match this. The falling out was,

1421
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:08,970
was the better story. I mean cause like
that year, well how does that night,

1422
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:11,880
and he just passes out. You pass this out
and then, you know, he wakes up and then,

1423
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:13,410
you know, we'd, we'd build this bond.

1424
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:16,040
I get sucked into the Kennison
entourage and I'm now like, you know,

1425
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:19,550
doing my graduate work and cutting
coke for Sam Kennison. And,

1426
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:23,340
and it was my job at that
point to organize the party.

1427
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:25,200
Like Sam would do this every,
every Monday night.

1428
01:22:25,201 --> 01:22:29,010
It became very taxing because
I knew he was coming in.

1429
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:32,540
What would happen is he'd show up in the
fucking party would start and like he'd

1430
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:33,241
show up at the store,

1431
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:35,970
he'd give me a couple of hundred
bucks and I'd go by all the booze and

1432
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:39,150
cigarettes and mixers and everyone
needed to bring up to the house.

1433
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,620
So I would get into this pattern.

1434
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:42,870
After a while I knew how long
the party could go on for.

1435
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:45,520
It could go on for two or
three days, 15 years. I didn't,

1436
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,760
I had no idea who did
this stuff. Yeah. So like,

1437
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:50,970
so I used to get this shit
so I'd go buy all this booze,

1438
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:54,690
but I know what would happen is that
he'd show up with 20 people and then come

1439
01:22:54,691 --> 01:22:59,450
day two or three. It just be me and Sam
and some freaks like, you know, you know,

1440
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:03,180
it ended up like eight people. So I would
hide the liquor all around the house.

1441
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:06,340
Now you up for the three days.
That hardcore shit.

1442
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,740
How the fuck did you write any jokes?
Well,

1443
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:11,050
I was only working the belly room
and you know, we were all in the,

1444
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:14,650
and we were on in the comedy store at
school in the Sam school where she's like,

1445
01:23:14,651 --> 01:23:14,831
you know,

1446
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:17,680
you lived your life as hard as possible
when he got up there and you fucking did

1447
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:20,750
the work. Well other newer
comedians resent you that you,

1448
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:24,190
you got into the Sam because like
at that time, you know, it was like,

1449
01:23:24,191 --> 01:23:26,330
who the fuck would want to
be in that entourage? Right.

1450
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:30,110
I mean at that time the guy who used
to be Mitsis assistant was like, uh,

1451
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:33,070
you know, he used to call us the
Manson family because you know,

1452
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:36,490
Sam was like this weird charismatic
freak that dwelled in the underworld.

1453
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:39,250
In most of the comics there were, you
know, were sort of like, you know,

1454
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:42,880
just working comics. I mean he was one of
a kind. That's what always blew my mind.

1455
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:46,450
If I could just stop this for just
half a second was where did guys like

1456
01:23:46,451 --> 01:23:50,410
Seinfeld fit in? Cause he was
around during that time. Like,

1457
01:23:50,411 --> 01:23:55,240
I just can't imagine like that universe
where there was like a level of party

1458
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,880
anyway, he would just come in. But he was
singular in that, you know, he, he, he,

1459
01:23:58,881 --> 01:24:01,090
you know, he was, you
know, he celebrated it.

1460
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:04,310
I mean there's a lot of comics as you
known as we all know that had their abuse

1461
01:24:04,311 --> 01:24:05,920
and substance of problems,
but you know,

1462
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:07,600
they would try and hide
it and just do their job.

1463
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,240
There were plenty of hacky comics
that were fucked up on drugs,

1464
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:15,040
but the fact that Sam had to live the
life as the beast, like out of the beast,

1465
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:18,000
he had the honor it.
So he was the first one that the,

1466
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:21,010
that was shameless about it. And then
you'd see all these other comics that you,

1467
01:24:21,011 --> 01:24:24,100
I don't need to drop names, are mentioned
names where they'd come around and,

1468
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,600
you know,
they'd hang out and do some blow,

1469
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:28,030
but they wouldn't want to
be tagged with it. You know,

1470
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:30,700
there was a lot of guys that would hang
out and do coke and be like, you know,

1471
01:24:30,701 --> 01:24:33,640
don't, don't nobody, you know,
I mean I saw a lot of that.

1472
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,890
I mean there are certain people that
would come up and party with us that we

1473
01:24:35,891 --> 01:24:36,880
weren't allowed to do drugs.

1474
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:39,700
Like one time Ted Nugent was hanging
around and saying it was like no drugs

1475
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:40,450
because dad is clean.

1476
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:43,210
So we had to sit there and I'll behave
ourselves for the three hours that Nugent

1477
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,340
sat there and talked
whole wild boar stories.

1478
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,500
Well he used to hold court at this house.

1479
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:50,920
So I go out and stock up the place and
set up the party and then he'd come up

1480
01:24:50,921 --> 01:24:52,480
with all this freaks and then it just,

1481
01:24:52,481 --> 01:24:55,300
a lot of times would end up just me
and him are and two or three people and

1482
01:24:55,301 --> 01:25:00,010
eventually I started to lose my mind
and I wasn't progressing as a comic.

1483
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:01,930
I was losing a lot of weight.
I was sleep deprived.

1484
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:05,440
I was driving poor fuckers to the airport
in Mitsis w when they had to go play

1485
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:06,720
the dunes because that was part of my,

1486
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:10,300
my job to work at the store was
to drive the guys to the airport.

1487
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:13,840
I remember one time I was driving, you
know, Mendoza and camp and era to the,

1488
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:17,620
to the Burbank airport because they had
to go play the comedy store that was at

1489
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:18,640
the dunes at that time.

1490
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:21,250
And I'd been up all night and there
was no gas and I could've killed those

1491
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:25,780
fucking guys. It's Christ. So like, so
what, it ultimately started happening,

1492
01:25:25,781 --> 01:25:28,660
I started losing my mind, you know, you
get to sleep deprived, too much drugs.

1493
01:25:28,661 --> 01:25:31,990
He started to hear voices, hearing voices
in your head and I, you know, and you're,

1494
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:32,980
you're a conspiracy guy.

1495
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:37,510
I had a mystical conspiracy organized
around Sam and Hollywood and how I,

1496
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:40,390
you know, like I used to do this
bit about how like, you know,

1497
01:25:40,391 --> 01:25:43,090
I thought I was special. I didn't think
it was a sickness because you know,

1498
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,540
when you hear voices in your head,
it's never one. It's always many.

1499
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,120
And he spent a lot of time trying to
get them to pick a fucking leader.

1500
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:51,580
You have someone's got something to say,
step to the front of the head.

1501
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:55,230
I need instructions.
So I'm losing my mind and,

1502
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,860
and thank fucking God, you know,
uh, the shit hit the fan. Uh,

1503
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:04,100
ultimately after almost a year of this
living like this, you know, uh, you know,

1504
01:26:04,101 --> 01:26:05,980
Sam had, he, you know,

1505
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:09,710
every week for a year you were
up for three days straight.

1506
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,320
And then once I got out, unless I went
out, well, you know, Tim, now two, three,

1507
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:16,160
two days, but you'd have to take breaks.
I mean, it wasn't, he'd go on the road.

1508
01:26:16,161 --> 01:26:17,900
I mean, it wasn't that
steady, but you know,

1509
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:22,880
it was part of a cycle because even when
he was gone, we were all hopped up and,

1510
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:26,120
uh, like he'd do weird shit, you
know. I mean, the one time, you know,

1511
01:26:26,121 --> 01:26:28,250
there's this chick,
I remember one night at the table,

1512
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:30,230
there was some girl like
sitting at the table,

1513
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:31,370
you never knew who showed up there.

1514
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,410
And I started to get that creepy
feeling like someone's going to die.

1515
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:36,530
And it might be me cause there was just
too much weirdness going on up there.

1516
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,860
And I remember one night like,
um,

1517
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:43,310
some chick was at the table and
she had a bandaged wrist, you know,

1518
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:46,700
and I didn't know when she was all
wasted and like, uh, you know, so I said,

1519
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,820
why is your risk bandage? And she goes,
well I tried to kill myself. And I said,

1520
01:26:49,821 --> 01:26:51,320
well, once you do the
other wrist, and she goes,

1521
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:54,550
cause I didn't want to fuck up my watch.
And I'm like, what? You know, and,

1522
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:57,860
and then she, she goes, I just remember.

1523
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:01,290
So she goes into the other room and
passes out in a couple of hours later or

1524
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:04,520
spark, he comes up to me and goes, I think
Sam pissed on that girl. And I'm like,

1525
01:27:04,521 --> 01:27:06,710
what are you talking about?
And like she was weighing in Todd's,

1526
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:08,240
Ben's there was pissed all over the place.

1527
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:11,840
And Sam at this weird thing
where occasionally he pissed
on things. It was just,

1528
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:15,830
he was weird. So essentially killing my
Sam Kinison all right, go ahead. Well,

1529
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:19,400
here's the, here's the story though. I
like, I didn't know he did the drugs.

1530
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:21,350
I just don't need to know the
peeing. Well, this is the,

1531
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:24,350
this is the punchline of this story and
I apologize if people have heard this

1532
01:27:24,351 --> 01:27:28,970
story, but it is sort of
comedy lore that interests you.

1533
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:33,200
Okay. These to be this guy
that hung around the comedy
store, he was a satanist.

1534
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:37,430
He, his name was Dave London and uh,
I, I should fictionalize his name.

1535
01:27:37,431 --> 01:27:40,200
His name was Dave. I don't
know what, it's too late.

1536
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,660
So this guy had like a Pentagram tech I,

1537
01:27:42,661 --> 01:27:45,140
you said his whole name and then he goes,
I'm going to fictionalize it.

1538
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:48,740
And he just said, just his
real first. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just trying to help out.

1539
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,050
I don't want to hurt anyone's
feelings or get myself in trouble.

1540
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,520
So this guy had a pentagram
tattooed on his heart. He
had six, six, six on his arm.

1541
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:56,460
He had the mark of the
Illuminati on the other arm.

1542
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:59,120
You look at Christopher walk and he was
a dope fiend and he used to hang around

1543
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:01,610
the store and we couldn't get rid of them.
You know how the store is,

1544
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,040
it attracts these fucking people in
there. There, there, there will be,

1545
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:08,350
because there's no, it's just that
open hallway where people, it's also,

1546
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:13,660
it's a psychic drain for fucking dark
weird people. You know, it's a home. They,

1547
01:28:13,661 --> 01:28:17,800
it's for the, for the people who don't
fit in, fit in at the store, you know,

1548
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:20,120
which is why I love it so much.
But this,

1549
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:23,390
you guys used to hang around and Sam hated
him. I don't, I never knew really why.

1550
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,020
So one night, you know,
a couple of nights,

1551
01:28:27,021 --> 01:28:30,750
I can't remember if it was a couple of
days before his HBO special premiered. Uh,

1552
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:32,240
he,
he brought all his guitars and shit.

1553
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:35,660
He played guitar up to the House and
we had this big jam session out on the

1554
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:36,620
patio.
It was great.

1555
01:28:36,621 --> 01:28:40,490
Sam brought him up with a saint and Sam
just setting up the story and you know,

1556
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:44,060
he took off and I'd put all the equipment
in my bedroom because Sam didn't want

1557
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:47,240
to take it home. So a couple of nights
after that, we have a party at the house,

1558
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:50,000
you know, Sam's up there.
And this guy, Dave,

1559
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:53,390
the satanist shows up and we're all
doing drugs and it's getting weird and

1560
01:28:53,391 --> 01:28:55,700
they're sitting at the table and everyone,
he's holding court.

1561
01:28:55,701 --> 01:29:00,410
Sam isn't in Dave's there and a few other
people and, and Dave, the Stna says,

1562
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:03,100
you know, like they're getting into
it about satanism like, you know,

1563
01:29:03,101 --> 01:29:06,810
it's like the beast versus the mini beast.
It was ridiculous. And then Dave goes,

1564
01:29:06,811 --> 01:29:09,450
I'm going to tell Anton levay about you.
You're not a real sadness.

1565
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,500
And Sam just like stands up. And this
was a common tactic he used in fighting.

1566
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:17,730
He stands up, he throws a drink in this
guy's face and pops him. Oh, that's good.

1567
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:20,670
That's like the old throw salt and
the guy that does it. Sand. Yeah.

1568
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:23,940
And there's a fight and there's a scuffle.
And then, you know, and then I'm like,

1569
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:24,091
you know,

1570
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:26,880
I break it up and Dave's all fucked up
and all the other people in the room are

1571
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:30,090
freaked out and Dade, the Satan is his
shirts all ripped up. And I'm like,

1572
01:29:30,091 --> 01:29:31,950
you gotta get Outta here man.
You just gotta get Outta here.

1573
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:34,680
You gotta get out of his face. He's
like, I'm not fucking even fuck that.

1574
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:34,951
And I'm like,

1575
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:37,830
well I got to leave cause I got to
pick up a buddy of mine at the airport.

1576
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:41,770
I don't know what the hell to do it yet.
So I lock them in my room. All right.

1577
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,390
I locked them in my room with the guitars.
That sounded like a good idea to me.

1578
01:29:45,391 --> 01:29:45,750
Right.

1579
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:48,810
So I have to leave cause my buddy's
flying in and I told him I'd been hanging

1580
01:29:48,811 --> 01:29:51,600
out with Sam and this can be high right
now. Of course I will always high.

1581
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,660
So I got to go pick up my buddy up at
the airport and I'd been telling him all

1582
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:57,650
about Sam, you know, and this guy
was in Boston and he's like, yeah,

1583
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,760
I used to do coke with him too.
And he was excited to come out.

1584
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,950
So I picked them up at the airport.
We go to his hotel and I'm like,

1585
01:30:01,951 --> 01:30:03,780
I want to stay out of there.
I don't want to go back tonight.

1586
01:30:03,781 --> 01:30:07,620
I'm gonna crash at the hotel. So
I crashed at the hotel. All right.

1587
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:11,280
And then we drive back to the house, you
know, me and my buddy in the morning,

1588
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:15,360
all right. And we walk in
and it's like, you know it,

1589
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,910
I walk into my room and it's been,
you know,

1590
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:21,450
if the door had been kicked in the beds
all fucked up, all the equipments gone.

1591
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:22,770
And I'm like, Oh fuck. What happened?

1592
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:26,700
That walk into the living room and there
Sam sitting with two or three other

1593
01:30:26,701 --> 01:30:31,410
people, a weird mix of people and
they'd been at it all night, you know.

1594
01:30:31,411 --> 01:30:34,470
And I walk in and I'm with my
friend and uh, and I'm like,

1595
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:37,670
this is my buddy bill and Sam just
sitting there. He goes, Marin,

1596
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,490
I pissed on your bed.
You want to know why?

1597
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,100
And I go, yeah, I do want
to know, have Sammy goes,

1598
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:49,770
cause you let that idiot
sweep with my guitars.

1599
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:54,030
And I know that apparently I turned
to my friend bill and I said,

1600
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:55,170
I told you I knew him.

1601
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,700
That was the last time I ever slept in
that bed night. And then I, that was,

1602
01:31:03,701 --> 01:31:06,420
I did the guy fuck up his guitars
and everything like that. No,

1603
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:09,100
we didn't do anything. Sam just had
his fucking freak out. You know,

1604
01:31:09,101 --> 01:31:12,700
it's manic psychotic cocaine free guy.
I don't know what the hell transpired,

1605
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,400
but I never signed no one.
I never slept in that bed again.

1606
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:20,320
In a couple of days later I snapped at
the store and lost my shit and I packed

1607
01:31:20,321 --> 01:31:21,154
up everything.

1608
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:24,730
I went up to the coke dealer who was
not the hairdresser at this point.

1609
01:31:24,731 --> 01:31:28,060
It was just Palestinian dude who was
kind of scary. I said, don't get it man.

1610
01:31:28,061 --> 01:31:30,490
I'm kicked out of the group, man.
What the fuck am I going to do?

1611
01:31:30,491 --> 01:31:32,770
And the coke dealer said,
you gotta get Outta here man.

1612
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:35,920
You got to start your own thing. And when
the drug dealers telling you to leave,

1613
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,890
yeah. You gotta lead.
Yeah. So I pack up my car,

1614
01:31:38,891 --> 01:31:42,220
I gave away everything and you
go find Jesus son back up my car.

1615
01:31:42,221 --> 01:31:45,550
And I think I'm hearing voices and um,
you know, and I, and I leave, I leave,

1616
01:31:45,551 --> 01:31:47,500
I call my brother and two
sides and I'm fucked up.

1617
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:49,660
I'm coming to stay with you for a
few days. Do I get straightened out,

1618
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:54,370
I got to go clean up. And uh, you know,
this is Christ you sound like slash.

1619
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:57,520
Yeah. Well, so fucking
unbelievable. I was 21 years old to,

1620
01:31:58,210 --> 01:32:00,010
I was 21 old and I think,
can I

1621
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,970
just pause for one second now and the
all you guys, uh, who know, you know,

1622
01:32:03,971 --> 01:32:07,330
listen to this podcast a lot and I
talk about my early days of stand up.

1623
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:11,590
I swear to God, Mark, when I started
stand up in Boston, Massachusetts,

1624
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,650
I started doing too well,
the amount of headliners,

1625
01:32:14,651 --> 01:32:19,360
I would say like 65% of the headliners
that I work with in my first three years,

1626
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:23,890
they're opening line to their set
was saw a, been sober for six months.

1627
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:27,400
Everybody was in fucking Aa.
Everybody you'd cleaned up.

1628
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:31,870
And half of those guys were,
um, were what? She'd gone,

1629
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:36,060
dude on the mic there. They, the a
half of those guys were like, um,

1630
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,550
uh,
like their,

1631
01:32:38,551 --> 01:32:42,550
their wages were getting garnished by the
IRS because they were making like four

1632
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:45,870
grand. Those guys like Sweeney and uh,
you know, I don't want to name names here.

1633
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,890
That's one of the things on the podcast.
We don't name names,

1634
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:50,290
you got to tell you that shit.
So they, they basically, yeah,

1635
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:51,820
like these guys had fucking,
you know,

1636
01:32:51,821 --> 01:32:56,080
they've been making four grand cash
every fucking weekend for 10 years and

1637
01:32:56,081 --> 01:32:57,840
didn't pay a diamond taxes.
Right.

1638
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:01,630
And then all of them basically couldn't
leave Massachusetts unless they got a

1639
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:04,390
written note from the IRS or some shit.

1640
01:33:04,391 --> 01:33:06,640
So by the time I came in,

1641
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:11,710
the rebellious thing to do was to go
on stage sober. Oh. If it was kind of,

1642
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:14,890
it was tough. I should even say
rebellious. It was the norm.

1643
01:33:14,891 --> 01:33:17,530
So when I came in and the
guys I started out with,

1644
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:19,960
and I'll mention names here just
because I'm not saying anything bad,

1645
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:24,460
but I started off with Dane and Patrice
and like those guys just didn't drink.

1646
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:28,220
And I came from a, like me and my friends,
we have a bunch of booze bags. Yeah.

1647
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:32,800
And when I came in they didn't drink
and I saw how fucked up these guys were.

1648
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:36,730
You know, who made, yeah. And, and, and
you know, in some of them had some regret.

1649
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:38,770
Not all of them, but some of them
were. I should have done that yet.

1650
01:33:38,771 --> 01:33:42,550
So I immediately equated with,
oh, getting fucked up is stupid.

1651
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:45,700
And so I started my whole
career, I started off, you know,

1652
01:33:45,701 --> 01:33:50,701
work totally clean and I w and I was and
I was totally sober and then a fucking,

1653
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,830
this year I had to actually go in the
wagon for like two and a half months.

1654
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:56,160
I don't know when it happened. Touring,
touring, he did it to me. No, it's,

1655
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:58,000
he breaks you down. It's a
tough racket. But you know,

1656
01:33:58,001 --> 01:34:01,300
I mean I always wanted to be that. I
mean I, you know, before I got to La,

1657
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:04,420
I always want him to be, you know,
I, all my heroes were fucks up.

1658
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,870
We were fucked up. You know,
all my heroes, all, you know,
all the comics, you know,

1659
01:34:07,871 --> 01:34:11,410
all everyone, I respect. Why
is it so romantic that that
whole fucking cause I'm,

1660
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,010
cause I'm sitting there going like
even as fucked up as that story is,

1661
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:19,300
I'm sitting there like feeling like I'm
like show business light because I don't

1662
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:22,210
have any stories of being up for
fucking three days and, and, and,

1663
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,300
and I'm old enough to know I
don't want those fucking stories,

1664
01:34:25,301 --> 01:34:27,670
but you just don't want to
have a boring autobiography.

1665
01:34:27,671 --> 01:34:29,140
You know when you do that,
when the comedian,

1666
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:32,230
when you finally hit and they give you
the book deal and you got to have unit

1667
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:35,260
your head on your hand, like, well,
you know, they might take on life.

1668
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:38,380
The truth of the matter is, is that,
you know, it doesn't help you and you,

1669
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:40,540
you know, and if you stay
doing that, it will kill you.

1670
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:42,730
There's no way around it that no,

1671
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:46,060
but you want to have a couple of
fucking gets it. Great Story. Oh,

1672
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:46,811
there's another story.

1673
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:50,080
When I was hanging out with Sam Tani Lena
Aa meetings just to fucking listen to

1674
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:53,470
the, Oh, he should Tommy Lee. I mean
I've been sober for over 10 years.

1675
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:58,340
Over 10 years. You haven't done anything?
No, I, you know, I got, I got straight

1676
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,460
got into the program, you know, you
know, learned how to rewire my brain.

1677
01:35:01,461 --> 01:35:05,580
I've done nothing. I'm a sober guy, 10
years it, but you know, whatever. Yeah,

1678
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:05,931
but you know what?

1679
01:35:05,931 --> 01:35:08,000
You're a cool sober guy cause I
didn't even know that about you.

1680
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:11,390
I mentioned to somebody last
night to get guns. I, you know,

1681
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:13,700
I didn't drink for two and a half months
and then I went to England. I was like,

1682
01:35:13,701 --> 01:35:15,710
I've got to try these beers,
beers on it now.

1683
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:18,740
I'm like bummed when I go three
fucking days. And I was like, fuck,

1684
01:35:18,741 --> 01:35:21,980
I was up to like 75 and then all of a
sudden he just got real serious. He goes,

1685
01:35:21,981 --> 01:35:23,810
do you want to get
sober? I'm like, really?

1686
01:35:23,811 --> 01:35:27,320
Like looking into my soul
and my Jesus Christ dude, now
I'm, I'm not like that. No.

1687
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:29,090
The only question is,
is like, look, you know,

1688
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:30,500
I don't care what anyone
does and you know,

1689
01:35:30,501 --> 01:35:34,820
and I certainly appreciate the process
of drinking and boozing and doing drugs.

1690
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,910
I loved it, but he, you know,
it really just comes down to,

1691
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:39,170
if you get to that point,

1692
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:42,970
the only time you need to get sober really
is if you all of a sudden, you know,

1693
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:46,040
tried to stop and you can't, or you
liked becomes unmanageable. That's it.

1694
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,010
You know? And then that's when you
need help. That's it. All right, well,

1695
01:35:49,011 --> 01:35:52,120
this is where I'm at. I'm, I'm, uh,

1696
01:35:52,190 --> 01:35:55,260
I have stopped and done, you know, but I,

1697
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:59,750
I don't want to stop. It's
not that I can't, I like it.

1698
01:35:59,751 --> 01:36:01,910
Like last night I'm sitting
there doing the Gig.

1699
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:05,300
It was a place I always wanted to
perform it. I fucking destroyed.

1700
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:08,160
I even yelled out of blues brothers line.
Yeah.

1701
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:12,380
That John Belushi said on stage in the
Minoan got it. But I did it for me.

1702
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,390
I just had a fucking great time,
you know,

1703
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:16,830
and afterwards they
got this big ice chest,

1704
01:36:16,831 --> 01:36:21,620
the fucking Heineken's just staring at
me and I didn't drink one because I knew

1705
01:36:21,621 --> 01:36:24,130
that, you know, I didn't
want one. I wanted one,

1706
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:28,520
wanted to drink all of them and then
stuffed my face into the ice when I was

1707
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:32,480
done. So I, I, I like it
the way I like cookies.

1708
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:34,520
I won't eat the whole fucking bag.
All right,

1709
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:37,760
so then you know what that's
called was set alcoholism. No,

1710
01:36:37,761 --> 01:36:42,520
it is okay to go telling me that
denial. I'm not an El. No, no.

1711
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:45,830
Look, the bottom line is you can do it
however you want. You know, they, he,

1712
01:36:45,831 --> 01:36:46,551
it's like he,

1713
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:49,970
a lot of people you have to understand
something about people in the program is

1714
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:52,710
that most of them, you know, who
are especially gung ho about it,

1715
01:36:52,711 --> 01:36:56,880
it's saved their fucking life and it does
every fucking day. That's it. You know,

1716
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,700
and you know,
that's really interesting.

1717
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:02,420
So now I'll be more forgiving of
somebody who, fanatics of any kind,

1718
01:37:02,421 --> 01:37:04,280
but they're not trying to
push Jesus on you. I mean,

1719
01:37:04,281 --> 01:37:08,630
part of the program is really,
it's based on helping other alcoholics.

1720
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:13,370
So they actually, when they do that,
it's, it's in a way, you know, you know,

1721
01:37:13,371 --> 01:37:15,950
uh,
in terms of the way the program works,

1722
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:20,270
it's helping them see it
teaches pathologically self
centered people who can't

1723
01:37:20,271 --> 01:37:22,070
control themselves to behave like,

1724
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:26,560
like regular people by helping other
people in a very specific way. So yeah,

1725
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,460
that's it. Yeah. I mean it's
not, usually they don't,

1726
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:31,580
it's not a hard line thing and no one's
ever going to come up to you like an,

1727
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,670
you know, I've actually really though, uh,

1728
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:39,800
monitored my drinking is because I'm
so fucking vain. I liked the, uh, the,

1729
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:43,470
the how my face looks a lot better when
you drink, when I don't, oh, cause to,

1730
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:48,050
I don't cause I lose, I loaded that
however you want it and that, you know,

1731
01:37:48,051 --> 01:37:50,420
the thing is, is like if it's not
destroying your life, so be it.

1732
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:52,850
And if you want to go up and
down and quit here and there,

1733
01:37:52,851 --> 01:37:56,000
and if it's not destroying your life,
that's it. Yeah. Like after I go do

1734
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,320
this,
my Easter dinner is going to be,

1735
01:37:57,321 --> 01:37:59,750
I'm going to go to somebodies house
and we're watching to watch the red sox

1736
01:37:59,751 --> 01:38:01,610
Yankees.
It's great now how to fuck

1737
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:06,470
not too. The thing is, it
really comes down to in, in, in,

1738
01:38:06,471 --> 01:38:07,940
in light of what you're talking about,

1739
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:12,350
if you've tried to stop with all your
heart over and over again because you want

1740
01:38:12,351 --> 01:38:16,880
to stop drinking and you can right then,
then it's something to be addressed.

1741
01:38:16,881 --> 01:38:19,100
If you want to take a break,
but you like to drink,

1742
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:22,610
but it's not ruining your life and you're
just a weird kind of controlling guy

1743
01:38:22,611 --> 01:38:24,830
in your mind and you're like, fuck,
I had two months and you know,

1744
01:38:24,831 --> 01:38:27,260
but if it's not a plague bucket,

1745
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:30,940
this is, this is what's killing
me. I had a buddy of mine, uh, he,

1746
01:38:30,941 --> 01:38:34,720
he quit for a minute and I swear to God,
like, he's one of these guys who quit.

1747
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,130
I'm like, dude, what the
fuck are you Quintin for? You
don't have a problem. Okay,

1748
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:42,050
this guy quit for like maybe 17 days
and I think he lost about 30 pounds.

1749
01:38:42,051 --> 01:38:47,000
And I was like, checks is Christ, you
will fucking Busan. And he looked great.

1750
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,790
He usually, you know what, he looked
like? He looked like an Oscar, but that's,

1751
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:53,490
he was the exact, I can't wait to
hit them with that one if you didn't,

1752
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:56,360
if you knew this guy,
he looked literally like his body,

1753
01:38:56,361 --> 01:38:59,480
the silhouette of an Oscar.
And uh,

1754
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:02,030
and then one day called me and said,
hey,

1755
01:39:02,031 --> 01:39:03,830
and I started drinking and I
realized I didn't have a problem.

1756
01:39:03,831 --> 01:39:07,020
I just was drinking too much and blah,
blah. So now he's back on the drinking.

1757
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:10,520
Okay. I saw him again and dude,
he looked like fucking hell.

1758
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:15,740
He looked like he got run over by a
bus man. Terrible, tricky business.

1759
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:20,450
It's a tricky shit, man. Yeah.
Like he just look, uh, he,

1760
01:39:20,451 --> 01:39:23,180
you know what he looked like
when he stopped drinking
for three weeks, you know,

1761
01:39:23,181 --> 01:39:25,220
those fucking shows that
they do a make over,

1762
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:28,790
we're going to give you a new hip haircut
or going to give you a shiny shirt and

1763
01:39:28,791 --> 01:39:31,060
all of a sudden you come
walk up. Yeah. Yeah. And,

1764
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:32,840
and all of a sudden the women's
start paying it. That's,

1765
01:39:32,841 --> 01:39:36,220
that's what he looked like. He
came down to the club and, uh,

1766
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,900
eating my girlfriend was
like, Jesus, look at you. Wow.

1767
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,180
And this is the thing about him.
He didn't even go to the fucking gym.

1768
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:44,570
He just stopped drinking. Yeah. So, uh,

1769
01:39:44,571 --> 01:39:47,450
that is the one aspect of
it as my face look better.

1770
01:39:47,451 --> 01:39:51,030
And then one girl told me that my skin
look great. Yeah. So that's, you know,

1771
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:55,610
I'm so [inaudible] so insecure
and so fucking vain. I'm like,

1772
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:58,880
I can't drink my mother. My Skin's
looking great right now. Yeah.

1773
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:02,540
Oh yeah. I, I, I'm with you
on that. I mean, I used to
talk, I talk about it a lot,

1774
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:06,290
you know, in a sense onstage and how it
is. I mean, like I said, it's just, I'm,

1775
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:09,920
I'm happy I lived through it because,
uh, there's a, there's periods there,

1776
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,420
you know, and whatever
anyone thinks, you know,

1777
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:14,950
either that's your life and that's the
lifestyle you want to live or you're

1778
01:40:14,951 --> 01:40:17,930
going to make a drastic change or you
just deal with the ups and downs of it.

1779
01:40:17,931 --> 01:40:19,970
But I, I used to say when I got
sober, used to say, you know,

1780
01:40:19,971 --> 01:40:22,780
the great thing about sobriety's how
clearly you can see you're disappointed

1781
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:30,070
thing I was joking about is how fucking
long a year is when you're sober.

1782
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:35,270
It's like, I remember every second of
this other than when I was sleeping.

1783
01:40:35,271 --> 01:40:38,390
It's like, it was like February. I was
like, I can't believe it's not may yet.

1784
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:41,870
It's just fucking insane. I like that
though. I, you know, as I get older,

1785
01:40:41,871 --> 01:40:45,320
I'd much rather time just drip
by then rush by. It's brutal.

1786
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:47,720
I don't even want to happen in
this last fucking decade, I think.

1787
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,810
I think we're getting close to what are
we up to there on your, on your computer?

1788
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:54,060
How many hundred minutes? I don't know.
We have no idea. No, it's three 20.

1789
01:40:54,061 --> 01:40:57,900
What time did we start? About two 15.
We might be a little bit over now.

1790
01:40:57,930 --> 01:41:00,440
You want to do it? Uh, yeah. Well
let me, let me, let me, yeah,

1791
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:02,760
let me give a chance here.
You listening to mark Marin?

1792
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,100
It just for the future when I
do these interviews. So, uh,

1793
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:09,210
it's always uncomfortable given other
comedians complements where we were such

1794
01:41:09,211 --> 01:41:12,180
self loving people. But I think
seriously, mark for my, for my money,

1795
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,780
you've always been when the one of the
fucking best comics in the country.

1796
01:41:15,781 --> 01:41:19,170
So if mark is coming to your
area, definitely go see him. He's,

1797
01:41:19,171 --> 01:41:22,860
he does not pander to the audience.
He says what the fuck he's wants to say.

1798
01:41:22,861 --> 01:41:25,860
I think you're fucking awesome.
And every comic from here on out,

1799
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:28,740
if they're on my show,
they fit that bill.

1800
01:41:28,741 --> 01:41:30,360
I don't know if there'll be
able to follow your stories,

1801
01:41:30,361 --> 01:41:32,190
but every once in a while we're
going to do this on the podcast.

1802
01:41:32,191 --> 01:41:35,790
I'm going to have a comedian that I really
admire and I admired your work for a

1803
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:36,301
long time.

1804
01:41:36,301 --> 01:41:38,940
So how about let me know some of the
