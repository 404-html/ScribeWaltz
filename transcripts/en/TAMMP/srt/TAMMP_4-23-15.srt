1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,150
Hey, what's going on? It's bill bar.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,050
Just checking in on
you on a Thursday here.

3
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:13,820
Whatever the fuck it is. The hell is
the God damn date here man. So you know,

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,810
fuck. Can I turn the third down here in
Louisiana down here on the buggy. Easy.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,570
We just rolled into town today and I'm
just going to do my little half hour bull

6
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:28,520
shit here before I play a couple of
classic clips from the Monday morning

7
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,241
podcast,

8
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:34,241
blackened yesteryear back in yesteryear
back before back when baby seals had

9
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:40,511
enough fish in the ocean to eat right
back when apples would turn brown when

10
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:45,530
they went bad. I still think we will
make our own salmon at that point.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,380
Man Made Salmon just stirring it up in
a petri dish. Would you care for a bike?

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,950
Um, anyways, so, uh,

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,580
the tour has been going fantastic.
Um,

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,670
this all, all these jokes, man, this is,

15
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:03,560
this is how you put together
a standup back there, right?

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,010
You get on a God damn fucking bus and
you just do shows every night for two

17
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:10,280
weeks and it's over one weekend,
one weekend. I'm telling you,

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,240
it's like going to gym. You go to a
gym the first day like, oh my God,

19
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,260
I don't want to do this.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,650
And then a weekend you feel like
a monster unless you'd like me.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,520
You Bet your bottom for months because
you're, you're almost 47 years of age,

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,450
right? But as a different thing.
All right, here we get the,

23
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:28,940
I note that I wasn't even trying to,
it's going to be like, hey, you know,

24
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:29,910
it's different.
But I went home.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,673
MMM.

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,220
So anyways, what's going on
in the world? Have nothing.

27
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:41,570
We have another controversy.
Everybody. What is it? What is it?

28
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,220
Is it that the oceans are fished out?

29
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,430
Is it that our food supply
slowly being turned into poison?

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,030
Is it that there was this maybe
like what three fucking banks left?

31
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,460
Is that what it is? No, it isn't.

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,620
Some fucking guy who plays captain America
and another guy who plays a fucking

33
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:00,890
electric man or whatever the hell they
play. I don't watch these fucking movies.

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,200
The superhero movies, they were asked to
describe some character, the black widow,

35
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,360
and they jokingly said she's a slut.
She's a whore, right. And, and,

36
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:14,900
and everybody's all fucking up in arms
about it and they have to apologize.

37
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,620
Nobody has to apologize for fucking
drilling for oil and actually accidentally

38
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,780
ruining the fucking water supply.

39
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,040
They don't even have to answer
questions during the town meetings.

40
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,440
They just sent somebody down there to
stare at the person who's now fucking

41
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:31,160
glowing green cause they had the nerve
to take a shower in their own fucking

42
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:33,020
house.
There's no apology coming from there.

43
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,280
But these guys here who walk around and
fucking under rose and make some stupid

44
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:42,080
ass joke right at the end of
a press conference, listen
to these fucking morons.

45
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:42,651
Somebody roads.

46
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:47,651
Well it's nice of Chris Evans and Jeremy
Renner to let us know they're super

47
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:51,990
gross.
Oh,

48
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:56,040
can you imagine driving cross country
with somebody who says super gross and

49
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,520
misogynistic way to go
bros. Another one. Oh dear.

50
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,720
Now that Jeremy Renner and Chris
Evans or making tasteless jokes, no.

51
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:08,890
Now Jeremy Renner and Chris
Evans or making tasteless
jokes about the only women

52
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,210
woman in the franchise.
Okay.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,560
Chris Evans and Jeremy [inaudible]
recent comments on the blackboard.

54
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,000
We're beyond, beyond disturbing,
okay. And misogynistic.

55
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,690
Unreal.
So then they both had to issue apologies.

56
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,810
The guys who walk around and under rules,
right?

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,930
And Eat fucking proteins
and salads so they can,

58
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:33,800
they can talk their guts into
these fucking tight suits
after wishing or apology

59
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:35,750
about making fun of a fictitious woman.

60
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,340
Yesterday they were asked
about the rumors, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. Here we go.

61
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:41,810
Here's the apologies.
Uh,

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,010
yesterday we were asked about the real
ways that black letter law had to be in a

63
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:48,590
relationship with both
Hawkeye and Captain America.

64
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,270
Can you believe this is a natural apology

65
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,880
as the accurate actor who portrays hawk?

66
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,900
I'd like to apologize to the character
black widow for suggesting she was a

67
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:04,430
whore. You know what I
mean? You know what I love?

68
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:07,160
I love that they're acting
like there are no horse.

69
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,510
That word exists for a reason.
You know there's horse.

70
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,910
I'm in Louisiana,
a fucking New Orleans.

71
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,530
I'll show you how fucking straight
of a does that make me misogynistic?

72
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,720
This is the dumb ish. Anyways,
I liked renders apology.

73
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:29,500
He goes, I'm sorry for that tasteless
joke about a fictional character.

74
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm sorry that sorry.

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,500
I am sorry that this tasteless joke about
a fictional character offended anyone.

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,650
Can you read between the lines? You're
fucking morons. That's what he's,

77
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,700
I feel like he's saying it was
not to be serious in a way.

78
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,550
Just poking fun during an
exhausting and tedious press tour.

79
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,030
These guys were asked the same five
questions for like nine hours in a row,

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,230
and then they called the woman who
doesn't exist of fucking widow, a widow,

81
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,060
no fucking whore and a slut. And now
they have to apologize as real people.

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,120
They have to apologize to real women
about the fictitious woman that they

83
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,440
labeled as a whore.
You know what I mean?

84
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:08,530
You know what's funny is that if there
was actually a real woman walking around

85
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,160
doing half the shit, I don't even know
what black widow does, but let's just,

86
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,200
you know, if they live up to the photo,
what does a black widow spider, right?

87
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,990
It fucking banks had guy gets his Joses
in him and then fucking kills them.

88
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,090
You know what I mean?
You know what that sounds like to me.

89
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,060
That sounds like that movie monster,
right?

90
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,810
What did she got an Oscar for that?

91
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,580
I want to see that.

92
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:37,410
I want to see a guy who plays a Gigolo
and goes around and murders fucking hard

93
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,220
up housewives. I want to hear that be
called a fucking brave performance.

94
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,270
It was so brave. He didn't wear any
aftershave during that performance.

95
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,260
Have you ever seen that movie?

96
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,360
That movie is one of the
funniest fucking movies ever.

97
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,830
They literally turn her into a victim.
You know what I mean?

98
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
I had and in the end,
like this love story,

99
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:58,400
she's sitting there crying
and I'm supposed to cry with
her cause she didn't fly

100
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:03,260
in love. This murderous
sociopath. Um, you know,

101
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,050
but she wasn't wearing makeup
and as she was killing men.

102
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,860
So evidently that's a brave,
it's a wonderful thing.

103
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,020
Um, anyways, if you're finally
somebody's rational, this woman wrote,

104
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,460
if you're offended by that joke,

105
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,910
that Renner and Evan's made
about a fictional character,

106
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:24,350
please re reevaluate your life and relax.
Exactly.

107
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,050
Someone else wrote Renner.
Did not sound sincere at all.

108
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,510
Does he really owe you an
apology? Huh? Are you a superhero?

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,640
You know, being a superhero and a
female has always been difficult for me.

110
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,590
First of all,
I possess no super powers to speak of.

111
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,000
And I don't know if there's a second,
but if it is,

112
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:52,001
I'm sure it's harder than whatever guys
go through consomme and apologize to me

113
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,380
please. Um, anyways, who gives a shit?

114
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:58,910
Okay,

115
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,010
let me come on. There were actors,
there were all horse, right?

116
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,320
Do you think anyone ones want to walk
around in those fucking suits? You know,

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,810
you fucking package all fucking,
you know, snuggled up there.

118
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,600
I Dunno who the fuck knows.

119
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,170
I'm waiting for them to somehow
then do something on white males.

120
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,300
I actually read one thing
was saint look shirt.

121
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:24,870
They were both joking but considering
they're white males and then it just

122
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:28,950
becomes, let's take the thing that we
know is a joke and now take it seriously.

123
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,160
Um,
which is going to bring up,

124
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm sure the whole argument that
if a guy sleeps around, you know,

125
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,820
he's called the stud. If a woman sleeps
around, she's called a whore in it.

126
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,460
And that totally makes sense to me.

127
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,780
And I'm allowed to have this opinion
without you fucking having your hair.

128
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,840
Fucking curlews go flying across the
Goddamn Room. All right. Fucking relax.

129
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,070
My opinion does not affect anything.
All right?

130
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,410
I go along with that because there's no
skill level and falls in a woman getting

131
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:02,700
laid is there, I'm not saying
you can fuck anybody you want,

132
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:06,060
but she can go out and get laid. I don't
think it's that God damn difficult,

133
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,270
you know, and less a, you know,
I don't know what your deal is.

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,450
Let's just so fucking know
and knowing you would have to,

135
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,710
big guys will fuck anything.
Why is that?

136
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,450
I don't know why, but all I know
is as a guide to get laid is a,

137
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:23,740
is a fucking skill.

138
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,920
You've got to learn how to do what
you got to have like a fucking,

139
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,500
you've got to have a good thousand
of bats under your fucking belt.

140
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:33,540
Just exist at that point.
If you're lucky,

141
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,560
a hitting about a buck 40.
If you look like Ron Howard
like I did, I mean, you're,

142
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,320
you've already been sent
down to AAA. Um, yeah.

143
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,510
Oh, Jesus Christ. So unfucking believable.
What a what a fucking way. Oh yeah.

144
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,780
I actually, I'm wasting time on
the podcast talking about this.

145
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,810
This has become like an every week thing.

146
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:54,400
Like I don't understand
who the fuck they are.

147
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:58,000
Even apologizing to the
people that comment.

148
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,680
That's just ridiculous.
You know,

149
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,760
I'm never going to see another one of
his movies until the next person offends

150
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:06,310
me and then I'll forget what they said
and then I'll go see their movies.

151
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:10,960
Anyways. Um, anyways, let's, let's,
let's get off this stupid subject. Uh,

152
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,270
what was the last time I talked to you?
I talked to you on Monday,

153
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:18,271
so I believe I was heading into fucking
Knoxville who dares to call me on the,

154
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,280
during the fucking podcast.

155
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,800
I have the most generic fucking bring.
Hold on a second.

156
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,893
Okay.

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,950
Jesus Christ. All right, so here we go.

158
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,450
Yeah, we go back to the podcast.
I don't know what that is.

159
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:42,960
I hope that's not business related. I
am not a good businessman. All right,

160
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,000
so last I talked to you,
we were heading into Knoxville.

161
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,890
Knoxville was an amazing,
um, amazing show. Uh,

162
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,800
do Chattanooga.
Jesus Christ,

163
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,550
don't sleep on that fucking place.
Um,

164
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,560
we went there and had great food,
unbelievable show.

165
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,040
And then uh,
we ended up hanging out this place,

166
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,200
which of course I already can't
remember the fucking name of it.

167
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:11,670
I tweeted about it. Do I have the
memory of, of a, of a fucking inset?

168
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,411
Unreal.

169
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:17,010
Now I literally have to look up when I
tweeted about at a place that I went to

170
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,400
and had a great time when I was in
Chattanooga. I'll tell you all about it.

171
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,950
Other than than Ah, right.
I know. I heard the ring

172
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,410
Steve Jobs.
You fucking cunt.

173
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,130
I bet you came up with that right to
have it fucking ring and ring and ring.

174
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,110
And if it doesn't, if they don't
pick up, it will continue to ring.

175
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,990
Um, all right. Where the hell is it?
Do I really fucking retweet this much?

176
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,530
What an asshole.
Oh Geez.

177
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:48,460
Is where is it dude?
You guys been watching ESPN by the way,

178
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,540
trying to fill the hours during
baseball season. I was watching,

179
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,700
I was sitting there eating breakfast and
they had the thing and they had a bit

180
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:59,140
on there called is it gangster or is it
[inaudible]? It's just like, you know,

181
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,130
you know, I think ESPN should
do, I think they should fuck,

182
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:04,510
I'd have sports center in the morning
and then while they're waiting for more

183
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:08,080
games to start in the afternoon, they
should just take a nap. They should just,

184
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:10,420
you know,
turn the fucking thing off,

185
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:14,110
show some old sports bloopers
and they should all, you know,

186
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:16,390
take off this suits and ties,
you know,

187
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,180
put the dress socks and they're wingtips
tips and they should just all just take

188
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:23,470
a fucking nap and stop pretending things
are happening between the hours of

189
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:28,120
11:00 AM and 5:00 PM nothing
is going on. All right, go out.

190
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:33,010
Go get yourself a fucking Taco. You know
the sitting there talking about, uh,

191
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,340
that, what's his face that
Jamison, what's his face?

192
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,680
They're doing this thing about him.

193
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Did he or did he not steal those stupid
fucking crab legs actually tweeted about

194
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:46,710
that and somebody fucking
took me seriously. I will.

195
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:50,950
Can you build a franchise around a man
who may or may own dot stolen some crab

196
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:55,740
legs? I'll tell you if I'm Tampa Bay,
I'm sure she reconsidering Jamison.

197
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:57,150
Winston is my first pick.

198
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Why only needs to look at the
Hernandez situation in New England?

199
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,460
How ridiculous is that?
Somebody actually wrote back to me like,

200
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,590
I'm first degree murder is a little more,

201
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,440
a little worse than fucking
stealing crab legs. You know, Jesus,

202
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,120
you know what, I'm not gonna be able to
find the name of this fucking place. Um,

203
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,850
I went to a place in Chattanooga,
we could smoke a cigar play.

204
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,590
You could fucking bull. And
I'm the worst. I swear to God.

205
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:30,720
I tweeted about it. I got an
I can't find, I can't find it.

206
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,060
I had a great time there.
I can tell you that, uh,

207
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,670
good food and all that shit.
And last night we were in Shreveport.

208
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,030
I thought I was playing at that place
that Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis did. I did.

209
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:44,850
And I played another place like
the strand right down the street,

210
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:48,220
which was awesome. Um, Elvis
was never there, but I,

211
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:51,360
I did learn when I was in
Shreveport, they have a, uh,

212
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,110
some sort of convention center there and
that's the first place where somebody

213
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,670
announced Elvis has left the building.

214
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:03,480
That's the first time that was ever
uttered. And uh, if you're a nerd like me,

215
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,730
that was a cool thing to learn about, you
know. So anyways, I'm here in the, uh,

216
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:13,460
the big easy, uh, the big
sleazy as they call it. And uh,

217
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,970
I got a show here tonight,
uh,

218
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,310
really looking forward to it and I'm
hanging out here over the next couple of

219
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,070
days somehow trying to figure out how
to stay in shape in this God forsaken

220
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,480
place. I swear to God they
fry everything down here.

221
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,320
Is the thing about the south too, it's,
it's such cheap fucking living down here.

222
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,070
Do you know when I was in Chattanooga
they had a sign that said 1-800-DIVORCE

223
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,450
and underneath it it said basic divorce,
350 bucks.

224
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,230
Can you believe? I mean, I know
that that's just the lawyers fee,

225
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,350
but you figure we what that is.
That is like one of the,

226
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,210
that will be like if honey
booboo, you know, someone
from her family got divorced,

227
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,830
you know, I mean, what do you, what
are your breaking up at that point?

228
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,490
Can I get that last
chocolate frosted doughnut?

229
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,440
Are you going to have it all
right if you take in that, that I,

230
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,860
I want to get that face cloth right.
Fucking lawyers just sitting in there,

231
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:11,990
you know, staring down at his shoes. You
know he's dressed like colonel Sanders.

232
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:16,230
Just get some weird mustache
you guys bought. Darn.

233
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:20,810
You settle it up. No, no, no. Wait, wait.
I gotta I gotta change up southern voices.

234
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,730
Yeah, I've got a couple more here. Um,

235
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,230
let's see. Do you want that? Uh,

236
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,470
do you want that? That was up to
each tank top. You want that or,

237
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,750
okay. You have, okay. If you
have that, that I'm getting
the keep on trucking April

238
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,940
and that'll be yet, and the other guys
just like, all right, there you go.

239
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,540
Signed, sealed divorce. Done.
That'll be 350 bucks. Oh Man,

240
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,920
I thought you said $3 and 50 cents.
I had no fucking idea.

241
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:57,140
I'm gonna have to go across the
street and get myself alone. Um,

242
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,890
that's the place you get divorced.
Everybody. Chattanooga, Tennessee.

243
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,270
I can't believe I can't remember the name
of that fucking place I went to. Dude,

244
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:06,460
you went in, you smoke cigars. It's right
across the street from the college that,

245
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:08,530
uh,
terrellowens went to,

246
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,160
which of course I can't remember
the name of that either. And uh,

247
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,500
they had outback. I gotta look this
fucking place up out back. They had a,

248
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,334
uh,

249
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,390
what do you call those things that white
people who don't have any money live in

250
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,423
a trailer.

251
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,000
I had a trailer airstream trailer that
they had hollowed out and they made like

252
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,520
a smoking room out of it.
And we sat in that fucking thing.

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,220
I've been watching a bunch of
NBA playoffs. It's killing me.

254
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,300
Versie and fucking La Headbutt
that God Damn Basketball Jones,

255
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,780
they just so fucking into
it and it's just like,

256
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:46,781
do you realize that the
Stanley Cup playoffs are
going on the greatest playoffs

257
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,880
that exists just fucking
guys. You flipping out about
three pointers and layups,

258
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,370
you put on fucking hockey. These guys
are taking a stick to their head,

259
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,720
skating off the spitting out teeth and
then they come back five minutes later,

260
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,130
that shit on the Knicks.

261
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,630
We comes out with his fucking broken leg
that happens like every other game in

262
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,590
hockey playoffs

263
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,430
back in the day pre
like HIV and that shit.

264
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:14,880
They used to stitch guys up right on the
bench and the guide be getting stitched

265
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:18,360
up and is a dude who hit him skates by
the guy getting stitched up but talk shit

266
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:21,940
to them. And they got Willis Reed
now, you know, obviously Willis Reed,

267
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:24,720
he beat up the whole fucking Lakers at
the same time. I'm not saying the guy,

268
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,200
but I'm saying I don't fucking,

269
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,470
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I'm just so sick of fucking watching hoop.

270
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,990
It just bores me to tears.
I do like watching, um, uh,

271
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,650
um, the guys from Oakland,
they're golden state.

272
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,300
I do like watching them. Um, but
I, I just, I've had enough man.

273
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,290
It's like I just watched march madness.
I'm all fucking hooped out. And you know,

274
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,010
I'm sitting there just flipping back and
forth and caught the end of the ducks.

275
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,330
I know that they swept, um, look at me.

276
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:01,200
I don't even know what they swept
Winnepeg and I know that a Ottawa beat the

277
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:06,090
Canadians last night,
you know, be amazing.

278
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,230
If they went to tonight in Montreal,

279
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:09,930
then all of a sudden all those frenchies
would get really fucking nervous. Like,

280
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:12,810
Oh fuck,
are we going to drop four in a row?

281
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,850
We can Trump four in a row to the costs
down the street that are actually a

282
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:18,930
capital of this country.

283
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,010
As we're up here walking around acting
like we're the capitol when they're

284
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,110
actually the capital, are they really
going to come back and do this?

285
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,880
And if they do,
when do we boot Carey price out of town?

286
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,750
Because that's what we do is Canadian
fence that was fucking spoiled brats

287
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,770
spoiled anymore. You know what I love
about them is just like fucking 20,

288
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:43,590
25 year olds with no recollection
of ever winning a cup.

289
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,130
It's happening right now up there,
all of those,

290
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,540
all that shit talking about
all their fucking cups.

291
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,470
It's going away because now there's
competition and they can't run the table

292
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:56,180
anymore. It's fucking phenomenal. And uh,

293
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,520
I really hope they go the rest of
my life and never wouldn't want.

294
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,590
I really don't wish that on anybody other
than Canadian fans. I don't know why.

295
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:04,640
They're just fun to hate.

296
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,610
You know what's funny too is actually get
upset then I fucking talk. She is like,

297
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,060
why would you get upset? My team's not
even in the playoffs. Playoffs, you know?

298
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:14,601
But you know what?

299
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:18,170
We have wanted fucking Stanley Cup at
least in the last 20 fucking years.

300
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,510
I know that you guys want a bunch yet,
but

301
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,670
I want to three o'clock as well.

302
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,510
They should play when they
show Canadians highlights,

303
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:30,260
they should show Bill Haley
and the comments and they
should go all the way back

304
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:34,930
to like Butoh, booboo,
booboo, booboo, you know,

305
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,280
maybe look three stooges music.

306
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,280
Wow. Wow, wow, wow, blah
blah, Bah Bah Bah Bah Bob.

307
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,620
Sorry. Alright, Chattanooga,
here we go. Chattanooga said Gar.

308
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,563
Okay.

309
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,510
Bowling bar. Let's see
if I can find this thing.

310
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,270
I'm actually doing like a
fucking 10 minute commercial
on it now because I can't

311
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:56,390
find the goddamn thing. Come on. Oh yeah.

312
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,020
I'll tell you everything slowed down
here in the south. Even the Internet,

313
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,910
even that fucking Internet,
um,

314
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,900
south side social, that's where I
went. If you're ever in Chattanooga,

315
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,910
you can smoke a cigar outside in this
fucking air stream while you're watching a

316
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:17,990
goddamn game. They got,
um, they got horse shoes,

317
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,950
they got bowling, they got pool, they
got games. I never even heard of.

318
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:26,600
They got Midwest Games, southern games,
any fucking thing you want to do? Um,

319
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,980
they had whiskey.
Slushies what more do I got to say?

320
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,830
Whatever. Fucking, I'll tell
you this, right if, whatever.

321
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,020
Okay.

322
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,480
Uh, college, um,

323
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,010
Trent Reznor went to whatever the
fuck his name is. Terrellowens uh,

324
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,070
just give tickets to a game. Go down,
right and right across the street,

325
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:49,040
south side, short social, going
there before the game. Smoke a stove,

326
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,080
he'd drink a beer and then go
across street. Watch the game.

327
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:53,990
You can actually walk up to the fence
and watch it. Like it's the, uh,

328
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:58,220
the depression era. And we had a
great time there. And, um, anyways,

329
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:01,550
then we went on to,
uh, went on to Memphis.

330
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,490
A bunch of people were in town.
Uh,

331
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,610
yeah,

332
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,920
I can drop names here,

333
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:10,940
but there was somebody in town
for the Memphis grizzly game. Um,

334
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,890
and he hung out with us talking
hoop and fucking version law head.

335
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,140
We'll losing this shit. And uh,
I was to just as a sports fan,

336
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:22,770
but they on a whole other level because
they just fucking, um, you know,

337
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,690
crazy oop fans. They were
asked him like, boats,

338
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,940
what was it like to play defense against
Michael Jordan and all that shit. So, uh,

339
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,010
we had an amazing time and uh,
it's been, it's been phenomenal to,

340
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,990
to really, to, to go through all of these
fucking towns that I've never been to.

341
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,580
Shreveport was the shit. Um,
rather than waking up today,

342
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,040
pulling into New Orleans and after
New Orleans, just to let you know,

343
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,370
the only place I need help anybody came
out to a show so far on this tour that

344
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,460
is enjoyed it. Could you, if
you know anybody in Mississippi,

345
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:52,680
could you please let them know
about the show in Jackson?

346
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:55,820
That is the only fucking one I'm,

347
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,810
I'm really trying to,
uh,

348
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,720
to get some inroads in their Mississippi
just seems like its, its, its,

349
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,140
its complete own deal
more so than even Texas.

350
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,780
The Texas walks around and
they talk a bunch of shit.

351
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,620
You know what are you interested? Yeah.
In America anymore. You booking taxis,

352
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,190
right?

353
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,180
You fuck you all right with you God damn
baby gap stores and all of that Shit

354
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,300
and all those whores walking
around with their makeup. Oh God.

355
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:24,510
Do I have to apologize to Dallas now?
Um,

356
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,190
well cause the woman puts on clown
makeup. She's a whore. If a man does it.

357
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,363
Hello.

358
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,940
All right. Can I say this to
people in general? Fucking grow up.

359
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,960
Bunch of God damn babies. Give a fuck
about something that matters. Right.

360
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,320
That fruit causes cancer
now. Right. How about that?

361
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:51,020
I'll just throw that out there. I don't
have to apologize to the fruit industry.

362
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,500
Um, now when you say fruit, what are you
saying? Are you actually talking about it?

363
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,800
Are you making fun of a group of
people? I want an apology. Ooh.

364
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,140
Um, I'd love to find who
these fucking people are.

365
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,510
Go out and just interview
them and you think, why?

366
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,760
Why were you offended personally?

367
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,800
And then go into their apps.

368
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:16,510
They fucking bullshit rhetoric and then
I just would gradually break them down.

369
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,230
What's going on in your life right
now? Huh? Are you happy at work?

370
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,980
Are you happy in your relationship
and you're not all right. Yeah. Great.

371
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:25,570
So rather than deal with that,

372
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:28,240
you're going to fucking talk about
these two guys that, you know,

373
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,040
they dress up like fucking,
uh, aqua man and uh,

374
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,320
the ozone layer guy, right? You're
going to get fucking upset about them.

375
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,740
Ozone layer guy, that's a good
new fucking superhero, right?

376
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,670
Okay.

377
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,600
Ozone layer guy, he's got
a hole in his heart, right?

378
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,630
That's the hole in the ozone layer.
Just can't give it to love.

379
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,660
And how he stopped the criminals is he
just sucks out the fucking atmosphere.

380
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,420
Everybody in the whole
planet faints and then he,

381
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,620
you revives everybody at the same time
except for the bad guy. And then people,

382
00:22:57,621 --> 00:23:00,500
you know, you know, society never
understands the superheroes. It'd be like,

383
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:04,130
you know, I understand that
he has to, uh, stop crying,

384
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:08,390
but does he have to to deprive all
of our brains of oxygen? I mean,

385
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:10,730
at the end of the day, uh, you
know, despite the fact, yeah,

386
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,530
you're, you're, you're, you're,

387
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,090
um, oh gee, I don't know
your, your mission I guess is,

388
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:20,470
is a noble one. Let me, don't get me
wrong, I want to clean up the streets too,

389
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:24,790
but I really don't need to
pass out every 20 minutes.

390
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,760
So Ozone Guy, if you are listening,
right. And of course he's like, he likes,

391
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,660
he's like the weatherman on that shelf.
Right?

392
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,470
But he parks his hair in a different
science and nobody can see it except for

393
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:36,910
some broad,
right.

394
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,060
She fucking figures it out and
she starts blowing them, you know,

395
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,960
in the hall of justice and like a broom
closet and she's just like, you know,

396
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:46,800
when,
when are we going to,

397
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,280
when are you going to introduce me to
all your other fucking superhero friends?

398
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,380
And, uh, he's all insecure because
he's not as cool as superman. Right.

399
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,470
Of the green lantern. What does the
Green Lantern Dude does it does. He,

400
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:04,530
does he actually have a lantern? Does
it shoot out green lights? Come on.

401
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:07,560
You fucking nerd. Somebody was skin
tags knows the answer to that, right?

402
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:11,740
Yeah.

403
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,060
Oh, that was me. That was really
mean. I go to the gym every day.

404
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,950
It's just become a pop me nights.
And if you don't want to be fatty,

405
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,670
well you go to the gym every day. You
can't. That's what I'm doing after this,

406
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,740
everybody, I'm going to the God
damn gym. I'm going to the gym.

407
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:33,300
I'm going to a fucking a gym down south,
which means they have a fucking,

408
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,490
they have a stair masters that somebody
one on card sharks a long time ago.

409
00:24:38,491 --> 00:24:42,670
And after Katrina, it floated by and
these people sprayed some Rustoleum on.

410
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,150
I gotta take a picture of this
God damn gym they have in there.

411
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,900
They do actually have some,
they have some dumbbells. So a,

412
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:52,190
I could do some damage in there. They do
have a treadmill, but it's like that. Uh,

413
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,220
remember those old school treadmills when
they first came out where it felt like

414
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:59,130
the tread on the mill sets
of proper terminology.

415
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,150
It was just a little bit loose and you
almost like do a face plant like every

416
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:07,590
like fifth step. Um, they
got one of those in there.

417
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,190
One of the ones, like if somebody who
weighed too much leaned against it,

418
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:14,300
the entire front of it would
just fucking break off. That's,

419
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,510
that's what I'm working with.
Um, so anyways, I got to read,

420
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,140
I've got one fucking advertisement
on this. Okay. Which God knows.

421
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:24,810
You guys know this is entertaining.
Oh good. We get to listen to bill.

422
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:28,050
Try to read out loud. I'm going
to try to slow down the pace here.

423
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,410
Yeah.

424

450
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:14,490
uniform, Romeo, Romeo. Um,
all right, let's see. That was
pretty painless, wasn't it?

451
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,650
Not really. Um, so anyways,

452
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:22,140
I got New Orleans tonight and um,

453
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,340
we're here for actually going to stay
here for a couple of days and uh,

454
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,730
we were actually thinking of going
to the Pelicans golden state game on

455
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:34,470
Saturday, but, uh, we have to make our
way up to Huntsville. So everybody,

456
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:36,180
your mission,
all right,

457
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:38,790
if you live down south and maybe
you live up north and you have that,

458
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:41,550
those cousins you never talked to,
if they're down there in Mississippi,

459
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:45,510
if you know how to somehow get in touch
with these people and get people to come

460
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:49,770
out to a show. I'm also, I want to thank
everybody who's been buying the, uh,

461
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,660
the Billie Bible belt tour poster,

462
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,900
just basically me preaching
to people 80 years ago.

463
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,140
It's basically a
preacher's head, uh, body,

464
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,230
and they took the head off and put my
head on it and that people really seem to

465
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:01,801
be loving that.

466
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:06,450
And a lot of people have seen pictures
of the poster and they would like to get

467
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,660
one. Um, I have, I can't sell them yet.

468
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,340
If I have any leftover I will and the
bonuses, they will all be autograft.

469
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:18,300
So whatever I have leftover after the
tour immediately I'll put it up on a

470
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,250
billboard.com. Um, I'm not fucking you
here. It's a high quality piece of paper.

471
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:27,180
It's a, I forget how big it is, but
it's, it's pretty uh, pretty impressive.

472
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,370
And I'm, if I do have any lefts,
um, I will autograph all of them.

473
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,890
And uh,
if you guys want to get them,

474
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:37,410
you'd be doing me a solid cause if not
that just going to sit in my fucking

475
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:40,890
garage and my wife's going to give
me shit. All right, that's the deal.

476
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,020
That's what happens.
Everything ends up in the garage.

477
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,340
Everything ends up in the garage unless
you get rid of it. And then what happens?

478
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:50,730
You don't have any room for your
fucking car to go into the garage.

479
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,600
And if you live in La,

480
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:55,380
what most people do is they turned
their garage into another room.

481
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:57,010
Cause they just look at it
like, well, hey, you know,

482
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:01,620
would never fucking rains out here. Oh,
speaking of that Shit, Jesus Christ,

483
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,380
Jesus Christ, can somebody do a
rain dance for California? You know,

484
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,930
I thought it was being right.
Smart investing into fucking real estate.

485
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:17,850
And even though I knew California,
I mean Los Angeles was a desert.

486
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,640
I mean, Hey, you know, uh, Jeez,

487
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,410
I'm actually thinking about selling
my house and going back to renting.

488
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:28,560
So when the shit hits the fan,
when that last drop of water comes out,

489
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:31,500
I can just walk away from at least.
Um,

490
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,390
I'll tell you what's some amazing that
I saw when we drive them from Memphis

491
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:41,100
down to Shreveport, south of,
uh, Little Rock, Arkansas.

492
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,140
Um,
it kill me too to drive through that city,

493
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,860
not do stand up there and fucking kill me.

494
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:50,660
I'm going to have to add that if I do
a, if I do a tour, starting little rock,

495
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:53,600
maybe cut through Oklahoma and do some
shit like that, I'll figure something out.

496
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,800
But, um, that whole fucking,

497
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:02,890
you can't believe I actually understand
why people in like some of these states

498
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:05,540
in the middle of the country
don't believe in global warming.

499
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,920
If you see the fucking land, they are
living on that shit. I mean, granted,

500
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:14,150
I was just zipping down the highway,
but all I saw was nothing but trees.

501
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,810
And you knew when they have trees with
them, wild pigs, that's good eating.

502
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,840
I'll tell you they'll fuck up a farm, but
that isn't good. Fucking eight. And uh,

503
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,000
that's all my bucket list.
I want to, I want to shoot a
pig on a shoot. A wild pig.

504
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,830
All right. In the fucking ass. Um,

505
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,270
picking up buck shot out of a
pork shoulder. Come on. We've all,

506
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,470
we've all dreamed of doing that
avenue. We all right. Anyways, uh,

507
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,100
I didn't even get to any of that shit.
You know,

508
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:44,750
I couldn't find the stuff that you guys,
you guys sent me on,

509
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,710
on a, I almost said on the Twitter.
That's how fucking old I am. I couldn't,

510
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,200
I couldn't find what you
guys sent me on the Twitter,

511
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,990
the shit that you wanted me to rant about.
Oh,

512
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:56,180
you know what one person wanted
me to talk about was the, uh,

513
00:30:56,181 --> 00:31:00,020
that w n a couple that got into the fight.

514
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,630
Yeah.

515
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,100
Where the hell is it? Come on bill.
Don't blow it. Don't be a fucking moron.

516
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:09,010
Like always. Where is it? Where is it?

517
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,420
Come on. Oh, I don't know
what the fuck happened.

518
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,830
I guess there's two women that play
on a team in Phoenix and they're in a

519
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:22,820
relationship and they're
actually engaged and um,

520
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,270
Brittany something or
other and they got it.

521
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:31,040
They fucking threw down
in the house and uh,

522
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,800
they, they just, they
couldn't break them up.

523
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,190
The couldn't bring me talking about to
fucking athletes competing at the top of

524
00:31:37,191 --> 00:31:40,940
their game. All right. You don't
get there by Quinten do you?

525
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,230
So these two fucking type a people,

526
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:48,260
I guess go at it and they just kicked
the shit out of each other and then even

527
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:50,330
their relatives finally
had to call the cops.

528
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,460
And this is the coolest
part in the end of it.

529
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,530
They neither one of them press charges.

530
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,300
So all they got booked on was suspicion
of beating the shit out of somebody else.

531
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,190
Um,
that's a solid move right there.

532
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,930
I think in, in the end, I think
there's still love there, right?

533
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,850
Neither want to press charges.
So you figure if I'm a cop,

534
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:16,640
so I got to look at that. Like that's
like offsetting penalties. You know,

535
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:20,000
we've got multiple files on the play.
Personal file.

536
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,930
Brittany watch her face for
punching to Lula so-and-so

537
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,130
right in the mouth.
She said she had a tooth mark on her own,

538
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:33,110
a fist and we got another personal
foul on the other side. Uh,

539
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,530
kicked to the clam by Talulah.
What's her face?

540
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,140
Those penalties offset replay the down.
That's how I look

541
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,580
at it.
I think it's fine.

542
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,470
Obviously they're going to have to
find a more mature way to settle their

543
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:50,190
problems. Why can't you just
do that? You know what I mean?

544
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,670
If you're in a relationship,
you're in a same sex relationship.

545
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,410
Shouldn't they be allowed if
they want to, to just, you know,

546
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:01,260
cause now you're talking to essentially,
um,

547
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,540
well I guess you'd have to be in the
same way class. All right. Um, I'm,

548
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,360
I'm lobbying for this right now,

549
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,990
just so we can keep the jail's
not as overcrowded. How about it,

550
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:12,090
if you're in a same sex relationship,

551
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,040
if your partner is in
the same weight class,

552
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:21,540
is you all right?
If you guys throw down not enough,

553
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,840
one beats the shit out of the other,
but if he bolts, just say, you know,

554
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,780
you want to fucking do this,
right? They fucking go at it.

555
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,910
And if they're just fine,

556
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:35,550
he's just settle it the way it did
with your older brother. Right.

557
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:39,000
You just fought and then that was it. You
fight till you're tired, you were done.

558
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,130
And the cops don't have to show
up. There's no problems, you know,

559
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,580
that'd be in Debbie. Okay.
That'd be a nice thing. Right.

560
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,400
Oh Jeez. I wonder if I could
do that. You know what I mean?

561
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,580
What if,
what if your wife is a UFC champion?

562
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:09,170
Okay. And you don't have any training
like me, right? All you have is a,

563
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,070
I'm going to get you in a headlock.
Why you get me in a headlock?

564
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:16,750
I'll never squeeze harder wins,
okay? If you were in a relationship,

565
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,570
you didn't know how to fight,
but your wife was a a,

566
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,030
a UFC champion.

567
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,560
Mrs. Such a stupid thing because
you're going to loose instantly.

568
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,840
If you guys watched any of those videos
where a, what's your face? Ronda Rousey.

569
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,090
There's always some dumb, goofy guy
that'll be like, hey Ron, you know,

570
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,140
put me in a fucking show called, oh
hey Ron, to do that little fucking,

571
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,650
that judo flip. I watched one. This
guy has, you're doing. It's like,

572
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,820
why would you do that?

573
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,810
She's a champion at beating the
shit out of people you think keep,

574
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:56,260
she never had a fight.

575
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,500
Some broad decides that you are you
sitting there with your man tits,

576
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,030
you should be wearing a sports bra,
sir. She fucking grabbed this dude,

577
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,970
threw him over. I got to give it up
to the guy. If she did that to me,

578
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:12,990
I think I would've died.
I definitely want to, God,

579
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:14,860
I remember it back in the
day when you played football,

580
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:18,010
when the ground was frozen and
when you were a little kid,

581
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,650
I remember the first time you discovered
that you could actually get the wind

582
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,640
knocked out of you by getting hit in the
back. That's what she did to this guy.

583
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:29,380
She fucking flipped the dude. He was
trying to be wacky. Hey, let me, you know,

584
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:31,360
let me go up here and uh,
you know,

585
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:34,930
fuck with this judo champion slash
you up mixed martial arts champion.

586
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,340
She fucking threw him over his hip and

587
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,690
he's laying on the ground and he's making
all these noises and she's laughing,

588
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,260
thinking he's fucking around and he
starts going up. It felt my ribs.

589
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,800
It's just going, oh no. And
he goes, I heard it crack

590
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,180
fucking over a fucking over man.

591
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,550
That would be the funniest shit ever.
If, if you were in a relationship with,

592
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,190
with a woman's UFC champion,

593
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:08,610
just to just flip that dynamic,

594
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,210
I guess they already made a movie
they made Norbert was like that.

595
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,800
But it would be funnier if she actually
had like judo skills. Like, honey,

596
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:19,930
I don't want to go to the mall and she
looks at you like, all right, I'm kidding.

597
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,360
My jacket it, nobody would
have sympathy for you.

598
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,760
Allowed your pussy go down to the fucking
strip mall, start taking some classes.

599
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,990
You know, you start taking, you'd
have to take some classes, you know,

600
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:37,620
on the slide without a no one.
When she comes home,

601
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:40,380
she thinks she's cheating on her
and she's fucking you. I Dunno,

602
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,370
she's gotten me a triangle.
Right.

603
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,570
And uh,
they will happen is either,

604
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:52,500
then you tell her that you're taking
the classes or what happens is,

605
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,030
is the next time your play fight and you
try a couple of fucking moves that you

606
00:36:57,031 --> 00:37:00,360
learned, you know, except get thrown
him. Like, I just learned this,

607
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:04,290
punched down to this at a strip mall,
which she's fought for real,

608
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,030
you know, and maybe it just sets her
off like she can't get, you know,

609
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,150
once she turned one, she flips that
switch. You can't shut it off. Right.

610
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,640
You wake up 40 minutes later, she's
crying. Holding both sides of your head.

611
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,590
I'm sorry baby.
I'm sorry

612
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,270
you did that spinning
back fist and I just, I,

613
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,000
I went somewhere else.
I'm sorry.

614
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,480
Don't want to work the next day. And
your wife knock you out again. Yeah.

615
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,350
Taking all that shit.
Would it be worth it?

616
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,180
I think would be. I think
we would be, I'd be looking,

617
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:44,420
you gotta teach me some Shit,
right?

618
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,280
Okay.

619
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,120
That'd be awesome. Oh God. I don't know.
Anyways, that's the Monday morning.

620
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:52,460
I had the Thursday, the
Thursday afternoon, uh,

621
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,380
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.
This is what it's been a,

622
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,680
now we're going to go take you back to
a classic clip from, from way back when?

623
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,760
From a, the end of the Bush years,
or maybe Obama was already an office.

624
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:08,270
I don't know where they
really, a different president.
I don't think they are.

625
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,580
I think it's the same guy.
I think it's a fucking mannequin.

626
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,550
And they take it out and this time
they decided to stick a little fucking,

627
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,940
a little Afro. One, a little
Ben Vareen Afro, you know,

628
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,150
maybe throw a little salt and pepper in
there. Give him a distinguished look.

629
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,430
That's it. And they just
stick of different voice
recorder in there. Right. Oh,

630
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:28,880
go fuck yourself. I have theories.
Send me Yours. All right.

631
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,920
Hope you enjoy these classic clips.
And uh, thank you for listening.

632
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,020
I'll talk to you on Monday.

633
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,130
[inaudible] [inaudible]

634
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,340
since you've been traveling across
the country for the past decade or so,

635
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,070
urban legend,
you ever heard of

636
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:19,530
urban legends? Uh, I've heard so many good
ones. Um, I, well I grew up in the 80s,

637
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,220
so there was a lot of fear
about age during that time.

638
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,810
And um,

639
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,770
I remember there was an urban
legend about a guy's in a bar.

640
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,940
He made this chick, she's totally smoke
and looks like a fucking supermodel.

641
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,210
They go back to her place,
you know, whenever her hotel,

642
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,910
she gives him the best
blowjob Evan at bang.

643
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:43,980
And I'm inviting the
greatest fucking night ever.

644
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,460
He wakes up the next morning she's gone
and he walks into the bathroom and then

645
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:53,760
on the mirror is written in lipstick.
Congratulations.

646
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,200
Now we both have age,
cause evidently he didn't use a condom.

647
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,160
And I remember being in a room or in
a warehouse believing every word going

648
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,020
really what we do. Where, where
did that happen? I don't know.

649
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,290
[inaudible] road.

650
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,890
And I was a moron. I liked
that one. And I liked a,

651
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,900
there was another one
out there about a guy,

652
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,060
he meets a girl in a bar
and uh, she says, hey,

653
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,910
and she's totally smoking. And
she says, Hey, this is the deal.

654
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:29,280
You can come back to my place, you can do
whatever you want to me, but in any end,

655
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,790
I get to do whatever I want to you. Like,
I was like, yeah, sure. Fucking let's go.

656
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,260
So, you know, he does everything you
could possibly do with a woman, you know,

657
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,430
as an orgasm, everything's great.
And she goes, okay, now it's my turn.

658
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,840
And she ties him down to
the bed. Sorry. Like, okay,

659
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:50,130
she's under this freaky dominator shit,
whatever. She walks out of the room,

660
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,100
closes the door and all of a sudden the
door fucking kicks open and there's a

661
00:40:56,131 --> 00:41:00,930
black dude dressed like Batman. And he
comes in and he fucks the guy in the ass.

662
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,690
And I actually believe that,
like that totally made sense to me.

663
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:08,520
I was like once again,
1819

664
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:15,840
where the dad had, but I don't
know, I think it was in Chelsea.

665
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,330
Um, yeah, probably that one.
And then, then anyone, any,

666
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,200
any of the firecracker, urban
legends, you know, for somebody,

667
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:28,650
put an mat in somebody's back
pocket and blew half his ass off.

668
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,470
I always liked that one. Um,
yeah, I would say that. All right.

669
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,360
And it's the second part
of the question also.

670
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:39,890
Do you believe and Spooky
Supernatural Shit? Yes and no.

671
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:45,260
I believe in outer body experiences.
I believe in some sort of,

672
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,970
uh, I dunno, I don't even afterlife,

673
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,850
but so just some shit that we don't,
we don't understand and we can't tap into.

674
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,800
I definitely believe in that,

675
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:00,200
but I don't believe in ghosts
like there that you know,

676
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,130
that they're going to haunt me. I
just don't get what it goes. Can Do.

677
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,200
You know, it's invisible.
I can't see it. Okay.

678
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:13,710
So what does it rattles a land
and goes booooo. All right,

679
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,330
man, that I get used to
that. And then, um, you know,

680
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,690
the worst he can just be as a pain in
the ass, just not shit off my dresser.

681
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,220
And then I speak really, and then
I can just fuck with him mentally.

682
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,410
Just torture him SPEC really well.
And maybe that's why.

683
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,600
Maybe that's why you're a ghost.
You ever think about that?

684
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,900
Maybe you're just a content in life and
your punishment is you don't get to go

685
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:38,040
anywhere and now you're
trapped in my awful apartment,

686
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:42,760
you know, kind of a fucking
loser ghost. Are you waiting?

687
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:47,450
Why don't you out there looking up
women's skirts and we get gay ghost punch.

688
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:50,460
Go fucking float over to Wa
West, uh, West Hollywood.

689
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,380
It's probably a dude's over there.
You know, he'll get their balls.

690
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,810
I ain't what I'm talking about
here. All right. Um, anyways,

691
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,950
he said my girlfriend is obsessed with
that show. Ghost hunter, hunter hunters.

692
00:43:04,951 --> 00:43:08,340
And I find it ridiculous. Uh, yeah,

693
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:10,860
I find that shows that
shows it's fucking stupid.

694
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,400
It's all all in the editing and they
act like they're going to find something

695
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:18,000
and they don't and they never quite
get like a good angle on the ghost.

696
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,070
You know? It's like if you
had a good angle on the ghost,

697
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,070
you would've kept the
footage and you would,

698
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:28,920
it just could've sold it to any network
out there for millions of dollars.

699
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:32,220
We finally have proof that ghosts exist,
but they never do it.

700
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:33,810
So we shaky handheld.

701
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,120
All right.

702
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,470
This is something that I think a lot of
white people need because not because

703
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:09,250
we're more racist than anybody else,
we just get the,

704
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,380
the consequences of us fucking up is so
much harsher than other people because,

705
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,910
uh, you know, we are the gold
standard when it comes to racist.

706
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,950
We are in the driver's seat right now.

707
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:27,340
We have been in the driver's seat
for awhile, basically beating that.

708
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:32,070
If we are ignorant ass holes, it has way
more effect than when other people are.

709
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,120
You know, back in the day
when other people were running
shit, that's the thing.

710
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:40,380
Whoever's on top, if you're
thinking ignorant, uh, that's
what, that's why, you know,

711
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,500
if you're on top and you're
thinking ignorant shit,

712
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,220
you have to be called on it because,
uh,

713
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,610
just cause he cause the effect that
you can have. You know what I mean?

714
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,980
Like if somebody from Bangladesh fucking
hates me, that's such a stupid example.

715
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,370
Okay. That, that's not a race of people.

716
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,340
I don't even know where Bangladesh's
and I gotta be honest with you.

717
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,020
I don't even know if
that's a city or a country.

718
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,940
Bangladesh have ever seen
that on the prices. Right.

719
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,161
You know,

720
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:16,140
and showcase showdown where selling yet
a Bangladesh and some white trash person

721
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:18,480
like myself to sit with a
confused look on their face.

722
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:22,470
Like I don't know where that is.
Is that where the terrorists are?

723
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:26,850
I don't want to go there, whatever,
like a Filipino people fucking hate me.

724
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:29,220
That doesn't affect my life.
It doesn't,

725
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,240
I'm not going to go and do a
job interview at, at, you know,

726
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,460
Walmart is not run by Filipinos.
You know what I mean? You know,

727
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,340
not saying there's anything wrong
with Filipinos. All right. See what,

728
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:43,470
see what I have to do it. There's a
white person, they'll say, I'm saying,

729
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:46,180
I think that about they'll plead out.
Just we clear hair planner.

730
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,120
I have never had issues.
I got to have a valve and him,

731
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:53,570
I'll fucking all that shit. You got to go
to the Jerry Lewis voice there lady. Um,

732
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,890
so yeah, people have
questions. So here we go.

733
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:59,850
And I think all races should chime
in the questions that you have.

734
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:02,550
If you have feelings about a different
race of people and you just think that

735
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,940
you're thinking something funny, there's
nothing malicious, but is this offensive?

736
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:08,970
Is it racist? This is, this
is the new topic. Okay.

737
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:13,740
And if you feel that I answered these
questions like the ignorant white men that

738
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:18,570
I am, uh, call me out on it. I'm
here. So here we go. This first one,

739
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,020
Bill,
is it racist to call Indians?

740
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,750
Dibble dabbles.
And I'm talking about the Asian ones,

741
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:32,670
not native Americans, I'm guessing by
Dib and Dab as you mean [inaudible] Oh,

742
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:32,990
Dubai.

743
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,860
October two baby to you're
saying like that debit Dabu um,

744
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:43,410
is it racist? Probably,
but it's fucking funny.

745
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,990
So that knocks it down a little bit.

746
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,820
This is what I feel that makes
something like racist. It's like,

747
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,880
like the reason why,
uh,

748
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,320
that one isn't as offensive
is because we haven't,

749
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,910
we never enslaved them. That's the
reason why white and black should,

750
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,450
is so sensitive is because of
the shift that we did to them.

751
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,390
But we haven't really fuck
with those people, you know?

752
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,810
So if the black version of that was,
is it,

753
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:18,630
is it offensive to black people?
Hey man, mother fucker or whatever.

754
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,290
Yes.

755
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,880
That would be offensive if you did some
sort of mocking of the way they spoke.

756
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:25,050
Yes.
That would be,

757
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,700
that would be offensive if some CEO was
giving a speech and I was driving a,

758
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:35,701
actually I was having someone else drive
my town car and we drove by a group of,

759
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:41,020
uh, and uh, they proceeded
to walk forwards again,

760
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,820
you'd have to apologize. So I guess, yeah,

761
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:46,000
I guess technically Duma
Dabo like that would be,

762
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,910
that would be offensive. Is it racist? Um,

763
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,940
this is what I, I really, I really,
it's hard for me to say because it had,

764
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,860
it's what's in your heart, you
know, cause I make fuck I really,

765
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:06,760
I make fun of, of everybody, you know,
I mean I play a game out here. Uh,

766
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:10,540
when someone is make, let me ask you, I've
got a question for you. Is this racist?

767
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,670
I have a game out here when I ride around
with Nia and she does not approve of

768
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:18,910
this to keep her in the clear.
She does not approve this.

769
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,980
When somebody makes a more ronic
move in front of me, you know,

770
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:28,120
driving, you know, just makes
a fucking horrific move.

771
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:31,090
I play a game called old or Asian

772
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,570
and you have to guess when,

773
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:37,480
cause I'm going to pass the person
cause I got to see what they look like.

774
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,420
You know, whenever somebody
does something fucked up,

775
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:42,100
some comedians do great joke about that.

776
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,360
You just want to see what the fuck they
look like. Right. Uh, that's the game.

777
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:51,220
Older Asian. So as I speed up my little
hybrid to try to pull parallel to them,

778
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,190
I always say what he's saying here, what
are you going with all the regime, what?

779
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:57,490
He got older Asian, she goes, I'm
not playing this game. That's mean,

780
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,660
and then I was gone. I'm going to
go with old and then I pull up, oh,

781
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,270
it's fucking Asian, you know, or
Oh, I nailed it. It was an old guy.

782
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,100
So is that racist?
I'm sure it's offensive,

783
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:12,040
but within the context of my own car,
you know,

784
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,240
I'm not yelling at anybody
and I got to admit, you know,

785
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,150
there's a lot of truth in the
fucking game. Yeah. Jesus,

786
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:23,710
I'm gonna have to apologize next week on
the podcast. So I would say that, uh, uh,

787
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,340
Indian people, why don't you
chime in? I would say that, yeah.

788
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:31,290
That they would find that they
would find that offensive. Um,

789
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,730
is it racist? Let me see if I
can use it in a sentence here.

790
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,860
Hey, uh, you know, I called up
customer service and, uh, you know,

791
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:47,010
one of those stupid dog was answered
and tried to tell me that his name was

792
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:51,080
Steve and act like he was in Kentucky.
But I,

793
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:53,930
I know that he was actually an India,
cause what he talked to,

794
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:58,060
he was going Dubak Dabo Woods.
How could I help you? Um,

795
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,520
is it racist?
Probably.

796
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,450
Okay.

797
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,940
You know what, something bad has to
happen between white culture and, uh, or,

798
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:15,360
or western culture in Indians.
So, you know what I mean?

799
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,890
It's like a, it's like you're playing
a team and there's no rivalry.

800
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:26,070
Like patriots verse jets this
year was like a whites and blacks.

801
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,940
It was bad. It was a
lot of hate, you know,

802
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,650
but like patriots verse,
like the Fucking Lions,

803
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,690
you know? Yeah. There's going to be
some shit targets. It's knocked out,

804
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,290
but it still hurts if
somebody says something mean.

805
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,340
I don't really know what the fuck
I'm talking about. All right,

806
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:47,390
let's move to the next one.

807
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,690
The next one on the new controversial
topic on the Monday morning podcast.

808
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,650
Is it racist? All right, here we go. Um,

809
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,020
Bill, I had an interesting experience
today apparently involving me as a racist.

810
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,060
I was walking with two of my coworkers
who are both black. Oh Geez. Here we go.

811
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,090
Um,
we were going to go get some lunch.

812
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,990
One of my coworkers who are
most of friends with, uh,

813
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
did a little high five fist bump shuffle
with one of the female six security

814
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:24,740
guards at the front desk.

815
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,920
Knowing both of them and how
they interact with one another.

816
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,690
I kind of made a in passing
comment to the tune of man,

817
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,950
you guys in your handshakes
while obviously laughing,

818
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:42,310
laughing while obviously laughing at
just how choreographed it was in more or

819
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:45,350
less picturing them in
a studio or something,

820
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:49,850
working out the logistics to get the
fucking handshake. Perfect. Anyways,

821
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,650
we all laughed and moved on and
we got our lunch. All right,

822
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:57,080
so nothing wrong yet.
So you're cool with these people.

823
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,860
You made a joke and everybody laughed.
No problems,

824
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:06,290
no problems so far. Um, however,
after coming back through secure,

825
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,910
uh,
back through security,

826
00:52:07,911 --> 00:52:12,740
I noticed the security guard stopped
me and Kinda had a scowl on her face.

827
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,660
I thought she was mad at me for something,

828
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:19,661
but it turned out she was mad at this
other lady who was black because she

829
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:24,170
overheard my comment and was telling,
uh,

830
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,400
that security guard that she couldn't
believe I had the nerve to say something

831
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:33,320
like that and I should be ashamed
all set to the point where she could,

832
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,243
um,

833
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,210
almost to the point where she could
actually go complain to the human resource

834
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:43,010
people because she was
offended, um, et Cetera,

835
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:44,360
without even considering that.

836
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,920
Maybe just maybe I was talking about the
security guard and my coworker and not

837
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:50,840
all black people now.

838
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:55,040
It being corporate America in all I'm
sure rather than even face apos pos

839
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,900
possibility of any bad press,

840
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:01,160
they'd rather just sweep me out the
door and completely ruined my re any

841
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:05,570
reputation I may or may not hold at the
company just to save their own assets.

842
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,820
I feel I did nothing wrong and had no
intentions of ever doing anything wrong.

843
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:11,743
Anything wrong.

844
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:15,620
I'm not going to go on and on about
how I kissed black babies and trying to

845
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:18,230
rehabilitate inner city
schools because I don't,

846
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,440
but I'm certainly not some corn fed rebel
flag waving ignorant product of what

847
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:25,340
might be incest.

848
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,760
I guess my question is do we really have
to walk on eggshells when we're just

849
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:34,761
making casual conversation that just
any that just any con can pick apart,

850
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,760
select the context that they might think
it is in and then start crying foul.

851
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:42,600
Basically.

852
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,140
I would have liked to call that woman
a cunt and told her to go fuck herself,

853
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,860
but let's just say I was already
kind of worried about my job.

854
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:55,830
All right. See, um, yeah, I think this is,

855
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,860
this is the classic one where you were
fucking around the other two people knew

856
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:02,441
you were fucking around,

857
00:54:02,441 --> 00:54:06,930
but the one person decides to get
offended and then you have to go on TV and

858
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:07,591
apologize.

859
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:12,591
Which personally I think is the wrong
move because when you apologize now it's

860
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:18,090
like you're, you're admitting that you
meant it in a bad way. I mean the apology,

861
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:19,200
I would do that and say, look, you know,

862
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:21,780
I'm sorry that you didn't
understand that I was joking,

863
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,360
but I'm not going to sit here
and apologize like I have any,

864
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,220
any sort of ill will come in your way,
you know,

865
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,990
but I, but just to avoid
the problem in the future,

866
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,711
uh,

867
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:39,330
white people do not use the
expression you guys or you people

868
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,560
when talking about black people, that's
just it. It's just not going to, you're,

869
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:49,500
you're setting yourself up for
someone to get offended. And, um,

870
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,870
there's a weird sort of a push
pull going on with that whole, uh,

871
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,230
you guys and New People thing where I'm

872
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:05,330
with somebody white says that
there becomes this concern of,

873
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:10,500
um, that you're separating.
You're separating like, yeah,

874
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:10,711
you know,

875
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:15,510
you people over there with how you
live your lives and where over here,

876
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,750
black people have that weird relationship
with white people where they're like,

877
00:55:18,751 --> 00:55:23,010
you know, can you stop stealing
our fucking music and our culture?

878
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:28,290
But then like, if something,
you know, hey, let's pave
the streets, you know, well,

879
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,930
make sure you do it in our neighborhood.
We're all in this together, right.

880
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:34,290
All of us together.
You know what I mean?

881
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,520
So it's that weird sort of fucking
push, pull thing going on. So yeah,

882
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,470
just avoid, uh, avoid the whole fucking,

883
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,480
um, yeah, you fucked up.
You didn't fuck up, but you,

884
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,780
you left yourself open for a
sucker punched by saying you guys,

885
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,920
you know, uh, that's, I guess that, that's
what it is. I don't know. That's, that's,

886
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,500
that's my, I basically a white guy
telling a white guy how he fucked up.

887
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:05,880
So black people feel listening
to this. Think, uh, please,
please help me out here.

888
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,370
Did I basically get it right?
Is that essentially it?

889
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:12,540
And I know most people wouldn't get
offended. All right. So there you go.

890
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:16,830
That's the new, that's the new topic.
Is it racist? And I would love to hear,

891
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,380
um, some honest comments from a
nonwhite people about their thoughts.

892
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,990
You know, the fucked up ones too. Okay.

893
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,400
Cause I've watched enough spike Lee movies
to think that evidently it's just us,

894
00:56:32,401 --> 00:56:36,270
but I've hung around enough people from
different races to realize, oh yeah,

895
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,250
everybody's like,

896
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:42,250
[inaudible]

897
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:07,890
[inaudible].
