1

letter l and the number five and they'd be

8
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:31,570
playing that harmonica. Remember that?
The outro music. How the fuck did,

9
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:36,430
I used to know how that
went. Bat Bat, bat that.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,260
That's mash. I don't fucking know. Um,

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,740
well you should probably ask yourself
at this point, what is audible.com?

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,550
It's basically, it's for people who liked
to read books but don't like to read.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,180
You know, you have, it gets sticky
or I going from left to right,

14
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:53,960
left to right or your eyes. If you're
not wearing a patch, you know, people,

15
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:56,570
do you want to read a book but
like don't want to read it.

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,250
I'm going to be nice if it,
you know,

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,270
if you had someone who could just
read it for you, go to audible,

18
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,350
podcast.com/bill and you
could die any book you want.

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,060
I'm a big urban Welsh fan. The acid
house. I liked that one. You know,

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,880
you could read that one if
you wanted or not really.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,480
And then you go to a party
and say you read it. You know,

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,170
it's kind of like fake credentials
except in like a book sense.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,400
C'Mon.
When you drive into work,

25
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,120
just have him read all the classics to
you and then you'll actually seem like

26
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:33,860
you're well read and you're not.
It's perfect.

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,780
You don't need to read a map anymore.

28
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:40,460
He does have that broad in your car
going may go left and seven seconds.

29
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,460
Right now you can just have
some guy reading the book.

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,980
Once upon a time in a galaxy far,
far away. They live these people.

31
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:51,650
You fucking nerd. Um, all right,

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,210
this is the Monday morning podcasts for
you people. This is was a brutal, brutal,

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,440
brutal. Not Funny, fucking
weak in the world, you know,

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,450
as opposed to what Phil, all the happy
go lucky w you know, weeks in the world.

35
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,950
You know what I'm talking about?
Very tragic, tragic fucking week.

36
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:10,761
And today I woke,

37
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:15,761
I woke up to more tragedy or the
ending of a tragedy via Paul Versey,

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,870
Vir, z. I few people trying to find
them on Twitter. Versie v, I, R. Z.

39
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:24,070
I don't, I call it what I say. Um,

40
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,020
he called me up and he texted me, he goes,
dude, you wash and you watching this,

41
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:33,380
they're cleaning house
epic cleaning house.

42
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:36,410
And I thought he was talking about
the red sox. You know what I mean?

43
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,701
Which by the way,

44
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:42,701
I'm in Boston right now and
I don't understand why the
fuck everybody's so down

45
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:47,120
on the red sox. If 48 and 48 they 583
and a half games out of second place.

46
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,170
Who gives a fuck? You know,
the ebb and flow of life.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,770
They want to world series. Now they're
going through a low point, you know,

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,910
why are you acting like in your own life?
You make the playoffs every,

49
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,000
you hold up the championship, you know,
and they asked you, you know, hey,

50
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:07,160
what's it a, you know, what's
it like to be a championship?

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,420
What do you got to say about finally
winning the championship and then you go,

52
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,910
it's about that time.

53
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,280
Yeah.

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,390
That might've been the worst.
Just winning a championship quote ever.

55
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:26,310
Lebron James J was broad King James,
you follow the,

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,280
I had to bow diab die. Well, why
didn't you just go, you know,

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,600
I just want to thank my teammates and the
feds are being supportive of, you know,

58
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,960
it's just, it's an unbelievable I
words you can't put it into words.

59
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,430
It's something like that. So
it's about that died, you know,

60
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,923
I dunno.

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,260
His stupid fucking agent's probably
going to try to trademark that and just

62
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:50,110
start having him say that. And
every stupid commercial, you know,

63
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,580
advertising toasters, toast
pops up. It's about Dab, Dab,

64
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,800
cut Lebron. You know, when you're
saying it's about damn time,

65
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:04,801
it seems like you're saying that the
toaster takes too long to toast the bread,

66
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,660
you know? Okay. No, I'm not saying
that he has it. I wasn't aware,

67
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,200
I couldn't talk to him. I'm sorry. Who and
who are you? White guy in a suit. Okay.

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,560
All right. Okay. Well we'll
fix it in the Edney. Oh, Gigi.

69
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,380
She um, yeah, it was just a
brutal fucking brutal fucking day.

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,250
Brutal fucking week.
Not a lot of funny shit.

71
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,580
Where the fuck is my phone buzzing
right now? Hang on a second.

72
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,103
Fuck that phone.

73
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,380
Fuck that phone in his ass. You
know what? Speaking of just brutal,

74
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:42,381
you know I had one of the worst
nightmares I've had in forever last night.

75
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,081
All right.

76
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm laying in a hotel room here and
right now you should be asking yourself,

77
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,380
bill,
it's Monday.

78
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,130
You usually home or you're flying
back from some God forsaken place.

79
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,540
Why are you on the road? Why are you
in Boston? You want vacation? Do it.

80
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,130
What are you doing?
You taking a booze cruise?

81
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,703
MMM.

82
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,200
I am a actually buy books, some
acting work to be honest with you. Um,

83
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,790
I'm shooting a pilot out here.

84
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,840
They are redoing the kid shows zoom from
back in the day they're going to do a

85
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,290
reboot. And, uh, I
booked the Gig. You know,

86
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,270
I'd like to think it was
because of my acting ability,

87
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:19,210
but I think it was because I remembered
the jingle from way back in the day.

88
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:23,350
Right? Zoom z double o m box
three five Oh Boston mass.

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,310
Oh two one three four.
Set it to zoom.

90
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,730
And I pointed right at the cast director,
right casting director.

91
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,800
She had a zoom on zoom. I took it
out, right? Like a fucking gun.

92
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,580
And they were just like, wow, this kid's
got the fire. We've got to hire him.

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,360
Get him in a striped shirt. Anybody
used to watch that? So zoom,

94
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,750
I think it was a very like local Boston
show where it was just these burnout

95
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:47,590
fucking kids.

96
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,190
Okay.

97
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,890
You ever seen a kid like five years old
and he already looks like he's got a

98
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,050
coke problem.
That's what like zoom was

99
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,880
and they're doing a reboot.
They're rebooting it up. You know,

100
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:05,510
I had an idea to do a
prequel to my, my, my,

101
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,260
I have three standup specials. I've got
one more coming out in October. Right.

102
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,680
So I got a three, you know,
so that would be my star wars,

103
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,980
empire strikes back and
fucking return of the Jedi.

104
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,050
So now I should do like a prequel.
Okay, I should fucking grow my hair out.

105
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:25,790
What's left of it and get like a fucking
red wig to put on top of like a Gabe

106
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,791
Kaplan Afro and just go out there
and do like topical humor from like,

107
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:35,390
I don't know, 1982,
you know, go out there.

108
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,170
Well doing some bad Ronald Reagan
impression and I figured, you know what,

109
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:41,180
that'd be funny for about 20 seconds.

110
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,350
Then what do you do for the other
fucking 59 minutes, 40 seconds.

111
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,050
And then there it goes that day. You
know what? I should just do a trailer,

112
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,020
a prequel. Ah, Jesus, who
gives a fuck. Um, anyways,

113
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,063
anyway,

114
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,780
uh, it's just, just been a brutal week.

115
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,510
So I turned on the TV to see
what verse he's talking about,

116
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,930
what he was talking about.
And it's um,

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,540
no, wait, let me get back to the red sox
here before I get into that shit. Ah,

118
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,180
I'm all right with the red sox sucking.

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,200
I actually liked them more now
that they're not doing well.

120
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,380
You know, I know this is, this is when,

121
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,460
this is, when you see who the real fans
are and who aren't it people won't do it.

122
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,550
You Know Those Guys Bandwagon Bandwagon.

123
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:33,551
You bought your first hat after game
seven of 2004 I'll maybe game five,

124
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,840
you know, if fucking break with your
green monster tickets. You can't

125
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,540
sit down in the bleachers like the rest
of us. No, it's fucking awful blue seats

126
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,570
right by. You should go to games,
right? There'd be nobody fucking there.

127
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,410
Just baseball fans before ESPN ruined
it and just so inundated the phone.

128
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,420
Maybe it's, we just like out fucked
our stadiums. I don't know what it is.

129
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,150
There's so many goddamn people now.
I remember back in the day,

130
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:02,110
you'd go to a game,
you know,

131
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:05,470
just having a good fucking time and
they'd always be some guy and he'd have,

132
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,010
there'd be an empty seat on either side
of him. And that's how we get that,

133
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,820
you know, you know, let's
go shocks then going,

134
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,780
he would just slam both chairs down.
You know, the cause it fold up shares,

135
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,690
right? That Jesus built. Can
you paint a better picture here?

136
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:23,530
If you lose an us and he'd be slamming
both of them down and everybody be

137
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:24,730
hammered and you know,

138
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,760
there'd be maybe five people there who
had like some sort of like Red Sox,

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,770
Actual Jersey on. Other
than that, you had a hat.

140
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,460
You just fucking,
Jesus it counting down some out there.

141
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,610
I'm near the water near the water.
Fucking coast Gad.

142
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,123
Um,

143
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,920
yeah, like you, you, you'd have
a red sox hat. That was it.

144
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:56,220
And he had the piece of
shit, one the one size, all,

145
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,480
you didn't have like the same one
that Clemens was wearing and you know,

146
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,770
and now you go to the God damn games.

147
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,840
It's like people did their fucking
wearing the whole damn thing.

148
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,250
Everybody's walking around, they look like
managers. You don't like bull pit lake.

149
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:12,300
There's like, they should
be in the bullpen. So I like
it. I liked that they suck.

150
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,350
I liked that. The trailing off. I
like that. I'm starting to see, uh,

151
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,740
some empty seats. It's
bringing me back. You know,

152
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,330
if they could just stop singing that
fucking song during the seventh inning

153
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:28,140
stretch and if they could just get
rid of that stupid fucking mascot.

154
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,630
All right. I understand. While you're
doing it for a marketing reason,

155
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:38,450
I totally get that to try to get kids
hooked into the gate. Why don't you,

156
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:42,410
you know, you know, I got into the game,

157
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:46,430
I went to the game and I enjoyed
fucking watching the game. That's it.

158
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,070
I went there and I was sold
the second I walked in there.

159
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,660
I didn't need some big fucking muppet
coming up to me in some creepy way. And,

160
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:56,600
but it's like, you know, you cut its
tongue out so it can't talk to me.

161
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,030
I fucking hate that about mascots.
I hate how they won't talk to you.

162
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:03,110
What do you go? Hey, what's up man? And
then they do that real fucking hyper nod.

163
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,750
It's like, I know there's
a guy in there. You idiot.

164
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,960
There's no fucking kids around. You
can't give me, hey man, what's going on?

165
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,680
It's fucking hot as fuck in here. All
right ma'am. Oh, here comes from kids.

166
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:15,890
I've got to shut up. You
know, can't do that. I mean,

167
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:20,570
how much are they really paying
you a game? All right. So anyways,

168
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,870
Versie was talking about a,

169
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,920
he was talking about Penn state, like
all those sanctions against Penn state.

170
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:32,040
Dude, it's fucking
brutal. Like I, I don't,

171
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,270
I don't think that the
punishment is in the right area.

172
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,220
I don't get it.

173
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,450
Why are you punishing
the players in the fans?

174
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,900
You're acting like they look the why
did the winds don't count from 2000 from

175
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:51,620
1998 to 2011 why don't those games count?

176
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,340
He won those fucking games.
You know what I mean?

177
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,120
That would be like if,
if fucking, I don't know

178
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,050
if Mark Sanchez gets arrested for
drinking and driving, right? Does his,

179
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,680
you know,
if they beat the dolphins the week before,

180
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:13,390
does it not count what the fuck is
drinking and drive and have to do with

181
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,850
whether, you know, you beat the dolphins
or not? I don't, I don't get that. Like,

182
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,210
so now all these players that played for
Penn state who now sit around probably

183
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:24,330
get together every couple
of years for union. Amen.

184
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,780
At that time we played Clemson,
you know,

185
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:28,900
sitting there with a cigar and scarred
up knees and they want to tell a war

186
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,870
story. Oh yeah. That
doesn't count anymore. Why?

187
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,520
Because somebody fuck the
kid. I didn't, you didn't,

188
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,460
nobody played the game.
Did nobody did. Yeah.

189
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,850
Can I at it happened during the game and
they played the game around the crime.

190
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,590
I mean, it's a fucking
horrible crime, but I,

191
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,650
I think what they're trying
to do is just a race,

192
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,970
Joe fraternals name off
of any all time a list.

193
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,240
They don't want his name up there.
You know what I mean? And, um,

194
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,020
I dunno, I just don't
think it's, it's, uh,

195
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,190
I don't think that that's right.
I think that those victories should count.

196
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,580
Yeah,

197
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,170
he fucking won those games.

198
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,360
That doesn't make any sense of what
the fuck is going out there on outside.

199
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,320
You know what,
I'll write out the winter,

200
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:20,070
they've got a couple of coast guard and
thinks and has probably some fucking

201
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,540
idiots went out on a god
damn dinghy every year.

202
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,730
Some stupid fucking kids do that.
Right.

203
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,210
And they had the stupid a memorial

204
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,450
little Stevie sure. Rip By and
uh, Mike, uh, mark and which,

205
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,080
you know, they was going to do that
shit and just have some sort of like a,

206
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,010
whenever there's a tragedy you got to
have some sort of like metaphor, you know,

207
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:47,520
water is, uh, it's the liquid of life.

208
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,310
It, where did a Stevie, she rep Mike
Berkowitz went out of their diggy. Uh,

209
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,020
they realized that that uh,

210
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,580
life nectar could also be a,

211
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,700
I really talked myself in a corner here,

212
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,070
have an I how they fucking drought and uh,

213
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,130
we found the raft
that would be the worst doing that.

214
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,570
Um, I don't know dude. It's
just been a brutal fucking week.

215
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,090
I feel bad for Penn state players.

216
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,300
I feel bad for their fans cause I feel
like they getting punished too and they

217
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,430
didn't do a fucking thing.
Okay.

218
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,330
It's a great fucking football
program and it's fucking,

219
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:30,480
I can't even wrap my head around that.
Joe Paterno was involved in that.

220
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,460
I mean this is the biggest sports mind
fucks since Oj Simpson, you gotta stand.

221
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,270
Oj To me was,
you know,

222
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,870
was the juice 2000 yards
in a 14 game season.

223
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,660
Um, those hertz rental car
commercials, Monday night football,

224
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,560
I even watched this bad movies like when
he played that astronaut and it didn't

225
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:53,000
make it to the moon and then
they tried to kill him, you know,

226
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,600
and the two white astronauts coast,

227
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,760
they killed Oj cause that's
how it always worked back then.

228
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,110
If you watched any def jam comedy,

229
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:01,080
they'll let you know the black I always
died and those movies right through the

230
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:05,190
naked gun and then out of nowhere he's
on trial for a fucking double murder and

231
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:08,880
he's got to look on his face like, yes, I
did this shit. How do I get out of this?

232
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,430
Um, this is the biggest, I think,

233
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:15,510
mindful as far as like who you thought
somebody was and then what the fuck they

234
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:19,170
were involved in. It's just brutal
and there's nothing funny about it.

235
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,950
So let's move on.
Let's move on.

236
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,470
Um, all right, let's
continue with this sports.

237
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,200
Okay.

238
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,960
Uh, as of right now, Dwight
Howard isn't a Laker,

239
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:34,790
but if Dwight Howard goes to the Lakers,
you know,

240
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,140
in Colby wins his sixth championship,

241
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,930
I am not going to engage in that argument
that he's now equaled Michael Jordan.

242
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,980
Anybody who comes up to me, I am,
as you say, comes out of your mouth.

243
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:51,130
I'm going to kick you right in the balls.
All right.

244
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,460
Look, you know, this is the
steroid era in baseball.

245
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,590
There has to be the pylon era. You
got to put that in there. Okay.

246
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Michael Jordan won six championships with
Bill Cartwright and Luc Longley as his

247
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:08,720
fucking centers.

248
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,900
How long do you think Colby Bryant
would tolerate that before he demanded a

249
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:18,890
trade. Okay. This guy
won three championships,

250
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,030
was Shaquille.
He got Shaquille O'Neal and Phil Jackson.

251
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,160
He got them brought to his team
and I know what you think of. Well,

252
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:30,790
Michael Jordan had Phil Jackson.
Phil Jackson was nobody.

253
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,560
He became a legend coach
and Michael Jordan. Okay.

254
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,160
And I'm not taking anything away from
this guy, but when the Bulls got him,

255
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:43,390
it wasn't like, oh, they got Phil Jackson.
This guy knows how to win. He was nobody.

256
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:47,980
He was an ex nick who want it
and 73 as a player. That was it.

257
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,720
He came in with is, hey man,
fucking Afro and mustache.

258
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,880
That was it. Okay. And
Chicago was rebuilding. Oh,

259
00:15:57,881 --> 00:16:02,100
they had Scottie Pippin. He came
from this system. All right.

260
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
They signed Dennis Rodman.
One fucking guy.

261
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,973
Okay.

262
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,820
They won with fucking Bill Cartwright,
Luke Longly,

263
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,620
Bj Armstrong,
that Mormon with the blonde hair.

264
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,983
Okay.

265
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,230
Before Jordan came along,

266
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,520
it was considered impossible to win
without a fucking big name center.

267
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,300
You had to get a big name
center. You had to, okay,

268
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,460
the guy totally changed the fucking game.

269
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,020
And I'm so sick of these
fucking bean counters who go,
well, he has six gib chips,

270
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,160
ed, he has five. Therefore, if he gets one
world championship, it is the same thing.

271
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,890
It's like all these people who watched,
uh,

272
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,790
whoever the fuck it was break Dan Marino's
passing record and they don't even

273
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:51,440
look at the fact of all
the passing rules changes.

274
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,860
I mean, they say that hitting a curve
balls. The toughest thing in sports,

275
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:58,070
I think at this point covering a
receiver is because you've basically

276
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:03,130
essentially made it a legal past five
yards down the fucking field are out.

277
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:06,410
Jesus, he's on a soapbox. He's
on his soapbox. All right,

278
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,030
so now if Dwight Howard goes to
the fucking Lakers, it's just like,

279
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,190
I don't get,
I tweeted about this,

280
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,670
like the amount of shit that the Miami
Heat got for having a pylon championship.

281
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,790
Coby Brian has been part of a pile
on fucking team from about 1999 on,

282
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,930
that's all I'm saying. Okay. And
I don't want you to take a, well,

283
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:30,980
Boston did it in 2008 yes they did.
That was a pylon championship team.

284
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,850
I don't look at that team like,
that's like the 86 Celtics or the 84 team.

285
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:39,650
I don't, okay. I wasn't
a fan of what went ha,

286
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,340
what happened there either,
you know,

287
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,730
but doing it once versus doing it every
year for 15 fucking years. You mean?

288
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:50,040
You know you're making a pile on
team and like the NBA in and blocks

289
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,570
of fucking trade. You know when even
they're sitting there going like,

290
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:57,270
all right guys, this is getting a little
fucking ridiculous. Don't you think?

291
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,810
You know what I mean? Ah, I'll get a
ton of shit for that too. All right,

292
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,840
let's just, let's just get
it. Let's just read Christ.

293
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:08,310
I'm all over the Goddamn map here. Let's
just read something. Advice here. Advice.

294
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,350
Uh, 37 and at the end of
the love road, Jesus Christ,

295
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,350
I thought we were going to pull out
of the fucking dirt here. Hey Bill,

296
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:21,080
I'm 37 years old and I've never had sex
with a woman I've been in love with. Oh,

297
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,220
I thought you said he never had sex. I
was just gonna be like, all right dude.

298
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:27,210
Well that's a wrap. A dream is over. Or
just go out and get yourself a hooker.

299
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,530
All right?
And like the thickest fucking condom ever.

300
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,230
Um, anyways, I'm 37 years old and
I've never had sex with a woman.

301
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,700
Don't you hate on these fucking Max when
just some application just keeps, what?

302
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,220
Why is it just keep bouncing up and down?
I see you.

303
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,060
It's like the fucking nerd in the back
of the class who? I know the answer.

304
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,020
I know the answer. Um, I'm 37
years old and I've never had,

305
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,350
I've never had sex with a woman I've
been in love with or liked strongly.

306
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,250
I've fallen in love with many beautiful
young women over my long run by my

307
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:05,251
deduction is that I become a total social
retard with those chemicals when those

308
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:08,660
chemicals are coursing
through me by chase a girl,

309
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,220
if I chase a girl, she's turned off
when I'm indifferent. I do. All right.

310
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,460
Okay.

311
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,840
That's good. That basically means
you're coming on too strong dude.

312
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:22,600
It's like a burner turned down
the Gasol though. Do you know,

313
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,250
are you showing up with like fucking

314
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,390
flowers and candy with your hair parted
down the middle the first fucking day?

315
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:33,200
Yeah. You're going to freak her out.
Um, anyways. One, I'm indifferent. I do.

316
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:34,034
All right.

317
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,750
I've kicked a number of women out of
my bed and life after they've made the

318
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:40,130
smallest infraction.

319
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,940
One girl had the greatest sense of
humor and had a perfect athletic body.

320
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,983
I threw,

321
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,310
I threw her out one night because she
was eating chicken wings in my bed.

322
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,300
Okay.

323
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,970
Only because I didn't have that.
Um,

324
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,240
only because I didn't have that emotion
that made me want to chase her down or

325
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:59,850
keeper. Otherwise, I think she was great.

326
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,390
You broke up with a girl because
he was eating chicken wings in bed.

327
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,770
How was your lock? The door test? Um,

328
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,640
yeah,

329
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,270
of course.

330
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,080
Now I get that love feeling less and
less frequently as I get older and my

331
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:18,280
failure to grow mature with the woman
over the years has given me an Anthony

332
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,820
Kumi, a complex, I only
want young fit chicks.

333
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,440
But now after years of living with a
void in my social life and being daily

334
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:30,610
devoted to girls of the Internet,
I finally fell for another real girl,

335
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:34,750
a young professional personal trainer
who joined my beach volleyball team.

336
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,340
I'll fuck you with your
hot ass. Ah, Jesus.

337
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:44,110
Look at this fucking guy. He probably
looks like a fucking James Bond.

338
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,070
The other chicken, our team tried
to convince that this new girl

339
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,190
was interested in me. Oh yeah. All
these chicks trying to help you out.

340
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:55,240
What is she was blowing you? Uh, the new
girl was showing signs of flirtation,

341
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:58,930
but when I made a move, she
fell silent. I am an old man.

342
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,460
My question to you is,

343
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,530
since hand guns are illegal and very hard
to find outside of the urban areas of

344
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,820
my country,
of Canada,

345
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,440
should I get a sling shot and shoot myself
over and over in the head with acorns

346
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:14,410
until I'm dead?
Or at least until I am particularly,

347
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,480
I am less particular about what
kind of vagina falls onto my cock.

348
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,373
MMM.

349
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,220
Yeah. Dude, you got, you got, you got
to make a pick here. You 37 years old,

350
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:29,550
you're drafting in the later rounds.
She's still trying to pick up a blue chip.

351
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:31,350
It ain't there. I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

352
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,540
You can take a risk on one,
but you know, I think, uh,

353
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,070
okay.

354
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,550
Yeah,

355
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,510
I think you've got to look at the douchey
qualities that yourself and realize

356
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,940
that they're putting up with you on
whatever the fuck it is that you do.

357
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,503
You know?

358
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,780
Um, you're only 37 years old.
Fortunately that's still young.

359
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,030
Back in the day, you
know, Ben Franklins Day,

360
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:57,940
you'd look like you were 106 and it
would be over and you'd have fucking

361
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:02,380
tuberculosis, you know, wheezing
that you never fucking found love.

362
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,260
So you're fine.
You're playing volleyball.

363
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,270
You just sound like an in shape guy
who keeps banging all these hotties.

364
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:09,190
But woe is me. Can't
find love. You know what?

365
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:10,810
Go Fuck yourself and your awesome life,

366
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,600
Huh?

367
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,120
You can't find love and you're
all fucking, you just, Oh,

368
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:18,870
I just keep fucking one personal 22
year old personal trainer after another.

369
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:23,370
This is a problem. Look, if you
want to find love, I, I would, uh,

370
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,860
I would stay single until you found it.

371
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,963
You know,

372
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,310
I think you like women just
being infatuated with you
and playing with your hair

373
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,780
and telling you how
amazing you are as you can.

374
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,930
No,
no.

375
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,980
And then he keeps saying, yeah,
look at you. You're not that old.

376
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,910
You still have four abs. Right.
I think you like all of that.

377
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,850
I think you'll like that
fucking attention. I saw a
guy like that this weekend,

378
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:48,010
right?
So hanging out with the lovely Nia,

379
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,280
we went to this Mexican
restaurant and this guy shows up,

380
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:54,310
right dress like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

381
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,480
And when he lost a little bit of weight
and he was promoting terminator two on

382
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:01,800
our [inaudible] Hall and he came
out in that Leather Ensemble, uh,

383
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,570
that's how the guy was dressed.
Any comes in with this?

384
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:07,420
Absolutely fucking smoking.

385
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,250
Okay.

386
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,490
I don't know.
Brazilian are meaning out of Iranian.

387
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:17,491
I don't know what the fuck she was fucking
smoking hot chick with like this lime

388
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:20,144
green.

389
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,680
I don't even know what I gotta know
what the fuck she was wearing it like,

390
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:30,520
you know, showed like her fucking
flat stomach, her fucking round ass.

391
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,381
Yeah,
I was checking.

392
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:33,660
I think it's one of those girls you
can check out right in front of your

393
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:36,960
girlfriend and she doesn't give a shit.
You know, she's like checking her out too,

394
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:41,910
like at the end, but pitches
hot. Um, so the bartender cards,

395
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,010
the guy was,
she loves because

396
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,190
he thinks it means that he thinks
that he's fucking 21 you know,

397
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,850
the guy looked like he was 50 and he
just goes, he's like my friend, he goes,

398
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,220
how we'll do that guy.

399
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,230
Yet he has this big cheesy date rapes
smile with his awful fucking beard.

400
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,350
And he's just like, how old do you
think I am? Right. And the guy goes,

401
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:08,120
I don't know, 35 right.
And the Nia goes like,

402
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:10,430
fucking like, you know, like goes,

403
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,320
makes us gesture of like way higher way.
I fucking burst out laughing,

404
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,340
but I don't think the guy saw,

405
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:20,210
because he was so full of them that he
actually didn't realize that this kid was

406
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,580
just working for his tip. It's
like, dude, you look like you're 50.

407
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,630
And he goes and he's like, I am 48.
You seem like one of those guys,

408
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,000
like you're out there
hooking up with them.

409
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,210
So I would say stop being
such as self involved,

410
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,300
douchebag and realize that
you have faults yourself.

411
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,020
Get over yourself.
All right.

412
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,400
You're actually starting to cause your
cause just starting to slip into those.

413
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:47,030
Uh, I'm not getting, you know, you're in
your David Hasselhoff ears. Who's kidding?

414
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:47,864
Who.

415
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,190
Okay.

416
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,430
But you know, if you're going to be in
those years and you haven't found love,

417
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,930
you're doing it the best way ever.

418
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,580
Banging personal trainers
and a volleyball players. Um,

419
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,730
in any ways. That's, that's the
picture that you painted yourself.

420
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:08,930
You could be a tub of shit cause you are
playing volleyball in Canada. I mean,

421
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,220
I don't know how many weeks a
year you can do that up there.

422
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,750
I can't tell if this is like the picture
that you painted is who you really are

423
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:20,050
or if you're in even bigger psycho
and you actually don't look like that,

424
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,650
but that's how you picture
yourself. Um, yeah. I, I would,

425
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:26,650
my advice would be get over
yourself and realize that, um,

426
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,733
you know,

427
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,360
I know. Yeah, I'm talking myself into
circles. I have no fucking idea. Oh,

428
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:37,510
do you know I ruined a
woman's Day at the mall.

429
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:39,700
I just remembered that
this woman in a wheelchair.

430
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,200
Okay.

431
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,370
I ruined a woman,

432
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,400
an old woman in a wheelchair his day at
the mall and it's been killing me for

433
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:52,130
like the last two days is what happened.
Me and Nia,

434
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:56,930
we were leaving the mall, the mall. Okay.
And we wait for the elevator opened.

435
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,660
The elevator opens and all you
see is this beautiful babies.

436
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,720
This the first thing you see when the
doors open is this baby laying in a,

437
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,970
in a stroller looking up big blue eyes.
One of those Gerber looking babies, right.

438
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,540
And me and Ian both go ah, second we see.
But like how are you doing? You know,

439
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:14,000
talking like baby talk to
it and saying the mother,

440
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:16,430
how good looking the kid is
and all that type of shit.

441
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,760
And with Gugu Gaga and
about the fucking baby.

442
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,880
And she gets off the doors
open when the door is open,

443
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:27,170
the first thing we see is this old lady
in a wheelchair being pushed by some

444
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:32,171
lady and you know they back up and the
woman with the baby gets off the elevator

445
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,890
and then the woman starts pushing the
old lady in to the elevator and she's go,

446
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,450
is this going up? Is it going
up? I'm going, it's going down.

447
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,010
And it's one of those things that's like
tension because the doors are starting

448
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:46,410
to close. So even though I
keep saying it's going down,

449
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,970
the ladies not hearing me cause all
she's focusing on is the door she says is

450
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,440
going up, is it going up? It's gone
down, it's going to. And I finally got,

451
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:58,441
it's going down like I yelled over the
fucking old lady's head so the old lady

452
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,790
looks up, she just goes, okay, thank you.

453
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,940
And I totally knew in that
moment that she was just like,

454
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,160
you were talking to her
like I wasn't even here.

455
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,250
You didn't even can
acknowledge that I was here.

456
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,340
And I realized that in that moment,

457
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,910
and I don't know why I think it
was cause I was talking to a baby,

458
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:21,810
I was still ice and she was
like fragile to my brain.

459
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,050
Went back to talking to the baby
and I just looked at her and I went,

460
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,240
as the doors were closing, I was soon,
okay, bye bye. I said it just like that.

461
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:34,470
And I waved to her like she was a baby.
I don't know why I did it.

462
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,750
And then the door closed
and I immediately,

463
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,320
I immediately looked down at
the floor and shame and Nia,

464
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:43,200
it was one of the hardest
I ever heard her laugh.

465
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,320
She just turned around and face the back
of the elevator and was laughing to the

466
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:54,480
point she couldn't even like get the
words out to ask me why. I just did that.

467
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,590
She kept just going like,

468
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,550
like she just kept getting out the why
part and I just kept going. I don't know.

469
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,780
I don't know why. Just did that. I stuck
my hand out right in her face. You know,

470
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:07,380
you wave to a baby. I did
that. I went, okay, bye bye.

471
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,240
Towards closed.

472
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,960
And I know she was probably thinking
either I was mocking her or that I felt

473
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:18,570
that she wasn't mentally there
anymore and I knew that she was,

474
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,450
and I just feel like shit.
And um,

475
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,780
the reality is is I could've written the
elevator back up and tried to explain

476
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:29,310
myself, but I didn't, I just
walked in shamed in my Prius.

477
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,320
Um, yeah, it was just
a fucking weird week.

478
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,300
The whole fucking week was just weird.

479
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,730
I have one of the worst nightmares I've
ever had in my life last night I was

480
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,131
laying in bed.

481
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:46,230
It's one of those dreams where like
this something trying to get me,

482
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:47,064
but it's like,

483
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,023
yeah,

484
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,920
it's like sort of envy. It's like
a force. He's trying to get me,

485
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:56,190
I know it's going to get me and I
can't fight it or get away from it.

486
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:58,080
And I'm just like,
even like the dream,

487
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:02,250
I'm like laying in bed and I can't
fucking move. And then in the end,

488
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,250
all of a sudden this fucking woman
appears like, just kinda like,

489
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,320
like a ghost, but it looks
like a person. Right. And, uh,

490
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,190
I have my hands clasped
together and she's like,

491
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,180
she had like fucking, uh, like
reddish hair, but like, you know,

492
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:24,800
the uncle and hot chicks
dye their hair red.

493
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:29,030
They're not real red heads like that.
Like almost like a fucking,

494
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,790
I dunno, like a page boy kind of
haircut. She's like a rocket ship.

495
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,750
She had tattoos and like this tank top
on Nice titties and I'm sitting there and

496
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:43,751
I had my hands class and she clasp hands
around my hands and she looked me right

497
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,800
in the eye and goes,
you're going to kill yourself one day.

498
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:53,290
And then she just disappeared
and it fucking freaked me out.

499
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,380
Obviously.
She goes,

500
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:59,860
you're going to kill yourself one
day with this look on her face.

501
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:04,861
Like either she knew or she definitely
knew and that she had killed herself and

502
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:08,170
I was going to join her wherever
the fuck she isn't in the afterlife.

503
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,740
And uh,
I was so fucking scared.

504
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:16,300
It actually woke me up and I wouldn't
open my eyes because I also be afraid that

505
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:19,990
she was going to be standing there
waiting to class my fucking hands again.

506
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,000
How freaky Zen.
Now let me ask you this because you know,

507
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,140
I think about killing myself, but I do
it in a very mainstream fucking way.

508
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,150
Like, you know, okay, bye. Bye. When the
doors close, I wanted to kill myself.

509
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:39,360
I wanted the elevated a land on me,
but I don't really want to kill myself.

510
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,280
So what the fuck does that dream mean?
Anybody wants to do?

511
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,733
Um,

512
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,050
okay.

513
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,430
And I don't believe in go see them.

514
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,660
I think the reason why I had that dream
was because last night I turned out all

515
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:59,430
the lights and I, and I got a
little freaked out because, uh,

516
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,080
my room right is right near the water

517
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,290
and it was this really
weird reflection and uh,

518
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,950
I had some weird shadows and stuff.

519
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:12,330
So what I always do when I get freaked
out like that is this is the stupidest

520
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:17,280
thing ever is I give the finger
to the shadow. That's what I do.

521
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,400
It's something I learned when I was
a kid because if it is a monster,

522
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:25,110
it's not going to put up with that.
Right?

523
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,110
It's immediately going to come
over and do something to me.

524
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:32,220
So if I give it the finger and it doesn't
do anything that when I was a kid it

525
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:36,780
just let me know that it wasn't a monster
or that it was a fucking pussy and it

526
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:38,670
wasn't, it didn't have it in it, you know,

527
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,060
it didn't have that killer
instinct and it was just going to,

528
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:45,750
it was just good to just stay over there
in the corner, which I was fine with.

529
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,010
You know, you can spend the night,
just don't come over here and kill me.

530
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,810
That was basically it. So I did that. I
still do it to this day and I, I do it.

531
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:59,811
It kinda has a joke and it makes me laugh
for some reason I was thinking about

532
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:00,810
that chicken,
the ring,

533
00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:05,670
just what their fucking hair popping up
and doing something to me have you do

534
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:07,380
that? You just mind fuck yourself.
And I was like, all right,

535
00:32:07,381 --> 00:32:10,590
I have 10 seconds to get into the bed
or that chick from the ring is going to

536
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:15,470
appear and fucking kill
me, you know? So I got my

537
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,070
self in this anxious state,
I think before I went to sleep.

538
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:21,940
And then I ended up having this goddamn
nightmare and she fucking class both my

539
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,970
hands and goes,
you can you kind of kill yourself one day.

540
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,050
And I just sat there laying, they'd
go, I'm not going to kill myself.

541
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,140
Okay.

542
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,840
Don't open your eyes. That freak
you out. Well, what gives a fuck?

543
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:41,240
It's been a weird fucking week, you
know, that awful tragedy out there.

544
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:45,170
And uh, Colorado, you know,
was driving him in my truck.

545
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,770
All I have is fucking a am radio and um,

546
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,830
and so all I could eat,
you know,

547
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,650
and that's all they were talking about
on talk radio. And I'm one of those guys.

548
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:57,960
Once I see it, it's
fucking horrific. I know.

549
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,460
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

550
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,030
I don't want to know the kid's name and
know what his face looks like just in

551
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,830
case he's trying to get
famous. I just, you know,

552
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,430
yeah,

553
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,510
it's just fucking awful. Right. But
all I could listen to on the radio,

554
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:12,040
that's all they were talking about.

555
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:15,730
And these fucking people calling
in every God there. One of them.

556
00:33:15,731 --> 00:33:19,030
It's just saying the same fucking
thing over and over again. It's like,

557
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,810
who doesn't know that it's terrible?
Who doesn't know that it's not a tragedy?

558
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,890
Who isn't going to send prayers
out to the fucking family?

559
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:28,600
Why do they got to keep calling up?

560
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,630
It's fucking guy calling up yet I believe,
and I have the,

561
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,880
I believe in a hell and
uh, this guy, he's a,

562
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:44,620
he's deed all. If I, if I
was running deck, z would
definitely shot that. We got it.

563
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,500
Okay.

564
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,400
The fuck you calling up for?
I Dunno. It just fucking,

565
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:53,130
it became annoying after awhile.
And,

566
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,730
and then the talk show hosts
just wanting to keep it going.

567
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:57,950
Okay.

568
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,670
It was like no other way to say it was a
tragedy and he just kept piling on is a,

569
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,850
it's bad for families.
It's bad for,

570
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,230
it's bad for the nation and the dead
and the freedoms that we, uh, we,

571
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,840
we give people at level,
but the lab, but the public,

572
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:15,930
well then the NRA always
has to immediately pylon
after somebody uses a gun.

573
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,620
Like this doesn't mean the
gun dated gun didn't do it,

574
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,330
person did it just just letting you know,

575
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:24,740
just in case you thought in an inanimate
object could somehow do shit on its own,

576
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,893
you know?

577
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:27,870
Okay.

578
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,490
And then they always come
up with the brilliant,

579
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,700
what if everybody had it was allowed
to have a gun then that wouldn't have

580
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:35,670
happened. Yeah. I think that that
guy would have killed less people,

581
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:39,270
but I think a lot more other people
would have got killed getting shot in the

582
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:43,950
back of the fucking head is people
tried to shoot that person. Right.

583
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,460
I'm not against guns by the
way, but like, you know, look,

584
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,990
everybody can have a driver's license.

585
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:52,440
How many people really are good at
driving? You know what I mean? Hi,

586
00:34:52,441 --> 00:34:54,960
people are good at sports. I don't
feel have good hand eye coordination.

587
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,140
Do you want these fucking people with
guns and all of a sudden somebody starts

588
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,610
squeezing off some rounds and those
motherfuckers are between you and the guy

589
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:06,000
shooting at you and you're
not organized at all.

590
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,320
Yeah.

591
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,960
You know when,
when like 10 cops going in store my house,

592
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:11,940
they know where the fuck
they're at for a reason.

593
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,710
So they don't shoot
each other in the back.

594
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,950
If you got a bunch of people in a goddamn
movie with fucking glocks and somebody

595
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,100
comes in and start shooting, I
mean, it's going to be a fucking,

596
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,480
it's gonna be even worse.

597
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,850
Okay?

598
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,500
I think what they should do is,

599
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:29,660
okay,

600
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,680
there's gotta be two, two, two
levels. You have to pass to get a gun.

601
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,940
Okay? Aside from not being a psycho,
you should, when you get a gun,

602
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,500
you should then have to become
a fucking marksman. All right?

603
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,820
And if you're not a marksman, then it
affects the caliber of gun that you get.

604
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:52,410
This actually makes a lot of sense. All
right? It's like taking the driver's test.

605
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:57,090
You can't go there blind as a bat and
they just give you a fucking goddamn car.

606
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,770
Like they'll go fuck yourself,

607
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,900
go down a Pearle vision
and get your game together.

608
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,210
They should do the same thing with
guns. Okay, I want to get a gun license.

609
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,840
So God bless America. You can have
one go over there, the gun range,

610
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,110
and now go shoot at that
silhouette over there. Right?

611
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,600
Yeah.

612
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:14,861
You know,

613
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:19,660
if you only hit it once she get a BB gun
or maybe one of those little toy guns

614
00:36:19,661 --> 00:36:21,250
that that shoots the plastic things.

615
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:23,380
So you could still put somebody's
eye out though with it, you know?

616
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,130
But if you actually go down there
when you're, you're a fucking

617
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,990
goddamn maniac, right. Psycho fucking,

618
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,130
you know, just everything's a headshot
or center mass. Then you get the glock.

619
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,703
Right.

620
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,230
Does that make sense?
Can you just have a safe word?

621
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,650
Yeah.

622
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,120
Just something the guy yells,

623
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,990
when would shit like that and everybody
hits the fucking deck and this guy gets

624
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:55,991
up and just puts too right in the fucking
psychos head and it's over as oppose

625
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,690
to just letting everybody
just start fucking shooting.

626
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,200
Okay.

627
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,610
Would that make sense?
Oh,

628
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:08,720
if everybody just thought the way I did
the world would be a just as fucked up.

629
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,040
All right.
Anyways,

630
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,320
but what kind of people
have to fucking call up?

631
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,280
Yeah.

632
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,150
During a tragedy and you just have to
call up and you just have to reiterate

633
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:20,620
that it was a fucking tragedy.

634
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,130
Okay?

635
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,110
You have to call up and say that, I
think this guy's going to hell. Like who?

636
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:26,180
Who doesn't think that

637
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,233
you know,

638
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,310
fucking idiots

639
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,800
watching this fucking
politicians stammering.

640
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:36,770
Okay.

641
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,940
Through, so you know, family is the
love to put, we asked. We got it.

642
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,880
It's fucking horrible.
Just get on with punishing this guy.

643
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:48,230
Go hang that guy by his fucking toes.
They won't,

644
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,100
they're going to go through some big
nine fucking year of trial with this guy.

645
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,680
Okay.

646
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,570
And then did they try to like,

647
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,930
they try to blame guns or they tried
to blame the fucking movie and she's a

648
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:01,450
white tee. He's out of his fuck. I can
guarantee before you waste all this money

649
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,800
doing all of these studies, this guy,
he's out of his fucking mind. Who, who,

650
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,050
who the fuck would go in and do something
like that and that now I'm doing and

651
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:11,600
see what, see what I'm doing right now.
I'm doing what these collars are doing.

second you give any money to anything,

684
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,710
What's up Billy boy,
I need a little unlicensed,

685
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,730
unlicensed advice that you've
been doling out. I liked it.

686
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:25,510
This guy said that this is my unlicensed
advice that you should not listen to

687
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,800
because, uh, I do not have a
degree in anything. All right?

688
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,960
I am about,

689
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,480
okay,

690
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,170
two shades below Dr Dr Phil.

691
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,960
That's how bad I am at this.
Okay.

692
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,210
That wasn't pumping me up.
That was dragging him down. Uh,

693
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,990
my friend recently broke up with a girl.

694
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:48,540
He's been dating for awhile and wouldn't,
and when you know it,

695
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,280
this girl is the tips.

696
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,940
I've been friendly with this guy
for almost a year in his girls,

697
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,740
was always with us when we
hung out a Jesus. All right.
I can tell you right now,

698
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,220
just go ahead and Banger and say
goodbye to your friendship. Um,

699
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:05,370
from the moment I met her,
I've liked her and wanted to bang her.

700
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,930
Oh wait,
but you just want a fucker.

701
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,490
Uh, dude, this is dirty. This is dirty.

702
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,690
The kind of girl I imagine
when I think of a girl,

703
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:19,420
I would want to have a relationship with.
Go Fuck Yourself.

704
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:23,440
You said you wanted a banger first or
you like some sadistic guy who just wants

705
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:24,274
to uh,

706
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,900
fuck this girl and fucker better than
your friend so you can just be behind it

707
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:32,230

You liked it. You one of those guys.

708
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,470

here, but I'm not buying it. Classy.

709
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:40,400
Attractive. Funny. The whole
Shebang. Dude. Right off the bat,

710
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:44,760
the first thing you said was you
wanted to bang banger. I Dunno.

711
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,960
You're trying to be funny.
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

712
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:51,010
Let's plow ahead. Uh, I've even developed
feelings, feelings, question mark.

713
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,450
I know that's gay. Fuck you. Uh, for
her axial guys, we just can't, we just,

714
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,620
we're not allowed. I actually liked this
girl actually feel like I could spend,

715
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:04,030
like, I can't even say that
without having that. Ah, oh my God.

716
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,490
Fucking tone in my voice. Um,
let me see if I can just say it.

717
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:13,390
How I say I really liked
this girl. I think I could
spend my life with her. Okay.

718
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:17,770
That just sounded like a bad read. There's
no way to say it without feeling like.

719
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,500
I just feel like I just
really connect with her.

720
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,910
Ah, go fuck yourself. Ah. I've even
developed feelings for her quickly.

721
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,120
I liked hanging out with her
whenever she tagged along.

722
00:42:31,121 --> 00:42:33,610
I never flirted with her
or anything like that,

723
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,380
but I did rubber muff under the table.
Come on, dude. You leave in some shit out.

724
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:41,770
He didn't say that last part, but come
on, but we did get along pretty well.

725
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,770
I would and still do.
Think about her all the time.

726
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,920
Some real grade school crush type shit.

727
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:53,290
Now they've broken up and she's single
and ready presumably to do some revenge

728
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,880
banging. Yeah, dude, you're a
piece of shit, but God bless
you. She was hot enough.

729
00:42:57,881 --> 00:43:02,370
I probably do it. No, I wouldn't.
My younger days I would.

730
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,040
I wouldn't. Maybe I would. I don't know.
I'm not going to judge you anyways.

731
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,810
See where I'm going with this.
Yeah.

732
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,510
I saw where you were going with it from
the second I started reading it. Anyway,

733
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,050
unlike most guys, I don't want
to just bang this broad. I want,

734
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,660
I want to be with her,
do the whole boyfriend thing,

735
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,530
but I know doing so would break one
of the most important rules of male

736
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:25,620
friendship. Never fuck
your friends girl. However,

737
00:43:25,621 --> 00:43:30,210
the power of pussy has be thinking that's
crazy and that the best and that's the

738
00:43:30,211 --> 00:43:33,390
best thing for me to do.
However,

739
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:36,660
the power of pussy has me thinking that's
crazy and that the best thing for me

740
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:40,950
to do is wait four to six months until
things settled down and see if she feels

741
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,010
the same way that I do.
I'm not sure if she will,

742
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,570
but I'm willing to try
and find out despite the
ramifications. What do I do, Bill?

743
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,340
Should I go after this awesome,

744
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,870
awesome girl risking my friendship
or do I go bros before hoes?

745
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,120
Forget her and wait for the next four.

746
00:43:57,121 --> 00:44:01,470
Do Juror a or am I just bat shit crazy?
Um,

747
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,710
AH, Jesus dude. Like I
can't figure you out.

748
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,790
You sitting here talking like you Gugu
Gaga and then you're also just saying

749
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,340
like, you just kind of
want a banger. All right,

750
00:44:11,341 --> 00:44:14,160
this is what I'm going to tell you.
Okay.

751
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:16,440
Rather than just telling you what I'm
going to tell you that this is what I'm

752
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:20,280
going to tell you before telling you
that thus eating up more time in this

753
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:21,330
horrific podcast.

754
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,410
This is the sad thing about getting older.
Okay.

755
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,740
When your friends get
older and they get married

756
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,470
and they have kids, you barely
see him anymore. It sucks. Okay.

757
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:38,400
And if they have some,

758
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:43,401
if they married some fucking Douche
bag who you know the in the and,

759
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:47,070
and they, and they just gave their
balls away in the relationship.

760
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,360
He had never gonna see him again.

761
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,860
But if they actually have a cool life who
lets them go out and hang out with the

762
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:56,550
Fellas, you still only going to
see each other once in a while.

763
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:59,610
You got to raise kids.
So in the long run,

764
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,480
if you feel like this girl might be
the one you got to do what you can't,

765
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,400
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

766
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,180
But if this is just some sadistic
shit where it was, she was,

767
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:13,830
you just wanted to bang her cause she
was around, you know, and you saw like,

768
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,140
it's just like,
dude,

769
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:19,350
I gotta tell you if you bang that
girl and afterwards you're not feeling

770
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:21,990
anything dude.
It's like now

771
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,730
she's got something on you and if she's
a psycho and if they had a bad breakup,

772
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,570
you can better fucking believe.

773
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,740
Like that's like that's chicks
ways of getting back at guys.

774
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:37,980
Like they'll go out and
fuck their friends. Um,

775
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,160
I mean just, I mean you weren't just
like Hell hath no fury as they say,

776
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:48,450
like a woman's scorn. And if
it's a bad breakup, like women,

777
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,130
they want to throw all your shit out
in the front lawn, light it on fire.

778
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,020
Okay. And that's not enough to
fucking go after you material things.

779
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,240
Okay.
That's what they want to do.

780
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:03,780
They want to leave you with and then
we'll go on and go bang all your fucking

781
00:46:03,781 --> 00:46:08,370
friends and then let you know about it.
So then you lose all your friends,

782
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,930
you lose your entire wardrobe.

783
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:14,880
You standing there like a flood victim
just tearing up as it starts to rain,

784
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:18,720
as you stand on the fucking front porch
at some dilapidated fucking three family

785
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:22,200
house, that's how they want to
leave you. They're fucking nuts,

786
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,430
some of them. Okay. So

787
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,180
you know the deal, dude, you're stepping
in Shit, you're looking at a field,

788
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:33,571
you know,

789
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:38,100
it's a minefield and you want to walk
across in any ways because there's a woman

790
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:39,030
at the other side of it,

791
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:43,920
which this is a classic Shakespearian
tale about ready to unfold.

792
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,750
So, and I can say that having never
read Shakespeare, I tried to read it.

793
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:51,780
It's more complicated than the Bible.
Um,

794
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,180
I, you know, I don't know,
Dude. I don't you, you have to.

795
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,120
You got to figure out where the fuck
you're at with this shit. All right.

796
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,920
Do you really like this girl?

797
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,880
Do you really think she's the one or
was she just around long enough that you

798
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:07,740
just were thinking about them and you,
you know,

799
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:11,730
looking at a Tan fucking thighs are a
fucking titties or a God damn mouth to

800
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:15,090
something and just like, I'd be
one or would it be like, you know,

801
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,640
and you just sat there doing
that the whole fucking time.

802
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,300
There always is that excitement that all
your guy friends have when you break up

803
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:24,210
with a hot girl. Cause they're all like,
Oh God, I always wanted to fuck that girl.

804
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:25,530
A Jesus Christ.
All right.

805
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,800
And you guys have that conversation with
each other and that's how you fucking

806
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:32,750
talk a bunch of pirates. You
sit day. Do you hear, uh,

807
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,150
Mike and Joanne broke up? Can you
believe that? Yeah, it's fucking crazy.

808
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,900
And then you guys sit there
and then there's that half
second pause and you both

809
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:45,480
just start laughing because you
don't like do it. We can't, we can't.

810
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,280
Oh Geez. I would love
to. I would love to. Uh,

811
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:50,710
I won't say anything you don't fuck is
anything. It's just, it's fucking brutal.

812
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,510
It's brutal.

813
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:57,100
And then the guys all insecure because
this is the bottom line is if, you know,

814
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,450
that's why you don't
bring your girl around,

815
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,960
you don't bring your girl on it because
you do it enough. You're good guy.

816
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:03,700
Friends are gonna want to fuck her,
you know,

817
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:05,260
and then she kind of gets to know them.

818
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,060
And then did you already do that stupid
fucking phone call when you call? Hey,

819
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:14,590
you know, just calling up just to
say, I'm sorry you guys broke up.

820
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,420
I thought you guys look great together.
Blah blah, blah, blah, blah. Right.

821
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,100
Try to catch her in that week
fucking moment. Did you do that,

822
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,890
your Predator? Ah, we all have, um,

823
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:31,160
that is a shitstorm sir. There's
no, uh, there's no way out of that.

824
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,953
Um,

825
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:36,300
and there's no way you're going to wait
six to eight months because if the girl

826
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,140
hot enough in six to eight months,
she's already going to have somebody else.

827
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,430
And if you come back around again,
it's going to be like her going backwards.

828
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,830
So there, see what I did? I just lit a
candle under your ass to go fucking do it.

829
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,500
Oh, it gives a shit. Let me know
how it works out. Uh, advice.

830
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,600
Friend's girlfriend is a bitch.

831
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,600
Haven't I already given
an advice over this thing?

832
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,180
I've given this advice
a Zillion fucking times.

833
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:03,200
I'm a high school senior and in
three weeks with me in three weeks,

834
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:06,560
me and my friends are going backpacking
through Australia for a month and a half.

835
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,130
We've been planning this trip since middle
school and I have saved for the past

836
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:13,250
five years because I am paying
for my share of the trip myself.

837
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,060
We're both psych to graduate from
high school and for this trip, dude,

838
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:18,110
I hope you have the most,

839
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,240
the only way I would backpack through
Australia is if they made thigh high

840
00:49:23,241 --> 00:49:25,430
hooker fucking snake boots.

841
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:27,640
Okay.

842
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,070
They got like some of the
deadliest snakes on the planet.

843
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:31,720
Okay.

844
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,390
They've got that Tai pan where
the fuck it is. They got the uh,

845
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,160
nothing got black Mambas out there.

846
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:40,720
Those ones you get bit like in the
second it get registered that the pain of

847
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:42,220
getting bit,
you like collapsed.

848
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,130
Okay.

849
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:46,200
Yeah. Fuck all that. All right
dude. We'll have fun with that.

850
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,970
This sounds like one of those trips
where somebody ends up dying and then

851
00:49:50,971 --> 00:49:54,390
somebody goes on trial for
possibly murdering the other
person and then they get

852
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,620
off and then the,

853
00:49:55,621 --> 00:50:00,470
but there's always that wonderment of
what really happened whenever Americans go

854
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:01,910
to Australia,
somebody dies.

855
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,710
Remember that guy who was on the honeymoon
and went scuba diving and his wife

856
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:07,820
got eaten by a shark?

857
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,250
Yeah,

858
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,310
yeah, I remember that one or something
weird. Or they went deep sea.

859
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:13,780
A fucking snorkeling.

860
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,260
Okay.

861
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:19,400
I would say right now, if you're a
fucking woman and a, if you're a lady,

862
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,900
um, and you're on it,
you're going on a honeymoon.

863
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:28,820
If it involves fucking scuba diving,
so any sort of going out to the ocean,

864
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:34,490
that's it. It's over. Call off the
wedding. All right. Call it off.

865
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,560
Nothing good comes from that.

866
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,480
He's either going to get drunk and fall
overboard or he's going to shut the air

867
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:42,320
valve off.

868
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:47,380
Yeah.

869
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,460
Don't go on a cruise.
You know? And if you do,

870
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,630
you do not go up on deck unless there's
plenty of witnesses around. Fuck that.

871
00:50:55,631 --> 00:50:59,470
Moonlight kissing. Fuck all that. That's
when you go off the back of the boat.

872
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,980
She was just, she wanted to
reach down and touch the water.

873
00:51:02,981 --> 00:51:07,810
I don't know what happened. No
body, no nothing. Ah, fuck that.

874
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,650
Hey billion. I'm a high
schools. All right. So anyways,
they're going to Australia.

875
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,890
My friend and I have known each other
since we were three and our families are

876
00:51:14,891 --> 00:51:16,210
very close.
He's like,

877
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:20,860
he's like a brother to me and we've
often confided in each other and ask each

878
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:24,040
other for relationship
advice. Whoever. Lee recently,

879
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:27,460
my friend had started dating this
girl who has put a huge rift in our

880
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:30,940
relationship. Congratulations.
He's met his first psycho.

881
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,130
You guys are really high school age.

882
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,480
I don't think this is going
to be that big a deal.

883
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,030
The girl my friend is
dating is a total whore.

884
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,810
She's ignorant and jealous and generally
has an unattractive personality.

885
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,810
They've only been dating for two months,
but she feels like she owns him.

886
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,290
She found out that my friend and I were
going on this trip and has been rude to

887
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:51,070
me ever since. Yeah, she's
insecure. She's young. Um,

888
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:56,560
and she's fucking a lot of
guys. It stayed, it started
with just snipping remarks,

889
00:51:56,561 --> 00:52:01,180
elevated over time, blah, blah, blah.

890
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,070
But this is just going
to be the usual shit.

891
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,700
The other night we were all at a party.
She got hammered. She came up to me,

892
00:52:06,701 --> 00:52:11,701
started shoving me and told me that my
ghetto pussy wasn't going to seduce her

893
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,544
boyfriend.

894
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,320
What his comment probably had something
to do with the fact that I'm black and

895
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:20,980
her boyfriend is white
though I was seeing red.

896
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,730
I tried not to sucker punch that bitch
in the face. He had dude, dude, don't,

897
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:26,950
don't ever do that.
Uh,

898
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:30,550
I've boxed and kickbox for the past three
years and I'm pretty sure I could have

899
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:34,450
stopped the yard all over. Yeah, Dude.
What the fuck? Where did that come from?

900
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,920
I think the fact that you're a guy, you
could pretty much beat up most women's,

901
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,120
so, which is why you
don't do it. You know,

902
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,730
it's like running up the
score and a college game. Uh,

903
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,790
I told her to calm down.

904
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,670
I have never done anything with
my friend and have no desire.

905
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:50,860
Intentions of anything
happened in Aussie land.

906
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:54,250
She kept yelling and screaming
and making a scene eventually. Oh,

907
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:58,060
so she's basically calling you gay in
front of all your friends at a party and

908
00:52:58,061 --> 00:53:01,870
you're at a high school level. Yeah.
That's kind of a, that's a situation.

909
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,410
Eventually I just gave up trying to
reason with the drunk broad and I left

910
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:07,060
naturally.
I told my friend what she said.

911
00:53:07,061 --> 00:53:11,110
He agreed it was absolutely unacceptable
and had a talk with her that turned

912
00:53:11,111 --> 00:53:14,890
into a fight.
My friends girl gave him an ultimatum,

913
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:18,070
me or her and for forbade
him from going to Australia.

914
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,660
This is absolutely hilarious to me,
which it should be. Since they're fight,

915
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,980
my friend hasn't called or texted me.
What should

916
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,630
I do? You know what? Fuck him. Fuck him.

917
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:32,580
Let him learn the lesson.
You know what you do?

918
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:37,740
You go down there with your
fucking American accent. All right,

919
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,420
and you're going to get more fucking
pussy than you could ever shake a God damn

920
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:44,940
sticker, a walking stick act. All right.
To keep it in, in a hiking sense here.

921
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:49,020
All right, fuck him. And then
you come back and just, you know,

922
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,760
let him be with that whore. Wash
your fucking hands of it, okay?

923
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,850
You Go. I invested a lot of time,
effort, and money into this trip.

924
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,810
I'm not going to have the beginning of
my senior year destroyed by some skank

925
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:03,420
phase control freak,
lush, which you shouldn't,

926
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,070
but I also don't want to hurt my friend
and have and have them be miserable when

927
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:11,790
we're going to be stuck living, sleeping,
traveling together for six weeks. Hey,

928
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:17,010
fuck them. This is the
deal. Fuck him. Fuck him.

929
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,270
Okay? He wants to be with that
horror. Let them be with that whore.

930
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:25,110
Get on with your fucking life. He wants
to go with you to Australia. Let them,

931
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:29,190
if he doesn't, if he wants to stay back
there with that psycho, let them let,

932
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:31,890
he has to learn this lesson the same way.

933
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,480
You got to let a toddler fucking slam
his head off the God damn coffee table.

934
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:40,110
Different, understand gravity or at least
putting his little fat baby arms out.

935
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,213
You know,
you gotta,

936
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,190
you gotta let this dude fall right
on his fucking face. All right,

937
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,830
let's hope he's wearing a condom,

938
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,780
but he's old enough to know how
people get pregnant. So you know,

939
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,170
give me a fucking break.
Fuck this shit. All right.

940
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,990
That's it. Fuck him. Wash
your hands of it. It's over.

941
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:08,880
All right. You go out, you enjoy your
senior year, you go to Australia,

942
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,080
he comes, he doesn't, you don't give
a fuck. All right, that's on him.

943
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:17,430
He wants to sit there and invest all his
life and some stupid drunk skank phase

944
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:20,190
control freak, lush as
you call her. Let them,

945
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:26,160
what the fuck do you care? Okay.
She fucking embarrassed you.

946
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:30,300
I mean you, you don't do that.
You don't do that. I mean,

947
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:33,960
one time I was dating this fucking girl
and she was so fucking rude to one of my

948
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:37,020
friends and that night I was like,

949
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:40,860
I was beside myself and I was asking
her how she could do something like that

950
00:55:40,861 --> 00:55:43,470
and she's just like, she was just
like, I'm sorry I didn't like him.

951
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,200
And I know it was the first time.
I was just like,

952
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,770
is that the most arrogant fucking thing
ever? And I'm not going to lie to you.

953
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:53,430
It took me like another,
like a week or two,

954
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:58,740
but I, from that second on I just
fucking pulled back and I was just like,

955
00:55:58,741 --> 00:55:59,041
you know what?

956
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:03,270
Go Fuck yourself because you know
that's the life you're gonna have.

957
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:06,510
You're gonna have no, you're going to,
all your friends are going to be gone.

958
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:11,010
So fucker. All right. Did I say it
enough time? Yeah. Fuck her. Um, dilemma.

959
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,940
Um, all right. Number one
at their physical peak,

960
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:19,941
would you rather box Laila
Ali or will Smith Will Smith?

961
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,040
There's no winning with Laila Ali
either lose to a check or beat one up.

962
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,150
That was easy. I'll fight. Will Smith
worse I can do is lose to an actor.

963
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,100
But he used to rap, but he was
mainstream rap. Right? But,

964
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:38,420
but what was the ones that he had?
What the fuck was that?

965
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,280
I know people who started
about that summertime when I,

966
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:42,490
I don't remember how that one went.

967
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,280
I was too busy listening to metal
with the fuck did he have back then?

968
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:47,050
Parents just don't wonder.
Don't understand.

969
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,370
That's when like mainstream white
people were finally discovering rap.

970
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,660
That's what we did. We parents just
don't understand. Can't touch this

971
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:05,380
the worst of the worst, but go
fuck yourself. African Americans.

972
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,940
All right. I bet the first white music
you listened to was, it was, it was awful,

973
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,290
uh, with your hall and
Oates. Um, anyways, uh, if,

974
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,500
if you were a parent of a boy and a girl,

975
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:21,700
would you rather see your
son on to catch a predator?

976
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,230
Jesus being national
exposed as a pedophile or be
driving down the street and

977
00:57:26,231 --> 00:57:31,120
see your daughter out on the corner of
whoring yourself out as a prostitute,

978
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,290
a prostitute.
Prostitute.

979
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,810
Yeah. Prostitute. There's nothing
worse than fucking a kid, you know,

980
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:45,550
I don't think it should change the
outcome of who won a football game. Uh,

981
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:50,440
but that's just me. A overrated,
underrated, underrated. A scabies.

982
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:56,470
He's underrated.
A great reason to launder.

983
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,570
I don't even know what
the fuck that means.

984
00:57:58,571 --> 00:58:01,720
I don't know what scabies it would
launder. What money you're clothes.

985
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,540
I don't even what you're saying
there. Number two, pointing out,

986
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,080
did I even pronounce that correctly?
Um,

987
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:13,060
to pointing out details about a steamy
sex story that make it uncomfortable and

988
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:17,890
unsexy. Jesus Christ. What's, what
the fuck is this creek for example,

989
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:18,671
hey baby,

990
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:23,480
remember the other day when I bet you
over the dining room chair and we raw dog

991
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:27,490
did and you finished me off on your
knees between the cat food dishes in the

992
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:28,324
litter box.

993
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,820
Your girlfriend expression will change
from sexy to four horrified in zero to

994
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:37,450
60. Um, if you're the woman
who's dating that guy,

995
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:41,710
please break up with that
fucking reptilian psycho. Um,

996
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:44,350
is that the podcast for this
week? Oh, we're coming up on it.

997
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,920
We are coming up on it. Oh,
you know what? I forgot.

998
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:52,150
I forgot to do the classic
stamps.com read. Hey everybody.

999
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,950
Oh wait, what am I thinking? I got
to do this other one. Legal Zoom.

1000
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,120
I forgot about this one. This is a new
advertiser. I think it'd be pissed.

1001
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:06,770
58 minutes into the podcast is only way
you could read a little earlier. Um,

1002
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:10,070
58 minutes in. All right.
Legal Zoom, everybody. Uh,

1003
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,340
you probably heard about legal zoom.com
and I probably seen it out there aren't

1004
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:16,250
a bunch of youtube videos,
but now I'm telling you about them.

1005
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:20,450
So you gotta check 'em out. These
guys are great. All right. Um,

1006
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:24,470
cause I've actually half the shift that
they do here and I paid a fucking lawyer

1007
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:28,250
to do it. It cost me a zillion
dollars. Uh, all right.

1008
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:29,480
If you basically,

1009
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:33,740
are you sitting in a cubicle right now
that you wondering why you're making

1010
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:37,100
somebody else's dream come true
while you're working towards that?

1011
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:41,420
When you actually have an idea
for a business, you know well,

1012
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,291
and you sitting there going,
well,

1013
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:44,630
I'd love to get myself incorporate
it to start my business,

1014
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:45,890
but it's going to cost a fortune.

1015
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,640
well@legalzoom.com if you've been waiting
for the perfect time to start your

1016
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:52,580
dream business, um, right
now's the time to do it.

1017
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:57,581
You can incorporate your business or form
an llc@legalzoom.com starting at just

1018
00:59:58,431 --> 01:00:02,390
99 bucks.
It costs me like 1500,

1019
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,440
something like that. 700 1500, I
can't remember. It was a lot of money.

1020
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:11,600
They'll do it for 99 bucks.
And if you have a family, um,

1021
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,280
and you need to make sure
that they're protected,

1022
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:18,020
legal zoom also will help you a make out
your last will and testament for just

1023
01:00:18,021 --> 01:00:21,980
69 bucks. That's something
that I have to do. All right.

1024
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,130
I have to make up my
last will and testament,

1025
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:28,910
which is really a scary
thing for me to do. You know,

1026
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,130
cause you're actually dealing
with your own mortality.

1027
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,390
And considering I just had a dream like
I did last night, it freaks me out,

1028
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:39,890
but I got to tell you if I'm going to
do it, I'm doing it for 69 bucks. Um,

1029
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:43,940
in the past 12 years, over 2 million
Americans have used legal zoom for Llcs,

1030
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:47,270
wills, trust, trademarks, and
more. This is basically, look,

1031
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:50,990
if you're trying to start a business
or if you need a will to protect your

1032
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:54,290
assets, this is the place to go.
Uh, you're going to save hundreds,

1033
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,810
even thousands of dollars versus
going the traditional route.

1034
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:59,450
And I know what you think of.
Well, what if I get bogged
down? What have, what have,

1035
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:03,620
I can't figure it out. They even have
an attorney to help you if you need, uh,

1036
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,121
if you need help.

1037
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:08,000
Basically they have attorneys that you
can call in that type of stuff. All right.

1038
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,280
Mandatory close. Sorry. It was
supposed to ride the worst.

1039
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,330
There's the mandatory,

1040
01:01:14,331 --> 01:01:17,780

01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:39,260
direction. All right? So
that's the deal there. It is.

That is the cheapest, most
efficient way to do it. Uh,

1049
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,490
I wish they were around back
when I got incorporated.

1050
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:50,000
Could have saved myself hundreds
of dollars. So they got legal zoom.

1051
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,310
What else? Is there anything
else I wanted to talk about? Um,

What more do you need?
What more do we need, bill?

1064
01:02:42,401 --> 01:02:47,320
We'd like one more funny fucking story
from you to end the podcast. All right,

1065
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:48,701
let's see what it got.

1066
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:51,670
It wasn't enough that I said bye
bye to somebody in a wheelchair.

1067
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,320
Jesus Christ. If I went to
church, how many fucking
hail? Mary's a said, you know,

1068
01:02:56,321 --> 01:03:01,321
stuff that I should go to confession and
just tell that story just to see what

1069
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:04,360
the guy says.
You know,

1070
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:09,630
cause I think they just make that stuff
up to off this boy hail Marys back there

1071
01:03:11,211 --> 01:03:15,310
drinking out of a chalice.
Who did that first?

1072
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,410
Those rappers in Atlanta or priests?

1073
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,260
Well I guess hip hop's only been around
since. What did I just say? Hip Hop,

1074
01:03:20,261 --> 01:03:23,950
I think I did since when?
When did that actually come about?

1075
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:29,760
Was it in the early seventies is that
what it was number one run DMC actually

1076
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:36,880
said that. Walk this
way was the first rap.

1077
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,550
Remember that? Why did
they say that? You know,

1078
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,350
did they run out of leather
jacket? Uh, Shell toes?

1079
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,170
I was that was that fun running
low when they actually said that,

1080
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:53,050
that wasn't the first Rep.
Why would they say that?

1081
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:56,770
Did black people get mad at them when
they said that shit? No one gives a fuck.

1082
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,620
You know what people,
I don't think I have anything left.

1083
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:02,350
I was actually hoping that the red sox
were going to be in town tonight cause I

1084
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:06,040
wanted to wear to head down there.
Um, even though I'm not drinking,

1085
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:10,300
I really want to drink. I ain't gonna
lie to you people I really want to drink.

1086
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:15,750
I do. I haven't drank in a couple of
weeks dry and myself out. You know,

1087
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:19,750
I get through the uh, the kid show
that I'm going to be doing here.

1088
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,650
You gotta be known at this point that
I'm not doing a fucking kid show is I'm

1089
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,890
sitting here talking about pedophiles
saying bye bye to somebody in a wheelchair

1090
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:30,100
and saying that Joe Paterno
is winds should still count

1091
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,390
in case you detective work.

1092
01:04:36,391 --> 01:04:39,970
He was still questioning whether or not
I'm actually going to be hosting some

1093
01:04:39,971 --> 01:04:44,830
sort of revamp of a kid
show. It ain't happening. Uh,

1094
01:04:44,831 --> 01:04:46,810
actually get another acting gig.
I'm doing all right.

1095
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,370
I'm doing all right on the old, the old
acting gigs. Thanks. This is what it is,

1096
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:54,130
is perfect. It's the exact fucking
reason why I moved out to La.

1097
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,970
I just wanted to start getting
some parts in some shit. You know,

1098
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:03,550
that's all I wanted to do. I don't
need to be as, I just want to,

1099
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:08,110
I just want to be in a, just let me
shoot a gun, gets shot to something.

1100
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,730
You know, I told you guys my acting,
these are, these are my acting goals.

1101
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:16,810
I want to do that scene where you run
down the alley and you're getting chased

1102
01:05:16,811 --> 01:05:20,800
by cop and he get to the chain link fence
and you get like three fucking crawls

1103
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:24,880
up at and they drag you back down. I want
to do that. I want to get interrogated,

1104
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,330
I want to get shot.
I'm going to get blown away.

1105
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,760
I want to get killed by a monster
at some point.

1106
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:38,260
I want to be getting eaten or something.
Just be gone. That's all I want to do.

1107
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,220
All right.
I don't want to do gorillas in the mist.

1108
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:46,160
What the fuck are they
counting down out there?

1109
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,250
I think these are like coast guard people
learning how to be coast guard people

1110
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:54,170
outside this way. Hang on.
What am I doing? Hang on,

1111
01:05:54,171 --> 01:05:55,080
hang on, hang on, hang on it. Yeah.

1112
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:01,060
I think it's some sort of coast guard
training thing out there. 10, nine a,

1113
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,800
you know, he's no one your boss in
Boston when they get down to four,

1114
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,590
six, five, four

1115
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:12,701
actually heard somebody say,

1116
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:17,230
but is day I got breakfast she wants
him to is with that. Uh, no, I don't.

1117
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:23,350
Trying to cut down on the
carbs. All right, that's the
podcast for this week. Um,

1118
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:27,250
go fuck yourselves. Don't take any shit.
And uh, you know, I obviously wasn't,

1119
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,520
you know that. Who gives a fuck? I'm
not gonna sit there and even try.

1120
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:33,760
What am I doing? I just said it
wasn't an apologize for anything.

1121
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,720
Fucking Penn State's wins should count.
Alright.

1122
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:41,770
Those fucking players played the Goddamn
Games. They blew out their knees.

1123
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:45,490
They risk fucking injury. They
won the Goddamn Games. All right?

1124
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:49,090
Just cause some old fuck was doing some
shit that he should be burned in the

1125
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:51,560
street for. You shouldn't punish
those fucking kids. I, Oh,

1126
01:06:51,561 --> 01:06:54,880
Penn state sells out all
their fucking games, you know,

1127
01:06:55,870 --> 01:07:00,610
learn from Smu. All right,
everybody just walk the fuck away.

1128
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:04,380
You show up in force.
That'd be the greatest fucking thing.

1129
01:07:04,381 --> 01:07:06,580
You know how how unbelievable.

1130
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,080
If you want to somehow turn this fucking
thing around Penn state fans is if

1131
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:13,900
every game over the next
four years sells out,

1132
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,920
even if you lose every fucking game,
okay,

1133
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:21,760
there's no other program out there.
Could ever question your loyalty.

1134
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:26,110
That would be the greatest
example of a fan support.

1135
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,170
Unlike these, some of these
fucking red sox fans out here,

1136
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:34,480
48 and 48 the fucking walking away,
you know?

1137
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:40,150
See, that's the deal with most vans.
They're not real fence. You know,

1138
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,680
you're like a marriage in sickness
and in health, good times and bad.

1139
01:07:44,681 --> 01:07:47,620
It doesn't work that way.
The fans fans basically say,

1140
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,920
I love you until you suck
and then I'm walking away.

1141
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:57,880
I'm going to leave you when you need me
most just like that Kenny Rogers song

1142
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:03,350
phone with children
cropping and they'll feel

1143
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:05,863
bad.

1144
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,700
We want 48 games the last 48 games

1145
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,070
and now you're leaving.
You can't, you know what?

1146
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,580
Get the fuck up. God bless John
Lester. I know he doesn't want to lose.

1147
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,450
I love and Pedroia when we're fucking
down like that and he's fucking powder him

1148
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:26,090
on the leg trying to get him psyched up.
I love that shit.

1149
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:29,510
I love that as much as watching a wind.
All right.

1150
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:34,680
And if you're walking away now you're a
cunt and is Tom Cruise said in fucking

1151
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,370
taps takeoff that baret right.

1152
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,170
Poor Tom Cruise is fucking lady left them.

1153
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,850
I think everybody like comes down on
Scientology. You know what I mean?

1154
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:52,010
What's the fucking problem with it? Until
they have like a uh, uh, inquisition.

1155
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:54,830
I really don't think there anywhere
as bad as my fucking religion.

1156
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:56,203
You know what I mean?

1157
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,610
We had like 58 Sandusky's running
around doing that shit. Did they, did,

1158
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:04,340
was the Catholic church not
allowed to go to a bowl game?

1159
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:08,270
Did they take away some of
Jesus's miracles? They didn't.

1160
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,740
Those fucking games count down
screaming in a hotel room.

1161
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,410
Those fucking games count. Those kids
won those games, those games count.

1162
01:09:17,411 --> 01:09:20,920
I did stand up for the Penn state Nittany
lions when they came out and they did

1163
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:22,960
the, when they were playing
USC and the Rose Bowl,

1164
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,780
I did stand up for them
and they were fucking,

1165
01:09:25,781 --> 01:09:28,990
it was like performing for the troops.
Pine tight. Everybody listening.

1166
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,110
I know you have a great set.
Nobody heckled me. They were great.

1167
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:36,190
Great Bunch of guys. You're going to
punish them. Go Fuck Yourself. All right.

1168
01:09:36,191 --> 01:09:38,860
This is what I say.
If you take away Penn state's victories,

1169
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,050
then you have to take
away Jesus's miracles.

1170
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:45,880
Jesus miracles didn't count if
Penn state's victories don't count.

1171
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,610
That's what I'm saying. That's
my statement. I'm sticking to it.

1172
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:50,800
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you next week.
