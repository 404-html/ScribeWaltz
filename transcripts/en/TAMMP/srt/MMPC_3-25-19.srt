1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,630
Okay.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,100
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

3
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:06,240
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday match 25th,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,690
2019. What's going on? How are you? Um,

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,710
okay.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,970
I'm going to fucking great
mood this Monday. 121 days.

7
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:18,860
No fucking bullshit.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,740
On Wednesday I'll be a third through
the year already. 33 fucking percent.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,780
33.5, whatever the fuck you
need. 33.3, three, three,
three, three, three, repeating,

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,090
uh, through the year. Just
like that. I feel great. You
know, it's funny, there was a,

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,400
okay,

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,760
we had some people over here yesterday.
Um,

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,410
I got some family in town so
we had a little cookout and uh,

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,270
you know, I needed some space on this
table so we can pre prep some shit.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,060
So I took all my booze and I just,

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,720
I brought it out of the kitchen and I
just took it upstairs and put it in the

17
00:00:55,721 --> 00:01:00,000
bedroom. And um, you know,

18
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,880
just so we have another area pregnant.
I was sent the biggest fucking kitchen,

19
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,550
right?
So fucking little prep area to cook.

20
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:09,870
So I fucking last night I'm
going to bed and my new thing,

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,900
I swear to God to go to sleep rather than
they have three fucking scotches like

22
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,950
I used to is I actually read,

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,920
I swear to God, I'm reading, I'm sober
and I'm reading how fucking funny.

24
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,220
So I uh,

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,470
okay.

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,590
I finished this book on Bob Cousy and
Bill Russell that I really enjoyed.

27
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:33,730
You know,

28
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,250
I'm going to give it to a buddy of
mine cause I don't like keeping books.

29
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,240
They're fucking heavy.

30
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,960
They take up space and I always act
like I'm going to go back and read them

31
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:44,980
again and I don't. So, um,

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,780
now I'm reading the, uh, the Beastie
boy book, a hardcover edition.

33
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:51,940
And as I was taking the plastic off,
I was thinking like,

34
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,400
is this going to affect the value
of it? It's just like, Bill,

35
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,370
when do you sell anything on
Ebay? Never. Alright, cool.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,200
So I was reading that and all I had
was my little reading light on it,

37
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:07,201
my bed and I looked over and I
had a bottle of the Yippy Kai.

38
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:11,130
Yay. Right. The Bourbon,
absolutely delicious. Unopened.

39
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,370
Just sitting there and the way the
light was hitting it and the way it was

40
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:20,290
passing through the bottle, it literally
looked like it like, like a sunrise.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,750
And I would be lying to you if I didn't
sort of sit up in bed and just look at

42
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:29,790
it for a hard 20 seconds.

43
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,583
MMM.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,930
And I was just, Oh my God. Yeah. That
was like, that looks fucking delicious.

45
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,090
But I didn't, I, but I will tell you this,

46
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,740
I'm going to get it out
of the bedroom though.

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,280
I don't need to be staring at that
late at night, you know. Well,

48
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:48,970
I need to do is have a tough day and
then have those bottles looking at as me

49
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,720
sitting there like, Hey, bill
will help you take the edge off.

50
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,730
I had one drink every hundred 21
days. It's not a bad thing. You see?

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,770
Okay.

52
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,160
It's a little taste to tell that tasted,
um,

53
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,660
anyways, uh, plowing ahead. So, uh, I'm
going to get that shit out of there. Um,

54
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,460
I also buy ordered a one
of those pitch backs,

55
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,710
which I haven't had since I was
a kid. Well, you, you know, it's,

56
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,520
you throw the ball,

57
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,310
it's like basically just like a
net and it records Shay's back.

58
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:25,750
He can either get grounders fly balls
or can come back straight, you know,

59
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,640
like you actually have a
friend to play catch with.

60
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,040
And I've since my fucked up my shoulder,
which is feeling great now by the way.

61
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,973
MMM.

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,410
Since I messed it up, I've been, uh,

63
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,420
I switched to becoming a lefty and a, I
just want to get my, my mechanics down.

64
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm almost fucking there where I
can get a little velocity on it.

65
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,661
So that's basic.

66
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:51,400
What I'm a basically living like a
God damn eight year old and I love it.

67
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,140
I absolutely love it. And uh, you know,

68
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,250
we're up at this week,

69
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:02,251
we're doing episode number eight of a f
is for family four Oh eight written by

70
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:08,680
yours truly. Um, I've
um, eight out of 10. So,

71
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,100
uh, this season as far as
like the heavy lifting,

72
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,750
the writing aspect of it is almost over.
Very thankful for that.

73
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,120
And um,
we've always had a killer writer,

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,670
writers' room and I think this
year is our strongest room.

75
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,350
It just keeps getting better and better.

76
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,940
I think that it helps that the
show's been on for as long as it has.

77
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:31,000
So writers come in the room now
just hitting the ground running.

78
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:34,060
They just understand the characters
and all that. So it's been, uh,

79
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,320
it's definitely been great.
So with that,

80
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,170
I have some new dates I have to announce.
Announce.

81
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,690
Uh,

82
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,391
let's see here.

83
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:49,391
I am going to be at the cosmopolitan
in Las Vegas on September 6th.

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,250
Um,

85
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,170
venue and ticket master Presale
is Thursday match 28th. Uh,

86
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:01,040
the public on sale is Friday, March
29th. I don't know what that means.

87
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,930
The public can't go to ticket master.

88
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,170
I'll presale Jesus Christ.

89
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:10,310
There's always somebody board before
group one isn't there? Um, anyways, yeah,

90
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,001
I'm going to be out there.

91
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:14,420
I'm going to do a Gig and
then the following day I'm
going to go see Elton John

92
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:15,780
because I know this is like his last tour.

93
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,690
A lot of people wrapping it up out there,

94
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,340
lot of people wrapping it up out
there on their fucking tours.

95
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,370
And, um, so I'm like, fuck, I gotta
go see these people before the date.

96
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:31,130
They just don't talk anymore. And then
they die. And I, I know you're thinking,

97
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,470
how many times can he get
suckered into that bill?

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How many fucking times could somebody
say it's their last fucking tore?

99
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,530
And then they come back around
again? You know, listen,

100
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,200
I forgive it if you get into
some sort of tax trouble.

101
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,303
MMM.

102
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,410
You know what I mean?
Fucking taxes.

103
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:55,411
Jesus Christ Jesus that I
start a shitstorm on fucking
read it when I was about

104
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,220
the,

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,840
uh,
that taxing people,

106
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,380
70% money north of $10 million.

107
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,360
And I am passionately against that.
I don't make north of $10 million,

108
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,820
but I also know how taxes work.
All right?

109
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,910
So they'll create that and then a few
years later they are going to be like,

110
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:18,190
well, people who make eight
to 10 should play this.

111
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,710
People who make six to
eight should pay this,

112
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,730
and it's just going to trickle all
the fucking way down. Um, yeah,

113
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:26,860
to 70% tax.

114
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,970
There's no justification for it on any
level that is absolute fucking rape.

115
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,723
MMM.

116
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,530
And people who were saying that,
uh,

117
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,410
that $20 trillion that is in offshore
accounts is a complete separate issue,

118
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,170
isn't I?
Completely disagree.

119
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,060
That's basically like you have a house
and the foundation is cracked and you're

120
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,840
worried that the house is going to fall
into the front yard and you're sitting

121
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:59,920
there going, we need to raise
money to paint the fucking
thing. And it's like, no,

122
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:03,850
dude, we need to fix the foundation.
And you like, that's a separate issue.

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,340
Technically, I guess it is a
separate issue, but it's like it's,

124
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,000
it's a more important issue.

125
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,350
You're going to paint some that's going
to fall down on it's fucking face.

126
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,301
All right.

127
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:20,200
If you're going to sit there and ignore
that and you're going to ignore the fact

128
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:25,201
that corporations are dictating our
foreign policy and have bankrupted this

129
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:29,350
country, this country is fucking bank
truck right now. And they're not bankrupt.

130
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,150
We're not bankrupt because people who
make $10 million or more are not paying

131
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:35,680
70% taxes.

132
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,440
We're fucking bankrupt because we're
spending $1 billion over $1 billion a

133
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,310
fucking month fighting some shit
that we could actually solve here.

134
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,230
We could just convert to fucking solar
power if oil companies didn't own the

135
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,480
politicians, you could convert
to that. Give the solar power,

136
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:58,220
give the fucking sun to the oil companies
so they can still have their eyes wide

137
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:01,580
shut fucking parties.
And I'm not saying solar powers cleaner,

138
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,150
it doesn't fucking fuck up the ocean
when you throw the big fucking things in

139
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,680
there or whatever.
I'm not saying that,

140
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,660
but I'm just saying it would
solve the Middle East problem

141
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,580
because all of that fucking terrorism
is funded with oil money and nobody uses

142
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:19,070
more of it than us. So let's just
switch over. I know it's a, it's a,

143
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:23,150
it's a fucking, not an
easy endeavor, but do it.

144
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,170
Let fucking Ilan mucks puts his little
fucking glow sticks in the Goddamn road.

145
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,250
We'll do that.
Not for a cleaner earth,

146
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,590
just to get us the fuck out of there.

147
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,300
Cause right now they have a saw walking
around like zombies going and I support

148
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:43,660
the to support [inaudible]
support the troops, right?

149
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,880
Who does it support the fucking home team.

150
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,300
But they take it to the point where you
can't question where you're sending the

151
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:53,050
troops and for how fucking long and
you can't even bring up like, hey guys,

152
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:56,590
we're fucking bankrupt.
This isn't working.

153
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,380
Separate issue.
Separate issue.

154
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,500
Let's fucking rape the guy
that started dollar shave club.

155
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,290
That's the solution and let me guess,
let me guess.

156
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,760
These are the tax dollars
that's are actually going to
make it to public schools.

157
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,850
These are the tax dollars that are
going to pay for nationwide healthcare.

158
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,150
These are the tax dollars.

159
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:19,120
They're going to fucking take over our
food supply again. So it's not peak.

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:19,841
You know,

161
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:22,870
little girls aren't getting their period
of 10 years old because of all the

162
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:24,280
fucking hormones in it.

163
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,620
Okay.

164
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,810
Like you're going to sit there,
you want to put money on the,

165
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,000
this is the tax dollars. It's
going to be spent, right.

166
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,940
That these fucking assholes
correct piece of shit.

167
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,990
Politicians aren't going to
steal the fuck outta here,

168
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,770
dude.
This people in this country,

169
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:44,970
you make an 80 to $100 million
that are paying 0% taxes,

170
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,160
0% taxes. Go look up apple. I
got an apple laptop right here,

171
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:50,070
sitting right in front of me.

172
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Go look up how they successfully avoided
paying 50 billion in American taxes.

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,030
Hey, gay guys, separate
issue, separate fucking issue.

174
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,240
All these corporations making money hand
over fucking fist and as such greedy

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,060
fucking conch.

176
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,890
They won't pay dollar
number one on $50 billion.

177
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,850
Oh yeah, no, no, no. Fuck that. Fuck that.

178
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,210
Let's go after fucking individual
Americans who had the balls to go after a

179
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,570
fucking look.
Let's just look at standup comedians.

180
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,830
I W I would if somebody
told me the percentage.

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,390
I can't imagine the percentage
that actually make it, you know?

182
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,310
And I was that guy in my mid to late
30 sitting on a fucking futon. No wife,

183
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,690
no kids,

184
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:44,970
okay.

185
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,950
In a fucking studio apartment.

186
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,640
Sit knowing that I'm
in a young man's game.

187
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,030
Okay,

188
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,510
going, what? Where the fuck does this
go do if I don't fucking make it?

189
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,010
Okay,

190
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,650
you know, I'm going to end
up on fucking cruise ships.

191
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,170
They might 50s and 60s

192
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,270
fighting every night to not throw
myself over the fucking railing,

193
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,530
all right? And I had the balls
to stay in it, but because I did,

194
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:18,190
you're now going to fucking
punish me and demonize, you know,

195
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:22,090
and I'm not saying I don't make that
money, but I know how this game works.

196
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,040
That is going to start at
10 and then there's going to
fucking work its way down.

197
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,350
And then what you're going to
have as my voice is cracking.

198
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,340
What you're going to have
is a literally a wall.

199
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,050
Yeah.

200
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:40,050
Between ridiculously unbelievably fucking
rich people who are paying no fucking

201
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:41,740
money in taxes.

202
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,510
And then you're going to push the
rest of everybody else backed down.

203
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,110
And that was all fighting with one another
with all of these fucking people who

204
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,220
sent me emails,

205
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,490
who are just saying they think never
heard me be so greedy like I'm breathing.

206
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,990
How fucking funny is that? I'm
breathing with what? My money.

207
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,160
Okay?

208
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,360
The money that I earned, I'm fucking
greedy with that. And you who?

209
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,010
It isn't your fucking money,
uh,

210
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:10,280
telling me to give it to you
and I'm the fucking greedy one.

211
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,980
And meanwhile,

212
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,580
you're going to completely ignore this
other subset of people who are paying

213
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:20,450
nobody to fucking taxes and tell me
that that's a separate fucking issue.

214
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,083
Okay?

215
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,020
I'm not the guy who was poisoned
the fucking food supply.

216
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm not the one who's pouring
shit into our drinking water.

217
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,920
Okay?

218
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm not the one who runs a company
that makes 50 billion fucking dollars.

219
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,510
And I got lawyers,

220
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,100
a team of fucking lawyers figuring
out how I can pay $0 million.

221
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,730
Okay?

222
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,180
Okay.

223
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,290
I don't have a fucking sweat shop where
people are trying to jump to that death

224
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,270
and rather than pay a more fucking money,

225
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:51,850
I put nets outside of the fucking factory.

226
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,210
So they just land in that and when I can
yank him out of the net and stick them

227
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,010
back at their fucking workstation,

228
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,033
okay,

229
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,410
I'm not the guy doing that.

230
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,140
But you're going to sit there and tell
me that that's a separate fucking issue.

231
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,670
Yeah.

232
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,060
Is it a separate issue or is it
just more difficult to police?

233
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,180
So you're going to go
for the fucking lay up.

234
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,250
Yeah.

235
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,520
Unfucking believable.
It's a separate issue.

236
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,760
I'll sit there all day and listen to
your fucking point until you say it's a

237
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:21,594
separate issue.

238
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,470
Okay?

239
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,230
Pay Taxes and paying your fair share is,

240
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,040
is fucking straight across the board.
This same issue.

241
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,420
And if you're going to go after people
who were already paying more than 50%

242
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:36,240
taxes on their fucking income,

243
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,950
which is fucking criminal in my world,

244
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,580
that the person who does the
job has to give away more.

245
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,480
Okay?

246
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,050
Then they made they get to keep less
than what they fucking made and they did

247
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:51,080
the fucking job. And you're going to
sit there and tell me that. That's fair.

248
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,730
The Fuck Outta here.

249
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,410
Okay.

250
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,960
I'll never agree with that,
but I will read your fucking emails.

251
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,870
All of these fucking politicians are all
in these fucking people's back pockets.

252
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,080
Okay?

253
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,890
Don't fucking believe these Goddamn
fucking people who come along and say,

254
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,830
I like Trump. I'm going to, I'm
going to clean up the swell.

255
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:16,550
I'm going to drain the swamp.
He hasn't taken a fucking,

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,870
he hasn't taken a Dixie Cup worth
of water out of that fucking swamp.

257
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,230
Okay.

258
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,630
All right. Cause this is what we
all want to fucking to ignore,

259
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,280
to really change then you would have to
have an all out fucking revolution and

260
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:32,580
there would have to be bloodshed and
the only people that really have the

261
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:35,790
ability to do it would be
those lunatics and blackwater.

262
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,870
They would be the only guys
who'd be able to do it.

263
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:41,070
And all you have to do is cross your
fingers and pray that they're decent

264
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:44,700
fucking human beings because they
actually have the weaponry to pull it off.

265
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,720
Other than that,

266
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,470
all you're going to do is fucking
go after innocent fucking people,

267
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,700
which is what you guys are. Uh,
some of you are fucking advocating

268
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,740
while you ignore the fucking 9,000 pound
gorilla in the room who's paying $0

269
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,910
million in taxes. All right, I'm done
until I read it more later. Rock.

270
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:03,330
Did you guys watch any of the,
um,

271
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,220
I think someone who makes 50 grand
a year should be paying 59% taxes.

272
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,130
Okay.

273
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,980
MMM.

274
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,540
All right.
Did you guys watch it?

275
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,270
Did you guys watch the Duke for
Central Florida game? Oh my God.

276
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:25,130
What a fucking heartbreak of that was.

277
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,760
I didn't know what to do cause I love
Duke, but I also root for an underdog.

278
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,680
And uh,
it was June the end of that game.

279
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,710
It was like the basketball
gods just chose fucking Duke.

280
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,200
You know, that alley. I don't know if
it would look like it was mistimed.

281
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,200
I don't know what.
And then the fucking

282
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,470
Duke misses it and then gets the fucking
rebound and then the shot in the end

283
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:53,240
and the tip and just didn't, just
didn't want to fucking go in. Um,

284
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,890
you know, I'll tell you right
now, if you're a fucking
NBA fan, you're missing out.

285
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,810
You're missing out in what's left of
college basketball because there's so many

286
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:07,470
one and done.
It's just a pleasure to watch

287
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,340
that level of talent and they're
actually listening to their coach.

288
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,670
Okay.

289
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,970
Because that's just what's
missing in the fucking NBA.

290
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,860
This fucking shit where
it's just like these guys,

291
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,970
they make so much fucking money that,

292
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,370
that they, they feel like they, they
don't have to listen to their coach.

293
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:32,840
Yeah.

294
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,940
I just don't know. I'm not
saying all of it, but just,

295
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:36,650
it just blows my fucking mind.

296
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:40,550
It's like you're a platoon and that's
the general and he's coming in with the

297
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,850
fight plan and you're like, ah Nah,
Nah, we're just going to Improv this.

298
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,460
Okay,

299
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,410
we're just going to go, we're all going
to go in there and just start open fire,

300
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,820
you know, in the same general
fucking direction. Okay.

301
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,550
Yeah.

302
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,050
I just feel like when you do that,

303
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:59,940
that's when a team that on paper isn't
as good as you can come in and you're

304
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,310
open yourself up to getting beat.

305
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,790
That's what it is, man. That is, that is,
that is how the NBA game is played. Now.

306
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,610
What is the individual fucking game?
It's the,

307
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:16,520
and one influence on the game,

308
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,550
which I'm not 100% against that level
of fucking creativity in one on one and

309
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,570
all that type of shit.
But like,

310
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,870
you know when you have like a coach just
sitting there with his fucking thumbs

311
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:27,704
up his ass,

312
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,020
cause he can only talk to the
lower fucking 70% of the team.

313
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,760
You know what I mean?

314
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,930
It's almost like those
superstars are like apple, right?

315
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,020
Don't pay their taxes.
They don't want it.

316
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,130
They think they think they're
above being coached. Um,

317
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,050
anyways,
everything's going to go back to that.

318
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,510
I've been paying attention
to the premier league.

319
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,610
Liverpool is still two points ahead,

320
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:58,340
but I looked up the schedule this time
cause I thought that they were in the

321
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:00,050
lead.
It's just they've played more games.

322
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:04,640
They have nine games left and
Man City has 11 games left.

323
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:05,750
And as far as I can tell,

324
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:10,751
none of them really have that much
challenging games left other than man city

325
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:16,170
plays, man United. That could be
the fly in the ointment game there.

326
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:17,570
So I'll try to pay attention.
I'll,

327
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:21,390
I'll watch that game because I figured
that's going to be a big one. Um,

328
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,150
and then I'm going to be
watching the Bruins versus
Tampa Bay lightening tonight.

329
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,950
That's going to be my a, that's
going to be my little fucking, uh,

330
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,790
my little evening tonight. And uh,
I mentioned, uh, last week I went,

331
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,940
I went to the premiere, that
Motley Crue movie, the dirt. Uh,

332
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,440
definitely check it out just to fucking,
I, I really loved the movie. Uh,

333
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,880
didn't pull any punches and uh,

334
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,890
I actually saw some woman
in the La Times was,

335
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,220
was given one of the band
members shit going like,

336
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,250
how could you put a movie out post me too.

337
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:59,230
How could you put a movie out like this?
And the dude was like,

338
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,800
well, I mean it happened. You
want us to rewrite history?

339
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:06,370
It was like the perfect fucking answer.
And if you watch it,

340
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:09,580
what's so fucked up is it's,
it's all consensual sex.

341
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,120
It's just a bunch of
people over indulging.

342
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,450
So have we gotten literally
to this point that,

343
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,070
that a bunch of guys playing in a band
who have a bunch of groupies who want to

344
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:26,200
fuck the shit out of him so
they do is like a bad fuck. Is,

345
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,800
is like somehow like that,
that there was something wrong there.

346
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,340
I mean, you could say there was
something wrong as far as like a,

347
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,640
okay,

348
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,680
what everybody was doing their,

349
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,910
do you want to get into some sort of
religious debate about morals leave if you

350
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:46,911
want to get out of religion and just
talk about the emptiness of living a life

351
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:50,010
like that,
how it's exciting in the beginning,

352
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:55,011
but then afterwards is a
profound loneliness to living
a life like that for both

353
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,750
people that Groupie End,
the fucking rock star.

354
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,390
I can have that fucking
conversation with you,

355
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:02,070
but I don't understand how that fucking,

356
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,863
you know,

357
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,050
I thought me too was you took your dick
out at work and just on a plant, right?

358
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,990
That was in that world,
right?

359
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,020
It wasn't played some songs and chicks
in the crowd is showing that tidies to

360
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:20,610
you.
Then afterwards you bang them.

361
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,630
I didn't think that that that
fell under that fucking umbrella

362
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,480
does meet to basically also get
to the point of like, you know,

363
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,620
the dead men can't go
out and enjoy themselves.

364
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,580
Okay.

365
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,980
If they're out there and they,
if you play in a band,

366
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,430
it's going to its rated pussy,
you know? That's going to happen.

367
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,380
This is actually people
that got into bands

368
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,060
just for the chicks,
and all of a sudden they're fucking,

369
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,930
they're band somehow fucking made it
and they're standing up there without,

370
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,750
in that passion is pussy.

371
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,760
Okay.

372
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,110
Look at Gene Simmons.

373
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,160
I've never heard that guy
talk passionately about music.

374
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:10,140
He just talks passionately about women,

375
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,250
any so obsessed with it.
He literally says Dumb Shit.

376
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:20,251
Like anybody who says they got dual bed
for the music is a fucking liar that got

377
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,670
in it for the pussy. I mean, it,

378
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,040
that's how it that far down
the fucking road that guy is,

379
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,010
if everybody doesn't share my opinion,

380
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,460
okay,

381
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,450
then, then, uh, they're fucking
lying. Um, anyways. Yeah, it was,

382
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:37,170
it was 30,
40 fucking years ago.

383
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,710
And uh, you know, I dunno.

384
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,890
Motley Crue did what a lot of bands did
and they made a fucking movie about it.

385
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,850
And even then, it's sort of like,
they kind of glossed over a lot of it.

386
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,070
So I don't, I don't understand
what the fucking problem is.

387
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,770
There's always somebody,
now let's get some sort of problems.

388
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,780
Don't she think that that
movie about seagulls,

389
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,620
Josie, does it misses the
mark about the main issue,

390
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:06,760
the main issue being the issue
that am I'm concerned with.

391
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:08,900
Okay.

392
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,880
By the way,
my favorite thing right now

393
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,370
on the Internet

394
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,820
is crystally is, uh, that
thing he did that thing,

395
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:22,510
he's trying to start jokingly
or not called the unfollowing

396
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,670
follow Chris Delea on
Instagram and scroll through.

397
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm sure he's made a couple
videos since his last one.

398
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:31,290
He did this fucking thing I,
and I was talking about,

399
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,400
I think I've just talked about this,

400
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:35,460
but I just want to promote it
again because I think it's a,

401
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:37,590
like all those Instagram models,
you know?

402
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,960
Okay.

403
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,760
It goes, hey, he goes,

404
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:45,650
make no mistake if you're on Instagram
and you're taking pictures of your booty

405
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,410
and you Teddy's, yeah. Okay.

406
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,210
And he literally breaks it down to all
of this shit that I didn't even know

407
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:01,470
exist that I guess, you know, hot
chicks biting into a giant sandwich,

408
00:23:01,471 --> 00:23:06,180
like looking up in the air, trying to be,
try to be cute or something like that.

409
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,380
And it's like, uh, I don't know.

410
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:13,560
He's just saying to unfollow them,
which is fucking funny to me

411
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,840
because I'm not in that world at all.

412
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,380
But I was talking to younger
comics about this and I, you know,

413
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,230
they run into these people I guess,
and they were saying like, yeah,

414
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:27,140
they actually come up to you
and have like an attitude.

415
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,890
Like they're doing something
now they are doing something.

416
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:31,880
They are going to the gym,

417
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:36,881
they are keeping themselves in shape
and God bless him in an entrepreneurial

418
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:41,330
way. I respect the fact that
they're building a brand here.

419
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,860
Um,
but okay,

420
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,430
I don't,
uh,

421
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,330
I don't coach sign on then walking
around acting like an egotistical maniac.

422
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,370
If that's what the fuck that dude,
I don't fucking know.

423
00:23:55,371 --> 00:24:00,130
There's so much shit on there.
That's fucking hilarious.
I saw it. Somebody made,

424
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,450
made a post where they would talk when
it was women's Day and of course they

425
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:06,810
were like, you know, fuck that. It should
be women's Day every day of the year.

426
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,110
Which is hilarious because it's just like,
and when would it be guys day then?

427
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,240
Does that seem fair to you?

428
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,900
And the person like took like a fucking
picture and it's like a sexy picture.

429
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,910
Like they couldn't just make their,
their statement.

430
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:23,190
They also had to show off their fucking,
you know,

431
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,120
they're flat stomach and their fucking
ass and stuff. It's just like, it's like,

432
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,410
what, what are you,
what are we doing here?

433
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,950
It's like if that exact picture,

434
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,790
if a guy used it to sell like,
uh,

435
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,490
like it out some Coca Cola,
it'd be like objectifying women,

436
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,590
Shell Jody Dki Blake needs to
change. But then, you know, I dunno,

437
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,990
but then you can't do it if it's you
doing it to yourself selling woman's Day.

438
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,300
I don't know. I don't, I don't
get out of fucking math works,

439
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:56,700
but you know something I
was never good at math.

440
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,163
Yeah.

441
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,490
All I can tell you this is,

442
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:05,020
I don't think Lebron James should have
to give away 70% of his money over $10

443
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,310
million. I don't, I don't, I think he's
already fucking paying well over 50,

444
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,610
Tom Brady, all of these fucking
people and I think you know something.

445
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,010
I think you paying your
fair share at that point.

446
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,970
How much more fucking money do you want
to take from these fucking people while

447
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:23,390
ignoring people who are
paying no money in taxes.

448
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,840
Why? Ignoring companies that are
leading us off into war that has no end,

449
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
that bankrupts the country.
That's a separate issue.

450
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,510
Oh, Jesus. All right, let me
read some advertising here. Hey,

451
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,480
my bookie, I look for
you doing all right. Um,

452
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,390
brackets first round upsets the
final four march madness is here,

453
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,280
right there on your television screen.

454
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,430
It's time to bet with the
best at my bookie. Hey,

455
00:25:56,431 --> 00:26:01,431
would you rather sit at your office
desk or call out sick and binge on Ncaa

456
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,600
Tournament Games and junk food? Like
that's okay. Or let's see. Would you,

457
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,610
would you rather s I am the worst.

458
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,970
Would you rather sit at your office
desk or call out sick and binge on NCA

459
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:17,630
tournament games and junk
food? Like that's even a
choice. I love how these guys,

460
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:21,800
they're not even trying to hide how
to generate the year gamble on sports.

461
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,120
It don't go to work.

462
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,560
Don't even have an apple
eat some Fritos anyways.

463
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:30,980
Sometimes it feels good to be bad.
It's the balance of life,

464
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,820
especially when it's
with someone you trust.

465
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,700
And if you're looking for a
place to get in on the action,

hoping that dream person
walked by and they need a job.

485
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,410
It ain't like that anymore.

Oh Geez. We've got a lot today.
What do we got here? What do we,

504
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,580
what do we have here? Uh, you know
what, I got one, two, three left,

505
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:07,620
so I'm going to break them up.
I'll read the third one here.

506
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:11,960
We'll get over the hump. This
is Wednesday here. Simply safe.

507
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,940
Hi fellows.
Here's something interesting.

508
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:18,270
Studies show that security
systems deter burglars.

509
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,540
It's a fact, but there's still a
burglary every eight seconds in America.

510
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,400
Um, how well think about
it. Think about it.

511
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:34,110
Do burglaries give up just because
somehow swi houses have security systems?

512
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,140
Of course not. They just find
a house that isn't protected.

513
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,810
That's why securing your home is
truly necessary. So wait a minute.

514
00:29:41,811 --> 00:29:45,230
So if everybody ends up getting a security
system that these guys are going to

515
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,930
have to up their game like a
virus because of, uh, you know,

516
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:50,600
if you don't kill the virus,
you just keep using the medicine.

517
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,770
They get immune to it.

518
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,830
Okay,

519
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,120
we have to kill the virus.

520
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,460
Okay,

521
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,490
so simply safe, what I would be doing
if I was them, I would eventually,

522
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:01,470
I would come with up
with a security system.

523
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,770
Okay.

524
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,050
No, it only detours the
intruder. It also kills them.

525
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,160
Okay.

526
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,340
All right.
But that's a different read.

527
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,900
Simply save senses will protect every
point of access to your home doors,

528
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,790
windows, garage, you name it.

529
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,880
If a burglary even tries to
break in and ear shattering side

530
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,380
it, maybe it was old cy, five things
where they would shoot like a sound rate.

531
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,090
It's somebody they would just
grab both their residents be like

532
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,750
drop to their knees. Uh, Jesus Christ.

533
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,980
I just picture the burglar
dressed like Captain Kirk. Uh,

534
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,650
best of balls simply saves
24. You wouldn't want him
in, is he a fucking house?

535
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:47,100
He tried to bang your wife first
of all. Simply see, saves 24,

536
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:52,101
seven monitoring is just 1499 a month
and they'll never lock you in a longterm

537
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,320
contract.
More than 3 million people already know.

538
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:58,830
It feels good to feel
less with simply safe.

539
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,060
So go with the only home
security system you can trust.

543
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:20,540
S I. M p. L. I. S. A. F. E. Okay.

544
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,590
bird.com. All right, let's plow ahead.

545
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,030
Alright. Cubans role
too tight. Hey, Billy,

546
00:31:30,031 --> 00:31:31,390
suction face.
Uh,

547
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,220
if you're Cubans turn your face
purple when you smoke them,

548
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,650
then they are probably counterfeit.

549
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,310
I know people tell me that but you know
something, I have to be honest with you.

550
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,140
I get a lot of Dominicans,

551
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,170
I get a lot of Nicaraguans and
I run into this same problem.

552
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,050
Not the same problem with the Cubans.

553
00:31:48,051 --> 00:31:52,490
So if somebody making fake
Nicaraguans and Dominican's anyways,

554
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:56,430
the demand for Cuban cigars far,
far outweighs the availability.

555
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,000
Um, and here's another
thing too sir. I fucking,

556
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,470
I've smoked him in different countries
and I've had run into the same problem.

557
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,230
Maybe you're saying the worldwide demand,

558
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,920
which you're probably right so they are
often faked in nearly indistinguishable

559
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:17,230
from the real deal.
Even for the train I,

560
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,070
it's only when you start smoking
them that it's noticeable.

561
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,840
Rolling a good cigar is a true art
which is not mastered by counterfeiters

562
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:27,100
looking for a quick buck.

563
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,770
The demand for Dominican's for example
is a lot lower and they are not con and

564
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:34,150
they are not considered
extremely rare or valuable.

565
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,640
They are rarely counterfeit
greetings from Ghent,

566
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,450
Belgium and as per usual go fuck
yourself. Well he is in Belgium, so, yeah.

567
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,100
Yeah.
I gotta be honest with you,

568
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:46,460
I'm kind of getting away from
the Cubans because they're,

569
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:50,190
they're really expensive. And, um,

570
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,980
I remember one time
when I was in Australia,

571
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,620
I must've got the real deal because I
bought these cohibas and when I came back

572
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,630
they, they were, they were incredible.

573
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:03,680
Okay.

574
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,890
Like they were a cigar that
as you were lighting it,

575
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,030
like the first couple of puffs
you went, oh my God. Oh my God.

576
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,430
That's believing what you do. Your
whole body fucking relaxes. And it's,

577
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:20,020
it's an amazing, having said
that, I would like to quit those.

578
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:24,070
That might be the next thing
that I want to do. And I am, um,

579
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,460
I am,

580
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,300
I would like to just replace all my vices
with something a little more healthy

581
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,440
and then eventually come back
to a vice that isn't a bad vice.

582
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,680
Yeah.

583
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,880
What's your vice,
you know,

584
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,930
I guess I think I read
too much in bad lighting.

585
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,710
I have to stop. I know I'm so
bad. I need to go to meetings.

586
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:49,430
Like I'd love to be that
fucking person, you know? Um,

587
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:52,760
so eventually I think I'm gonna
like get down to maybe like three,

588
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:56,390
four cigars a year, the Rose
Bowl, the big college game,

589
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:01,440
my birthday, and then something
around Christmas. And um,

590
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:02,770
okay.

591
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,770
Just sort of leave it at that because
I am really getting into living like a

592
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:08,800
fucking nerd.

593
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,973
MMM.

594
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,150
You know, it's underrated
or overrated, underrated.

595
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,180
I'll tell you underrated reading a great
book at night to make you sleepy rather

596
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:22,040
than staring at a screen.
And A,

597
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:26,270
I've kind of realized that one of my vices
is the amount of time that I spend on

598
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:27,104
my phone

599
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,970
and um,

600
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,380
I want to get used to like not being,

601
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,283
uh,

602
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,810
you know,

603
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,110
like I'll be in the car and I just find
myself going over and picking it up like,

604
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,600
like a fucking child with,

605
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:46,500
with its little favorite teddy bear and
fucking sitting there looking at the God

606
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:50,700
damn screen and it's like I'm driving,
scrolling, trying to find a song.

607
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,443
MMM.

608
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,030
So I think what I'm going to just,

609
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,030
okay,

610
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,590
I tried to put it in airplane mode,

611
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:01,020
but then most of my songs
are on the fucking cloud.

612
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:02,820
And then I lose all my God damn music.

613
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,040
So now what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to have a playlist, download those,

614
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:09,660
you know,
10 songs or whatever,

615
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:13,110
and then put it on airplane mode and
then literally take the thing and fucking

616
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,910
throw it in the back seat.
Um,

617
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,180
I would like to do that and um,

618
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,570
okay.

619
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:25,290
But I'll tell you man, underrated.
Fucking reading back into it.

620
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,140
And,
uh,

621
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:28,841
and I told you,

622
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:32,020
I had this woman telling me that I
wasn't going to be able to learn French,

623
00:35:32,021 --> 00:35:36,700
saw back to the flash cards
and stuff. And, uh, I got a
couple of friends of mine,

624
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:40,870
I can French. So we only text each
other strictly in French. And I'm not,

625
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:44,050
I'm really starting to learn this shit.
I can't speak it well,

626
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:48,520
but I can read it really well now, or
at least to another level. And it's,

627
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:53,590
uh, I mean, I can, I can fucking be doing
that rather than slowly killing myself.

628
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:56,690
And killing brain cells and shit. And, um,

629
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,560
okay.

630
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,290
I Dunno man. I think, uh, you know,

631
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,680
like I had that cookout yesterday and
there was a bunch of people over and shit

632
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,800
and I was stoned, fucking sober.
So then, you know, it was,

633
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,490
I'm walking around and then I run
into my kid, hey, how you doing?

634
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:12,780
I'm not like buzzed.

635
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,140
Yeah,

636
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,190
they, there's a low point in
your fucking life, you know,

637
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,340
having a little buzz going, then you
see your fucking kid. It's just like,

638
00:36:21,341 --> 00:36:22,180
what am I doing?

639
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,590
What if something happens right now and
I need to react and I'm a little buzzed

640
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:29,320
right now. I just can't fucking do
it anymore. Then the guilt of it,

641
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:34,300
I can't handle it. So, um, anyways,
I agree with you sir. I like the, uh,

642
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:38,800
the Casa Magna's, the, uh,
I, I swear to God, I think
they're called calligraphy us,

643
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:41,920
like that fucking half a porno movie.
Um,

644
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,060
I liked the Aurora emeralds and um,

645
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,960
there's a couple of my father's cigars
that I really like, but, um, I don't know.

646
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:55,320
I'm going to be basically trying to
phase those fuckers up. All right.

647
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:58,840
Card Games and board games.
Um,

648
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,300
hey bill catching up on the podcasts. I
heard you had fun playing cards. Yeah,

649
00:37:02,301 --> 00:37:06,740
I loved it. Played with my
mom. It was awesome. Uh, you
should check out the word.

650
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:07,990
Okay.

651
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,750
Um,
the world of card games and board games.

652
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,380
There's a regular popular
game called five crowns.

653
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:19,360
That's a rummy style game. That is fun.
Also, board games have come a long way.

654
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:24,250
I feel like you may have been a
risk guy. I was, I loved that game.

655
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,830
Taking over the world. Uh, though
I don't recall you saying it.

656
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,740
Oh, I love that fucking game. Uh,

657
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,870
there are a great strategy games
out there that are fun to play with.

658
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:37,570
Friends and cigars.
Uh,

659
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,570
people love settlers of Catan or Catan.
Again,

660
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,170
that is probably sold.

661
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,490
Okay.

662
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,480
Thriller like numbers in
the tabletop game world.

663
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,940
I'm going to check that out. Hey,
you know what? I missed? I lost.

664
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,750
Um,

665
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:00,610
let me see if I that
meditation fucking music.

666
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,490
I lost it. Uh, you fucking asshole bill.

667
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,070
Okay.

668
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,990
I was really looking forward to that shit.

669
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,390
God Damn.
I'll be able to find it.

670
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,080
I guess it's just that music that goes
on for like fucking three hours or I can

671
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:20,560
just go back and listen to my old pod.
You know?

672
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,710
Is is amazing here. I don't, I
don't even know how to fuck. Sorry.

673
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:24,580
I just unplug something.

674
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,890
I don't know if you know how to
fucking listen to my own podcast.

675
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,750
How pathetic is that?
Um,

676
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:30,960
okay.

677
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,910
All right. I'll definitely
be checking these things out.

678
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,830
He says there's a game called secret.

679
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,350
Okay.

680
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,280
That's pretty involved. I'm not sure
you'd have time in your schedule,

681
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:45,200
but it's worth looking at. Seek.
There's a game called secret Hitler

682
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,530
object.
Find the person in the game who's had,

683
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,310
who's starting the final solution again.
Um,

684
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,930
even the classics are fun to revisit.
Monopoly life, et cetera. Yeah,

685
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:00,880
I love that stuff.
And my kid gets a little bit bigger.

686
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,850
I want to start playing those games.
Have a game night.

687
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:05,800
We already have the night where we go out.

688
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,010
This will kill my standup career game
that I can't, I can't do that Gig.

689
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:13,060
I have game night. I can't do that
Gig. I have to go out for 'em.

690
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,590
Okay.

691
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,310
I you have to go out, take my family
out for dinner. Hey, by the way,

692
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,520
anybody who lives in La and you know
some really good mom and pop places,

693
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,520
it doesn't have to be healthy or
anything. What in the fuck is that? Oh,

694
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:26,890
it's a cat. Jesus Christ.
I thought it was a raccoon.

695
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,570
I just saw a fucking cat

696
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,240
just came up in the fucking
window through the blinds.

697
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,580
Who's was like looking in like
it was going to do something.

698
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,290
Okay.

699
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:43,180
Cat's a creepy man. They just, they just
are man. They just always think they,

700
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,260
they think too much.
You look at a dog, it's,

701
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:48,880
it does not fucking thinking about
anything. Catch just had that fucking,

702
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,050
that they're plotting,

703
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:51,723
you know,

704
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,620
very female energy.
You have,

705
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,910
you just sit next to your girlfriend
and you just feel them thinking,

706
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:02,290
you're like, fuck, here we go.
Here we go. What's wrong now?

707
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,550
What the fuck is wrong now?
Or at girlfriend forcing me to go vegan.

708
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:09,240
Speaking of which,
I bet that guy fell toward thinking.

709
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,620
Okay.

710
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,320
Uh, first of all, before
we even get into this,

711
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,110
okay.

712
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,080
Uh, your girl could friend
cannot force you to do anything.

713
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,710
You need to fucking eat a steak
in front of her and say, listen,

714
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:24,010
you either love me or you don't.
I already know the solution to this.

715
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,273
All right.

716
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,051
Hey,
Billy,

717
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:32,850
longtime listener and first time I've
written in as I desperately need some

718
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:36,420
advice. My girl and I had been together
for about eight months. She's awesome.

719
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:41,400
And I get laid about three
times a week. All right. Um,

720
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,290
weird sentence.
Uh,

721
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:47,250
things have gradually gotten more
serious and we now spend most evenings

722
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:51,180
together eating dinner even though we
don't stay over with each other every

723
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,280
night. Well, that's good. That's healthy.

724
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:55,770
That you'd still have a
little bitty independence.

725
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,930
We mostly eat dinner at her place,

726
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:02,640
so she does the grocery shopping and
she's also Vegan, which isn't bad dude.

727
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,870
She's, you know, provided
she's buying, you know,

728
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,540
I guess organic.
How do you even tell if it's organic?

729
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:12,210
Because I've heard from a lot of people
then this might come from the meat

730
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:14,490
industry. I've no idea. But I've heard
from a lot of people that, you know,

731
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:18,990
the amount of pesticides they spray on
sometimes actually eating some iceberg

732
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:22,890
lettuce might be more for you than
eating a fucking pig. Um, who knows.

733
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,290
Okay.

734
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,430
Also,
she's a Vegan.

735
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:28,670
She recently decided that she
was not going to buy meat for me.

736
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,680
So it's easy to cook. Plus it's
better for the environment and health.

737
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,940
Basically. All the fucking arguments
vegans use against us. Carnivores. Yeah.

738
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:42,050
All the cows farting it up into
the atmosphere. I do love me,

739
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,080
but also love this girl.
It would honestly go Vegan for,

740
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,260
should I just be done with it and cut,

741
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,960
cut it meat. Oh, see,

742
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,260
I think you might say cut out meat or
am I setting setting the tone for the

743
00:41:56,261 --> 00:42:00,460
whole relationship to get treated like
a little bitch. Appreciate your advice.

744
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:04,000
All right. I like that you're
asking these questions, sir.

745
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,530
So you're still in a healthy
place mentally. Ah, that's
what I would say to her.

746
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,520
Just be like,
listen.

747
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,243
MMM.

748
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,770
I'm willing to do this for us,
but I'm also,

749
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:20,771
I would be lying to you if I wasn't
nervous that I was setting a tone that,

750
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:26,090
you know, if say you don't like
March madness that I'm Greg,

751
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,130
I'm eventually going to stop watching it.

752
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,510
So you gotta do it in a
funnier way than that.

753
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,083
Okay.

754
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,413
MMM.

755
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,521
I Dunno.

756
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:42,290
I don't think going Vegan if the person
knows what the fuck they're doing,

757
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,420
cause there's a lot of fat
vegetarians out there, um,

758
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,630
who are eating chips and
cheese made from potatoes. Um,

759
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:52,560
okay.

760
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,220
But the, you know, they're not
necessarily healthy, you know,

761
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:58,650
when the carbon it up.
Um,

762
00:42:58,651 --> 00:43:01,350
I know there's a lot of fake meat and
shit out there now. There's a lot of,

763
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,820
there's a lot of ways to go.

764
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,473
MMM.

765
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,230
I am not nearly it read enough on this
subject to give you any sort of advice as

766
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:14,490
to which way to go.
But I think your concern is correct.

767
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:16,570
MMM.

768
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,870
I would just go slow. I would
just say, all right, look,

769
00:43:19,871 --> 00:43:24,400
if you just want to cook Vegan here
and then I would just, which isn't bad,

770
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,070
it's not bad to take a break from it,
I wouldn't think.

771
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,810
MMM.

772
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,310
I Dunno, I, but I also
know that it to really do

773
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:36,973
okay.

774
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,130
Do the Vegan thing correctly.

775
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:40,660
Okay.

776
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,590
I actually, you know something
to be a mediator and, and
and, and just eat up too.

777
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,000
Just really eat well.

778
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:49,720
Is he borderline need a
fucking degree in something.

779
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,311
First of all,

780
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:56,311
you got to be half a fucking private eye
to try and figure out where the organic

781
00:43:56,771 --> 00:44:00,640
shit is because everything now is free
range. Everything is fucking Oregon.

782
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,280
The amount of chickens that
they say a fucking free range,

783
00:44:03,281 --> 00:44:07,060
but there's still those fucking Arnold
Schwartzenegger roid it up fucking

784
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:11,400
chickens. Cause I remember when I
watched a, that, that documentary, um,

785
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,150
I forgot what the fuck it was
called. Uh, not you are what you eat.

786
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:17,410
Okay.

787
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,600
Something about food. And I
saw, I was like, man, fuck this.

788
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:23,320
I got to go find an organic chicken dude.
I mean,

789
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,760
I had to go to a farmer's market and then
I had to sift through all the bullshit

790
00:44:27,761 --> 00:44:30,970
there and get people to honestly
tell me this guy finally,

791
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,920
like he had the Cuban three actual real
Cubans in the back. And when he held up,

792
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:39,210
when he showed me a what a real chicken
looks like, it looked, I was like,

793
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:42,300
is that what does that a fucking
pigeon? It's like, no, that's, that's,

794
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,980
that's what they're supposed to look like.
It looked like a player,

795
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,910
a football player in the 1930s versus
one in the fucking eighties and nineties

796
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:52,440
when they were fucking all roid it up.

797
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:59,010
Not linkedin does not doing roids
now. Um, Oh, speaking of which, uh,

798
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,750
football players,
uh,

799
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,500
congratulations to rob Gronkowski
going out as a champion.

800
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:09,501
Thank you so much for all your fucking
everything you did over the years playing

801
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:14,430
for the Patriots.
And I actually think it's a great move.

802
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,180
Um, especially when you see, you know,

803
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,280
the results of playing
the game and all that.

804
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:22,920
I think he's leaving at a perfect time.
He's got his money.

805
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:24,683
MMM.

806
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,800
He was really taken a lot of
hits basically below the waist,

807
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:30,240
which was the only way to get them down.

808
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:32,310
And they would just chop
and his fucking legs down.

809
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,570
And he was probably sick of going into
surgeries and being hurt and all of that.

810
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:40,170
And just the fact that the last game he
played, he made the biggest fucking play,

811
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:43,170
that big catch that got
us to touch down that uh,

812
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,200
put us over the top and
one s our six super bowl.

813
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,323
Um,

814
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:49,450
okay.

815
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:54,250
Yeah. Hall of fame, New England
Patriot without a doubt. I don't know,

816
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,270
you know, I don't collect football cards
anymore, so I don't know what his, uh,

817
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,231
his numbers are.

818
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:03,970
But I got a good feeling about the actual
pro football hall of fame in Canton.

819
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,320
So, and I also did a roast with them one
time and he was such a fucking cool guy.

820
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:09,851
And,
uh,

821
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:13,360
there's a lot of people out there that
think he's his big dumb guy and he isn't.

822
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,850
I remember I was talking to him about,

823
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,753
MMM,

824
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,930
we've talking about going to concerts
and he was saying how much he fucking

825
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:21,980
hated how people will sit in,

826
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:26,420
they're videoing their experience rather
than having the experience he's going

827
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:28,670
like, it's like you're
there, enjoy the experience.

828
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,170
And I remember thinking in that going,

829
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:34,010
I wish people could hear this
fucking conversation. So, you know,

830
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:36,890
cause they always just think, they always
think that about big fucking people,

831
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:41,240
that they're fucking dumb. He was not, he
was not. And he did great on the roast.

832
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,130
Uh, Bandy was funny, you know. Anyways,
so plowing ahead here, I would, um,

833
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:51,230
you know, I would use this thing as
an opportunity to basically, yeah.

834
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,300
Set some boundaries in your relationship
in a funny way, and just be like,

835
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:57,400
all right, you know what, I'll
be beacon when I'm at your house.

836
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:58,900
Okay.

837
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,370
And if, um, you know, if she's pushing
you to become Vegan and your house,

838
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:07,780
just be like, you know, I, I
really enjoy a steak. I really do.

839
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,870
And, um, I'm going to keep eating it.

840
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,160
And if you're going to break up
with me over a pork chop, then, uh,

841
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:21,610
they're probably really wasn't love
here in the first place. Um, meanwhile,

842
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,980
you know, read up on fucking
nutrition. I mean, I'm,

843
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:26,740
I'm giving you advice
that I should be taken.

844
00:47:26,741 --> 00:47:31,741
I should read up on it too because I've
been really well over the last year and

845
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:37,080
now that I've, uh, I should
say since July and I'm,

846
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,200
I had so many put together a diet for me
and I pretty much loosely use that with

847
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:45,460
some of my older bad habits. I'm
not going to lie to you and, um,

848
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,450
and just cutting out the booze,
it's been really easy to sort of maintain,

849
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:51,760
uh,
uh,

850
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,360
a decent body weight is probably the
smartest thing that you could fucking do.

851
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,530
Learn how to defend yourself and
learn how to eat right. You know,

852
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,090
figure out why you fucked up so you
don't take it out on somebody else and go

853
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:05,360
out and go find a great person

854
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,143
and then

855
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,940
work on the relationship
like this person's doing
rather than bailing. Cause I,

856
00:48:11,941 --> 00:48:15,130
I actually have a theory about
divorce where I think a lot of them,

857
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,700
they could have fixed it if they just
were working on it along the way.

858
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,060
And then you just start thinking like,
oh, this person's a fucking asshole.

859
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:23,990
And then he just had this
fantasy that you're going to

860
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,500
okay

861
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,120
meets it.

862
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,600
You just basically chasing that feeling
you had when you both met each other in

863
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:32,300
the beginning and you're just
never going to be brand new.

864
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,490
Okay.

865
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,690
You just have to accept that,

866
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:39,250
but you can get back to different levels
of emotional heights if you actually

867
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:43,560
work on it. Like the dumbest
thing ever. Just doing shit. Like,

868
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,690
you know what family dinner night and
everybody puts away their phones or

869
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:50,530
whatever and it's just you. Or if you're
single or whatever, you be not married,

870
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:54,210
you can go out to a movie and uh,
I'm telling you,

871
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:58,740
turn it off your phone is a fucking
huge thing. Um, that I've discovered,

872
00:48:58,741 --> 00:49:03,690
especially if you get fucking massive
add like me. Okay. Where are we here?

873
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,710
Big Sugar.

874
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:06,510
Okay.

875
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:06,731
All right.

876
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:10,120
I can't tell if this is a place to go
skiing or this is more stuff about food.

877
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,250
Hey,
Billy Ball balls.

878
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:17,251
Last week or so you went off on one email
proposing a massive tax on the rich.

879
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,760
No, I didn't. No, I did not.

880
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:27,210
I went off on a massive
tax on honest Americans.

881
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,070
Yeah.

882
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,200
Okay.
This is not a tax on the rich.

883
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:36,230
This is a tax on people who are not smart
enough or corrupt enough to have their

884
00:49:37,231 --> 00:49:39,150
money in offshore accounts.

885
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,380
That's what I went off on.

886
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,150
He said that I learned about how tax
dollars are feeding billions to sugar

887
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:48,984
industry.

888
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:54,060
The US government has subsidized the
domestic sugar industry so much that

889
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:59,061
domestic sugar prices are up to 50% more
than their international counterparts.

890
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,720
Separate issue.
Separate issue

891
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:10,020
the government does is by establishing
quotas that limit imports.

892
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,790
So now more domestic production means
that there is more farmland did take up by

893
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:17,700
sugar. Yeah. Which is people are
starting to say as a carcinogen.

894
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,180
Okay.

895
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,360
Um, there's another thing too, when
you cut sugar out of your diet,

896
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,820
like I've been having this
fucking almond butter.

897
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,650
I know big Hollywood fucking phony.

898
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,020
You have to apologize for
trying to eat right. Right. Uh,

899
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,980
it's like when I drove a Prius savage
dude, dude, but he fucking, you know,

900
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,270
saint all homophobic shit to me cause I
was cause you're just reminding people

901
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:39,104
that hey man,

902
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,670
the way we're doing this shit is steering
us into the fucking sun here. Um,

903
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,750
anyways,
uh,

904
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,570
and my wife had bought some peanut butter
for my daughter and it was just the

905
00:50:49,571 --> 00:50:51,070
regular kind and I,
you know,

906
00:50:51,071 --> 00:50:53,230
we ran out of almond butter
and I put some on some toast,

907
00:50:53,231 --> 00:50:57,970
I bit into it and I have fortunately
such little amount of sugar, my diet.

908
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,960
Then I bit into it like I literally am
like my fucking my mouth Packard like

909
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:06,880
Jesus Christ, I had no idea how much
sugar is in fucking peanut butter.

910
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,220
It's insane. It's anyways, he goes,

911
00:51:09,221 --> 00:51:12,580
if you are wondering why kids
are getting beards at 10,

912
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,560
then this might be why these companies
don't want to pay for real sugar.

913
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,600
So they just make another sweet poison
and call it sugar free. The volume.

914
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:23,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

915
00:51:23,561 --> 00:51:28,561
The environmental impacts are also dire
with sugar beets causing worsening soil

916
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:32,380
quality and water pollution that
is much worse than other crops.

917
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:37,510
The worst part of all is is the insane
amount of money these bastards get like

918
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:42,511
one Florida farm families getting 150
to 250 million that comes out of the

919
00:51:42,701 --> 00:51:45,880
taxpayers' pockets. Separate issue. Also,

920
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:49,720
the increased sugar prices may
companies in food processing,

921
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:54,610
you have to lay off 10,000 to 20,000
employees a year while sugar growers can

922
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,630
usually make up to $750,000 a year.

923
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:03,490
Sorry, 750 million a year.
No, seven 50,000 a year.

924
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:07,900
That doesn't make any sense. I think
you put the wrong number there. Um,

925
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,233
uh,

926
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:15,420
the American sugar alliance is one of
the most funded lobbying groups with a

927
00:52:15,421 --> 00:52:20,220
handful of companies bringing in the mass
amounts of the 4 billion in subsidies.

928
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,540
The taxpayer's give.

929
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:24,750
I hope you found this
important and interesting and
has always go fuck yourself.

930
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,613
Yeah.

931
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:30,940
Handful of look at that is one of
the most funded lobbying groups.

932
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,670
Yep. Then where do you
think all that money goes?

933
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,150
Do you think it just goes to the
lobbying or do you think it goes into

934
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:40,250
politicians pet projects?

935
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,150
It's fucking ridiculous
how corrupt that is.

936
00:52:44,151 --> 00:52:48,890
And you're going to go after the people
who create an APP or people who start

937
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:52,520
movement watches these, these,
these people are the fucking, yeah,

938
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:56,030
they had a fucking problem.
You can ignore all the corruptions.

939
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:00,410
So here's a guy here who's basically
going to fucking tear me a new asshole.

940
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,660
Yeah.

941
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,490
All right. And I love the
title. Why I stopped listening.

942
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:06,570
Okay?

943
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,330
And this is the classic baby.

944
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,090
Okay?

945
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:13,930
That exists. Now you know you,
you know you, you don't, you,

946
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:17,230
you have a difference of opinion.
So you're going to stop listening.

947
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,730
You fucking child.

948
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:20,450
Okay?

949
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,900
As if my words somehow affected your life,
like I said,

950
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,360
that and then what the IRS

951
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,590
is actually going to be going after these
fucking people did not. All right. Why?

952
00:53:30,591 --> 00:53:34,310
I stopped listening. Bill, I've
stopped listening to your pod.

953
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,130
What are you fucking eight years old?
I felt that I should tell you why.

954
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,210
[inaudible] much like a restaurant
who loses a loyal customer,

955
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,120
wants to know why, what
went wrong? You, you know,

956
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,310
you love how he's putting
those words in my mouth.

957
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:56,480
Like I give a fuck that an absolute
child isn't going to listen to my fucking

958
00:53:56,481 --> 00:54:00,650
podcast. Uh, so no hard
feelings, but here it is.

959
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,540
You should like flip your hair right
now. Like d Schneider, is that his name?

960
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:08,120
The guy from twisted sister, when
he made that point, you know,

961
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:12,290
when he was in front of
Congress about the PMRC man. Um,

962
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:16,940
I have never heard a more selfish
mouth breathing uninformed money.

963
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:20,960
Grubbing can't speak in my entire life.
This is what I love.

964
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,510
I don't even mean I don't
make $10 million a year.

965
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,240
I don't make $10 million a year.

966
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:30,740
So I was actually defending people
whose tax money would actually go,

967
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:31,730
I guess to help me.

968
00:54:31,731 --> 00:54:35,840
And somehow I'm money grubbing because
this person's so up the ass of their own

969
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:40,310
fucking point. They can't even listen
to what it is that I'm saying. He goes,

970
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:44,900
sometimes you say something halfway smart,
but it is surrounded.

971
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,920
He says my so much bullshit,
he's calling me dumb.

972
00:54:48,921 --> 00:54:52,490
He didn't even hit spellcheck
by so much bullshit.

973
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,690
It makes me feel you stumbled into
saying it by accident. Yes sir.

974
00:54:56,691 --> 00:55:00,740
Because no one could ever be as smart
as you like how a monkey banging on a

975
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:04,580
typewriter might somehow
type out Shakespeare.

976
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,380
I don't think a monkey
banging out a typewriter.

977
00:55:09,381 --> 00:55:11,060
It might somehow type out Shakespeare.

978
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:15,650
I think what you meant meant to say is
that he might accidentally spell a word

979
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:20,210
correctly, like might
accidentally spelled the or act.

980
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:23,060
I don't think you meant Shakespeare.
All right. You know what I'm finding,

981
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,330
I think you wrote this in a
very high emotional state here.

982
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:30,530
So I'll cut you some slack. And
uh, I've always said I'm a moron.

983
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,890
Okay.
And even now that I'm reading,

984
00:55:33,891 --> 00:55:38,870
I'm reading like the fucking Beastie boy
autobiography. I'm reading the fucking,

985
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,300
which actually is I'm finding
out, uh, is, is a history book,

986
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:49,030
um, on a certain genre of music that
I believe the kids called hip hop.

987
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:54,550
Um, all right. The biggest problem is you
cannot see beyond your own experience.

988
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,820
Making $10 million a year
is not my experience.

989
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,360
I've never made $10 million in a year.
Okay.

990
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:07,361
And this is most evident in your
recent diatribe about the 70% tax rate.

991
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,630
I Dunno. I like to think I get, you know.

992
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,910
Okay.

993
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,910
I don't always, but I like
to think, you know, I,

994
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,120
I try to at least listen to both sides
I guess. I guess I, I guess I don't,

995
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,630
in case your memory is
blinded your own rage.

996
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:26,490
Yeah.

997
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,030
What about your rage?

998
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:32,470
Let me go over some dumb ass
things that you said on Monday,

999
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:34,060
March 18th first of all,
sir,

1000
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,900
you calling me a mouth breather and
you're saying that I have rage and you're

1001
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:42,610
literally misspelling words and you're
so angry at me right now that you can't

1002
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:46,450
present your opinion without
calling me names anyways.

1003
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,960
You called people making
10 million plus a year,

1004
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:54,550
regular guys who are deserving of empathy.
Sure.

1005
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,150
Some are your,
what was me lament of these poor,

1006
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:02,140
poor millionaires made my blood boil.
Exactly,

1007
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,460
exactly. It. Look how
you just phrased that.

1008
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:08,840
Yeah.

1009
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,610
Luca, these poor, poor millionaires,

1010
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:15,440
you're judging them and who they are
because of how much money they make,

1011
00:57:15,441 --> 00:57:19,250
and you're going to turn it into a Disney
movie where anybody who makes money is

1012
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:23,760
fucking evil.
Makes my blood boil.

1013
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:28,710
Fuck you. This guy literally just
said blinded by rage. Fuck you.

1014
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:33,780
You implied that money
tax from millionaires goes
directly back to lazy cons

1015
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,280
making less.

1016
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,093
Okay.

1017
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,740
I don't remember saying that. Maybe
I did. Maybe I did. All right.

1018
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:45,460
You said it isn't fair that people being
honest with their income have to pay

1019
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:49,780
this rate. Uh, while rich people
hide their incomes overseas.

1020
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:53,650
You also said that tax money
is being wasted, wasted,

1021
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,610
and then he just says
corrupt the bullshit. I agree
with both of these things.

1022
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:01,970
These are separate problems
that also need to be fixed.

1023
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,860
You're often being,

1024
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,730
you're often being dumb bullshit like this

1025
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,013
up.

1026
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,200
What as if the government
can't do two things at once.

1027
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,250
Okay.

1028
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,450
Okay. I think with your fucking half
written email, calling me a moron,

1029
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,613
ser.

1030
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,860
Okay.

1031
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,140
They're not going after these people.

1032
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:27,460
Okay.

1033
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,300
They're not

1034
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:29,900
okay.

1035
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,440
Okay.
It's been deemed too difficult.

1036
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,200
Okay. Because what they do is be,
I already explained this shit,

1037
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,280
is how was it explained to me in layman's
term? You have a fucking company.

1038
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:44,030
Yeah.

1039
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,220
Okay. You have a bunch, a pile
of fucking money. So you crew.

1040
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,420
So you fucking either incorporate,

1041
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:50,920
okay,

1042
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,550
in a a a different country or you,
you create a,

1043
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,870
a fake,
phony fucking company in that country,

1044
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,730
which bills you're legit company a
ridiculous amount of fucking money.

1045
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,330
So then you're then able to show
that your company somehow lost money.

1046
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,790
So now you don't have to pay any taxes,

1047
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:14,140
but now your money is in this fake
company. So how do you get it right?

1048
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:17,470
You'd be having in this
foreign fucking island, right?

1049
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,140
Which is a different country.
You pay some people off there,

1050
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:21,290
so let the money go there.

1051
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,340
Then you start another company in a
different island and then they build that

1052
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:29,420
company and you just keep going hopscotch
and through the fucking Caribbean or

1053
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:32,240
wherever the fuck this shit goes down.
All right?

1054
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:38,020
And then the last company goes back
to you and gives you like 50 million,

1055
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,360
$100 million in the form of alone,

1056
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:46,160
which is untakeable and then you're
allegedly going to pay it back,

1057
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,070
which you don't.
And when you don't,

1058
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,100
that phony fucking
company forgives the loan.

1059
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:57,500
That's the base in Layman's terms.
That's the way it was explained to me.

1060
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:02,870
And the problem is, is that with each one
of those islands that it goes through,

1061
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:07,280
it's, it's a whole new fucking,
it's a different country,

1062
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:10,670
a different government, and you have
to go through a mountain of red tape.

1063
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,540
So they have seven,
10 14 of these fucking companies,

1064
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:19,060
all pink Pong and all through the
fucking islands. And it just, it just,

1065
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,070
it's too difficult.
It's too difficult.

1066
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:26,990
And then what you have is honest fucking
people who took a fucking chance.

1067
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:33,320
Okay. And risk basically sleeping
alone on a fucking futon with no wife,

1068
01:00:33,321 --> 01:00:36,320
no fucking family maxed out there.
Fucking credit cards.

1069
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:40,630
And most of those people lose.
And then you're going to come in to take,

1070
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:44,010
there's no way you can present
an argument or $70 million,

1071
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:48,770
70% paying taxes on one fucking dollar,

1072
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:53,300
70% you cannot set that fucking
precedent by the government, okay?

1073
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:56,390
Considering they are complete
corrupt pieces of shit.

1074
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,350
A standup comedian is not
a corrupt piece of shit,

1075
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:02,751
okay?

1076
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:05,780
He's not looking at the other way with
all that shit that person just said about

1077
01:01:05,781 --> 01:01:09,650
sugar. These are not separate issues.
Once you have is a broken fucking system,

1078
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,410
which is now going to take,

1079
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:16,610
put duct tape on the fucking problem
and go after innocent fucking people and

1080
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:21,230
for you to call me a moron because you
just sit there and you go, oh, these poor,

1081
01:01:21,231 --> 01:01:24,110
poor millionaires.
If somebody is fucking honest,

1082
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:27,470
they shouldn't have to fucking pay for it.
Look at the cleanse.

1083
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,840
Look at the bushes. Look at
the Obamas. Look at them.

1084
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,480
Look how fucking corrupt they are.

1085
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:39,260
The most they ever made was foreign of
fucking 500 fucking grand being president

1086
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:42,950
of the United States and they're all worth
millions and millions and millions of

1087
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:47,420
does go look. Go. Look at who they
fucking give this speech to go look.

1088
01:01:47,421 --> 01:01:50,990
Cause people who Obama's first two
fucking speeches were to like two of the

1089
01:01:50,991 --> 01:01:54,440
biggest fucking banks that
were behind the 2008 scandal

1090
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,920
and they're going up vacuuming
up all that fucking money

1091
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:08,210
is fucking Michelle Obama has the fucking
balls to put out an inspirational book

1092
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:12,860
on how to be a better fucking person and
make your dreams come true is she has

1093
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:16,790
all that corporate money fucking fallen
out from between her fucking Teddy's get

1094
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:20,490
the fuck outta here. What
I want to, I want you to,

1095
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:23,040
if you still listening what you,
I know you are.

1096
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,000
Okay.

1097
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,060
What a poor, poor millionaires. Well
why do you, why you judging somebody?

1098
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,710
Cause they fucking had the balls to put
their entire future on the fucking three

1099
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:35,130
zillion to one dog with the limp
at the back of the fucking race.

1100
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,360
And the thing came in.

1101
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,950
So now they have to give away 70%
of their money north of $10 million.

1102
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:46,550
Listen, if you're saying that
that's what the number is,

1103
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:51,170
and everybody's going to pay 70% north,
you know,

1104
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,740
north of $10 million, which
once again, I'm not making,

1105
01:02:55,910 --> 01:03:00,560
so I'm literally arguing for
fucking people that I'm not okay.

1106
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:04,520
But I plan on making more than that and
I'm in a country that allows me to do it.

1107
01:03:04,521 --> 01:03:07,620
Thank Christ.
All right?

1108
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:10,230
And I hope that you fucking do it someday.

1109
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:15,620
And it's not my fucking fault that you
don't have to fucking balls or an idea or

1110
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:19,170
the charisma or whatever the fuck
you need to get to that level.

1111
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:24,050
I haven't had it yet, but I'm not
going to just because I haven't,

1112
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,740
I'm not going to fucking punish these
other fucking people. And it's the thing,

1113
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,130
if every motherfucker in this country,

1114
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,153
okay,

1115
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:37,750
making north of $10 million
had to fucking pay that,

1116
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:42,460
then you are going somewhere.
But here's the fucking thing though.

1117
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:46,620
Here's the thing though.
Where is that money going to go?

1118
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,960
Are you going to fix where
the fuck it's going to go?

1119
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,270
Because are you going to somehow fix her
fucking foreign policy so we don't get

1120
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,020
broke fight in 3,500 jerk
offs on a fucking jungle gym.

1121
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,750
You're gonna ignore all of those fucking
problems and just take a select few

1122
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:08,530
group of fucking Americans
who did nothing wrong,

1123
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:15,250
made it in a sports, created a watch
company, created a shaving company,

1124
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,950
fucking created some something in their
standup act that fucking made enough

1125
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:25,800
Americans want to go to this
show that they're making it.

1126
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:30,530
You're going to punish them.
You're going to cosign, sign on.

1127
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:33,950
They have to give away 70%
of their fucking money. I
just can't get behind that.

1128
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,303
Yeah.

1129
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:40,520
When all of these politicians blowing
these fucking people who aren't paying

1130
01:04:40,521 --> 01:04:41,660
fucking taxes

1131
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:48,080
and then they're going to come out the
other side and then go give speeches to

1132
01:04:48,081 --> 01:04:52,100
people who don't pay fucking taxes and
companies that don't pay fucking taxes

1133
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,640
and take that money and stick it in their
fucking pocket and go buy themselves a

1134
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,970
big mansion on fucking mouth has
been good. That's all fucking fine.

1135
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,000
Unfucking believable and it sit
there and say that separate issues,

1136
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:07,330
that's all tax issues.
That's all the same fucking issue

1137
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,620
anyways.
Um,

1138
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,330
you said it isn't fair that people being
honest with their income have to pay

1139
01:05:16,331 --> 01:05:19,650
this rate while rich people
hide their income overseas.

1140
01:05:19,651 --> 01:05:23,130
You also said tax money is being
wasted on corporate corporate bullshit.

1141
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,720
I agree with Paul. Ira. Read this,

1142
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,720
this half a fucking paragraph
that this person wrote.

1143
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:32,290
You said we should pay
politicians. Fuck you money. Uh,

1144
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,930
you don't think if that happens,

1145
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,340
even every money grubbing corrupt con
will do anything possible to run for

1146
01:05:38,341 --> 01:05:40,230
office and win an election,

1147
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:44,880
including promising corporation special
deals in exchange for campaigns.

1148
01:05:44,881 --> 01:05:49,800
So I do believe that. I do believe that
you've been saying this for years. Yes,

1149
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:50,700
I believe that.

1150
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:52,710
Yeah.

1151
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:56,050
I can't believe nobody's called you
out on how fucking stupid it is. Dude.

1152
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:01,080
What's you're doing is you're basically
going to be like this. Well listen,

1153
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,520
we can't get these guys,

1154
01:06:02,521 --> 01:06:07,521
so let's get the people we can get
who haven't poisoned the food supply,

1155
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,980
who don't, who don't dictate
our foreign policy. Yeah.

1156
01:06:10,981 --> 01:06:12,720
Fuck all of that shit.

1157
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:17,190
Fuck the $20 trillion sitting
in the islands in the Caymans.

1158
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:22,380
Let's go after the third basement on the
New York Yankees. Yeah. Fuck this guy.

1159
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,250
This doesn't make any
sense, dude. What could,

1160
01:06:26,251 --> 01:06:30,900
you can put a name and a face on that
fucking guy and because he was better in

1161
01:06:30,901 --> 01:06:31,950
gym class than you,

1162
01:06:31,951 --> 01:06:36,480
you have this underlying resentment that
you call them a poor, poor millionaire.

1163
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:37,861
Anyways,
he goes,

1164
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:42,861
I think the biggest issue is that you
come from comedy and you can't see beyond

1165
01:06:42,871 --> 01:06:46,380
that business. I, I seem to be talking
about a bunch of business here is don't I?

1166
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:49,470
I'm talking about our foreign policy.
I'm talking about the food supply.

1167
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,710
Oh, we, how much further do I have to go?

1168
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,840
I think everyone in this country should
be in the position where their success

1169
01:06:58,841 --> 01:07:03,460
is measured by how hard they work
and how much they contribute.

1170
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:09,520
That is mostly true in
comedy. Dude. First of all,

1171
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:12,390
I'll throw you a hypocritical
bolt. I'm gonna. I'll, I'll,

1172
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,890
what the fuck do you know about comedy?

1173
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:22,300
Right. I know as much about comedy. Is it?

1174
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,050
I mean I know as much about your
job as you know about comedy,

1175
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:28,440
so why is your opinion
on Comedians more valid?

1176
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:29,830
Yeah.

1177
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:34,600
Anyways, if you are a millionaire
and your daddy was a famous comedian,

1178
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:38,560
notice how they use the word Daddy,
right?

1179
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:42,970
That will only take you so far
in comedy if you're not funny.

1180
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:50,320
This is not true in every single business.
For example,

1181
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:54,550
if Donald Trump had just invested his
father's money in the stock market,

1182
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,760
he would be Richard than he is now.

1183
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,700
What the fuck is that based on?

1184
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,740
Like what is the stock market
guaranteed you're going to make money.

1185
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:11,730
The stock market is corrupt,
but he is a very successful,

1186
01:08:11,731 --> 01:08:14,820
hardworking man deserving
of all our empathy.

1187
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,080
Just like every other rich asshole.

1188
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,200
Okay?

1189
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,000
Yeah. Dude, you know what
you have a problem with?

1190
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:24,930
You have a problem with anybody
who's rich cause you're all,

1191
01:08:24,931 --> 01:08:29,220
you're putting all of them. You
using all the buzzwords. Daddy rich,

1192
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:33,090
asshole, poor, poor millionaire. Anyways,

1193
01:08:33,091 --> 01:08:37,800
I graduated from Harvard in 2015
I'm a public school teacher.

1194
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,810
One of the people you say tax
money should be going towards. Yes,

1195
01:08:42,811 --> 01:08:44,970
tax money that was already collected,
sir,

1196
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,280
that was wasted on a
neverending fucking war. Yes.

1197
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:51,780
Okay.

1198
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:54,270
Yes. But let's not go after
the people that wasted that.

1199
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,680
Let's take more tax dollars from
somebody who fucking plays fucking power

1200
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:02,820
forward for the fucking
Cleveland Cavaliers anyways,

1201
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:06,960
unlike my classmates making millions,
no matter how hard I work,

1202
01:09:06,961 --> 01:09:09,240
no matter how much time
I spend on my students,

1203
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:14,190
I don't earn another sent
over my $48,000 salary.

1204
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:20,160
Okay, and did you not know that
going into that fucking business,

1205
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:25,330
Mike, what do you, what
do you want me to do here?

1206
01:09:25,331 --> 01:09:28,930
I don't think you should earn that. I
think you should earn way more than that,

1207
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,950
but I don't think that regular fucking
people who don't stick their money in the

1208
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:37,951
Cayman fucking islands are now required
to pay for you because all these other

1209
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,240
Americans are paying no taxes.

1210
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,730
I, I don't, I don't feel that that's
where that money should come from.

1211
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,700
I feel that you should make
way more money than that.

1212
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:50,590
Okay.

1213
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:55,590
I think that you do one of the most
important jobs in this country and I think

1214
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:59,050
you should get, you should
get paid, I don't know,

1215
01:09:59,051 --> 01:10:01,150
200 fucking grand a year to do it.

1216
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:02,870
Okay.

1217
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,830
And I think you should have all the
supplies that you fucking need. I 100.

1218
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:09,080
I just don't agree with where
you want to get that money.

1219
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:15,820
He goes, I can earn less than a
thousand dollars in the next year.

1220
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,510
I can't believe you're a fucking
teacher by the way, by the way,

1221
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:21,860
you read the wrote this fucking thing,
but I'm going to,

1222
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:24,820
I'm going to give you the benefit of
the doubt and say that you were fucking

1223
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:29,020
pissed off and fucking fired this thing
off. Or this is a giant voice text.

1224
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,880
Um, like an earn less than
a thousand in the next year.

1225
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:39,120
Pay Increase based on how my students
do on statewide standardized text tests.

1226
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:43,600
In fact, if I want to spend
money on class material,

1227
01:10:43,601 --> 01:10:45,070
it comes out of my own pocket,

1228
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:50,530
can deduct a maximum of $250 a year.
Meanwhile, some of the richest continents,

1229
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,790
country are using their money to try
and make public schools worse. Yeah,

1230
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:55,990
I got to tell you something,
dude.

1231
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,130
These aren't the guys you're going to
get what that 70% tax thing and here's

1232
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:00,964
another thing,
dude,

1233
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:06,030
rather than call me a fucking dumb ass
and a monkey hitting a fucking keyboard,

1234
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:10,240
you know an idea that I had was

1235
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,240
I would like to to as a comedian to do,

1236
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:20,270
there's public schools in my fucking
neighborhood here and I was walking by one

1237
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:25,020
the other day and I saw an auditorium
and I'm thinking, wait a minute,

1238
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:28,020
they have an auditorium, they
got seats, they got his stage.

1239
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:33,240
Why don't I do a fucking
fundraiser for the public school?

1240
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:38,970
That was my thought and I know I'm a
mouth breather and fucking moron, dude,

1241
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:42,600
you and I are on the same fucking team
here and we should not be fighting with

1242
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:42,961
each other.

1243
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:47,961
We should be joining forces and demanding
that these corrupt politicians go

1244
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:49,200
after all the,

1245
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:54,201
all these fucking asshole corporations
and individuals who pay no taxes

1246
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,150
rather than fucking as we're both like
fucking trying to scamper out of the

1247
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:04,050
boiling water poet, pulling each
other down by each other's ankles.

1248
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,680
All right,
but here's the funny fucking thing.

1249
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:12,090
It's the second I thought
about doing that show.

1250
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:17,120
All I thought was of the hashtags by
the fucking parents and all of these

1251
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:22,800
fucking lunatics whose minds have
been poisoned by social media and all,

1252
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:26,160
it's going to take his fucking
one of them to go out there.

1253
01:12:26,161 --> 01:12:30,330
I can't do my fucking act in a public
school auditorium in front of the fucking

1254
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:33,720
parents.
How the fuck do I do that?

1255
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:38,010
I know how I do it.

1256
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:41,610
What I do is I get those cell phone bags
and everybody has to put their fucking

1257
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:44,430
cell phones in the fucking
bag before you go in there.

1258
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,530
That's how I'm going to
have to end up doing it.

1259
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,910
And unfortunately that's some of the
money that I could've given that it could

1260
01:12:49,911 --> 01:12:54,150
have given back to the public schools.
So here's the thing. All right, sir,

1261
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,340
and I know you're not listening anymore.

1262
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:01,740
I'm going to start doing those fucking
shows. I'm going to start doing shows.

1263
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,510
I'm going to pick a fucking school and
I'm going to give back that way, that way.

1264
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:08,460
I would rather do it that way.

1265
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,260
Then eventually having to pay 60% fucking
taxes on my income because I'm already

1266
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:18,030
paying 56. That's just on my
income. That's not property tax.

1267
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:20,940
That's not fucking uh, um, sales tax,

1268
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,120
tax on gas is all these fucking
hidden taxes. Then I'm already pain.

1269
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,890
I'm lucky at this point,
if I'm keeping 30% of my fucking money,

1270
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:34,150
I would cringe to see what
the fuck I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

1271
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:39,151
I'm paying and fucking taxes and I know
you have no sympathy for me cause I had

1272
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:44,481
the audacity to half my fucking 300 to
one fucking greyhound come across the

1273
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:49,680
finish line and I won and that
you fucking resent me for that,

1274
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:54,960
you know, and you let me in to people
and I'm not even at that fucking level.

1275
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:57,511
All right?

1276
01:13:57,511 --> 01:14:01,170
But I've been around the block enough
times to know to know that if that's 70%

1277
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:02,550
thing gets fucking past dude,

1278
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:05,640
they're not going to stop at 10
and they're gonna keep going down.

1279
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,500
So what I got out of this is,
you know something,

1280
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:11,610
I'm going to do one of
those fucking shows, um,

1281
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,330
at the public schools and I'm,

1282
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:15,790
I'm going to start doing those
fucking things and I'm going to get,

1283
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:19,000
and I might get those fucking cell
phone bags and I'll stick them in there.

1284
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,520
And that's the way that I'm
going to fucking give back.
And I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

1285
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:25,570
I'm gonna get a positive out of this.
All right?

1286
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:28,240
And I think what regular
Americans need to do,

1287
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,390
which is what I still am,

1288
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:34,600
and you can fucking demonize me all you
want because I'm the finally fucking

1289
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:39,490
making money. 27 years into
this fucking shit. All right?

1290
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:42,070
Where the fuck will you, when I was
sitting on the Futon, waking up,

1291
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:46,690
having panic attacks when I had
no manager, no fucking agent,

1292
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,270
and all agents were telling
me I had a weird look.

1293
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:52,900
That's what he used to say to me.
By the way,

1294
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:57,220
there is an unwritten rule in this fucking
business that if you are a redhead,

1295
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:02,410
you are not the lead in a movie. Um,
I dunno if that's gradually changing,

1296
01:15:02,411 --> 01:15:05,960
but I remember I used to go to fucking
auditions and like they would be prepared

1297
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,810
three seats. It was back when
I had a black and white photos.

1298
01:15:08,811 --> 01:15:11,680
So I kind of looked like I had brown hair.
It was the 90. They had moose in there.

1299
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:14,830
Oh, right. And I would come
in and as they looked at me,

1300
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:17,200
I would see the look on their
face. They'd be like, okay,

1301
01:15:17,201 --> 01:15:20,320
we're just going to read the first
scene. Yeah. It's like, dude,

1302
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:23,800
you're redheaded male. You're
not the lead. You're the
friend. You're the friend.

1303
01:15:23,801 --> 01:15:27,310
You're the one who doesn't get the
girl and all of that fucking shit. Um,

1304
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:32,620
so anyways, we should be helping
each other out, sir. Okay.

1305
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:36,430
And is the thing, if I became a
comedian and I didn't make it,

1306
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:40,000
I wouldn't be crying to you about it.
Okay.

1307
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:43,780
So you were the one who went to fucking
Harvard and decided to become a public

1308
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:46,750
school fucking teacher.
You knew what the deal was.

1309
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:50,800
Okay.
That's what the fuck you wanted to do.

1310
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,750
And I'm going to believe you that you
went to Harvard and that you are a public

1311
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:59,050
school teacher. Cause you know on the
Internet people can be like, I fucking,

1312
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:03,070
I hate Trump and I'm a republican.
People can do that all the fucking time.

1313
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:07,390
I'm going to take all its face value and
that you're actually a teacher and that

1314
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:12,130
you wrote an email that was filled at
this many spelling mistakes. Um, this,

1315
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:17,131
this much fucking hypocritical behavior
where you're yelling at me that I can't

1316
01:16:17,471 --> 01:16:18,910
see past the end of my own nose.

1317
01:16:18,911 --> 01:16:23,260
And the whole fucking thing was about
you and your job and where the fuck you

1318
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:27,220
sit in the world. I didn't really see, I
didn't really see how you were. You were,

1319
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:31,330
um, stepping outside of yourself.
Um, so here's the thing, sir.

1320
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:35,560
Or Ma'am who have a fucking wrote this
thing. I'm going to start doing that.

1321
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:38,890
All right?
I'm going to start doing fucking shows,

1322
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:44,170
raising money for suffer
some fucking public,

1323
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,880
uh,
and our high schools or whatever,

1324
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:49,160
get them some money for some computers
or whatever. And actually you,

1325
01:16:49,161 --> 01:16:53,200
no way I'd be helping myself because I
get a kid now and all the public schools

1326
01:16:53,201 --> 01:16:56,050
suck out here. So now you've got to go
to private schools from the beginning,

1327
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:57,430
you know,

1328
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:02,430
and you're like hundreds of thousands of
dollars down the fucking drain because

1329
01:17:04,361 --> 01:17:04,961
once again,

1330
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:08,520
people who didn't pay taxes and all
the money that all the money that we've

1331
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:12,440
already, all the money that they already
fucking collect does not go with a fuck.

1332
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,680
It should be. Um, so I
appreciate your input.

1333
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,090
I hope you're mature enough to see,
you know,

1334
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:23,170
I hope you don't decide not to keep
listening to this podcast because of

1335
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:24,380
something else.

1336
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:29,120
Cause it sucks because it's not funny
because it got boring to you after awhile.

1337
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,050
But if this is the reason why that
you're not listening, you're, you're,

1338
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,410
you're a fucking baby.

1339
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:37,730
You're a big fucking baby and you're
really not solving the fucking problem.

1340
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:39,253
Um,

1341
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:43,980
and I think it's really ignorant to,

1342
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:47,810
to demonize people that,
that made it on their own,

1343
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:52,820
made it in a sport, started
a company, you know,

1344
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:54,680
but I draw the line at,
you know,

1345
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:59,090
if you made it in a sport and you don't
pay taxes or you started a company and

1346
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,910
now with that, your next move is to
get your money outside the company.

1347
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:04,940
I don't support that. And if you're
a comedian, you need to do that.

1348
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:09,830
I don't support that. I don't, I
love Willie Nelson not paying taxes.

1349
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:14,450
Don't support that. Okay. And I have
no problem paying my fair share.

1350
01:18:14,451 --> 01:18:19,160
And I think at 56% plus all the others,
I think I'm more than doing it.

1351
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,570
Unfortunately.

1352
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,590
My tax money that I'm paying is
getting nowhere near your school.

1353
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,770
And that is not my fault,
but that is the problem.

1354
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:32,150
And those are not separate issues from
where I'm from. All right, that's the,

1355
01:18:32,151 --> 01:18:36,520
that's the podcast. Go fuck
yourselves. And I'm going to,

1356
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,910
you know, I'm going to
make, do on my, my, my, uh,

1357
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,600
campaign promise. I'm going to find a
fucking school and I'm going to do it.

1358
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:48,590
All right. That's it. Go fuck
yourselves and I'll see you on Thursday.
