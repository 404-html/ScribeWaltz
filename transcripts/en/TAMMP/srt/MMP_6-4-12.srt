1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,180
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:06,630
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,260
June 4th,
2012 2012 how are you?

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:15,870
How's it going? I know, I know. It's
a little late. It's a little late,

5
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:16,704
but you know,

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,170
can't you just go twiddle your thumbs
and do something else for a minute?

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,250
You know, set a going on my Twitter
and breaking my balls. I know what,

8
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:29,850
just take a pill. You don't really
don't have a fucking day job.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,680
So there's really no excuse for
you having this podcast late.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,810
Once again.
Well listen,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,260
if you notice like axl rose,

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,620
I am also a balding
redheaded performer and

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,293
yeah,

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,680
now we're notorious for starting shows
late for sitting in our trailers,

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,150
you know, making sure our
kilts fit correctly. Um,

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,650
that's when you knew that band was just
fucking really was just going over the

17
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:05,850
top and there was nobody saying no in
their camp when he came out. You know,

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,560
when the war, the kilt is, it's
what woody you doing. All right.

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,570
You're not Scottish. I'm sure you have
some sort of Scottish heritage, you,

20
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,600
ginger bested in your blood.
But you know,

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,540
you from fucking Rhode Island
or where they like Indianapolis.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,050
Well that was he from Illinois.
What? You're in America,

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,100
it's not a kilt. Let's it's Saint
Patrick's Day, Saint Patrick's Day.

24
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:32,070
I'll look the other way. Other than
that, you were at a fucking dress.

25
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,800
You know who stole it?
Years later,

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Kurt Cobain came out wearing a summer
dress cause he was sad and he thought

27
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:44,220
maybe if he felt a little
pretty that you know, uh,

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,020
Jesus fill you really going to say,
well fuck it.

29
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,410
I'll say maybe he wouldn't stick a
fucking gun in his mouth. You know,

30
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:53,910
when the fuck do you get off
making fun of the, Oh fuck you. Um,

31
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,850
believe it or not, I'm
actually in a great mood. Um,

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,370
the rest of the reason why I was late
today, this is my ex, this is my,

33
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:04,240
the dog ate my homework. Excuse
was a, I finally went out, uh,

34
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,700
riding a motorcycle today. That's
what I did. I had a manly morning.

35
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,970
What did you do? Huh? You sit down
and eat some fucking lucky charms. Hi,

36
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:18,450
you pansy. You sit in there smelling
like gas. I don't think you are,

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,500
is there any worse than when somebody
just picks up a new hobby and then they go

38
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:25,410
out and they just buy all the gear and
then they start walking around like the

39
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,850
fucking Clint Eastwood?
Well, lucky for you guys.

40
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm not one of those guys.

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,650
And the only reason why I'm not
is because I'm an old bastard now.

42
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,510
And one of the great things about being
in an old bastard about being an old

43
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:39,931
bastard,

44
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:44,700
one of the great things aside from
having an enlarged prostate is,

45
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,090
is you know your limits.
You've gotten fucked up.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,780
Somebody kicked you in the head by now.
You fell down a flight of stairs.

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,700
You fucked up some relationships.

48
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,780
You know people you know have
gotten fucked to you. You realize,

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,860
you realize there's not some dude in
the air that gives a shit about you.

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,930
You know that you have some sort of
guardian angel just looking out for you.

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,820
Now, if you're a fucking idiot,
eventually you're gonna get fucked up.

52
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,920
Why is that true though? There's a
couple of golden childs out there. No,

53
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,990
it doesn't. Everybody just know that
guy that you've just been predicting.

54
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,150
You know, a guy's going to
get his fucking ass kicked.

55
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,720
I'm telling it's going to
happen. Remember, remember,
remember this conversation?

56
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:30,550
Remember I said it? Okay, well fucking
guy, he doesn't show any respect.

57
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,010
He's always running his fucking Yap.
I tell you,

58
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:36,100
I would've done it if I didn't
have so much to loose, you know,

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,780
I would have kicked his fucking ass
if a x, Y and Z in this scenario.

60
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,600
My wife wasn't yelling at me,
you know,

61
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,840
and he just keep predicting that this
guy is going to get his ass kicked.

62
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:51,340
And you know, there's always that guy
where it just never happens. And uh,

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,010
once they hit 40 and if you've met,
he never got your ass kicked by 40.

64
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:57,210
I,

65
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,750
it's pretty much not going to happen
unless there's some sort of home invasion,

66
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,470
you know,
I would think,

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,060
or unless for some reason you'd
take up drugs late in your life,

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,180
right? You end up eating
somebody who's fucking face

69
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,400
and growing at the cops.
It's just, you know,

70
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:22,080
isn't it unbelievable that I refuse
to watch that video? And if you, I,

71
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:26,860
if you watched that video like before,
if you haven't watched it yet, you know,

72
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,820
just
those videos,

73
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:35,110
that's like getting just deliberately
putting a virus on your computer.

74
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,290
You don't want that shit in your own
personal hard drive. You don't want that.

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,740
You don't want that roll around in your
head. You don't want to see that shit.

76
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,350
You have a fucking meat.
Like you know,

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,920
veterans who've really seen some shit
be it military or cops or whatever,

78
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,430
prison guards,
they got that look on their face.

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,100
They just seen too much shit.

80
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:59,560
Christmas music starts fading
away in the background.

81
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:03,700
He just see why would you deliberately
do that to yourself? All right,

82
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,920
it already sounded horrific enough.

83
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,280
It's already making my stomach
turn. I mean, that's just

84
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,440
what kind of world we live in.
Whether could something like that app,

85
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,230
that's the new drug. I mean,
on one hand you got to hang it,

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,220
hand it to the youngsters,
you know, every time you know,

87
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,650
you think your generation
has taken it to the limit,

88
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,860
the next generation somehow
figures out a way to top you.

89
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,690
It's one of the great
things about human beings.

90
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:32,020
That's why cars keep getting better,
right?

91
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,340
People figure out how to make a sandwich
a little more tasty, or it just,

92
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:40,840
you just keep improving. And uh,
but that also goes with evil shit.

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,080
And I always thought,
you know,

94
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,980
the crack eighties when I saw crack
babies, I was like, that's it.

95
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,420
I don't know how you top that.
You know,

96
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:54,070
some little shiver and fucking Guinea pig
of a kid. Never had a god damn chance.

97
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:57,710
Comes out addicted to crack.
How do you beat that? You know?

98
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,260
And then along came meth heads,
right?

99
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,170
That's always the beginning
of some spinoff Sitcom, right?

100
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,800
Like meth heads was the flow
from Alice to crack babies.

101
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,660
If you were making a sitcom about drug
use, you know, male kiss my grits.

102
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,790
That was fucking methods. Just
go with me on this. There'll be,

103
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,720
what else are you going to do?
He go to work.

104
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,650
Sit in your cubicle and
actually get something done
and aren't a fucking living.

105
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,930
That's right. Wrinkly. Your fucking knows
it. Me and my podcast. What are you doing?

106
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,383
Huh?

107
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,910
Eating those yellow Oreo cookies you got
down from the vending machine at those

108
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:39,080
tasty. They are, aren't they? Now
your blood sugar's starting to crash.

109
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,413
Look at you.

110
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,120
Big stupid head on your head and acting
like you're trying to figure something

111
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,670
out on your computer.
You're not, you know,

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,700
maybe you're in an airport and you just
finished off some fucking horrible food

113
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,110
right now you're going to go waddle
your ass onto a God damn airplane. Um,

114
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,030
that was, it has to do with anything from
oil. So anyways, then you had meth heads

115
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,230
who I thought were basically
real life zombies as far as,

116
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,650
as far as you could take it. And then
along comes this guy along came Polly,

117
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,120
right?
Just like the movie,

118
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,150
except Phillip Seymour Hoffman
is eaten somebodies face.

119
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,940
How great is that fucking
basketball scene by the way?

120
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,890
Ray Dad's old,
old schools the best.

121
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,170
Um,
eating somebody God damn face.

122
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,110
I refuse to believe that that's
the drug's fault. I think you, you,

123
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:40,000
you gotta be like already a maniac
and then you do some new psycho drug.

124
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,150
But who knows? Maybe that's the new thing.
Maybe that's what the kids are doing.

125
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,153
Ugh.

126
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,270
And then the guy fucking survives and
now you're in the hospital. I mean,

127
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,141
I would just be like,
dude,

128
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:54,920
kill me if I was laying in a hospital
bed and then they're acting like they're

129
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:58,460
going to somehow a fucking do a face
transplant on me. Like from what

130
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,840
bill? I think you Harrison there. Listen,

131
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,420
we have your stabilized,
we've got new.

132
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,330
I would immediately just,

133
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,870
I would be just start feeling around
my hospital table for a pen and I would

134
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:19,170
just be like, shoot me. Actually,
you know what? I wouldn't,

135
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,860
I wouldn't because then
they would be like, well,

136
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:24,930
we have to prevent him from doing what
he wants to do to himself right now.

137
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,680
And uh, so I actually, I wouldn't
say that I would just write oh great.

138
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,770
On a post it and then stick
it to my nonexistent forehead

139
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,530
and I just keep pointing to it every time
they talked to me. And then the second,

140
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,240
yeah, I felt like I was
alone. I would, I do it.

141
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,121
Oh,
that'd be great.

142
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:51,320
Just rule right out the fucking hospital
window with your ass hanging out of the

143
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:54,740
bag of that robe. I'm sorry. I feel
bad for that guy and everything. I'm,

144
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,130
I'm not fun of that guy.
But

145
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,910
like I don't have the internal strength
like you ever see that shit like when uh,

146
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,180
like Christopher Reeve

147
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,210
gets thrown off a horse,
hits the ground like a fucking lawn,

148
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:12,040
darts snaps his neck and then the next
Oscar she's willing himself out with is

149
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:16,750
like tongue smiling at the crowd.
Like I feel fortunate to be alive.

150
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:21,490
I feel lucky. There's no fucking way. If
I'm ever presented with that challenge,

151
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,630
we're going to handle that even remotely,

152
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,590
dignified way. There's no
fucking way I'm Gunna, I,

153
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,160
I'm not as strong as those people.
I'll just be, I will just be, you know,

154
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:34,890
like I said,
sounds great.

155
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,220
Was going to be right on my fucking
forehead and I'm going to steer my chair

156
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:41,130
right down a flight of stairs
and that's it. It's over.

157
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm willing to roll with it.

158
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,113
Dice,

159
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,940
you know about what happens
after you after here personally,

160
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,990
you know,
he's fucking people who,

161
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:55,991
who go through shit like that and then
are able to continue on with their lives

162
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:57,820
and they give you see these fucking
people, they're like, you know,

163
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:02,320
writing a fucking novel with
their left foot. You know,

164
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,460
I'm sitting, I've girls like take out
the recycling. I'm like, AH, fuck.

165
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:09,880
I mean I just, you know,
if there is a higher power,

166
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:14,500
I think he knows who to fucking challenge.
He's taking a look at me again.

167
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:17,770
Oh Geez, you should, we'll let
that one go. It's fucking asshole.

168
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:19,210
Can't even make the goddamn bed.

169
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,370
I'm going to send him flying off a
fucking horse. He gets serious. Um,

170
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,340
so anyways, let's get on with my
day here. I had a phenomenal day.

171
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:33,340
I went a dirt bike riding this
morning for the first time ever.

172
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,420
Never rode a motorcycle.
Um, and I got a minute.

173
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:38,350
I did all right for now.

174
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,290
I was driving around for like an
hour and then next thing you know,

175
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:45,580
they talked me into going out on the track
where they had jumps and shit. And, uh,

176
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,550
but it wasn't like, you know,
they were fucking steep for me,

177
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:52,030
but they had like the plateaus he could
ride ride over on like a little bitch,

178
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,923
which,
uh,

179
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,040
is exactly what I did and it's why I
didn't get hurt a couple times. So,

180
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,900
you know, I got into like second
gear and I kind of was like, whoa.

181
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:04,450
When there was like a fucking fence with
a telephone pole and I was like, yeah,

182
00:11:04,451 --> 00:11:05,620
you know what?
I don't want to be doing that.

183
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,780
I don't want to be fucking laying there,
you know,

184
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,580
with my rib cage slammed
into all my vitals. I don't
feel like doing that. So I,

185
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,120
you know, I kept it slow. Then
I got on the track and uh,

186
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,970
it was hilarious. I thought it was
flying when I was on the track,

187
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:22,870
but someone was taking video of it,
which I will give you. I will, uh,

188
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,930
put up on the podcast
page hopefully if, if, uh,

189
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,420
it's sent to me by the time I post this,

190
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,360
I'll definitely at least have some photos,
but I thought I was flying right. Like,

191
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,760
Hey Dad,
dad that was flying.

192
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,410
I watched the video, it
looked like may, may,

193
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:42,060
maybe it looked like I was riding like
a fucking moped, but, um, anyways,

194
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:46,410
I drove around for like two hours,
got it down pretty God damn good.

195
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:50,250
And I only ate shit once I was on
the track and every, I don't know,

196
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,260
even know what happened. I was
like, I was off and then I wasn't,

197
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,980
it was like a goddess.
It's going good man. I'm

198
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,730
going to kick up some dirt and that
was, it. Landed on my shoulder,

199
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,020
jacked up my thumb a little bit. And you
know what I did? The old man in me said,

200
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,670
you know what bill? You know what I
think, I think that's good for a day.

201
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,510
I think that's good. I rode right off the
track. I went around at one more time,

202
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,600
you know, just so I'm not like
afraid of it. And then I, uh,

203
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:18,040
I just went over and I pulled up to
the truck and I got some water that an

204
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,980
instructor dude came up day, you want to
ride around? And again, I was like, Nah,

205
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:24,340
you know what I think of
good one face plant is good.

206
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,300
I've got a podcast I have to do.
I got the gist of this shit.

207
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:32,590
I'll definitely be coming back. It's a
great time, man. It was such a good time.

208
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,610
I uh, took my truck out there
and met the, a buddy of mine,

209
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:40,690
he had the body who was getting a
couple of bikes just uh, just a,

210
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,780
an adventure today, you
know, we got off at the exit,

211
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,700
there was these two
dogs that look healthy.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,440
They just running down the
fucking highway, tongues
hanging out like, you know,

213
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,030
big spoon tongs. And we were
uh, pulled over, picked him up,

214
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,740
gave him some water, uh, parked in
the shade, let them hang out there.

215
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,140
Fucking awesome dogs.
They were filthy,

216
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,460
but they were well fed
and they had collars.

217
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,800
So we, um, it was hilarious. Like
right next to the track was this guy,

218
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,920
he had like a fucking,
uh,

219
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,040
just was living in like a double wide,

220
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,550
like motorcross she there for two
seconds and you just feel it. It is,

221
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,580
it is a white trash sport.
That's why I loved it. You know,

222
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,230
my fucking inner redneck, you know, I
mean you could just feel it, you know,

223
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,550
gas gears, meth, the whole fucking
thing was right there, you know,

224
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,950
mullets
you know,

225
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,810
everybody this sucked at math,

226
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,740
but they can convert a lawnmower into
like a fucking Ferrari if they had to,

227
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,620
you know, or at least a
Mustang, a that whole vibe.

228
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:50,950
So right next to the track was,
um,

229
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,150
this guy had like a double wide,
he had like fucking 20 dogs.

230
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,460
So the dude who picked up the dogs,
it's going,

231
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,400
let's just drop them cause we yelling
in, the guy didn't come. I'm like,

232
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,270
let's just drop him over
the fence. And I, you know,

233
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:05,740
I watched that dog whisperers shit.

234
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:09,010
And I see like when a dog comes up to the
pack and everybody starts freaking out

235
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,250
and I'm like, I dunno
about this guys. I Dunno.

236
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,500
So we lift the dogs up and
the pack media says like,

237
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,480
Oh fuck is, look, I not a
good idea that it got it.

238
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,430
We're almost through
these dogs to their death.

239
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,740
So we ended up putting
them back in the truck.

240
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:26,320
I know there's a couple of people who
know a lot of stuff about dogs right now.

241
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:28,990
Don't worry. It has a happy ending.
Okay? So you can relax. All right.

242
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,090
Get off the edge of your staples seat.
Uh,

243
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,970
your Ikea Chair. Um, this has a good
ending. So we ended up going to the track.

244
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,850
We parked in the shade and the
dog's immediately just, you know,

245
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:43,460
passed out there was so exhausted,
pour things and um,

246
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,020
they were friendly as hell.
So when we were done,

247
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,380
we ended up just looking up,
uh,

248
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,130
the humane society and they had a drop
off and we went over there and we came

249
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:58,700
walking in with them, didn't have leashes
where like carrying him in and shit.

250
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,930
And, uh, we come walking in like, hey, how
you doin? My whole head is like, please,

251
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,120
you're not going to kill these
dogs in like 20 minutes. Right?

252
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,130
So we brought him in a second.
We came walking in and they were like,

253
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:11,690
Jesus Christ, those dogs it back again.
Uh, we know those dogs and you know,

254
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:15,470
they had, they were microchipped
scanned them and shit and uh,

255
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,890
which was unsettling because one
of my buddies is going like, oh,

256
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,710
these things are micro
checked, chipped, you know.

257
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,020
Then the conspiracy theorist in
me is just like, yeah, we're next.

258
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,710
It's what they're going to do.
A,

259
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,870
they bring us into after we escape a
FEMA camp on your papers for the ease and

260
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:33,050
they get a fucking Tapley you scan you
and send you right back to your camp and

261
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:37,940
Fresno. Um, but let's get back to the
happy ending. So they knew the dogs,

262
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:40,030
they scanned them,
they called the owner and then the,

263
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,670
they ended up coming down and get the
dog. So we did a good day. All right.

264
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:48,020
That's why the podcast is late because
I was acting like a fucking eight year

265
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,870
old,
but we rescued dogs along the way.

266
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,010
Isn't that a nice story?
I got to tell you something.

267
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,960
If you've never gone dirt bike
ride and you've got to do it.

268
00:15:56,961 --> 00:16:01,550
And I can't imagine when I saw some of
the kids down there getting a ride those

269
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:05,360
bikes,
like how fucking incredible that must be.

270
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,660
You know,
cause I remember you were a kid,

271
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:10,340
you just sit in there
and riding in the back,

272
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:13,490
you're always the passenger and then
all of a sudden one day you turned 15,

273
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,370
15 and a half, he gets your permit next.
Neil, you're driving down the street.

274
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,380
It's the greatest fucking feeling
ever to feel that at eight to go from

275
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,214
literally like

276
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,640
to like fucking a half hour later.
But

277
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,720
flying around the track,

278
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,010
it's just incredible to me. Um, but
anyways, it was an awesome time.

279
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,320
And uh,
I dunno,

280
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,920
but I don't know if I have time for
another hobby and I got to tell you like,

281
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:47,330
um, you know, it was fun
but it's fucking scary.

282
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,770
I didn't know I was doing at one point,

283
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:52,760
like I let out the clutch and I just
started flying them in the parking lot.

284
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,970
It's all dirt and I'm heading
towards these trees and these cars.

285
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,420
And fortunately I remain
calm and I had to, like,

286
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,420
I had to like think, what do you do? A
push in the clutch and here's the break.

287
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:10,130
Okay. And it's the exact opposite where,
you know, I'm used to driving my truck,

288
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:13,580
I push in the clutch with my foot breaks,
obviously what the foot,

289
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:16,580
and now it's the opposite
unless she used the back brake,

290
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:18,200
which is on the right side
of the whole fucking thing.

291
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,280
But I was able to remain calm
and it was hilarious.

292
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,480
I stopped and when I turned around,

293
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,140
I saw everybody in the parking lot was
laughing and I was just sitting there

294
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:31,360
like, dude, I am just a fucking
youtube video waiting to Ha I this,

295
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,420
I should have had epic fail,
uh,

296
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,000
written across my shoulders.
It was,

297
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,380
it was a little sketchy in the beginning,
but I just kept, you know, you know,

298
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,050
I watched a couple of youtube videos on
how to ride a motorcycle and they were

299
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:50,490
just like, look, just keep, you know,
he'd in first gear, let out the clutch,

300
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:52,380
get going a little bit and
then learn how to stop.

301
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,030
And they just keep doing
that over and over again.

302
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,010
So I just kept doing
that over and over again.

303
00:17:56,011 --> 00:18:01,011
So once you can slow the
fucker down your right and uh,

304
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,980
I would say I got it into second gear
a couple of times, but like I said,

305
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,980
I wasn't, uh, you know,

306
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,540
I wasn't trying to break my collarbone
or even worse fucking via lawn dart right

307
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,580
into the, I'm just not,
I'm not, I'm too old.

308
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,180
I can't make a comeback from that shit,
you know, you know, kids are all positive.

309
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,150
They like fall out of a skyscraper
and like, yeah, I'm good. You know,

310
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,280
put on some cartoons and they're like
up and walking in like a week like that,

311
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,870
that would have broke me as a human being.

312
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,580
I'm not, I'm just a shit talk and asshole.
But when it comes to stuff like that,

313
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:39,640
like I'm not a, I know my
limits, I fucking know him.

314
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:43,150
There's a couple of times I got it up in
second gear and that fucking voice that

315
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,940
you ignore when you're a youngster,

316
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,600
that voice that's going, dude,
what the fuck are you doing?

317
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,470
And just plays out the scenario,
you know,

318
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:56,740
of laying in the back of the ambulance
and that guy flashing the pen light in

319
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:57,430
your eyes.

320
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,430
Just playing out that scenario and all
the canceled gigs I would have and a in

321
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:06,730
every time, you know, and fucking
it's below 30 degrees out.

322
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:10,250
My fucking liver hurts.
Like I just played all of that.

323
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,080
Every time I thought of that, I
just kept slowing down. So, but uh,

324
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:17,850
it was fucking awesome man.
And uh, and that's it. They go,

325
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,840
there's my dirt bike story. That's
why I'm late. All right. Um,

326
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,110
okay, so this is the Monday morning
podcast. Everybody did you got you.

327
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Did you watch some fucking sports
about them South Dick's to fucking say

328
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,420
I fucking said it.
Oh yeah.

329
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:45,580
Fuck you set your fucking cunt dude,

330
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,300
I'm the fucking Celtics tied it up.

331
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,380
Holy Shit. Amazing. I gotta
tell you something right now.

332
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,640
I have the utmost respect
for fans of the NBA.

333
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,840
It is the most fucked
up nerve wracking game.

334
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,630
It's, it's, I can't even explain it.

335
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,140
No team can go up by 20 points
and fucking hold the lead.

336
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,050
They just can't do it by 24.

337
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,640
And then all of a sudden stern calls the
refs to fuck you guys doing the rule is

338
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:24,560
15 points, 15 or more. And then they
just start Twitter eight to tweet,

339
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:28,930
tweet, tweet, fall away
from the ball. And you know,

340
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,940
I've never watched this sport where you
hear the announcers review a call like

341
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:39,110
six times a gave. They go, I dunno what
he was looking at there. Then he lays,

342
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:41,210
Rondo,
pushes the ball up court.

343
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,120
You know how many fucking times?

344
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,740
It's the most frustrating
sport I've ever in my life.

345
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:50,980
When the Celtics were up by,
uh,

346
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,840
we got like 15 or whatever scored 61 of
the first half and then all of sudden

347
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,870
you've got 28 in the second half.
It's like, what is going on with that?

348
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,130
That doesn't make any sense to me.

349
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,610
Like when a pitcher comes out and
he's on and he's got his stuff,

350
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,810
he has his stuff,

351
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,820
he doesn't like pitch pitch lights out
for four ratings and then like let up

352
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,530
like 19 fucking home runs

353
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,713
doesn't happen.

354
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,770
Fucking NBA.

355
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:20,010
They said they were up by 24 points
and then all of a sudden did you,

356
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,000
they can't get a call,

357
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:24,510
they can't get a bucket and all of a
sudden it said it's up fucking four point

358
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:25,440
nail biter.

359
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,060
We were up by 24 points after three
quarters game 3:24 PM if you scored 24

360
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:33,504
points,

361
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,160
that's a solid quarter with the fucking
points and somehow it went down to being

362
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:41,700
like an eight point game and I was just
losing my shit and the Moros watching it.

363
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,610
I was just convinced that
it's manipulated by the refs.

364
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,310
I don't give a fuck what you say.

365
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,990
There's no other official that has
more power than an NBA referee.

366
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,310
They can kick people out
of the fucking game. Okay.

367
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,960
You can call attentional grounding on
Peyton manning. You can call a, you know,

368
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:03,750
some bullshit forward
lateral or some crap,

369
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:08,430
but you can't kick Tom Brady out of the
Goddamn game unless he throws a punch.

370
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,510
You know what I mean?
I guess she can,

371
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,700
as he verbally abuse you or touched
the ribbon, he asked to do something,

372
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,140
but in basketball you can just
call phantom fouls. Like if, I bet,

373
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,910
if I bet the game, this is all you got to
do. Who's the best player on their team?

374
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,510
This is what you do right out of the gate.
You give him two quick fouls.

375
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,360
Now he's on the fucking bench probably
for the rest of the first quarter.

376
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,140
He comes out in the second quarter.
Now you got to give him his third,

377
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:37,680
but you know, you got to
wait a few minutes, you know,
however the game's going.

378
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:40,440
You wait a few minutes. Then he
gave him his third. All right,

379
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,460
so and so's in foul trouble.
Third quarter starts,

380
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,270
he's on the fucking bench and now you
want the other team to make a run.

381
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,100
The Fuck Oh comes off the bench.
You give him his fourth tee them up.

382
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:57,030
Maybe a couple of technicals there.
I think I watched that game yesterday.

383
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,220
It goes into overtime.
It's a playoff game.

384
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,060
Paul Pierce files out
Lebron James Fouls out

385
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,730
two fucking best guys out there arguably,
you know, and it's sitting on the bench.

386
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:12,520
You don't watch hockey and
all of a sudden fucking,

387
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,130
you know whoever you want to call the Fox,

388
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:18,940
even in the finals now
[inaudible] you know Zach Parisi,

389
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,580
however the fuck you say their names,
they hate the doubles. I never watch him,

390
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,803
you know?

391
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,970
Oh that's his third fucking cross check
that said he's out of the game and like

392
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,790
the like Gretzky and Lemieux are
just sitting there on the bench,

393
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,440
fouled out and then like the scrubs
come in and they can't hit fucking free

394
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:38,050
throws. I, I just, it's
unbelievably frustrating,

395
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,120
frustrating fucking game to watch.
But we're tied up with tied up.

396
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,100
So did that make any god damn sense

397
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,790
if you guys ever watched those
youtube videos when you see a,

398
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,380
okay,

399
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,800
what, when you see what's his face when
you see that whole Sacramento Series,

400
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,150
Sacramento Kings,

401
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,240
but was it against the El La Lakers in
2002 a series that was allegedly fixed?

402
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,600
Um,
you saw right there I to fix a game.

403
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,670
They just filed out both their centers
on bullshit fucking calls and a then it

404
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:14,630
is let's shack run wild and
they still almost lost the game.

405
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,210
I don't know man.
You know what it is.

406
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:23,070
I'm so sick of people like being a hockey
fan unless you run into another hockey

407
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,660
fan.
It's the weirdest sport to be a fan of.

408
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:27,390
Cause people just shit all at
well why did they let them fight?

409
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,330
I can't see the puck. And after watching
the NBA for like the last three weeks,

410
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:38,280
it's like why don't you worry about the
mobbed up refs in your league? You know,

411
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,300
I think the NBA is, is basically, it's
a pure game. It's a beautiful gay,

412
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:46,230
but it's basically a traveling
gambling ring as far as I can tell.

413
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,040
The players gamble with each other.
They get into fistfights on planes,

414
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,320
they bring guns to the fucking arena.
You had a mobbed up ref, you know,

415
00:24:55,321 --> 00:25:00,150
and then they pulled the Lee Harvey
Oswald, he acted alone. Horse Shit. Right?

416
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,950
You have the biggest star of the game.

417
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:07,460
It has to mysteriously just
retired for a year and a half.

418
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,270
And then one of his loved ones essentially
is murdered like execution style.

419
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:17,600
Like there's a lot of shit.
There's a lot of shit going on.

420
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:22,100
So why don't you go fuck yourselves
with your criticisms of hockey? Okay.

421
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:26,030
I can recognize NBA is a great
game. But uh, your, your league,

422
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,840
it's a little fucked up. And as far
as you guys who can't see the Puck,

423
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:33,770
why don't you start by looking at the guy
that everybody seems to be focused on.

424
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,590
All right.
That's usually the guy with the puck,

425
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,090
the black object against the white surface
that you, for some reason kids see,

426
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,700
um, speaking of which I'm trying
to go to game for the La Kings

427
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,270
in, what's the best thing about, uh,

428
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:54,170
about the La Kings making the playoffs
is listening to the local spa sports

429
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:56,960
radio shows like half to talk hockey.
Dude,

430
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,570
they are fucking flailing out
here and this or that, that,

431
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:03,110
that Max and Marcellus show.

432
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,450
That's the show I always listened
to and they're great and everything,

433
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:08,120
but when it comes to hockey,
they don't know a fucking thing.

434
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,240
Max is just hitting you with basic fell.

435
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,350
They got there quicker than
any other team. A big team.

436
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:19,640
They're playing together. He's nothing.
The guy's got nothing. This is funny.

437
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:20,461
Like two weeks early,

438
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:23,210
I was listening to his show and some
jackass called him was go, yeah,

439
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:26,390
I'm a casual fan of hockey. I go to
a couple of games a year, you know,

440
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:29,330
if they just would tell you what a
cross check is, it's like right there.

441
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:32,600
It's like, dude, you're not a casual
fucking fant. That'd be like me saying,

442
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:36,140
I'm a casual fan of the NBA.
I go to a couple games a year.

443
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,300
If they just tell me what traveling is,
it's like,

444
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,500
how do you not pick that up within
the first fucking period and a half?

445
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,020
All the criticism, criticism will gets
hockey silver. I love when they go,

446
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,780
why do they have two half times it's like,
dude,

447
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,200
why don't you go back to basic math and
realize that it's mathematically you

448
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:55,020
can't have two half,
right?

449
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:57,270
They have a third time
and a two thirds time.

450
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,030
We want to get tech technical.
Correct. All right. Anyways,

451
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:05,400
this is the podcast. Hey,
you know what time it is?

452
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,050
It's time for some fucking advertising.

453
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,560
What are you safe days
coming up every body?

454
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,220
If it wasn't for your dad looking
at your mom wanting to get down,

455
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:20,910
you wouldn't be here, right? This
is the thing about mother's Day.

456
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:25,110
You go all out on mother's Day. Everybody
does, right? You just go all out.

457
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,070
She your mom, she's a saint, right?

458
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,440
You go all out and what happens?
Father's Day.

459
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,650
Your father is basically Walter Payton
and Superbowl 20 remember they let the

460
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:39,510
fridge, the fridge is your mom, right?

461
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,570
The fucking popular one handed off to her
and sweetness doesn't get a touchdown.

462
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,500
All right, well I think it's high time.
You let your dad fucking run one in.

463
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,110
All right, and you can do
it with the man. Great.

464
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,410
What is the man great you you ask?
Well,

465
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:57,750
when you go out and you
look at your father's grill,

466
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,600
he's going to have one of those grills
where they have those little skinny

467
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,690
little grills. You know what I
mean? That you couldn't even,

468
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:07,920
you couldn't even put like a,
a cheese it on without it falling through.

469
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,230
You know, this is what
the man great is. It's a,

470
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,080
basically it's a grill enhancement system,

471
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:16,560
which means you don't have to go buy a
new grill. This is going to enhance it.

472
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,870
You ever go into those awesome
steakhouses and you look at this,

473
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,960
this psycho Musky grill that they have
and those really thick a grates that they

474
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:26,760
have and the little,
the little moat thing to catch the grease.

475
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:30,180
So there's no grease fires. They
basically, they finally made one,

476
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:31,800
I don't know why it took so
long for someone to do this,

477
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:34,440
but they finally made one
for your grill at home,

478
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,310
which basically now you're
going to get the, the, the, the,

479
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:41,340
the look and the flavor of a
real steak house. All right,

480
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,290
Bay and this is the best part is 100% made
in America. Cast iron, grilling greats.

481
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,040
What do we make in
America? We'd, and this,

482
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,860
I think that's all we have left.
All right.

483
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,850
This is actually legal in all 50 states.
All right?

484
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,510
100% a made in America cast iron,
iron grilling grades,

485
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,470
they're heavy duty grilling grades deliver
exactly what you need to achieve that

486
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:07,290
steakhouse flavor that
you've been looking for.

487
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,130
A man grades got the patent and
design is great for chicken, steak,

488
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:14,730
veggies and all that stuff was
never going to taste so good.

489
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:18,510
You don't have any more flip
flare ups or dry meat guaranteed.

How could you do better?

501

You know,
get them a hookah

502
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,350
dad, you've been faithful all these years.
Oh wait, here's a, here's a, a is a,

503
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,690
an email from somebody talking about
NBA reps because that was like convinced

504
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:22,340
that the NBA is fixed or at the
very least manipulated, you know?

505
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,580
Oh my God, the lottery. Are you serious?

506
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,020
Okay.

507
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,870
The lottery.
The Knicks when the first one ever,

508
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,190
because you want Patrick Ewing to go
to New York City course. Absolutely.

509
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,780
Um, the fall away from the ball. I
don't know why he was looking at their,

510
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,750
um,
be rest.

511
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:45,180
Bill saw your tweet about NBA reps and
how they are in it for the money. Well,

512
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:49,080
it's the truth. Uh, this guy's
claiming that this is the truth.

513
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,940
This is all alleged before I get sued
by a conglomerate of those footlocker

514
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,680
jackasses.
I'm friends with the daughter of one of,

515
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,990
one of the top paid reps in the league.

516
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,040
I just went to a wedding on Friday night
and there were two tables of NBA reps

517
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:06,090
there. No lie. I can provide picks for
verification. I don't want any pictures.

518
00:31:06,091 --> 00:31:09,300
Don't send me any pictures.
I don't want to rat anybody out here.

519
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,990
I just think it's hilarious. Anyways,
anyway, I know that reps gets paid,

520
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,010
referees get paid 10 grand
per game for the NBA finals.

521
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,880
So if the series gets swept,
it's uh, it's 40 grand.

522
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,050
But if it goes to seven games,
that's a difference of 30 grant.

523
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,310
I work in finance and that's a lot of
coin for an extra three days of work,

524
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,600
plus the network gets more money from
advertisers, et Cetera. Although as sport,

525
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,010
uh, although a sport,
it's a major business.

526
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,540
I don't know what that sentence
means. A former ref Tim, Donna,

527
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:47,460
he got busted for gambling on games a
while back and wrote a book about it.

528
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,660
This is my favorite thing. They say that
that guy has no credibility. You know,

529
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,610
that's what they said
about Jose can Cinco,

530
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,140
when he first came out and you know what
was ratting everybody out, like, oh,

531
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,140
he's all these better. He's turned his
back on baseball. Uh, wait a minute.

532
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:03,510
He's right. Nope, sorry
about that. You know,

533
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,270
plus if you say he has no credibility,

534
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,770
then you have to like let 80% of people
out of prison because that's how they

535
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:14,880
ended up in prison. The person they did
the crime with was negotiating their,

536
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:19,530
their fucking sentence down
and they ratted him out.

537
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,850
Right. I don't know. I think
the NBA is filthy. You know,

538
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,970
Pete Rose Bets on baseball.
He's banned from baseball for life.

539
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,030
Jordan bets on it and he
gets to go play baseball,

540
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,820
allegedly, allegedly, uh,
former ref Tim, Donna,

541
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,980
he got busted for gambling on games
a while back, wrote a book about

542
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,580
it. The guy is from the same neighborhood
as I am and we know some of the same

543
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:43,911
people.

544
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:47,610
The guy that does my homeowner's insurance
was named as a gambling pat and I in

545
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:48,560
the first chapter.

546
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,920
It's eye opening of how shady the business
is and how reps can cheat so easily

547
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:59,000
to fix the outcome of a game.
According to Tim [inaudible], Dani,

548
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:02,930
this is all alleged people, all it
Philadelphia is a hotbed for NBA Reps.

549
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:07,460
And I actually went to high school with
an active Nba Ref who was also at the

550
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,850
above mentioned wedding.
Uh, I love the podcast,

551
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:13,970
but just started listening a few months
ago. How can I download the camp?

552
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,370
The dude,
you didn't really say anything.

553
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,580
He just said you went to a
wedding with some NBA Reps.

554
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,250
You know how much they make a game,
but you didn't really provide any.

555
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,540
That's all circumstantial.

556
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,943
I Dunno.

557
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,960
It just seems so filthy.
Like they call like the,

558
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:34,450
when they call those ticky tack files,
I'm telling you,

559
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:38,560
they're thinking ahead in the
game as, as how I look at it.

560
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,440
Like I get Paul Pierce files out.

561
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:45,340
But like those bullshit ticky tack files
that you call on him in the beginning

562
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:48,190
of the game is how we ended
up falling out when the end,

563
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:52,570
when he actually follows somebody. So
I don't, I don't know. I don't get it.

564
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:53,470
I'm sitting there watching us.

565
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:57,040
We got a 15 point lead and then
all of a sudden within a minute,

566
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,530
Paul Pierce in Rondo,
both pickup there.

567
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:03,400
Fourth files have to sit down and next
thing you know, it's a game again.

568
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,190
Okay.

569
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,310
You know, so I don't know
that they necessarily, I,

570
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,800
this is the feeling that I
have when I watched the NBA,

571
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,020
I feel like somewhere around 14,

572
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:16,980
15 point lead in the playoffs,
the playoffs,

573
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,130
um, that's when all of a sudden, you know,

574
00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:23,190
calls started going the other way because
they don't want people to turn the

575
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:27,270
channels at the end of the fucking day.
It's a business.

576
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,720
Okay.

577
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,770
They keep it close. Just keep a close.
That's what they're doing. I don't know.

578
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,280
I'm an asshole now listen to me,
but I I 100%

579
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:37,880
okay.

580
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,470
It, it just wouldn't surprise
me if somebody came out
and they actually found out

581
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:43,020
that like 18% that's a little high.

582
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,280
I'd say 11% of NBA Games
are strongly manipulated.

583
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:54,120
I would be surprised that a PR that it
wasn't more like 18% cause when I just

584
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:57,330
watch him, it's just like how
many times can they just be like,

585
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,370
there's like no foul in that did shit.
I know we talked about it last week,

586
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:05,160
but Coby hacks,
a guy across both fucking arms,

587
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,490
they call him for his third
foul in the second quarter,

588
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:11,790
you know he's going to sit down. That's
going to affect the casual fan watching.

589
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,600
They have a 92nd meeting and then they
give the file to somebody else and that's

590
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:18,900
a business move right fucking there.
And then the announcer says,

591
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,150
I don't have a lot.
They'll look good at their raw right.

592
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:25,680
Kobi bringing it up the court
fucking nuts. She was in the front.

593
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,170
There's a file away from the ball
cheese. What was he looking at? I don't,

594
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,620
it must've been something
before the video. There was act.

595
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:38,470
They act like perplexed. All
right, here's his sexuality

596
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,180
situation. Everybody, um, hey bill,
I need your advice on something.

597
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,410
Uh, this is, uh, not, this is not about
a breakup dating are gold diggers,

598
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,970
but I think your advice could help me,

599
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,390
could help me out on an
extremely awkward position.

600
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,050
I'm 19 and I'm home from
college for this Ama.

601
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,470
I've been home for about a month
and I live in North Carolina,

602
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:01,420
but go to college in Arizona.
Dude,

603
00:36:01,421 --> 00:36:06,070
good move Arizona with all those fucking
whores out there coming to class and

604
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:10,960
like bikini tops and you're out there
with your Q to than cute southern draw.

605
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:15,610
How much Asah you get? Well,
let's find out. Shall We? Okay.

606
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:20,230
While I was away at college, I have
opened up to new ideas such as politics,

607
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,120
politics,
religion,

608
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:27,370
and about my sexuality and
my bike and I am bisexual.

609
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,420
At the beginning of summer I started
hanging out with my old friends from high

610
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:35,260
school. One of which was gay. We
had messed around in high school,

611
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:39,520
but nothing serious. What does that
mean? You flicked his balls a little bit.

612
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,830
Sorry. The fucking joke is there. I'm
going to do it. All right. Come on.

613
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,370
Take it like a man like everybody else.
Okay. Everybody gets trashed on this.

614
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:52,630
Here we go.

615
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,780
So this summer he and I were hanging
out at my house and nobody was home.

616
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:59,530
We started and we started to drinking.
Oh Gee, she's playing some music.

617
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,660
Why am ca and he started
to smoke some weed, man.

618
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,850
Then after about two hours,

619
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,200
we decided to do the dirty Jesus Christ.

620
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,030
Okay.

621
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,750
Okay. Here we go. Slugging away through
here. Halfway through US getting it on.

622
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:21,250
My mom walks into the room
and catches us in the act.

623
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:27,090
Wow. Now talk about the needle
going off the fucking record.

624
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:32,700
She started yelling at me, swatting
me with the mail she had just gotten,

625
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:36,870
I'm surprised you didn't turn the hose on.
You kicked my friend out of the house.

626
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,850
Then banned him from ever coming over
again and started screaming about the

627
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:45,720
Bible and a bunch of religious shit.
By the way,

628
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,520
this all happened when I was in a,

629
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,900
in a panic trying to get some
clothes. Oh my God, Dude.

630
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:56,700
What a way to come out.
Oh,

631
00:37:56,701 --> 00:38:00,720
I think it was Mitch was a giant neon.
I'm gay sign hanging over you.

632
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,240
Wow. That's a fucking
situation there, Huh.

633
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,321
Ever since then,

634
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:11,600
my mom and dad had been forcing me to
go to a few religious nut jobs that are

635
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:15,420
supposed to convert me from
bisexual to heterosexual.

636
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,730
That's hilarious.
You know,

637
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,880
like you're going to convert a truck from
two wheel drive, the four wheel drive,

638
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:25,020
like it's that fucking easy. This is
a huge pain in the ass because one,

639
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:28,290
there are churches on every
corner and North Carolina and two,

640
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:32,030
I don't want to change, so you
shouldn't do it. You can't.

641
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,320
You are who you fucking are and they're
going to have to accept it. Also,

642
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:35,980
my parents had

643
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,120
been treating me differently now and it's
really weird and awkward every time we

644
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:44,020
talk. So I guess my question is
how do I deal with this dude?

645
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,400
This is might be outside the realm
of my lack of extra expertise here.

646
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:51,880
Do I tell them that I don't want to go
to some religious fat fuck who was a

647
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:56,620
Jesus Freak and whose stomach
is as long as his vowels.

648
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,200
I always,
you've got that southern draw.

649
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,200
You can't bleed suck in day yet.
Um,

650
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:09,070
or should I just pretend to be straight
until the end of the summer then go back

651
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:12,550
to living the life I wanna
live at college also.

652
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:16,780
How do I keep saying with people telling
me that I am living my life wrong and

653
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:21,580
that God is judging me. Hope that wasn't
too sad dude. It's a fucking epic story.

654
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,750
Thank you for Shea. Sharon it here. Um,
all right. This is the deal dude. You,

655
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:26,920
you need new friends.

656
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,850
You need to keep the friends that accept
you for who you are and the ones who

657
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:33,670
aren't, you just got to phase
them out. Your parents were,

658
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,910
your parents will come around,
you know,

659
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:42,580
they got to come around cause
you're, you're their son.
Alright. Stereotypically,

660
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:46,270
probably your mom before
your dad or whatever, but I
don't know, maybe they will,

661
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,120
maybe they won't.
But what the fuck are you going to do?

662
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,630
Okay.

663
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:54,560
You know, you are who you are. You've got
to go be who you're going to be. And uh,

664
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,560
as far as do you tough it out for the
summer, that, that's up. That's up to you.

665
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,560
That's up to you. If you're
going to keep going back. I mean,

666
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:07,830
if I was going to keep going
back to some shit that I wanted,

667
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:09,960
I didn't want to go to,
I would just,

668
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,330
I,
I would have fun with it.

669
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:20,470
I would just act like a fucking moron
and I would keep acting like I was almost

670
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:22,400
cured.
And then at the last second be like,

671
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:25,310
but don't you think John Travolta's
cute? Oh, no, no. Sorry. Sorry.

672
00:40:25,311 --> 00:40:28,490
I'm just fuck with the guy who just have
a good time. If he can't get out of it.

673
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,520
If you don't want to, you
know, fight, you know,

674
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:35,090
if you don't want to be like Hitler and
try and fight on three fronts and ended

675
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:38,930
up in a fucking bunker, uh,
maybe just start with the,

676
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:43,610
get some new fucking friends. Uh,
that's it, dude. That's brutal,

677
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:47,060
man. That's brutal. But,
uh, you'll get through it.

678
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,470
You'll get through it and you'll find some
fucking people, you know? I don't know.

679
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:54,950
It's weird. In a weird way. Everybody
does that beyond that shit. You know,

680
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,740
as a comedian, I never fit in
anywhere. Everywhere I went,

681
00:40:57,741 --> 00:41:00,380
like when I fucking had jobs and they,

682
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:04,310
we'd be sitting there and I had my little
Michael J. Fox fucking suit and tie on,

683
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,770
like thinking that,
that this is what I was going to do.

684
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,640
And everybody was going in for some
fucking meeting. I'd never gave a fuck.

685
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:11,960
And I never,
I just felt,

686
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:15,320
always felt like an outsider until
the day I walked into a comedy club.

687
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,670
And I basically found people who were
the same kind of weird that I was.

688
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,290
So they didn't seem weird to me.

689
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,570
Committedly comedians were
all out of our fucking mind.

690
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:27,020
So that's what you have
to do in a gay way.

691
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,880
You just got to go find some heterosexuals
who are accepting of you and go get

692
00:41:31,881 --> 00:41:36,320
some gay friends and you know you're going
to have a great life and you're going

693
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:40,010
to have abs until you're 60 evidently.
Cause that's how it works with gay people.

694
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,420
Fuck them. B, O, u, R and a. That's
it. All right. There you go. All right.

695
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,820
Dealing with girlfriend's mom,
girlfriend's mother.

696
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,990
Dear Bill. Yum. I'm 24 years
old. You know it's funny,

697
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,000
I always do this as this Boston accent.

698
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:02,930
I think that it fucks with my language
for the rest of the week. My language. No,

699
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:06,520
my accent for the rest of the week. I'm
24 years old and recently started. Let's,

700
00:42:06,521 --> 00:42:09,440
let's see if I can pronounce
my rs through all of this.

701
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm 24 years old and recently started,
started dating a new Gal.

702
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:19,010
She's a complete sweetheart.
Sorry. Also 24 years old,

703
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,810
but her mom already hates me.
What do you got? A mullet.

704
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,760
You got an earring, you got a
loud car. Do you got that? Look,

705
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:32,390
I'm going to fuck your daughter.
What's going on with you? Uh, he says,

706
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:36,770
I'm a pretty successful guy for my
age, college graduate. I have a house,

707
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,940
legit office job, et Cetera. How
the fuck you got a house at 24.

708
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,030
Okay.

709
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,860
Do you come from money or are you dealing,

710
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,993
okay,

711
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,391
dude,

712
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:50,630
if you're a college graduate and you
legitimately found a job and were able to

713
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:52,130
buy a house, like at a, I don't know,

714
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:56,810
like you've probably like one of five
people from your generation that's able to

715
00:42:56,811 --> 00:43:00,680
do that with his fucking economy.
So I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

716
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:01,491
Congratulations.

717
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:04,410
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
that you don't have a meth lab in Europe

718
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,820
bathroom. Um, anyways, the
girl that girl's lives at home,

719
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,890
and before she was, uh, before me, she
was dating a guy in medical school.

720
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,780
Her mom crept through my Facebook profile
and decided based on the suburb I'm

721
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:20,930
from, the school I went to,
when the fact I'm not a doctor,

722
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,910
I'm not good enough for a daughter.
Uh,

723
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:28,150
which means she probably pressured her
daughter to go data fucking doctor or you

724
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:33,110
know, she dated a doctor trying to make
her mom happy. That's what I'm guessing.

725
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,100
[inaudible] was my lack of a
psychology degree. Um, but my,

726
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,120
my cynical way of looking at stuff,
uh,

727
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,050
well after three months of dating and
accepting, I might be around for a while.

728
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:49,940
They finally agreed to meet me. Her Dad
seems like a nice guy. It's just the mom.

729
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,720
I have two air quote in press.
So here's the issue.

730
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,990
I can't play the Red Knights redneck
stereotype too hard by wearing acid wash

731
00:43:59,031 --> 00:44:03,140
jeans and a def Leppard tee shirt
because my girl will get pissed off.

732
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,640
But to my, my advantage, I own two cars,

733
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:11,920
both of which will annoy her
and deem me a fucking Hick. Uh,

734
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,520
which option in your
opinion would be funnier?

735
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,470
Parked in the wraparound driveway
of their million dollar house.

736
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,040
And now he sent me pictures of
his two fucking sweet rides.

737
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:25,820
He's got a 2006 Ford Mustang Gt.

738
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:30,821
This is my daily drivers blue with silver
racing stripes and lower two inches.

739
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,010
I have the cats removed and full exhaust.
I don't know what that means.

740
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:38,220
What catalytic converters?
I have no idea what that even means.

741
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,500
I just love that you
assume that. I know. Um,

742
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,600
so it's loud as shit and it's a five
speed so I can play like I sucked at

743
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:50,400
driving a stick and do the rev and release
clutch move that all 16 year olds do.

744
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,720
That should rattle their stainless steel
appliances and granite countertops.

745
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,980
Number two.
I've got a 1991 Ford f one 54 by four.

746
00:44:58,981 --> 00:45:01,900
My bad weather slash housework.
Uh,

747
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,800
I think you beat her real better.
Three 51 Windsor motherfucker,

748
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,770
two tone red and white
single cab red bench seat.

749
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,550
It has plenty of NRA stickers on the
back from the previous owner and my

750
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:19,260
favorite being fight crime. Shoot
back a dude. That's it. That's a wrap.

751
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,260
Okay.

752
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,390
That's a wrap you got, I think you've
got to go with the truck. Fender wells,

753
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:29,410
a rusty a rusting out and there's
several rustles in the bed.

754
00:45:29,441 --> 00:45:33,550
It also leaks cooling and oil and it
would leave a nice stain in the driveway.

755
00:45:33,551 --> 00:45:35,620
I don't plan on being a dick
or anything when I meet them,

756
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,080
but she's going to judge
me without even knowing me.

757
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:41,620
I'd hate to let her down and close to
pictures of both cars and the bumper

758
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:45,280
sticker on the truck. Please advise. Uh,

759
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:48,850
that's what we say at the end of emails
and bullshit. Corporate America. Oh,

760
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:51,530
please, please advise. Um,

761
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,610
well those are beautiful cars,
man.

762
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:56,490
Yeah,

763
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,840
I love to Tom Pickup trucks too, by the
way. Uh, this is what I, yeah, pull up,

764
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,330
pull up in your pickup and then
the next time you come over,

765
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:09,670
you come over in the car and that'll do
the other stereotype that people, uh,

766
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,860
who don't come from money always,
you know, by depreciating assets.

767
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:15,970
Um,
I don't know.

768
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:19,400
Did it all depends on how much you
care about this girl because I,

769
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,690
your whole attitude is perfect. You
shouldn't give a fuck whether, uh,

770
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,410
she likes you or not. You
really shouldn't. There's
nothing you can do about it.

771
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:32,340
Just a, you know, romance or daughter if
you love her, if you don't get rid of her,

772
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,940
um, don't stick around
just out of spite. But, uh,

773
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:39,210
I would definitely go with
the pickup truck. The pickup
trucks. Fucking hilarious.

774
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,110
You know something. The mustangs cool too
though. That Mustang says, I, you know,

775
00:46:44,111 --> 00:46:47,320
I'm going to bang your daughter
before we even get to the restaurant.

776
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,813
Okay.

777
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,880
It's loud.

778
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,660
Maybe the Mustang. Do you got a
mullet? How about a clip on earrings?

779
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:04,090
Um, I dunno. Anyways, anyways,

780
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:06,790
what the fuck else happened to me here?
I got to click back to my notes here.

781
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,550
It was a couple of stories I want to tell
you. I told the motorcycle one right?

782
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:13,900
Didn't I? Fucking nine hours. Oh Shit.

783
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:18,180
Where the fuck is it? There
we go. What the hell is it?

784
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,770
You know what? This fucking
computer man. Ah, yeah.

785
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:24,870
How sick you guys listen to
me bitch about my computer.

786
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,690
Let me just get rid of this. Oh
Shit. You know what I went to on? Um,

787
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,680
was it Wednesday of last week?

788
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:34,750
Thursday last week I went
down to the House of Blues.

789
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,530
They had the John Bonam a birthday bash.
It's become this,

790
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,490
this yearly thing with this cover band.

791
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:45,250
Basically not cover van.
It's like these insane fucking musician,

792
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:46,630
I guess they're all playing led Zeppelin.

793
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:50,260
They come out and then all
these drummers sit in and they,

794
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,090
and they play all these Zeplin tunes
and it's, it's the fucking shit man.

795
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:00,960
And there was some guys out
there who really, really
impressed me. Simon. It was,

796
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:05,920
it was crazy. Um, Freddy cupcake curry,

797
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:07,510
the nicest guy in rock and roll.

798
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,880
Now if you remember that from MTV
headbangers ball, you're showing your age.

799
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,310
He played a custard pie and Simon,

800
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:21,970
right?
The drummer for ACDC from 83 to 90,

801
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:25,570
he took over when Phil Rudd
got kicked out. And uh,

802
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,050
right before they did razor's edge,
1990,

803
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:31,690
he left to go play with dio and all.

804
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,840
I never really listened to deal
at least that part of his career.

805
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:39,730
And uh, all I heard was some just playing
the ACDC stuff, which was total two,

806
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:40,840
four, two, four stuff.

807
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,080
And he came out and play the
ocean and he fucking crushed it.

808
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,200
Phenomenal drummer.
But more importantly,

809
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:51,730
the last time I saw both those guys on
the same night I saw them play the old

810
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:56,290
Boston Garden. Cinderella was opening up
for eight ACDC on the heat secret tour.

811
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,500
Ah, you jealous? Is it a,

812
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:04,501
isn't it amazing that it took me 43 years
to find dirt bikes when you hear that

813
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:06,430
story?
But uh,

814
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,110
Freddie curry played custard pie and uh,

815
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,070
I felt there was two different,
they all the drummers there were great,

816
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,650
but I felt there was two
kinds of drummers that night.

817
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:20,770
There was the drama that was going up
there that loved John Bonham and was

818
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:22,870
paying tribute to him and,

819
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,190
and understood what it
was that John Bonham did.

820
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,260
And then there was the other guy,
what's,

821
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:34,261
this was a small portion went up there
and it was just a jerk off festival that

822
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:36,880
they were going to go up there and show
that they could play all the fucking

823
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:41,080
licks and they will play in all over the
kid throughout the song. And it just, uh,

824
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:44,530
I dunno,
one guy saw put the drum stick in his,

825
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,010
between his teeth as he was just
playing with his right hand.

826
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:49,030
And I was just thinking,
you know,

827
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:51,190
Bonham would have smashed a snare
drum over your fucking head.

828
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:53,490
What are you doing? What
are you doing? I mean,

829
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,440
was he biting on it because he felt he
geeked fucked up a lick? I have no idea,

830
00:49:56,441 --> 00:50:00,670
but it was annoying.
Fucking annoyed me. Um, oh,

831
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:03,250
it started off great. The guy
who organizes it, Brian Tissue,

832
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,410
I think he organized it.
He played in the evening and man,

833
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:07,780
he just fucking crushed it.
And uh,

834
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:12,520
I was in my John Bonam glory and um,

835
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,080
and then Sebastian Bach came out and
sang whole lot of love. It was just,

836
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:17,914
it was just the shit.

837
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,920
And the last time I saw Sebastian
Bach live was December 31st,

838
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,280
1989. I had just lost my light
license for drinking and driving

839
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,090
and I saw Aerosmith at the Boston Garden
to bring in the decade of the 1990

840
00:50:33,091 --> 00:50:38,090
[inaudible]. That's how I went out
of the 80s. It was on the done,

841
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,830
not, don't always say done with
mirrors. It was the pump tour. And, uh,

842
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,960
Aerosmith was silver by then,
so they started fucking incredible.

843
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,670
And that was that classic story I told
you where when that concert was going on

844
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:55,410
was right around the time when,
uh,

845
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,810
another bad egg that
the United States said,

846
00:50:58,811 --> 00:51:03,580
invested in Manuel Noriega down in Panama,

847
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:06,970
all of a sudden wasn't doing what the
fuck we wanted to do. One of them to do,

848
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:08,650
you know the deal,
all these dark bags,

849
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:10,630
they're all doing shit that
we don't want it to do,

850
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:12,880
but they're doing what we need them to do.
So it's okay.

851
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,820
And then the second they stopped
doing what we needed to do,

852
00:51:15,821 --> 00:51:19,270
all of a sudden were outraged that they
gassed their own people fucking 12 years

853
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:22,760
earlier.
How could he have done that at 1973?

854
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,780
We got to go on and get this right?
Uh,

855
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,730
there's like the fucking Coby Brian Foul.

856
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,920
90 seconds later they give it
to somebody else. It's like,

857
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,950
what the fuck have you been talking about?
So anyways,

858
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,121
so you know,

859
00:51:36,121 --> 00:51:39,660
they're pumping us with
all the information about
Manuel Noriega and none of it

860
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:40,494
is good.

861
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,820
So you know, so he goes up there in
the middle of this fucking metal show.

862
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:48,820
He decides, I know I told this
story before, but I love this story.

863
00:51:48,821 --> 00:51:53,620
He decided out of the
fucking blue to go political.

864
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,730
I remember he was standing on stage
and he might've been drunk, just, just,

865
00:51:57,731 --> 00:52:00,340
you know,
for him to save face,

866
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:05,050
but he was wearing these leather pants
and I just, him standing there, he goes,

867
00:52:05,051 --> 00:52:08,680
what's up with this man? Well, and
he grabbed his dick and he goes,

868
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:11,560
suck my fucking Burrito,
man.

869
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:13,660
Yep.

870
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,920
Fucking a rhythmic.

871
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:20,590
And it was this awkward pause and
everything just went very starched chair.

872
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:21,361
And he goes,
I'd seen,

873
00:52:21,361 --> 00:52:23,980
he said something about going
down there and fucking Newcomb.

874
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:28,870
It was the classic and for all you conn
silver in England, the guys from Canada.

875
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:31,270
So go fuck yourself.
All right.

876
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:35,920
You think now the typical stupid
guy from the states, all right,

877
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:40,710
might've been pandering, but I got to
tell you, we all cheered. That's right.

878
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:41,670
Sebastian,

879
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,300
you figure out Central America
and then play slave to the grind.

880
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,800
Oh No, no. That was their
first tour. That's a new thing
in 18 in life. You got it

881
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:00,090
right. And all the chicks are like, oh my
God, look at me when I take my tits out.

882
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,410
Oh,
those were the days.

883
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,390
All those fucking fish netted horse whose
flows the greatest fucking thing ever.

884
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:13,340
I'm really so happy that I grew up
during that time rather than the grunge

885
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:17,530
period when all those hairy checks would
just fucking walking around with this

886
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:21,980
Sasquatch muffs, you know,
high and tight eighties baby.

887
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:30,310
It was right before the really bad news.

888
00:53:30,311 --> 00:53:32,980
Two things that were really
bad and the nineties like,

889
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:38,050
you know that grunge music, you
know, the top tier I like all right.

890
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,340
But there was a lot of moping around
just because moping around was selling

891
00:53:42,341 --> 00:53:44,110
albums the same way with hair metal.

892
00:53:44,111 --> 00:53:46,210
There was a lot of shit
about the devil and you know,

893
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:49,660
they weren't really
sacrificing anybody. Right. Um,

894
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,140
it was only the top shelf that
were, but anyways, the, the,

895
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,380
the mopey music of the
90s and then the fucking,

896
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:59,170
the just absolutely perfect circle,

897
00:53:59,171 --> 00:54:04,171
horrific grapefruit fake tits where you
had like a varicose vein on the side of

898
00:54:05,861 --> 00:54:10,540
your titty. Like those two
of the worst things from the
90s, I would say, you know,

899
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,810
one of the best things for the 90s
I would say would be sound garden.

900
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:18,020
I go with them.
Um,

901
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,730
I'm sure I could play a fucking email,
Dave,

902
00:54:19,731 --> 00:54:24,060
fuck these jug gang actually ripped up.
I don't give a shit. You guys like me.

903
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:27,900
Anytime you computer comes up and says,
hey, there's new software available. Yeah.

904
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:32,220
Would you like to download it? And you've
got that option. Not now. You know,

905
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,400
like hitting the snooze alarm on your
fucking computer and then one day you go

906
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:37,200
to your,
iTunes doesn't work.

907
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:39,840
Now the video works and then you
yell at your computer. Like it's the,

908
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:44,040
it's the problem. That's what
I like to do. Hey everybody,

909
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,850
if you've been to the post office
lately, yeah. How did that work out?

910
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,630
Wouldn't it be wonderful if somehow you
could take the enormity of the stove,

911
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:55,110
the postal industry, and just stick it
inside your, of your, of your apartment,

912
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,320
put her right in your little sleeping
bag. Wouldn't that be great? Well,

913
00:54:58,321 --> 00:55:00,240
I'm here to tell you that
that's a possibility.

914
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,870
If you go to stamps.com everybody,
um,

wastes of time in your life right now,

916
00:55:06,661 --> 00:55:10,500

office, especially when
you've got a business to run.

917
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:13,560
Or maybe you just want to sit
down and eat a sandwich, right?

918
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,400
That's why you need stamps.com.

package. Sorry, I read that wrong.

923
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,850
Basically anything you want to ship,

and put it on a scale. You know,

925
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,730
maybe you need some help. Now you've got
a friend, right? You have him pick it up,

926
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:46,440
you put it on the damn scale,
you weigh it,

927
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,090
you put the postage right on the park out,
you're putting your post office box,

928
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:54,360
whatever, your mailbox, and then you go
right back to watching t bill. We know,

929
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,720
we know what we would do if we had the
post office in our own apartments or

930
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:02,490
houses or outhouses or tense.
Do you live in a tent city?

931
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,640
Do you have an outlet?
Uh, by stamps.com uh,

It's a fraction of the cost of a
postage meter. Plus you get discounts.

934
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:13,080
She can't even get at the post office.

935
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:16,470
That's a great thing if you get an early
with stamps.com because once it blows

936
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:19,260
up, you know that they're not
gonna have any of these discounts.

937
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,440
So you get an early, all right, I'm
sure. I'm going to get a note on that.

938
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:25,950

948
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,150
You know,
that'd be great.

949
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,200
What if he had the grocery store in your
own apartment? That's probably be next.

950
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:06,570
Go to grocery store jet Com.

951
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:11,030
Wouldn't it be great if Lehmans fell
out of your ceiling? Do you know? Uh,

952
00:57:11,031 --> 00:57:13,870
the wonderful, the beautiful,
the lovely Nia has been, uh,

953
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,360
she's been on a tear lately,
you know,

954
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:21,250
planting all his shit out in the
Yad and uh, none of it's edible.

955
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,240
So we're having this big fight. Like
she likes pretty smell. It smells good.

956
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:29,320
I like it. It's Lilac. It's like
you can't fucking eat that shit.

957
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,550
You know? Why don't we get a a, you know,
like a watermelon tree is something,

958
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,720
right? Why email is don't go fuck
yourself. I know they don't grow on trees.

959
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:39,520
You know what I mean?
Let's get something edible out here.

960
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:44,120
Let's grow some goddamn
potatoes. You know, scope,

961
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,990
grow some fucking food
is what I want to do.

962
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,920
They got those little dwarf trees
like a midget, a grapefruit tree.

963
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:52,690
They got a midget avocado
tree and they just,

964
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:57,190
you just stick them in a barrel and
then you go park. Alex comes, it comes.

965
00:57:57,191 --> 00:58:01,000
Jesus thrown all the sinners down into
hell and you just sitting there eating

966
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,100
Avocados. Like, go fuck
yourself. You hippie.

967
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:07,090
I got a food supply when he got
to do to make the end of the day.

968
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:09,820
I know you're a pacifist.
I know you don't got it in you.

969
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:14,620
You don't have that rage like your
dad does. Talent skips a generation.

970
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,190
All right, why don't you go play the
fucking Maracas and get out of my face?

971
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:22,710
I know that's not your three headed
dog. That's your dad's. Yeah, go for,

972
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,700
look, I respect your dad.
I'm not disrespecting now
and disrespect and you, yeah,

973
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:31,000
I'm sure that's how you're going to
tell the story of fucking pussy. Right?

974
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,650
All while you're eating an avocado
or grapefruit or some shit like that.

975
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,330
You know, recently I worked with
somebody and they said something about a

976
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,840
um,
they said something about the a microwave.

977
00:58:44,841 --> 00:58:46,250
I don't think I can ever use one again.

978
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,420
He said they microwave water to
boiling point and let it cool down.

979
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:55,130
And then they boil some water on the
stove and they water two rows of flowers

980
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:58,700
and the water with the microwave water,
they all died.

981
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,440
So I'm all set on the microwave. That's
all it takes. That kills a plant.

982
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,900
What's it doing to me?
I don't know.

983
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:13,460
I'm easily scared everybody and I'm
very, I'm not, I'm not trusting.

984
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,690
So if you have any remote like
theory on anything, like, you know,

985
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,430
I would literally phase out,
uh, living in a house if,

986
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:24,590
if you a good enough lie as to
why it was slowly killing me.

987
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,180
Um, anyways, what else do we got here?

988
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,050
What are they have I promised
I would resend this to you.

989
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,560
Run this whenever you would like.
All right, this is spotify.com.

990
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,100
All right. This is one of these places
that you, you, uh, Oh for Christ sake.

991
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:47,810
What is this? This is the graphic image.
Why don't I have this stuff ready?

992
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:55,520
The worst, you know, this is why I'm
a comedian because I swear to God,

993
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:58,370
if I was in the real world and
I had some sort of presentation,

994
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:01,820
I would be the guy showing up with like
the papers falling out of my briefcase

995
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:06,260
at what? Atlanta. I meant to say it
would be like the nutty professor,

996
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:11,180
but I would never turn into the cool
guy. Jerry Lewis is by the way. Um,

997
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,570
what is Spotify? Uh,
it's a new way to listen.

998
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,290
Listen to free to listen to music
for free. Millions of tracks,

999
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:22,760
artists and even co comedic content is
on there for you to access whenever you

1000
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:24,230
want. I know what a lot
of you guys think at bill,

1001
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,540
why you're hyping this stuff when you
had a problem with that other site.

1002
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,610
Because this site actually is going to
pay me for my material so I don't have a

1003
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:35,610
problem with them. So go down
to Spotify, everybody. Um,

1004
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:39,860
this is why the way I,
I think about Spotify is iTunes,

1005
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:43,040
but with the entire world's live,
oh is this one I'm supposed to say?

1006
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:45,290
This is what I think you
guys are speaking for me.

1007
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:48,890
Evidently Spotify is like iTunes,

1008
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,540
but with the entire world's library
at your fingertips will right there.

1009
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:57,200
That's better than iTunes.
How many times you go on Itunes,

1010
01:00:57,201 --> 01:00:59,810
you go to look up a band and they don't
have it unless it's like the biggest

1011
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:00,644
thing ever.

1012
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:05,060
You know like your guilty
pleasures at that kid.

1013
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,560
They'll actually have the be tracks
of Brittany Spears on Spotify.

1014
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:10,760
It works on a PC.

1015
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:15,500
It works on a Mac home audio system
and mobile phones tracks play live.

1016
01:01:15,501 --> 01:01:19,490
There's no need to wait for downloads
and no big dense in your hard drive.

1017
01:01:19,491 --> 01:01:23,840
Spotify connects seamlessly with your
Facebook account and allows to easily

1018
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:26,390
discover new music and
share them with friends.

1019
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:30,440
Super easy to use and is what you do.
You go to the Spotify link on the website,

1020
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:32,810
Click register from your Facebook account,

1021
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:38,060
download Spotify to your windows or Mac
computer search and play the millions of

1022
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,430
songs that are now yours.
During it, they say,

1023
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:44,660
we'll give you free access access to
Spotify, and it's really just that simple.

1024
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:48,200
Um, Bill, do you have a
deal for us? Yes, I do.

1025
01:01:48,201 --> 01:01:51,200
For every one of my
listeners that I drive to a,

1026
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:55,310
those is the actual deal that I get.
Every one I drive there,

1027
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:59,110
I get a free quarter of a grilled cheese
sandwich for listen to. So it's a,

1028
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:04,310
it's a whole sandwich. Um, banner
ad is attached to the email.

1029
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:07,250
We don't even have this up yet. I'm
going to have to hit, AH, Jesus Christ.

1030
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,460
Why did I do that? You know
what you did? That's like,

1031
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:13,760
you just got somebody leaked.
Copy the tracks of their new album.

1032
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:17,360
We're going to have that up for next
week. Everybody, all spotify.com

1033
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,690
boy. Oh boy, this is the
greatest thing ever says bill.

1034
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,320
I like when this copy like that. I
don't even have to think. Um, anyways,

1035
01:02:27,321 --> 01:02:29,570
so let's get back to the podcast here.
What do we got here?

1036
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,180
We got some overrated underwriters.
We've got to wind this down here, right?

1037
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:36,920
What are we up to? An hour
and two minutes, Bill. Yeah,

1038
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:39,980
but here or leaving them wanting more.
All right.

1039
01:02:39,981 --> 01:02:43,580
We've gone through the advice dealing
with girlfriend's mom or his last one.

1040
01:02:43,581 --> 01:02:47,690
It's entitled Virgin lack of the Jade.
Hey,

1041
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,580
who here wouldn't still Bang Madonna?

1042
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,513
Huh?

1043
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:58,050
I just thought she'd be so fucking
annoying though. Just shut up.

1044
01:02:58,051 --> 01:03:02,850
You're from Detroit. You not have me with
your dumb accent. Uh, I'm 21 years old,

1045
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,490
dude. Just graduate to Bobby Kelly,
right? This, I'm 21 years old gig.

1046
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,300
Do you guys listen to the,

1047
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:14,100
what the fuck podcast or Christopher
Titus is podcasts and I'm going to be on

1048
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:15,180
that.
I don't even know the name of,

1049
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,240
I actually just went and did his podcast
and I didn't even learn the God damn

1050
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:22,620
name of it because I'm so wrapped up
in my own thing. You know, it's funny,

1051
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:26,610
as I went to the search thing and I
actually searched cricket is gay because I

1052
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:28,560
wanted to see what Jason Alexander said.

1053
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,683
Uh,

1054
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:37,280
all right, Chris Titus podcast.

1055
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,250
You know what's great about us doing
the podcast? If there's any video of it,

1056
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:45,170
you guys can actually see that we are two
different people tied his podcast.com.

1057
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,670
There we go.
This is what you do.

1058
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:51,200
You go to Titus podcast.com
and there's all kinds of music.

1059
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,550
Uh, all right. It's just
called the tightest podcast.

1060
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,820
He's got a cool logo. The son of a
bitch. Anyways, I did one of his,

1061
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:01,100
and I actually just tweeted at
this this week, so there you go.

1062
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:05,670
There's your homework this week.
Listen to the, what the fuck did? No,

1063
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:09,210
not what the fuck. Oh, you know what dude?

1064
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,940
What the fuck is Marin's?

1065
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:17,790
You know what dude is Bobby Kellys
and the Christopher Titus podcasts.

1066
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:22,440
Go to Titus podcast.com. All
right. If you like this podcast,

1067
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:25,260
hell, you might even like
those. All right, virgin.

1068
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:28,050
I'm a 21 year old virgin.

1069
01:04:28,051 --> 01:04:31,740
Do just graduated from college in La.

1070
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:35,220
Is that Louisiana to Los Angeles
and one of my bigger issues,

1071
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,610
that was a great Dennis Miller joke a
long time ago. Just got back from La.

1072
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:41,830
I love Louisiana. Uh, yeah. Any,

1073
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:45,060
one of my bigger issues in my life
right now is that I'm still a virgin.

1074
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:50,520
The 21 that's not bad. Uh,
I'm not attractive. I'm not
unattractive or anything.

1075
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:54,360
I work out,
have a bit of an issue with acne,

1076
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:57,750
but it's nothing like having a
gigantic puss ball on my face.

1077
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:02,490
I was in a relationship with a girl since
I was 14 and we ended it when I was 20

1078
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:06,570
because we just couldn't deal
with the long distance anymore.

1079
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:11,460
And she was really conservative Christian
and I guess I was naive and stupid

1080
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:15,300
enough to tell her that I would wait.
That's not right. The, you're a good guy.

1081
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:20,410
Therefore, the more we
went, the most we went,

1082
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:24,760
all the most we went to was just oral sex.
All right.

1083
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:28,600
Do we not like a terminal virgin?
You're actually doing,

1084
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:30,580
you're living the life
you get your having sex,

1085
01:05:30,581 --> 01:05:34,540
like you have it like a one
of those massage parlors. Uh,

1086
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,720
uh, we came close a couple
of times, but I don't,

1087
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:44,120
I would always back out because I'd feel
bad that I would be running off with

1088
01:05:44,121 --> 01:05:47,620
the virginity because at the back of my
mind I kind of knew this relationship

1089
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:51,130
was never going to work out. Jesus
Christ, dude, you're a saint.

1090
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,640
It doesn't help that she and I
have had the same group of friends.

1091
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,680
So if word got out, what I did, uh,

1092
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,730
that would have been seen as a dick move.

1093
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,670
Now that I'm actually single
and looking for chicks,

1094
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,120
and on occasion I've actually managed
to convince a few to come home with me.

1095
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,020
All right,
you're in the game.

1096
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:12,880
I feel this innate sense of pressure that
I wouldn't be able to perform well and

1097
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:16,060
would end up embarrassing myself due
to lack of experience doing unit.

1098
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,140
You're going to be fine.

1099
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,920
These nightly escapades would therefore
only tend to end up with out sessions or

1100
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:26,680
the occasional finger bang
blow job before a pussy out.

1101
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,240
Where do you think I should do,

1102
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:33,070
should actually do in a situation like
these when I'm taking a check home who

1103
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:37,330
probably has way more experienced
than I do and I should just,

1104
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,190
should I just take a heavy dose of man
the fuck up and wing it in the future?

1105
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:46,270
Uh, I wouldn't think of telling a girl
that I'm a virgin before fucking her.

1106
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:49,810
Which sound remotely attractive
to her in any circumstance.

1107
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:53,020
What are your thoughts on
this? Yeah, Dude. You know
what you gotta do? Just like,

1108
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,390
look,
you know,

1109
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:59,230
I got good at playing hockey or halfway
decent upper level of sucking your like

1110
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:04,180
I gradually got to the truth on that.
I ain't met the upper, upper sucking,

1111
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,270
not quite lower mediocre.

1112
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,570
How I got there was I played with
people who had more experience than me.

1113
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:15,220
All right, so just slide that over
to bang in these girls. All right.

1114
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:18,130
And I don't think that they, the girls
aren't like that. Then I can, uh,

1115
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:24,250
what is she going to do? All My god,
you never fucked anyone before Jesus.

1116
01:07:24,251 --> 01:07:28,900
I fucked like 900 guys. They're not going
to say that. I think he'd be like, Oh,

1117
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,100
and next thing you know, you can be
banging on the fucking doggy style.

1118
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,290
That'll be a thrill for him.
You know, you put on the,

1119
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:40,300
the the fucking soundtrack
to the graduate, you know,
you have a good time. Yeah.

1120
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:44,620
Just, just look, you know what the thing
about this is, is the more you wait,

1121
01:07:44,621 --> 01:07:48,400
the bigger of a fucking deal it's
going to be. You know what I mean?

1122
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:51,190
It's like icing the kicker
and the kicker is your Dick.

1123
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:57,190
All right for God, say, get out there
and fucking blasted through the uprights.

1124
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:00,240
That's what you needed
to do. All right. And uh,

1125
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:05,020
you sound like you're doing great
man. You're a good guy too. Junior.

1126
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:09,340
You realize the fucking, the,
the, the, I don't know what it is.

1127
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:12,100
I don't even know what the word is
cause none of my friends have this,

1128
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:13,240
this character trait.

1129
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:16,130
I'm sure women know what it is and
they probably look forward in a guy.

1130
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:18,060
Okay,

1131
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,240
a gentleman, Jesus. I had to
search for it. What a what a just,

1132
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:25,500
you're a human being, dude.
You were an honest guy.

1133
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,450
You could have banged
this girl and you're like,

1134
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:31,080
I can't do it because I in the back of my
head, you actually, you know, you know,

1135
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,020
it's funny.
You're probably bang a couple of girls.

1136
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:36,000
You become a piece of shit like me, but
right now, dude, you're in the zone.

1137
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:41,550
Mother Teresa couldn't fuck with you. You
know, Jesus comes back tomorrow, Dude.

1138
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:46,080
He's fucking your write up on that horse
smelling of puts.

1139
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:50,440
Surely when you fucking grab around his
waist and right into having to look at

1140
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:54,600
what a disgusting image anyways. Yeah
Dude, just, just man the fuck up.

1141
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,120
We get the future and uh,
you know what?

1142
01:08:57,121 --> 01:08:58,860
You know what I think would get
rid of a lot of the pressure.

1143
01:08:58,861 --> 01:08:59,694
Why don't you just tell them,

1144
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,393
you know,

1145
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,070
I dunno if you feel like the
moments there, just tell them.

1146
01:09:05,071 --> 01:09:06,720
If you just feel like the moments there,

1147
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,040
you don't have to come the whole
fucking story just in the middle of it.

1148
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:11,820
Just telling me I never,
never did this before.

1149
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,300
That's okay.

1150
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,960
You know, next thing you got their
feet in the air. I'm telling you,

1151
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:21,860
you're going to be fine. All right?
And you're a good person and a,

1152
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,670
there's the deal, dude. You're a fucking
virgin. All right? So you're like a,

1153
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:29,120
you still got that new car smell.
All right? So whatever you do,

1154
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:35,440
alright, condoms from here on out.
Condoms, mirror on out. No fucking skanks.

1155
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,780
All right? Cause they have a
dental. Even if you wear a condom,

1156
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:41,510
you can still get fucked. You know
things. I'm not going to do this.

1157
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,120
And now you get even more
in your head right now.

1158
01:09:44,121 --> 01:09:47,150
What I just did is now you finally lined
up to ticket to kick the field goal.

1159
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:49,880
And I'm sitting there waving my arms with
the fucking Air Horn in the background.

1160
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,753
Just,
you know,

1161
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,070
okay.

1162
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:55,830
Fucking around. And it's like boxing.
Protect yourself at all times. All right?

1163
01:09:55,831 --> 01:09:58,650
That's all I'm going to say.
Okay. All right, good luck to you.

1164
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,170
That's the podcast for this week.
Apologize for being late.

1165
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,860
I hope my story about riding a motorcycle.
What the fuck happened to my taint?

1166
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,370
Jesus Christ. It just sat in this
chair the wrong way. My fucking,

1167
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:12,320
my fucking Tate hurts. Ah, fuck.

1168
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:14,730
You know what it was was I went over
a couple of fucking jumps and I got a

1169
01:10:14,731 --> 01:10:16,830
little bit of air and I
didn't own enough to stand up.

1170
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,310
So I kind of came off the seat and
then landed and fucking slam my taint.

1171
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,520
He liked that people.
I jacked my thumb up,

1172
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,970
my shoulders talking to me and uh,
I took a nice fucking slam,

1173
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,250
a couple of slams to the Tate.

1174
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,980
I'm going to call the comedy store.

1175
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:38,450
Tell him I can't perform this week
because of a bruise taint. Um,

1176
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:42,290
are you fucking with us? I'm dead serious.
Hang on a second. You've got the iPhone.

1177
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,810
I'll take a video.
That's disgusting. Well,

1178
01:10:44,811 --> 01:10:46,940
it's your fault for hanging out
for the whole podcast. All right,

1179
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:50,210
go fuck yourself. That's the podcast for
this week. I'll talk to you next week.

1180
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,410
Don't take any shit,

1181
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:56,820
and uh,
God bless everyone today,

1182
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,320
okay. All right. Bye.
