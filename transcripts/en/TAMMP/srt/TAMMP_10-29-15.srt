1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,220
Hey, what's going on is bill burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:09,910
Monday morning podcast just before Friday.
And Ah,

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,910
just checking it out. Yeah, I can't
do it guys. My fucking voice is shot.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,600
I've been on the road again
for fucking two weeks.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,190
Just about two weeks coming up on two
weeks where we were in Chicago here.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,300
Beautiful Chicago, one of the
most underrated cities out there.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,370
You know what I mean?
Just as far as the sheer size of it.

8
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:33,210
And everybody talks about New York.
Everybody talks about La.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,160
Everybody's always going on and on about
De Moines, you know, but it's really,

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,020
you know,
it's fucking view.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,700
What are the fucking city has
these kinds of views, you know,

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,740
right on the water is not a lot of
major cities like this. You know,

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,690
that sit on the wall, sit on a lake.
How about that? That'll make it unique.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,530
They sit on a lake, it's fucking
beautiful. You know what I mean?

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,870
This is what Detroit will become some day.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,530
It's coming back to slowly coming back.
Cleveland's crushing it.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,070
That's when I found out about this, uh,
this part of the country, man, all these,

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,120
these, uh, I think that whole rust
belt things going to go away. You know,

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,720
they're not going to have that slogan
anymore. But anyways, last night, uh,

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,270
we were in Minneapolis had
a great fucking time. Um,

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,640
first show is a little bit
rough. Jesus Christ, you know,

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,270
I dunno what the fuck it's the first
time I've snapped on stage and so fucking

23
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:27,510
long. Um, you know what I mean?

24
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,800
Just this fucking lady just talk and
talk and talk and talk and talk and,

25
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:33,300
and it's like, I don't give a
shit. I'm still going to get paid.

26
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,780
But I know people around paid
to hear the fucking show.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,930
They didn't pay to hear me go on and
on it. And she was living at one point,

28
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,990
standing up, yelling at me, you know,

29
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,100
it's doing some bit trash and fucking
women. I mean, it's what I do.

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,430
You know what I mean? I trash
them. I have fun doing it.

31
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm allowed to do it as a comedian
and it doesn't affect anybody's life.

32
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,430
Fucking lunatic, you know?
And the more you yell at me,

33
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,340
then the more I'm going to do it
because debts then it becomes funny.

34
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,940
If you just shut up, it'd be,
it'd be over in like two seconds.

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,120
So she's standing up screaming
and yelling at me. Right?

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,960
Like I give a fuck and I'm
yelling back at her, you know,

37
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:16,020
and the security is so funny that
just sorta daintily going, miss, Miss,

38
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:18,660
you have to sit down and miss. You
have to sit down. And I was joking.

39
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:19,471
How if that was a guy,

40
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,900
he'd be in a choke hold getting
dragged out into the fucking alley.

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,780
You know what I mean? Um, and uh,

42
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,720
finally in the end they were
finally gonna throw her out.

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,460
She was living at one point miming rubbing
her pussy with a tongue hanging out.

44
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,780
Um, like that was going to
shock me. It was just like,

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,580
I've been doing the
road for like 20 years.

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,580
He can have to do a little
better than that. Um,

47
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,270
I just did not, I don't know if she
just was a, uh, maybe she was drunk.

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,900
I don't know what her deal
was. But, um, you know,

49
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,610
she decided to take some joke
seriously and felt that it was,

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,270
she needed to stand up and start screaming
and yelling. So that happens. Right.

51
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,980
And I finally just snap
in the end because, um,

52
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,930
it was just the first show was just weird.

53
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,931
Like they had the front three rows were
within the spotlight that you stood on.

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,250
So they were,
is lit up is I was,

55
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,430
and then the rest of the theater was
completely in the dark and I couldn't see

56
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,620
them.
I couldn't see any of the fucking theater.

57
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,090
So I felt like I was performing to
like, you know, 20 people. It was weird.

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,730
And um,
I dunno,

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,090
it got a little sideways
there towards the end.

60
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,860
Okay.

61
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,410
And uh, they will finally
going to fucking kick her out.

62
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,570
The guy finally is politely going to kick
her out cause she, cause she's a lady

63
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,440
and uh, I said, no, don't kick
her out. Don't kick her out.

64
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:52,441
Just let us sit there and act like a
baby was absolutely no ramifications the

65
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:55,150
way she's been allowed to her whole life.
I mean,

66
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,690
her behavior was so fucking immature.
You know,

67
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,960
and then what kills me is the end
of the fucking shallow, right?

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,160
I'm going through the tweets. I'm just
making sure that people in the dark,

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,070
he still had a good time. Right. Um,

70
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,910
which stays were saying they were and
they actually people military Minneapolis

71
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,220
who fucking cold is there. They
Will Paul, sorry for that lady,

72
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,650
Blah Blah was still a good time.
So I felt good about that. Right.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,540
And then some woman had
tweeted at me, um, you know,

74
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,740
heckling is never a good idea,
but you know,

75
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:31,390
being subjected to 40 minutes of sexist
and original material, Yada, Yada,

76
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,190
all this fucking bullshit.
Right. First of all,

77
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:38,191
I love how she addresses somebody's not
shutting the fuck up for an entire show.

78
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,480
70 minutes. She just said, dre,

79
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,230
she takes care of that with
[inaudible] is never a good idea.

80
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,670
Now that I've addressed that, and then
she exaggerates, it wasn't 40 minutes.

81
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,080
That's sexist material.
It was like 12.

82
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,920
Okay.

83
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,610
And I thought it was pretty original.
Um,

84
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:04,240
anyways, but we had the
fucking best time, um, in me,

85
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,780
I still had a good time on that fucking
show. And sell right to the end.

86
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:11,220
But then I felt good because
this woman backstage, you know,

87
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:13,940
that was running shit back
then. I was saying, Hey,

88
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,980
look at this tweet and I just gotta go
do it. Does it? Am I that fucking bad?

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,140
And she goes, look, he goes,
I live alone. I got daughters.
It's all women, the house.

90
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,260
I'm pretty independent. I didn't have
a problem with anything that you said.

91
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,180
I thought it was funny and you're always
going to get one of those at the show.

92
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,140
And I was like, thank you.
Thank you. And then I went out.

93
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,880
I had a great fucking time on the
second show and it got off stage.

94
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:39,180
I fucking gave her a
hug, you know? Thank you.

95
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,300
I needed to hear that from a lady.
Right?

96
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,670
Oh my God. That fucking
fucking woman. She was a loan.

97
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,760
A tick standing up.

98
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,870
Who the fuck is dumb enough to get that
mad at a comic that you're standing up

99
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:58,810
yelling? You know, like at
some point I'm going to go,

100
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,950
oh yeah. You know what? That's
a good point. I am. I'm sorry.

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,690
Let me,
uh,

102
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,140
let me fucking Redo my whole act now
just for you because you don't seem to be

103
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:08,974
enjoying it.
Yeah.

104
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,943
Okay.

105
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,410
Uh, you know, in a
perfect world, you know.

106
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,610
Yeah.

107
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,810
Ah, no, I'm not even gonna say it was
fucking me. Whatever. What happened?

108
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,760
Let me just let me get out.

109
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:19,250
So I'll maybe talk about the great
time that we had in Minneapolis.

110
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:22,160
So I've gone there last six times.
I've gone there.

111
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:25,760
I've wanted to go get the juicy Lucy
fucking burger that they have, right.

112
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,900
Just basically they put the cheese in the
patty and then it melts in his fucking

113
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,800
piping hot and all the tourists fucking
bite into it and burn their fucking

114
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:36,010
mouth. Right. So we finally,

115
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,220
we have barely enough fucking time
cause we were driving in from a up from

116
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,430
Milwaukee. So it was a long ass
fucking drive, like six, seven hours.

117
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:45,050
It was rain and sleet knowledge shit.

118
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,240
So we literally just
dropped the bags in me, Eh,

119
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,930
and Farsi and this other body of eyes.

120
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:55,270
We fucking jump in this car and we fucking
drive over to this. Uh, I think it's,

121
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,410
is it match? I kept calling it Mike's,
I think his match match bar, I believe.

122
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,700
Um,

123
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,030
okay.

124
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,490
Hang on, hang on, let me
look it up. Where are we?

125
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,930
I write what the text messages.

126
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,570
I only have it on fucking
soft and it's still fucking

127
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,450
okay.

128
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,890
Go into settings and find mute your whole
view. Go into settings. You can't, um,

129
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,580
the hell is it. Come on, you scroll and
Scroll and Scroll and Scroll and bup. Bup,

130
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,370
Bup Matt Smith's bar.
That's what it would fuck.

131
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:27,250
We went right now I'm going
to go all these fucking
tweets from people going, oh,

132
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:31,030
you shouldn't go to fucking cookies in
fucking Saint Paul. I didn't have time.

133
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,770
I went to the closest one and it was
fucking delicious. Char Broil Burger.

134
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,630
And we, we go there and the lady was nice.
The lady, she goes, hey guys, she goes,

135
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,210
nibble around. She saw it,
you know, you know for his,

136
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,730
he had a Yankees hat and my other
buddy at a mets hat, so you know,

137
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,610
I look like a fucking jerk off says, and
they knew we weren't from there. Right.

138
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,170
So she goes, uh, just make sure you're
nimble. That cheese is hot, right?

139
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,430
So maybe the other guy, that's what we do
first. He fucking thanks. He's nibbling,

140
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:00,340
but he's so fucking hungry bites right
into the cheese and he just goes,

141
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,550
he's like spitting it out, right?
So before I can laugh at them,

142
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,410
he fucking takes another book
just as deep and he's going like,

143
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,300
we fucking crying, laughing boy, for what
the fuck is wrong with you? He goes to,

144
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:21,960
what the fuck? She said to take a
nibble. I took it and said, no, you tend,

145
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:22,990
you took half a bite.

146
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,610
Okay,

147
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,620
you just Italian do.
You don't know how to nibble.

148
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,910
You fucking stuck in your mouth.
You fucking jerk off. And he goes,

149
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,150
boy did I go this second bite. He bedded
so deep, he pulled out half the pickle,

150
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,130
burn the shit out of his mouth and we
will fucking cry and laugh and tease the

151
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:42,610
shit out of him.
He kept trying to blame the waitress.

152
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:43,990
Yeah,

153
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,060
each app trying to blame the wedge.
It sounds just like, hey, you know,

154
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,980
we didn't have a problem. We completely
understood it. We didn't burn our mouth.

155
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,850
I was joking last night, he sounded
like he was hitting a heavy bag like ha,

156
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,890
I've been dreaming about getting up to
fucking sandwich every time I go there.

157
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,940
And that was the big thing.
I was thinking, I had like
a game plan. I was like,

158
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,550
yeah, cut it in half and I'll
let it melt. The big thing is,

159
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,850
is once you actually bite into it a little
bit, it's still gonna be a little hot.

160
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,730
But uh, once that air gets on the
cheese, it really, it kind of,

161
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,490
it's almost like a blows through the
whole Burger and then a fucking cools it

162
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:21,320
off and then you're able
to completely enjoy it.

163
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,660
And I'm totally 100% lived up to the hype.

164
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,500
Even Versie after he burned his
fucking mouth. Ha Ha. Um, he,

165
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,010
he even, he's still fucking a
joke. It's just a great burger.

166
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:38,620
So thank you to people there at
match bar full, hooking us up, uh,

167
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,600
hooking us up by just being open.
They didn't give it to us for free,

168
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:44,300
can't just me. You know
what I'm saying? So, um,

169
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,380
and the day before we were in Milwaukee,

170
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,300
now that great fucking city and uh,

171
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,780
played the Riverside theater
and that might have been a,

172
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,630
that was right up there with fucking
Indianapolis as far as like the crowd just

173
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:02,920
being right on top of you.
And uh,

174
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,821
we had one of the,

175
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:06,960
you know what I was steered or does
it just has the fucking magic man.

176
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:09,830
It was fucking awesome.
And upstairs they had a,

177
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,610
this crazy green room and they had a chef
up there who made the salads with all

178
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,040
this stuff was fucking on it.

179
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,080
Got I got treated like rock stars and
then as flat screen TV and we watched the,

180
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:24,980
uh, the royals come back and
beat the mets for game one.

181
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:29,390
I missed all the game too. But um,
I know people are freaking out.

182
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:32,510
And of course I, as a red sox fan,
I'm immediately thinking, well,

183
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,950
the mets were down o two, an 86. And
I remember how that one turned out.

184
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,900
That has our little
roller it out of Buckner.

185
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,930
What does it say?
[inaudible] with a bag between the bag.

186
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,750
I want to,
I can't even remember how it goes anymore.

187
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,690
And mads when it,
that's what you remember how it ended.

188
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,930
You know what's funny about
that fucking clip now is now,

189
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:00,050
it's just hilarious to me because thank
God we finally won it and then we got

190
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:03,880
two more for good measure. So
now when I watch it, I just,

191
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,860
I just,
it's just funny to me now.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,580
Okay.

193
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,250
The fucking, the disappointment
that that was was just funny.

194
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:13,530
How the fuck did you get it?
There's a little roller up the field.

195
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,080
I'll get to pass Buckner and the
match went, ah, that's what it was.

196
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,090
Jesus Christ. That still
hurts to say that. You know,

197
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:27,510
it's the funniest thing is when nights
scores, he's fucking running at one point.

198
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:32,310
He puts both his hands on his head.
To me, that sums up the whole game.

199
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,720
That was literally like, I can't,
I can't fucking believe these guys.

200
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:40,590
Just fuck that game up. Um, you know,

201
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,950
forget Buckner fucking Bob Stanley
just comes waddling in deck guy.

202
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:50,670
He wasn't a, he wasn't even
in beer league softball shape.

203
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,700
Fucking horrible comes fucking walking in,
you know,

204
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,580
besides that, we let them, you know,
they came back and be, I can't remember,

205
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:05,900
we were like up by like fucking three
runs or something, something crazy.

206
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:09,490
And then in the bottom of the ninth,
we will one fucking strike away.

207
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,240
And I swear to God,
I feel like we let up 17 singles in a row.

208
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,220
They just kept getting hits and
can't get it. Kept getting heads.

209
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,520
And then the past bald tied it up.
Oh my God.

210
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:27,660
You're just sitting there like
this isn't real. They count a cow.

211
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:29,340
Could you fuck this up?

212
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,150
Gets passed back gear
and their mats weight.

213
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,780
Oh man, that'll toughen you up.
As a sports fed. Jesus grow.

214
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,260
We went up three nothing.
And the next game. I was too,

215
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,030
too young as a red sox fan at that
point. I still had hope. I was just like,

216
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:51,630
I am a fucking one. That one kind of
fuck did I get on that? Oh, that's right.

217
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:55,980
I said we were in Milwaukee. So
anyways, um, before we went there,

218
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:57,720
we've actually found a steam room.
Right.

219
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,990
So me and [inaudible] will walking up
the street and the guy fucking at the

220
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,480
hotel we were staying at and I was
like four blocks up the street.

221
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,910
So first it comes out of the hotel,
you know,

222
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,930
versus he's one of those backpack guys.
Like he,

223
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,310
he does not bring luggage and he just,
I dunno,

224
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,810
I dunno how he gets it all in there.
So his,

225
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:16,800
his wardrobe options are very limited.
So he's walking down the street, right?

226
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,180
He's got on dark socks in the flip
flops that he's going to wear,

227
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,710
the sandals that he's going to
wear in the fucking, uh, the sauna.

228
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,840
He's got on like basketball shorts down
to his fucking knees, passes needs,

229
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:35,460
I should say that Jordan ones. Right. And
then he's got one of those fucking, uh,

230
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:35,681
you know,

231
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,990
it was army I fly airplane jackets
that have the Zipper on the arm and his

232
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:43,680
fucking Yankee Hat, right? Just walking
down the street. He looked like he was,

233
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,310
I dunno,
like,

234
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,340
cause his building caught on fire and
he just grabbed a jacket and ran out.

235
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:50,080
That's what the fuck he looks at freezing.
Uh,

236
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,080
Bart Nicks and other coach shorts guy.

237
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,660
And then he'd get me walking
down the street. Like I say,

238
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:58,980
looking like a sickly Ron Howard and a,
it turns out the fucking thing was like,

239
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,371
I dunno,

240
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,970
like 20 blocks up the street and first
he's Pinky toe is killing him and his

241
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:07,680
flip flop, it was fucking cry and laugh.
And as we go up there, so the hotel,

242
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,850
the hotel we go up to,
I swear to God with the steam room is in,

243
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,530
is called the Pfister
swear to God,

244
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,120
p f. I. S. T. E r the Pfister.
If you ever go to Milwaukee,

245
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,150
you got to stay at the Pfister,
all right?

246
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:28,620
Cause they got this sick
ass fucking stay bro and uh,

247
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,400
spy and all that shit. So we
fucking go down there, right?

248
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,960
And it's like individual steam room
that you get off of the fucking room.

249
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,670
We're like freaking out. It's all these
beautiful women walking around that work.

250
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,910
They're like, oh, this is
great. So finally was sitting
there drinking spa water,

251
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:50,860
right, dressed the way we look, right.
Look and like fucking animals. And,

252
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,230
uh, all of a sudden, like
three people come out, right?

253
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,370
Too cute women in this dude.
And I'm just thinking,

254
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,400
what the fuck is he doing here? And then
he just goes, ah, he's like, ah, Mr. Byrd.

255
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm like, Hey, you gotta be
fucking kidding me, right?
So we go over it, right?

256
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:09,660
And he shows me how to use the spa,
the steam,

257
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,310
because all I'm doing is taking the
steam. And he's like, yeah, you do this,

258
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:16,130
then you do that. And I was
just like, yeah, yeah, I
know how to use. And he goes,

259
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:18,890
hey,
I just so fucking disappointed.

260
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,690
Right guys should not work at
fucking spas. They just shouldn't.

261
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,510
It should be all fucking ladies,
right?

262
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,360
So I'm not a sexist pig. The Lady Shit
on the fucking thing too. How about that?

263
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:36,410
Does that make you feel all right? You
fucking dumb. Cunt. Minneapolis. Um,

264
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,890
so afterwards, right? So the thing is,

265
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:42,530
I did listen to the guy explained
the fucking Steve. Thanks.

266
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:47,180
So the fucking steam thing turns on, dude.
And it is like angry. It's angry steam.

267
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,480
And I'm sitting there like, I got to
pull my fucking feet up onto the bench.

268
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,880
They don't burn off and I'm
huddled in the corner and uh,

269
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,540
you know, I'm like, it was so fucking
hot. I had to, I had to get out.

270
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,820
I just had fucking walk out like twice.

271
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,500
I was read as a fucking tomato and
I kept going back in or whatever.

272
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,930
And um, long story short, he get
out of the spa and then Barton,

273
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:12,950
it can forsee they'd come out of
theirs and they were going, oh my God,

274
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,350
that was fucking amazing.
I was like, dude, it wasn't
too hot. It wasn't too hard.

275
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,131
He goes, no, he, they go,

276
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:18,440
we just stood on the other side
of the steam where the shower was.

277
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,910
He just like turned the
shower on. I was like, ah,

278
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:24,500
I didn't fucking think to do
that. And they were like, well,

279
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,630
the guy didn't tell you how
to do it. And I said, Nah,

280
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:29,210
I shoot him out of there because I
was pissed and I didn't get a woman.

281
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,060
And then first he starts
laughing. He goes, dude,

282
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,690
the second that guy came walking
out with those two women, he goes,

283
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:39,530
I said a quick prayer
that I didn't get the guy.

284
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,820
And then I laughed and I said,
yeah, I didn't. I thought it was,

285
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,720
what the fuck is this guy
doing here? Oh, you know what?

286
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:51,590
They should have guys at spas for women.
That's what they should have.

287
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,540
You know what I mean? It's all
part of the fucking sparks spirit.

288
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,320
She's supposed to be looking at
something beautiful. All right.

289
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,350
I don't want to see some stubbled
face jackass coming down. You know,

290
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,030
if he's listening to this,
God bless. Should Dude,

291
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,110
you tried to fucking explain
the Steve to me. Um, so anyways,

292
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,040
what was another great
thing too about that,

293
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:13,520
that Gig was a Riverside theater was
right down the street and next to it,

294
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:18,200
almost built into, it was a
fucking bar and a uh, and a cigar,

295
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,910
a tobacco store. And I want to thank
everybody there for hooking us up.

296
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:26,270
They stayed, they stayed open
late for us. We showed up.

297
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,970
They had two large fucking pizzas,
right?

298
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,250
And then they had all these
fucking sick ass cigars and um,

299
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,000
it was just one of those great nights
on the road. Wait a second, go. Fuck.

300
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,140
I can't fucking type of password
and talk at the same time. Hang on.

301
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,240
Fucking screensaver, God damn
fucking thing. Um, anyway,

302
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,630
so I don't even know how to, I don't
even know how to say the name. The Tibet.

303
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:52,960
It's like u h l e you'll

304
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,710
tobacco company.
I don't know how to say it.

305
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:59,740
Thank you so much to them and
thank you to the guy next door.

306
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:02,890
I didn't get the name of the bar. He
apologize, but it's right next door.

307
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,030
Thanks for hooking us up with the
shots. And uh, we stayed there til like,

308
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,790
you know,
three 30 in the morning,

309
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,340

they weren't a motorcycles,

310
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:16,540

said we had a fucking awesome time. Um,

312
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,410

313
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:27,790

00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,340
Yeah. This guy had cookies in one
of them. Said, ginger, count on it.

317

all of that shit. Uh, what else?

319
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,920
There was a guy when we will
always in, um, Pittsburgh,

320
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:53,060
I think made a half
patriots have Steelers,

321
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:54,260
a jersey.

322
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,640
Okay.

323
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
So one side was Tom Brady.
Yellow was,

324
00:18:57,441 --> 00:19:00,410
I think I talked to about this Hines
ward because we play in Heinz Hall or

325
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:04,850
whatever. I mean, you know, you guys don't
have to do that stuff by the way. Uh,

326
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,440
but you know, it's greatly
appreciated. You know,

327
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,830
I want to make sure I thank people
don't think you have to fudge it.

328
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,830
Just show up.
Just show up and,

329
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,890

pretend like to rub your clam and stand up

330
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:20,870
and yell at me. I mean, you could do it,

331
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,880
but you're only fucking over the
other people there. So anyways, um,

332
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,240
with that, I should probably read a little
bit of fucking advertising here, Huh?

340
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,000
or is this like tips for the person's
writing the copy for the life of me?

341
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,530
I don't know why they leave that in there.

[inaudible] right club Debbie Taylor.
Evil doers.

353
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,130
Don't you hate it?
One wine looks like a 10,

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,110
but why ends up tasting like a six or
even worse when you walk into the store to

355
00:20:58,111 --> 00:21:02,430
pick out your wine, you could easily be
fooled into a situation just like this.

356
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,620
Was that a whole sentence?

357
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,520
Don't you hate it when your wine looks
like a 10 but winds up chasing like a six

358
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:12,170
period or even worse? Question Mark.
Exclamation point. That is a fragment.

359
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,780
When you walk into the
store to pick out your wine.

360
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,880
Oh Dash you could easily be fooled into
a situation just like this. All right,

361
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:23,780
that was my fault. Uh,
well now there's new, uh,

this new wine club called club dubby
care named near port after my daddy.

363
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,870
They've changed everything.

364
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,240
No more being fooled by winds that
pretend to be harder or tastier than they

365
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:37,830
actually are.
It's easy.

366

All right,

387
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,950
let's get back to the, uh,
the, the podcast here. Um,

388
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,310
so anyways, hey, how about those Bruins?
Huh? Hey, are we go bro, when or we go,

389
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:10,311
Bob Bob scoring six goals against six
and nothing took against the fucking shut

390
00:23:11,011 --> 00:23:12,630
up.
Ah,

391
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,140
Jeremy. Hey, he's got a goal.

392
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,100
Anytime he fucking scores. I'm
pitching this right now at the TD bank,

393
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:24,970
north well's Fargo Center or wherever
the fuck they call it. The old,

394
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,120
the new Boston Garden.
Anytime Jimmy Hayes scores,

395
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:32,530
they should show that clip from Goodfellas
with Ray Liotta in the shower going up

396
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,660
Chevy.
You

397
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,100
got to do it.
Everybody loves good.

398
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,670
And who doesn't love it when a seven
foot fucking winger scores when he's got

399
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:47,360
that Bruins logo on? So I was
excited that I was excited for Milan.

400
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:52,190
Lou Cheats got his first fucking goal
with the Kings. Can't root against him.

401
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,300
And,
um,

402
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,730
I have to tip my fucking cap as much
as I don't want it it to the Montreal

403
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,580
Canadians went in nine and a fucking row
actually wanted to see them break the

404
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,740
record just because I don't
want to see them win a cup.

405
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,840
But I like seeing records get broken,
you know,

406
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,890
the Vancouver Canucks Canucks
contacts or they'd beat them,

407
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,030
you know, they'll always be constantly,
you know, I just didn't like,

408
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,810
I don't have burrows guy biting the guy's
fucking figure. You know what I mean?

409
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,230
That was the stupidest fucking
media realized they were
going to like maybe even

410
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:29,120
sweep us and that he bit a guy's finger
and acted like it. He poked the bear.

411
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,370
Why? Why, why would you do
that? And then what happened?

412
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,740
Everybody knew you fucked
up the series and then your,

413
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,440
your fans went out and they
burned down all the Starbucks.

414
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,190
And to this day when you go to Vancouver,
you cannot get a good cup of coffee.

415
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,060
It's a true story. That's
a hockey story. You know,

416
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:48,860
that you could see that on the
NHL network. Um, by the way,

417
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:52,010
if you listen to me and you get frustrated
with how little I know about hockey,

418
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,380
you should listen to Joe Barton. It's
puck off. I'll tell you right now,

419
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,690
nobody fucking like,

420
00:24:56,691 --> 00:25:00,110
if you just want to listen to an
absolutely fucking rabid fans,

421
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,990
they come up with nicknames.

422
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:07,370
They got all these cool awards like the
Claude Lemieux award is when you come

423
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:12,230
out of the penalty box and you, you
immediately score. It's got all that,

424
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,250
all that type of shit on that,
uh, on his podcast. But whatever.

425
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,560
Let's get back to the fucking, uh,
what else did I want to talk about?

426
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,050
I got to work out guy.
So I'm not going to lie to you.

427
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,810
I haven't need like a fucking animal.
Last night on the bus,

428
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,860
we watched Godfather One
and godfather two and a,

429
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,890
we swung by a swung by this
great fucking Italian Deli in,

430
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:38,300
uh, Minneapolis. Um, I thought
it was, you know, I thought
it was great, but you know,

431
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,590
partner can fucking fuzzy. They
also enjoyed it. They enjoyed it.

432
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:47,400
But like Italians, the reason why they're
so fucking great it food is they, their,

433
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:51,770
their critiques. Most people would be
like, good sub dorma goes for good.

434
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,880
Unbelievable. Oh that fucking
broaden that Denny's or whatever.

435
00:25:55,881 --> 00:26:00,080
The fucking olive garden. Oh
my God, it's so decadent. Um,

436
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,150
they have like,
they have like 9,000 levels of bad,

437
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,400
decent and unbelievable.

438
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,140
So like we got this fucking meat plate
right? And I'm sitting like, oh my God,

439
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:16,500
this is fucking delicious.
This is delicious. And
they're like, well, you know,

440
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,010
you know, you know,
the Gaba ghoul is good,

441
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:23,000
but we got spoiled with the stuff in
Pittsburgh. The Salami is outstanding.

442
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,100
The pursuit is, is, is decent. It's not
as good as Pittsburgh. I'm just like,

443
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,690
how could you guys fucking even tell
it's fucking delicious. Whatever it is,

444
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,110
it's fucking delicious. But the Cannalis
and the bread were fucking unbelievable.

445
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,760
It was all fucking good.

446
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,370
I probably shouldn't have
said that because now people
are gonna think that I'm

447
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:45,120
shitting on the fuck. I'm shitting on the,
uh, the place and that we went to, uh,

448
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,310
oh, I'm going to say this.
Broders B, r, O, d, r,

449
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,570
S. Broaders Caseen Italiana. Um,

450
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,470
the that leads Italian,
catch him.

451
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:59,070
I'm fucking can onlys were amazing.
Everything was great there.

452
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,790
You know what I mean? But I will
say the Gaba wool from fucking, uh,

453
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,450
I gotta get off towards these guys.

454
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:06,930
They're turning me into a fucking
Pi's on here. Um, food was great.

455
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:11,250
So then we put on, uh, and we
literally, when we didn't have any wine,

456
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,800
so we got out out of the bus,
walked over.

457
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,220
I'll tell you if this podcast doesn't
make you want to be a fucking comedian,

458
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,820
by the way, it's like the greatest
life ever, right? So we fucking,

459
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:21,900
we walk over to this bar,

460
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,730
we went in and we bought like
two bottles of Cabernet, right?

461
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,290
And then it's the perfect moment
to drop a good fellas line. Right?

462
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,560
Second, we got the wine, we
go, okay, now we can eat.

463
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,750
Never gets old.
Oh,

464
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:43,230
I actually quoted Frankie Carbo
when that lady wouldn't shut up.

465
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,510
And I was blaming,
I was blaming everybody,

466
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:49,440
every guy in the front row for not keeping
their woman shut. I go at some point,

467
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,770
I'm not advocate domestic violence,

468
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,870
but you got to go a little
Frankie Carbone here,

469
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:58,520
you've got a wad up that
fucking make coke, shut the
fuck up and opened the door.

470
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,370
Got a huge laugh. Um, so anyway,

471
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:05,220
so my almost done with this fucking
podcast. I really have to go work out.

472
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,150
I got to do it,
man.

473
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,300
They got a scale actually here in
this hotel. And I tell you right now,

474
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:16,890
I don't dare get on it because I'm
going to hate myself. Um, I'm open.

475
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:21,380
I just put on like five to seven and
then I got like two weeks before Madison

476
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,381
Square Gardens.

477
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:24,720
So then what I'm gonna do is I'm just
going to drop three pounds both weeks.

478
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,823
That's it.

479
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm going right back to eating as
perfectly as I know how to eat and do an

480
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:34,000
insane amount of fucking cardio. I'm going
to try to do that. But next week, um,

481
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,270
play in, uh, in Philadelphia,

482
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,300
in somebody's already told me where
to go to get a fucking cheese take.

483
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,480
Cause I always go down and he did.

484
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,510
The people that you go to the genome
as you go to fucking blah, blah blah.

485
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,890
And the more I go to Philly,

486
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,250
I find out that the only people that
go to those places that are kind of the

487
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,090
younger people,

488
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,030
because they don't know any better because
they're going to stand in a fucking

489
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:57,840
huge line. So someone was
telling me, hey, by the way,

490
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,360
fairly people, if you know a
spot, cause I, I've eaten it,

491
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:05,010
both of them.
All right,

492
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,490
I can't remember which one I'd like
last time we meet verse, he went there,

493
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,350
we got a, we got one at
each, cut them in half,

494
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,670
you know, and then switched, you know, so
we both got, you know, half of each one.

495
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,760
And I remember there
was one I liked the uh,

496
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,630
cheese better on one and I like to
something the bread better on the other or

497
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:26,760
something like that.
So anyways,

498
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,670
if you guys know of a
different place to go to,

499
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,980
I'm trying to scroll right now and find
what this person told me to go to. Um,

500
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,260
they said go to Steve's Prince of steaks.
If you guys know one of those,

501
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:43,850
cause I don't Rose's the Rose's from
Philly and he goes, Nah man. He goes,

502
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:45,770
I never go down there to
fucking lines are too long.

503
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:48,660
He had one that's off the beaten path.
So it seems like everybody knows though.

504
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:53,140
So, uh, give a couple of tours. So Hook
up here, let us know where to go. Um,

505
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,050
well if you don't want to blow
up your spot. I understand. Um,

506
00:29:57,051 --> 00:29:58,880
so I'll be there and
then I'm doing a casino,

507
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:02,770
I think in Bethlehem or something like
that, Pennsylvania. And then I got a,

508
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,580
I dunno what I'm doing, I think some
sorta some Gig, I don't even understand.

509
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:10,640
I think it's a casino. I don't know what
it is. Someplace down in Daytona, Florida.

510
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,800
And then I'm up in New York and I'll be
in New York for the whole fucking week,

511
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:20,090
getting ready to do a,
the Madison Square Garden Show,

512
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:24,410
which should be a,
obviously pretty fucking memorable.

513
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:29,270
So I'm getting pretty excited about that.
But I got to go to the gym every day.

514
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,390
It's got to become a poppy life. And
if you don't want, I'll be fading away.

515
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:38,210
You go to the gym every day, you'd cut
I gotta I gotta get back to that. Um,

516
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,780
I do find, I gotta get back
to that. I'm a fucking idiot.

517
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,860
But he's like a fucking jerk off sitting
here eating cookies with my name on it

518
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:50,690

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,140
it could not have been a more fun
toward the whole fucking thing.

562
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:13,070
From top to bottom. The guys that I went
on tour with, Jason Lalia, Joe Barr,

563
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:16,970
Nick Paul Versey, and everybody
came out to the shows, the venues,

564
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:17,804
all of that shit.

565
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,930
Even that fucking crazy broad last
night on the first fucking show,

566
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,270
I don't get any fucking hate for
you. Whatever. You know what?

567
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:25,910
I bet if we went out and had a drink,
we would have had a great fucking time.

568
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,480
You know, that admitted? Come on.

569
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:35,210
We could have traded notes on the ladies.
Um,

570
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:38,450
all right. That's the, uh, I
was just checking in on, you.

571
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,820
Hope you guys have a wonderful weekend.
You can't send now.

572
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:43,070
We got a so cool music.

573
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:46,310
You guys always ask me about the
music that's on this thing. Um,

574
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,140
I don't pick it out. Uh,
Andrew [inaudible] does,

575
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:55,240
so look him up on fucking
Twitter, Twitter. Um, he's,

576
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,620
he's a young fella.
He knows all the cool fucking music.

577
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:01,480
He's the one that tells me what the fuck
to listen to and I've been downloaded

578
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,130
some of the shit that he puts up
there. Um, I really get into the band.

579
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:09,560
Fucking God,
Jira.

580
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,540
I hope I'm saying it right.
It's Godzilla.

581
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,240
But that name was taken so they just
wrote it how someone would say with an

582
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:21,740
Asian accent. Gojira and they're
fucking drummer is insane.

583
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,880
Fucking insane. And I've never been into
that rope. Barbara. I'd like lamb of God.

584
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:28,160
I like,
like for me,

585
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:31,520
there's still has to be like a couple of
songs where they slow it down and maybe

586
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:35,510
the guy actually sings regular if he know
bands like that where there's still at

587
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:40,190
least a little bit of melody
to it as opposed to just like,

588
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:44,900
just blistering, beating
the shit out of you. Um,

589
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:51,110
oh, by the way, somebody actually
sent me some of this swag too. Um,

590
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,580
I've got to thank him for that, man.
It's been a fucking amazing tour.

591
00:34:55,581 --> 00:35:00,581
So now I've got three nights at the
legendary a Chicago theater and for my

592
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:02,270
money,
for my money,

593
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:07,100
it's the best in most
iconic marquee in the,

594
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:10,530
uh, I've any theater I
play, I've, I've, alright.

595
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,410
Even just seeing just that,

596
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:17,340
that fucking vertical sign where it
just says Chicago, it's just went out.

597
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,511
You know,

598
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:20,720
what I love too is whenever the Blackhawks
have a big game of back in the day,

599
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:24,830
the bulls that the Jordan Pippin bowls,
whenever they were,

600
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,440
they had like a big playoff
game and they would show,

601
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:30,590
they always showed the fucking river,
you know,

602
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,250
the seers fucking tower or whatever.
They show the fucking, you know,

603
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:35,720
sky long along along the lake.

604
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:38,340
But they always showed the
Chicago Theater mannose fucking

605
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,130
um,
I saw that for years as a sports fan.

606
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:46,131
So to be able to play it is amazing and
a little bit of a backstage shit here

607
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:51,500
for you. Um, this is the only theater
that I've ever played where, um,

608
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,100
you actually see a Frank Sinatra Dean
Martin and Sammy Davis Jr have their names

609
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,970
on the wall.
They actually signed it and they,

610
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:08,460
they have it behind glass cause everybody
autographs the wall and then they have,

611
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,440
um, when you're backstage, if
you're walking from left to right,

612
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:18,180
you go all the way over to the right
and way, way, way, way up on the wall.

613
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:23,181
I don't know what sort of fucking ladder
they gave the chairman of the board,

614
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:28,140
but it says Frank Sinatra. Oh, it says,
I hope, I hope you had a good time.

615
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,890
I know I did. Frank Sinatra.
It's fucking amazing. So, uh,

616
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,460
fucking just awesome wave
started off with Notre Dame,

617
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:39,520
USC and we end up at fucking
dish Chicago theater.

618
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:42,670
Could not have been more of a
perfect tour. Um, and that's it.

619
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,880
I'm done gushing here thanking everybody,
but we really didn't have a good time.

620
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,280
All right, go fuck yourself. So
have a wonderful weekend. I see.

621
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,390
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

622
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,490
October 3rd, 2011. Why?

623
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,470
How's it going? You
hear that echo? Oh Yup.

624
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,030
Um,
I'm in a new place.

625
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,870
I moved no more angry old guy beneath me.

626
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,610
I'm in a new place and uh, it's sparsely
furnished, some sitting in an old chair.

627
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:55,180
So it's going to be creaking a little
bit during the podcast and actually got

628
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:59,320
out of it cause I just
realized that sonically, that
could be a little annoying.

629
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,430
Um, yeah. Move to a new
place. Little bigger,

630
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,830
little better. Right? The
American dream still existing,

631
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,900
you know, instead of taking giant leaps,
you take little steps. Little baby steps.

632
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,950
Ooh, look at that. The kitchens
up to about six inches bigger.

633
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,110
Um, no, I'm psyched. First
Time my fucking life.

634
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:25,780
I don't have some cut live
in below me or above me.

635
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,240
So you know what that means.

636
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:33,390
All I got to do is piss off my
neighbors and I think I'll be all right.

637
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,240
No, we got it. We a nice place.
So we're site my girls happy,

638
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,140
which is a great thing as a guy, you
know, that's a great thing. You know,

639
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,460
you get something new and shiny and what
are the names and then they're happy

640
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,970
and then your life is great.
That's all you want.

641
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,950
You just want them to be happy.

642
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:57,100
Maybe if they're happy they'll
stop fucking bitching at me. Stuck.

643
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,910
I, you booed me. Maybe
that'll stop, you know.

644
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,080
But you know how broads
are, you know, they are,

645
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,060
no matter how cool they are,
how fucking hot day. Yeah.

646
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,670
Eventually they find something.
Eventually they find something,

647
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,913
you know,

648
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,960
and you sit in there and you'll listen
to him talk and you nod and you know it

649
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:25,610
and your head. Ah, yeah. Ah, okay. Yeah,
I'll work on that. Yeah, definitely.

650
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:29,480
I'll work on that. And then your head,
you just sitting there going like really,

651
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,200
really fucking unreal.
I swear to God,

652
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,610
I swear to fucking God. I was talking
to Paul Versey about this the other day.

653
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,010
We were on the phone joking
about this shit going,

654
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:45,520
I bet Donald fucking Trump gets nagged,

655
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,403
you know,

656
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,640
sitting there looking out the fucking
helicopter window that has his Goddamn

657
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,200
name on it.
Right.

658
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:57,760
And His fucking wife is probably sitting
next to him if he's even married,

659
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,380
whatever his fucking girlfriend,

660
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,860
he likes those Transylvania
hotties that Olga kind of chicks,

661
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,943
whatever.

662
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,890
He's just staring out the window
of his fucking Chapa. Right.

663
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,150
Just fucking sitting there
shaking his head, you know,

664
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,570
whole head moving to pay,
sitting still, you know.

665
00:40:21,571 --> 00:40:24,960
Right on top of his head on a swivel.
Right.

666
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,960
She's just fucking sitting
there nagging him. You know?

667
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:33,740
I just thought you could have gotten a
little more social if like I was having,

668
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,040
those are my friends.
Okay. Those are my friends.

669
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,150
Those people are important to
me the same way you are. Okay.

670
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,890
You have to accept all of me.

671
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,870
Donald's stop looking at your skyscrapers.
I'm talking to you here.

672
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,480
This is us. Okay. I or just who? You're
the dawn. You have a hit show. Okay.

673
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:58,360
This is us. Okay. This
is your foundation. Well,

674
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:01,090
I don't feel like you're listening to me
because I'm staring at the back of your

675
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:05,720
orange hair. Okay? Okay. I'm sorry.

676
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:08,300
I know hair is sensitive
to you. It's just I'm, I'm,

677
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:11,940
I'm emotional right now and I felt okay.

678
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,240
They were,
I was going to invite my friends over,

679
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:16,621
right?

680
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:21,420
And then they go into that shit right
now here's a little quiz for you fellas.

681
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:26,870
Why did that fictitious bitch start
crying in that fictitious monologue?

682
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,590
Why did she cry? I'll give you a
couple of seconds to come up with it.

683
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,910
It was because she was really, I feel
like I'm giving a lecture right now.

684
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:39,990
It's just really sending my ego through
the fucking roof. Why did she cry?

685
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Was it because she felt like he didn't
love her was because she was truly upset

686
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,010
that he wasn't nice to her friends or
was it because she took the argument to a

687
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,220
place where she knew she was wrong
by bringing up his fucked up hair?

688
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,210
That's what it was. Since she just, Oh
my God, I'm going to start losing this.

689
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,680
So then they immediately go to the tears.
That's what they do. They're terrible,

690
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,570
awful living things with a vagina now.
I'm kidding.

691
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,520
Um, anyways, but I'm not kidding about
why she cried. All right, so there it is.

692
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,730
So that's what you have to do as a guy.
You have to assess, why is she crying?

693
00:42:17,731 --> 00:42:20,850
Am I being a Dick? If you're being
a dick and she starts crying,

694
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,450
that's when you go in and you hold them.
Any telling me you're sorry. All right.

695
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:28,080
And say please don't cry. But if it's
got nothing to do with fucking anything,

696
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:31,640
it's just, it's just a manipulative
technique to make you feel like,

697
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:36,480
like you're the hulk. You know when
you're screaming in their face. All right,

698
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,100
so you don't always have
to go in for the hug.

699
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,420
You don't always have to do it to
stand back and assess the situation.

700
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,170
One of them fucking
coordinators on the sidelines.

701
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,200
[inaudible] so listen to this shit.

702
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,110
I've come to Copenhagen

703
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:17,170
when I, when I travel to other countries,
boys and girls, believe it or not,

704
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,350
I am on my best behavior.
I always try to be overly polite.

705
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,740
I try and learn a couple of words and
a, I try to figure out their, their,

706
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:29,440
their money system. So I'm not
like going, you know, you know,

707
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,350
one of the weirdest things,
where are you going to another countries?

708
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,860
You immediately feel like a child,

709
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,590
especially if you don't know
the language and you're just,

710
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,200
the funniest thing is money transactions.
You just come up and you're like,

711
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,530
hey,
like hoping they speak English.

712
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,940
You almost say like hello with an accent.
Like hello.

713
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,000
I see.

714
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,740
Until you basically speak English in
your interpretation of their accent,

715
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,990
hoping they're going to understand you
and then they're like on 2000 Deutsche

716
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:05,290
marks or something. And then you
just a handful of fucking coins

717
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:10,750
and you just guess and your hand until,
you know, you just feel like a little kid.

718
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:13,030
Like,
is this enough for that Stubbs?

719
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,350
And you hand it to them and then you just
wait and you're waiting for that. Like,

720
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,760
uh, could I have a little more
or are you fucking shitting me?

721
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,760
Or they just sort of
take it and, um, anyways,

722
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,700
what's cool over here is a Denmark
they got, they have really cool, uh,

723
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,093
I liked their money.

724
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,640
I like any sort of money that has a
little hole drilled in the middle of it,

725
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,223
you know,

726
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,160
like some little Peush and people use
it as wheels and they somehow remove the

727
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:47,190
axle. And then the giant people used it
as currency. I liked that type of stuff.

728
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:48,900
So anyway,
so I come over here,

729
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:52,830
I'm on my best fucking behavior and when
I'm in the states and somebody comes

730
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:54,420
over there and they're
from another country,

731
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:59,150
I try to be extra nice store so they
have something nice to say. So anyways,

732
00:44:59,151 --> 00:45:00,510
so I come here to Copenhagen.

733
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,010
Okay.

734
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,900
Um, which is in Denmark for all you
Americans, fellow Americans, I should say.

735
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:07,041
Look,

736
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,650
let me try to separate myself as if I
could find it on a map before I came here.

737
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,173
Um,

738
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,630
okay.

739
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,350
We jumped in the cab and I'm talking to
the promoter who's going to take me all

740
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:20,290
the way through Scandinavia.
You know,

741
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,270
that has all the ladies that
Hitler used to rub one out to,

742
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,550
wants to have blonde hair and
blue eyes. Yeah. Oh yeah. Right.

743
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,020
And, um, this is one of the
most fucked up podcasts so far.

744
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,960
How many times can you bring up Hitler?
Let's go for the record, shall we?

745
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:41,980
It's early on and podcasting history.
Um,

746
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,280
the first person to set the record,

747
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,220
or at least the first time it was tracked,

748
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,060
was bill burr back in
the early two thousands.

749
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,080
He had a podcast called
the Monday morning podcast.

750
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:01,530
It was highly successful until one day
it was permanently suspended from iTunes.

751
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,710
If you turn to page 17 in your
Monday morning podcast textbooks.

752
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,720
Um, so anyways, I'm in this
fucking cab and I have this thing.

753
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:18,820
Um,
I can never remember it from west to east.

754
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:23,710
If it goes, if it goes
Norway, Sweden, Finland,

755
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,370
or if it goes Finland, Sweden,
Norway. I always fucking forget.

756
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,693
Okay.

757
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,220
And why wouldn't I forget?

758
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,670
Those fuckers are never in the
God damn news other than that,

759
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:40,600
that tragedy and Norway. But other
than that, they're cool countries.

760
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,100
They don't fuck with people.

761
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,170
Yeah.

762
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:47,370
So they don't make the news. The only
reason why these fucking cunts over here,

763
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,080
nowhere America is, is because
we're bombing people. You know,

764
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:57,150
because we have basis in their country
because we're annoying the shit out of so

765
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,670
much of the world.
That's why they know where we're at.

766
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:00,820
Yeah.

767
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,760
So I'm in this cab and I'm having this
conversation with the promoter gun.

768
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:07,780
Does it go know what Norway,
Sweden, Finland, Finland, Sweden.

769
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,020
I can ever remember. And he
explains it to me. I go, okay, okay.

770
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,470
And then the cab ride ends and then the
cab driver turns around and goes on the

771
00:47:14,471 --> 00:47:19,390
Americans. And so Stopa was the geography.
And then he goes, I'm just kidding John,

772
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,090
to be passive aggressive. I said,
Oh yeah, you fucking Danish.

773
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:29,680
Where's Tennessee in relation to
Missouri? And he goes, don't know.

774
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:32,860
I'm stupid to go fuck yourself
with your passive aggressive.

775
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,270
This cut said that shit. America is, yeah.

776
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:39,040
So still put was the geography and then
he does his little pussy smile and he's

777
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:43,900
just kidding. No, you're
not. No, you're not. You're
serious. You're miserable cunt.

778
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,280
Oh yeah.
You're so smart.

779
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:48,220
Did you go to fucking premed
to become a taxi cab driver?

780
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,480
You fucking Dosha and right there.
I swear to God.

781
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,600
In my head I was like,

782
00:47:55,870 --> 00:48:00,010
fuck Denmark and fuck this show
tonight for like the next half hour.

783
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:03,430
That's what I was thinking.
And uh, then I was like, no,

784
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,200
I can't judge the whole fucking city.

785
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,420
I can't judge the whole country because
one douche drive and a cap. All right.

786
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,790
Put yourself in America. Do you find
cab drivers in America to be pleasant?

787
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,020
No, I do not. Do you find them to
be slightly miserable? Yes, I do.

788
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:26,740
If you drove a cab, would you be a
mess? Miserable. Cont yes, I would be.

789
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,950
And then I said, fuck it, let's give
these Danish cons of fucking show.

790
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,930
And um,

791
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,850
actually I was still nervous before
I went in to do the show and uh,

792
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,760
you know, you come all the way over
here and as much as they speak English,

793
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,720
you're, you're kind of
wondering, you know,

794
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,150
how much are they going to get?
And fortunately,

795
00:48:55,151 --> 00:49:00,151
the night before I was in London and I
just made this decision probably about

796
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:05,140
10,
the first 10 months of my set in England,

797
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:10,141
I felt like I was a little on my heels
going and here's this joke and are you

798
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:14,740
going to get this? Okay,
here's another joke.

799
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:18,610
Are you going to get this? And then
I find he just said, you know what?

800
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,230
Fuck this.
I'm just doing my shit.

801
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:27,820
All right. And if they laugh, cool.

802
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:33,010
If they don't have Jesus, is this going
to be room service? Hang on one second.

803
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:37,270
Hang on one second. You're going to get
to hear me talk to a Danish person here.

804
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:46,600
Hello? Yes, yes, no, no, no.

805
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,110
Many wives. Cool. Okay.
Okay. All right. Thank you.

806
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,530
Oops, I got it. God

807
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,750
Damn European doors, I
can't even close it. Um,

808
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,550
so anyways, yeah, so I kind of,

809
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:04,770
I learned that when I was
in doing the show in London,

810
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:09,450
I just said to hell with it, you
know, just say, just do this shit.

811
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,750
Like you're standing in the
middle of Kentucky. Fuck it.

812
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,080
Just do your act and off they laughed.
They laugh and if they don't,

813
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,400
I will address it.

814
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,720
I will then make fun of the fact that
I was so stupid that you thought I was

815
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:24,480
going to get it or
something will come to me.

816
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:29,810
And then I was able to relax and
I had this fucking show in London,

817
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:34,340
so I was like, well, it
worked in London. Let me, uh,

818
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:37,840
let me do that over here.
Okay.

819
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:42,670
So I show up to this place in
Denmark and it's probably like a,

820
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,970
I dunno, 400 seater and I'm
not going to lie to you.

821
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:49,600
Only about 125 people showed
up, you know? But why,

822
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:53,170
why would foreign to people show up? I've
never been on TV over here, whatever.

823
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:57,220
This is the whole purpose of it.
And I got free DVDs for all these people,

824
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:02,320
right? So the, the, the, the
basic marketing strategies,

825
00:51:02,321 --> 00:51:05,020
I'm going to go on stage,
fucking destroyed.

826
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:10,340
And then they're going to take these DVDs
and go onto, you must see this America,

827
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:13,420
next time it comes to Tanya.
Uh,

828
00:51:13,421 --> 00:51:15,850
I apologize to anybody
from fucking Denmark who,

829
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,250
cause I keep making you guys
talk like fucking ss people.
I, I don't know. I can't,

830
00:51:21,251 --> 00:51:25,330
I can't do your accent. Go fuck
yourselves. I'm trying. So,

831
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,240
um, they have this dude from Sweden
opened the show and he comes up and he's

832
00:51:31,241 --> 00:51:33,940
speaking a, I don't know, Swedish Danish,

833
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:37,330
I don't know what the fuck Juan's
gals tries in face Andrade.

834
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:41,620
And uh, the crowd is, you know,
sort of Giggling, sort of laugh.

835
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:44,440
And it was kind of a weird thing where
there was a bunch of comedians in the

836
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:49,120
crowd. So, uh, this guy goes
on stage, he's a comedian,

837
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:53,370
he's a newer comedian. I don't
know what the deal is. And uh,

838
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:57,490
they're sort of laughing, but not really.
And then in my head I'm like, gone off.

839
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,910
Fuck is this, what's going to
happen to me and uh, but I dunno,

840
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,920
I just felt like this
great vibe in the room.

841
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,090
I went out there and I am the,

842
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,880
and I did what I would do in the states
cause I was sitting there in my head

843
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:14,460
going that's fucking cunt and the taxi
cab but mannequins that so stupid with

844
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:16,720
the geography was bugging
the shit out of me.

845
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,590
But I didn't want to go up there and
shit on one of their country man cause I

846
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:22,900
thought they would all pull back
and then they wouldn't like me.

847
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:28,000
Then I was like well what if this was
the states? What if you were down south?

848
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,990
You're clearly a fucking Yankee.
If some guys said, hey buddy,

849
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:35,530
you booked and critique
the Saskatoon Razz game.

850
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,320
That's what the fuck I would open
with soy. I said to hell with it.

851
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,190
That's what I'm doing here.

852
00:52:39,191 --> 00:52:44,191
And I went out there and I shit all
over the guy add a and I basically said

853
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:49,030
something to the effect of Yeah did you
go to medical school to become a taxi

854
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:51,910
driver? And they laughed their asses
off and I was like, oh look at this.

855
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,530
Just like America,
except they're bilingual and uh,

856
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,030
and everything went great after that.
So,

857
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,200
and there's my European stories so far.

858
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,540
[inaudible]

859
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,460
underrated for the week.

860
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:43,870
Direct TV and getting
the NFL network people,

861
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:48,530
I don't give a shit what your landlord
says. Put a fucking addition on the side,

862
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,370
figure out a way to do it.
Steal somebody else's direct TV.

863
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:56,690
I got it is fucking phenomenal.

864
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,080
It's funny,
it's like you're on sports bar.

865
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:04,130
It's the greatest fucking thing ever
except you can just sit there and chill.

866
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:08,330
You don't have to fucking sit there and
listen to all those idiots who ruined

867
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:09,620
the gang. You know, you know those idiots,

868
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:13,400
those Jersey wearing
ball watching jack asses,

869
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,243
you know?

870
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:16,190
Okay.

871
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,520
Who like something happens and then
they yell at your table all day.

872
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,400
They do that shit.
That's some tough as shit.

873
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,480
Who couldn't even catch a basket of potato
skins if you under handed it to him.

874
00:54:29,481 --> 00:54:33,200
Like he was a fucking three year old,
all of that shit.

875
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:37,010
Ah, oh. One of the last
times I went to a sports bar.

876
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,900
It was when the saints were on their run
and all of a sudden for the first time

877
00:54:41,901 --> 00:54:43,970
in my life I saw saints fans,
you know,

878
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and they all got their brand new fucking
jerseys on typical sports bar fans.

879
00:54:49,701 --> 00:54:53,810
Brand new fucking jerseys
on. Go on. Who that? Who Dat,

880
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,730
who dat date they're going to beat them.
Saints.

881
00:54:55,731 --> 00:55:00,380
It's just like where under what
fucking rock did you crawl?

882
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,400
What? Where the fuck are You Ben?
Right ball watching Jack asses.

883
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,300
You get the NFL package.
You don't have to deal with it anymore.

884
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,530
You don't have to fucking
deal with it anymore. I got,

885
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,980
I got that and I got the NHL
package and that's what I'm doing.

886
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,230
I'm going to get the MLB
package when that comes around,

887
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:23,120
I am going to have a $400 a month cable
bill and I'm going to sit there with a,

888
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,360
with a fucking Nirvana,

889
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,450
like look on my face as I pay
the cable bill every year.

890
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,930
I am every month I am
done with sports bars.

891
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,120
I don't know why the
fuck you would ever go.

892
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:36,520
Okay,

893
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,350
why the fuck you would ever go?
What do you want to see?

894
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:42,490
You want to see the sports bar horse.
Those are some of my favorite ones.

895
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:46,500
Isn't that great?
How women can make anything look sexy.

896
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:49,690
And all those girls that come there and
they tie their fucking jerseys off and

897
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:51,530
they put some grease out
of their eyes and he just,

898
00:55:51,531 --> 00:55:55,540
and the little fucking Pony tail and
they act like they're there to watch the

899
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,550
game when they're really there,
you know,

900
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,720
just to test their pussy power
just to kind of walk around.

901
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:03,430
Okay.

902
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,560
Get everybody all fucking worked up.

903
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,780
I went to a place out
here a few weeks ago, uh,

904
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:14,380
down on Melrose called parlor live.
And I don't know,

905
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,600
I don't know if I'm getting old or what,

906
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:21,220
but it was a fucking mob scene.
You know something,

907
00:56:21,221 --> 00:56:23,850
if I was in my twenties I would go
down there cause there was a ton of hot

908
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:27,330
chicks down there, you know, and
isn't that what you want? Is a guy,

909
00:56:27,331 --> 00:56:31,740
some hot chick with a fucking pony
tail who actually watches sports,

910
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,290
you know, so I, I get, you know what,

911
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:38,380
I just realized I was too fucking old to
go down it cause I literally went down

912
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:41,950
there and I was like, why
does, why the TV so loud?

913
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,660
I can't hear myself back. Um, whatever.

914
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:55,240
All I'm saying is I'm telling you,
if you're younger,

915
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:56,580
you're in your twenties just don't,
don't,

916
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,180
don't go drink it for
a couple of weekends.

917
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,900
Pool that money together with your
roommates and go out and get a dish.

918
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,770
You fucking Douche bags.
I'm telling you. All right.

919
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,960
And then what you do is
you have people bootcamp,

920
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,140
you have those fucking sports
whores come over to your place.

921
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:17,510
There's your TV three feet over. Oh,
there's your desk. There's your bedroom.

922
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:23,000
It's right fucking there. Then they're
already used to coming over to your place.

923
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:25,820
If you hang out with them another
night and you invite them up,

924
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:30,080
the places already familiar. Oh Shit. I
think I'm on to summarize what you do.

925
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:32,810
If you're in your 20s pool your money
together with the other fucking slob.

926
00:57:32,811 --> 00:57:36,140
Have a roommate or slobs. All
right, and this is the big thing.

927
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:39,170
And you invite your friends over and they
bring their brides over to, all right,

928
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:42,720
this is to get laid by the way,
cause I know a lot of sports fans will be,

929
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,290
well you don't want any girls there cause
they're just going to talk during the

930
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:47,330
game and shut up during the commercials.
I understand that,

931
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:50,690
but if you want to bang a couple of them,
this is what I do. You get that shit.

932
00:57:50,691 --> 00:57:53,840
And the big thing is make sure
your fucking apartment is clean.

933
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,710
Make it immaculate.
All right?

934
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:00,910
There's nothing that dries up a pussy
like a dirty apartment. I'm telling you,

935
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:05,230
if they walk in and they feel that
they're gonna fuck inside of a laundry bag

936
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,830
that they're out, they're out the
door. And if you try and make a move,

937
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:12,070
you have a 30% chance that they're
going to scream rape. All right?

938
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,000
All that shit that everybody
says is for fucking cool

939
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,420
centered,
can't get something,

940
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,450
some sort of fucking decent
smell going on in there.

941
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,890
Take the shit from your male friends
when they come in like, dude,

942
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:30,240
it smells like a fucking candle store.
Would you pull that thing out of your ass?

943
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,240
Take that shit.
All right.

944
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:40,190
All you have to show is this in your 20s
all you gotta do is show remotely some

945
00:58:41,881 --> 00:58:46,260
level of fucking maturity and I'm
telling you, you're in the God damn game.

946
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,700
I don't know. There's something about him.
He dresses nice. His apartment is clean.

947
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,750
I think he's worthy of
answering my vagina,

948
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,773
right?

949
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:28,050
What the fuck is I, I don't even
get me started with that shit.

950
00:59:28,051 --> 00:59:29,940
Those people who dress up for games,

951
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,990
you know like those stupid
fucking raider fans,

952
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:35,880
what are they doing?

953
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,340
Do they understand how it went from one
of the scariest places you could ever

954
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:45,480
play to now looking,

955
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,250
it looks like a musical looks
like a Broadway musical.

956
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,890
Like I look at that and all,
I don't think intimidating.

957
00:59:52,891 --> 00:59:56,940
I think Phantom of the opera.
I really wish I knew some of that music.

958
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:02,060
I'm sure a lot of the people in the black
hole and they stand up for the whole

959
01:00:02,461 --> 01:00:05,160
game.
Do they?

960
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,400
Hey, look, it's Darth Vader. Gee,

961
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,160
I don't know if I can
catch this football now,

962
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,350
raider nation, you guys have the best
fucking uniforms and all of football.

963
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:24,010
You have the best logo.
You have the baddest fucking tradition,

964
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,860
and I don't know what you guys did to it.

965
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:32,460
You need to get those Saifai road warrior
want to be out of your stadium and you

966
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:39,811
got to go back to looking like the
fucking hell's angels like you used to be.

967
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,960
You know, look, I'm not going to
stop. I'm not gonna lie to you.

968
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:47,890
I was actually gonna go to the Patriots
game up there with a buddy of mine and

969
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,910
he's like, dude, we're not wearing any
patriots shit. I go, fuck a fuck. No,

970
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,810
this is the west coast. The Shit isn't
fun out here. People get stabbed,

971
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,910
they get shot. You lose an eye. They're
out of their fucking minds. All right?

972
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,670
But I can tell you right now, Boba
Fett is not doing that shit. Okay.

973
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:08,170
Or the guy with his fucking shoulder pads
and his fake spikes coming out of it.

974
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:16,550
Oh, with the band bandanas
in your face makeup.

975
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,970
You know, what I love about those
guys is I just want to see them,

976
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,670
you know when they're their alter ego,

977
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,710
you know like when they're in Burt ward
mode and they're just waddling down the

978
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:29,310
street going to work.
Yeah.

979
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:30,643
No

980
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:36,250
Jesus Christ.
Um,

981
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:41,210
yeah I think you guys need to go back
to looking like fucking Ken Stabler and

982
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:45,080
Jack Tatum. You know, you really should
go back to that and you know something.

983
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,010
I'm actually being,

984
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,910
I'm not being fair to open rate of fans
right now cause I've been to a game up

985
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:53,660
there and most of them look that way and
I actually talked to a couple of them

986
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:57,140
and they fucking can't stand those guys
who dress up like they were in the rocky

987
01:01:57,141 --> 01:02:01,340
horror picture show and typical TV,
typical TV.

988
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,360
Who Do they put on,

989
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:05,990
do they put on the real rate of fan was
just sitting there maybe with the rate

990
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:08,750
of t shirt or just dressing
with the black tee shirt.

991
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,940
It looks like he'd slice your throat.
You know,

992
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:15,290
like a normal upstanding raider fan
looks like. Now who do they put on?

993
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:19,880
They put on the guy dress like the chef,
the muppet show,

994
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:28,730
the fake scar pain and on is do it.
At one point they had some guy,

995
01:02:28,731 --> 01:02:31,370
I was watching the game and this
Douche bag is just sitting there,

996
01:02:31,371 --> 01:02:32,880
this face painted and he's like,
yeah,

997
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,463
okay.

998
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:40,490
Like what happened to you?
You know what happened?

999
01:02:40,491 --> 01:02:42,410
His balls dried up this disappoint.

1000
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,570
Like they don't really talk
about this in health class.

1001
01:02:44,571 --> 01:02:49,571
In high school you get to a point where
you're such a douchebag and it's been so

1002
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:52,640
long since you actually laid
down with the woman that you're,

1003
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:56,280
your balls turned into saw dust and uh,

1004
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,180
the estrogen levels go up. And
the next thing you know, you,

1005
01:02:59,181 --> 01:03:02,630
you go out and you buy a
little vanity and you're like,

1006
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,760
I just don't want to
go to a football game.

1007
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:08,940
I want to go there and character
five thick Theban eight.

1008
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:12,380
Shaneal um,
Oh God,

1009
01:03:12,381 --> 01:03:14,930
help me the next time I go up
to the bay area. Um, so anyways,

1010
01:03:14,931 --> 01:03:19,340
so we were going to go to
the game and they, and right
off the bat I'm like, Dude,

1011
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:23,750
I'm not wearing any patch
shit. And the dude's like,
yeah, absolutely not. I don't,

1012
01:03:23,751 --> 01:03:26,780
you know, why would you do that to
yourself? You know? Why would you get,

1013
01:03:26,781 --> 01:03:28,730
especially out on the west
coast where you get shot,

1014
01:03:28,731 --> 01:03:32,870
stabbed the Illusia fucking eye.
So we came up with this great plan.

1015
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,980
I ended up not going up there, but I, I
want to pass this on to my listeners here.

1016
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:38,510
This is a great thing that you can do,

1017
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,880
especially when you know
your team's going to win.

1018
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,560
You go there dressed in the other team's
colors and then you act upset when your

1019
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:47,930
team is kicking the shit out of him.
That's what I was going to do.

1020
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:51,200
I wasn't going to wear a Raiders thing.
I was going to go there and a black,

1021
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,340
black thermal,

1022
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:56,750
and it's Tom Brady was marching up and
down the field and everybody around me

1023
01:03:56,751 --> 01:04:01,550
was going, oh, what the fuck? I
be like, yeah, come on, watch.

1024
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:06,350
They're probably going to score
again. Oh Great. Just what we needed.

1025
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,110
You know, it's funny, nobody would have
noticed. No one would ever stop and go,

1026
01:04:12,111 --> 01:04:15,290
wait a minute,
this guy looks like a fucking Leprechaun.

1027
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,900
We don't have any red heads and in fucking
Oakland, this guy's a double agent.

1028
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:23,430
They never would have been able to
figure it out. You know why? Cause they

1029
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,000
too much makeup in their eyes.

1030
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:42,540
[inaudible]

1031
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,980
I've got to say this was I right?
Was I right about Mark Sanchez?

1032
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,790
I'm sure he's a great guy. I'm sure
he makes a hell of a Salisbury steak.

1033
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:02,160
You know, I'm sitting there watching ESPN.
Okay. And I've been saying it for years.

1034
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:07,020
Like the way to beat the jets is
you have to go up by two scores,

1035
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,630
touchdown in a field goal.
That's all you need.

1036
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:14,910
And then all of a sudden mark has to
be a quarterback and he has to make

1037
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:18,750
something happen. He can't just manage
the game and be like, don't throw, pick,

1038
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:21,300
don't throw a pick mark and just
fucking throw it out bounds.

1039
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:22,890
He has to try and do something.

1040
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:24,240
Okay.

1041
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,930
All right. Well this year, you know,
they lost a couple of players on d.

1042
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:32,100
They got a couple of injuries.
Now all mark has to be captain come back.

1043
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,550
And uh, you know, I was watching TV on
ESPN. They said, you know what do you,

1044
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,260
when you're running games
not working it and a,

1045
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:45,261
you could only hit intermediate passes
and you can't throw the ball deep pla.

1046
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,000
That's going to be easy to defend against.

1047
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:53,570
And I'm sitting there on the
couch going say it. Say it,

1048
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,730
just fucking say it.

1049
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:02,180
He's not as good as you tried to tell
me that he was okay. And New York is,

1050
01:06:02,181 --> 01:06:05,540
if you ever wondered why everybody
fucking hates you guys. All right.

1051
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:10,070
Yes we are jealous of your fucking
awesome city. It is awesome. All right,

1052
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:14,760
but not cause you're there before
you puff up your man tits. All right?

1053
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,580
This is why I can't stand
New York, because if you
play sports in New York City,

1054
01:06:20,581 --> 01:06:25,200
if you just scratch your ass, they call
you a fucking star. It's ridiculous.

1055
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:29,310
If Mark Sanchez played for the fucking
Seahawks, if he played for the chiefs,

1056
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:33,630
if he was down there in Texas playing
for them, fucking texted down in Houston,

1057
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,900
you wouldn't hear a fucking
word about that guy.

1058
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,833
All right?

1059
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:44,530
But all of a sudden he plays in New
York and he's got dreams. Me Ice, man,

1060
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:48,880
you stay. Start Ramming them now my
throat, like he's this fucking superstar.

1061
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:53,710
Very fast guy. Very elusive. Difficult
to sac. I'll give him that shit.

1062
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,890
All right, was the last time
you saw him throw a frozen rope.

1063
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,390
Put that fucker ball. Ace does the back
shoulder thing. Oh, he's all right.

1064
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:06,400
You know. Well, everybody down
there saying he's a fucking stock.

1065
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:09,220
Give me a God damn break.
All right.

1066
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:13,240
Give me a fucking break.

1067
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:17,280
That guy is his upper mediocre.

1068
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:18,820
Yeah.

1069
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,140
I would rather have Philip Rivers.

1070
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,980
Then I wouldn't Mark Sanchez and that's
sitting there throwing this guy now my

1071
01:07:23,981 --> 01:07:28,720
God damn throat. While his
defense is winning games,
he's like, fucking Jim McMann.

1072
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:30,410
Jimmy

1073
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:33,620
man walking around with spiked hair
and sunglasses on while I was fucking

1074
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:37,190
defense. Shuts everybody down. Oh
Gee, did you win the gang? Jimmy.
