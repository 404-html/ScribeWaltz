1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,281
Hey,

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:06,030
what's going on is Bill Byrd is time for
the Monday morning podcast from Monday.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,410
Uh,
what is it?

4
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:11,370
September 24th,

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,630
2018 what's going on? How are
Ya? Just realize my flies down.

6
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:16,950
Am I at that age now?

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,660
50 years old and be that
guy walking around doesn't
even always flies down here.

8
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:25,260
Where are my glasses?
I still haven't fixed this.

9
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:28,550
All I do is just bitch about this wire
rather than going out and getting it

10
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:32,670
fixed. Why would you do that bill? All
right. I just flew back from Charleston,

11
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:36,660
South Carolina for that house in Richmond.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,000
40,000. Not Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,540
I was down in the fucking,

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,990
saf had a great time.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,110
He had a god damn great time. I got
to tell you some Richmond, Virginia,

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,670
the Altria Theater, uh, top five,

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,160
top five theaters in America I've
ever played. That there was the,

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,580
I dunno, I dunno what it
was. The whole layout of it.

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,680
That dome above how great the sound was.
The crowd was amazing.

20
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:14,740
It was incredible. You know, I know what
she's all, what about us? And Norfolk.

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,050
I had great time there too.
Great crowds the whole fucking time.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,070
Great people. They didn't lose their
houses because of the hurricane.

23
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:26,430
I haven't been to fucking
North Carolina yet. You know,

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,730
I was so relieved and when
I got to Charleston because
they said that thing was

25
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:34,420
going to hit him dead center,
you know,

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,900
and uh, I was like, want to,
so what am I going to show up?

27
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:40,240
Everybody lost their house. I'm going
to come down there being like, oh,

28
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:43,840
what's up with this fucking wire on
my party? Like a ditch and about that.

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,490
People just lost their house. I
didn't want that. I was so relieved,

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,760
so relieved that I didn't
have to go to design.

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,810
Don't ever send me to a disaster area.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,910
I am much better hundreds,

33
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:01,770
if not thousands of miles away doing a
benefit where the money is then sent to

34
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,420
that area. You get me in the
area, my act, my act as not work.

35
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,750
Yeah.

36
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,410
When people are knee deep in water in
their living room, it just doesn't, okay.

37
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:15,010
I've tried. It doesn't work
and it's just, you know,

38
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,530
it's just not a good thing.
But you know, it's, you know,

39
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,440
there's other comics for that. It's
a great big, beautiful fucking world,

40
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:25,710
a comedy. Um, anyways,

41
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:29,820
I flew back today and, uh, guess who
was sitting next to me on the plane,

42
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,620
Frankie Valli. I couldn't
believe it. I was freaking out

43
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,380
sky and you know, I, I didn't bug him.

44
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,090
He was literally right next to me and
his whole vibe was he didn't want to be

45
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:45,650
bugged.
So I did not fucking,

46
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:49,010
I didn't say one fucking word
to him other than excuse me,

47
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:53,300
cause I had the window, you know, and uh,

48
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,070
the guys like 84 years old, you should
have seen him popping up out of his seat,

49
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,000
the end of the flight to grab his bag.
You know,

50
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,420
are we expecting someone
to bug him? And, uh,

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,830
incredible shape kept himself
in like I eat fucking ways.

52
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:11,230
The exact same you way back when
he was singing all those songs,

53
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,910
it's very inspiring.

54
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,743
MMM.

55
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,040
Actually when I looked him up,

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,770
one of the questions that
people ask what you know,

57
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:23,670
all like all the top questions.
One was how did Frankie Valli die?

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,630
You know, that's when you
know you crushed it in life.

59
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,240
Yeah.

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,560
You've been living so long. People just
assume that you're dead. I don't know.

61
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:38,430
I was pretty impressed by that. I hope I
live that long. When did bill burr die?

62
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,990
Uh,
he's still alive.

63
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,090
You can go see him down at the fucking
Hooky Lao and chickopee Massachusetts.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,913
MMM.

65
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,420
All right. What's your favorite Frankie
Valli Song? What? Mine is mine. Is that,

66
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,510
remember that song? Yeah. Yeah.

67
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,670
Mazza Georgia.

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay.

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,040
Though I never laid a hand on you.

70
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,390
My eyes door June like itself.
Then it Salvey good.

71

73
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,450
Okay.

74
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,280
He sat next to me on the plane.
I didn't fucking say shit to him.

75
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,790
He just,
that you know,

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,110
eight I was enough. It was
enough. He was fucking automatic.

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,790
It's pseudo did you will
ignore a really big fan. Great.

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,680
Now we used to go wash his hand.

79
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,363
MMM.

80
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,720
So if you see him, you know, fucking
lean Multnomah Salem street. It was,

81
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,361
it was his mood.

82
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,840
Today I'm talking like I know the guy
I did set next sit next to him for like

83
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:45,760
fucking three hours
when we were done,

84
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,980
if I just started singing his
fucking stuff, I was, you know,

85
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,850
I just put on my fucking headphones.
They just started singing his shit

86
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,660
song. She Sung like 9 million fucking
times. Then he has to hear him.

87
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,850
Disgustingly attitude.

88
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,730
Okay.

89
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,210
Probably would elbowed me. Hey Kid, shut
up. I did it better. Something, you know,

90
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,710
some cool something that are
called gay would say, man,

91
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:09,730
I hope I'm in the shape.
He's,

92
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,090
I hope I live that long and I
hope I'm in the shape he's in.

93
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,860
He looks fucking great and uh,

94
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:15,990
okay

95
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,200

So that was pretty cool. I'll tell you,

96
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:22,320
what was it called?
I'll tell you what I did enjoy.

97
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:23,980
Yeah.

98
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,670
Was how the New England
patriots got their asses.

99
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,700
Why Bunch of Goddamn nerds,

100
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,640
oh,
this happens every September.

101
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,100
Every September we start off slow and
then everybody has this dead and buried.

102
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,230
It's fucking over every setting. The new
tradition in the AFC is in September,

103
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,630
the Patriots are done and Kansas
City's going to the super bowl.

104
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,750
How many times have we seen it? Well,
it's only the second year in a row. Well,

105
00:05:58,751 --> 00:05:59,950
it feels like five.

106
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,253
Okay.

107
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,780
Kansas City, it's over. It's a gift.
Wrap it up in a fucking bow. Right?

108
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,850
Fucking unbelievable fucking Versie man.
For as he jinxed me,

109
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,100
he fucking tease the Patriots.
I didn't even give him shit.

110
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:23,570
That's the second week in a row that
he's lost on the lions as he calls him.

111
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:27,680
The hapless lions.
Fucking unbelievable.

112
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,240
Not as unbelievable as this God damn
fucking wire. Oh, did I move my head? Oh,

113
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:35,840
is this a comfortable position?
And now go fuck yourself. Um,

114
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,283
okay.

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,150
I was actually doing,
I did two shows last night.

116
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,370
My wife taped the game so
I haven't even seen it,

117
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:46,550
but I was watching the ticker on my
phone cause I don't know how you guys,

118
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,780
you fucking download the app and
then you gotta have your pen.

119
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,620
How do you keep all your
passwords? Well, how do you keep,

120
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,760
how do you keep track of them?

121
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,893
You know,

122
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,750
unless you just don't give a fuck and
you just use the same one every God damn

123
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,584
time.

124
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,690
Okay.

125
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,950
I'm a, I'm not even good at
coming up with passwords.

126
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,780
Like when I go to type it in that
the computer's like week, Eh,

127
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,590
that's getting better.
And I'm like,

128
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:18,620
I'm like fucking Zebra
[inaudible] 98 they're like fair.

129
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,890
It's like how the fuck is,
somebody's going to figure that out.

130
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,613
Okay.

131
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,170
Anyways.
Um,

132
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,720

Balloon Herbie 49 week like this
to somebody already have that.

134
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,040
I have no idea.
But let me ask you this.

135
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:45,150
When was the last fucking time he is
a God damn stats, Foy stats or stat?

136
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,160
He's a fucking stat for you. When was the
question? I have, when was the last time?

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,120
The browns,
the lions and the buffalo bills.

138
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:58,870
All one in the same week.
Jesus Christ.

139
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,540
I mean, you're talking the browns
in the lions have both gone. Oh,

140
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,520
and 16 in this decade,
right?

141
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:11,230
Was it this decade under the years
of flying by 32 fucking losses.

142
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:14,401
You know,

143
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:17,190
they always do that when they talk about
the national debt and they tried to put

144
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:18,510
it in terms that you can understand.

145
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:23,010
I'm going to put 32 losses in terms
that you can understand. Lost, lost,

146
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,480
lost, lost, lost, lost,
lost, lost, lost, lost.

147
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,470
I'm going to fucking do times three plus
two. Lost, lost a lot of fucking losses.

148
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,980
Um, somebody's going to use that as a
rink. Film loss loft. Sorry. Anyways,

149
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,340
um, it's weird. My team is one and two.

150
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,820
We actually have a worse record
right now than the Cleveland browns.

151
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,800
Having said that,

152
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,830
it's kind of fucking fun seeing these
teams that have sucked so long be good.

153
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,810
I want, does anybody out there
call a buffalo bills? This

154
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,680
maybe a bad on it, but who
the fuck? Who the fuck saw

155
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,680
27?
Nothing.

156
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,550
Okay.

157
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,220
Whatever the fuck they were up by 17.
Nothing

158
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,510
against the fucking bite.
What a viking stove.

159
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,430
The vikings putting their fans out of,
out of their misery early this year.

160
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:15,320
They usually wait till the playoffs.
Playoffs.

161
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,770
Okay.

162
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,350
Um, I watched a bunch of
football this weekend. I watched,

163
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,730
I watched Alabama roll tat.
I watched them against the Aggies.

164
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,820
Love the Aggies quarterback.
Man, that guy's a fucking game.

165
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,770
He kept a minute for like a hat almost
to the half, but uh, I swear to God,

166
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,950
watching, watching the,
uh, Alabama crimson tide,

167
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:40,780
it's like watching the patriots where
the players are so well coached.

168
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,050
Like the way they turned it on at
the end of the first half to be like,

169
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:47,171
hey,

170
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,610
let's get another touchdown here and
let's buy whatever the hell they were by.

171
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,900
Like I think, I can't
remember, maybe seven.

172
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,880
Let's go in the locker room up by four.

173
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,660
They put the foot on the gas and then
went right down the fucking field and they

174
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:01,630
scored. Aggies come out,
they shut them down again.

175
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:03,370
They got the ball back and
then they kicked a field goal.

176
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:06,760
They tacked on an extra fucking 10 points
and it was like, wait a minute, wait, we,

177
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,320
we were down by one score. We've done
by a touchdown like three minutes ago.

178
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,130
We're ready to jargon, you know,
feeling good about ourselves.

179
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,680
And all of a sudden they give him the
whole fucking right there, Fred twice.

180
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,420
And then the,
uh,

181
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,040
Alabama was getting the ball coming
out of halftime and you liked it.

182
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,720
They're going to go down,
they're going to score another touchdown.

183
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:28,990
It's fucking game is over.
That's essentially what they did.

184
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,790
And the fact that, uh, Nick Saban,

185
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,510
I always go to forget his name and I just
remember that chant when I went to the

186
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:42,320
Lsu game and the whole student
section was going, fuck you save.

187
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,250
So I always have to say
that once in my head,

188
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,070
I have to picture of that memory and
then the audio plays. Fuck you save.

189
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:51,400
And I called Nick, Nick Saban, Nick Saban.

190
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,123
MMM.

191
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,970
The job that that guys doing down
there, considering, you know,

192
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,220
all the players that you lose every year,

193
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:02,670
everybody thinks they're a pro or they're
just a senior and they can't play any

194
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,430
more and you're just constantly
rebuilding the fact that they,

195
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,240
that whatever the hell he instills
in them, they get it immediately.

196
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,700
Um, you know, it was pretty
impressive. I miss the Lsu game.

197
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:17,100
Fucking college football is
like the Games don't like on,

198
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,780
they'd like random games on like
Tuesdays now it seems so on Friday.

199
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:26,490
I think I missed that. But they're three.
No, I think we got Florida next week.

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,650
I did say we, I'm in, I'm in
with fucking Lsu. I, I, you know,

201
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,890
can't, can't root for Alabama. They
just took God damn good. Right.

202
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm not looking forward to that
Alabama game. That's going to be rough.

203
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,893
But who knows?

204
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,390
Maybe dead fucking Cajun Hulk
Hogan can talk them into s I dunno.

205
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,310
I Dunno. You know what? That'd be fun.

206
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,940
I got to watch Alabama every week
cause I never watched when they lose.

207
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,260
How angry does nick say?

208
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:02,010
I actually worry for his loved
ones when that guy's taking a loss.

209
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,020
Okay.

210
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,020
Like that poor Alabama kicker.
We fucking Shank two punts.

211
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:12,700
The fucking look on Nick Saban's face.

212
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,510
Oh my God. It was like he wanted to
rip the kids fucking foot off. Um,

213
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,600
anyways, I hate fucking podcasting
when I flew across the country fly.

214
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:25,450
I don't know what it is.
All my funny just goes out the window,

215
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,890
but brain isn't working
fucking sitting here.

216
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,020
Jesus Christ. Um, so how was
I going to talk about, I,

217
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,970
I absolutely nothing to fucking
talk about. How many minutes of,

218
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:42,030
I'm 12 minutes in 12 fucking
minutes and I got one for you.

219
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:43,250
You know somebody come home,
right?

220
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,780
All I want to do is jump in the shower
and just wash the fucking airport off of

221
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:51,230
me. All right? Can't do it.

222
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:54,570
Cause I own an old house and we got a
plumber in here for the 9 million time

223
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:59,210
trying to fix whatever the fuck is
wrong with the, the toilet this time.

224
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,910
Can't do it. I swear to God, give you
guys some advice. If you ever fucking,

225
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:09,210
somebody ever describes a house has
having character, I'm telling you,

226
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,430
just head for the hills. All right?
If you meet a woman and she says,

227
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:18,210
guys find me intimidating. Just
run for the hills. Does it?

228
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:22,500
There's a couple of fucking
red flags out there. Um,

229
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,850
ladies, what are we? And tell me what,
what is it so I can help out women here?

230
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,110
What, what's the, uh,

231
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,580
what's the red flag with a guy

232
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,060
you don't know him and he says drink lists

233
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,600
something creepy. I
don't fucking know. Um,

234
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,640
anyways,

235
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,530
the red sox clinched that was all exciting
until the Yankees clinched and it's

236
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:52,710
just like, oh, so are both zero and zero.
Like what am I getting excited about?

237
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,920
Why is everybody popping
fucking champagne and all that?

238
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,520
The Indians won the series. I think
they took two out of three from us.

239
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,691
I'm telling you,

240
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:05,370
Terry Francona is laying in the
weeds and nobody sees this guy.

241
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,480
Okay.

242
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,150
People, how many times do I
have to be right? I, I'm, I'm,

243
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,350
I'm going to pat myself on the back
right now. I had been killing it lately.

244
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,840
I said it wasn't fucking open when we
swept the Yankees. I was right. I said,

245
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:24,370
you can't base the lines first fucking
week or what they're gonna do or anybody.

246
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,960
I was right about that.
All right.

247
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:31,150
I was worried about two things,
but that feels great to me.

248
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,960
Felt like I've been right
about a lot of shit. You know,

249
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,820
this is what happens when you get married.
You know what I mean?

250
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:39,580
When you actually write about something,
you just, you want to tell people.

251
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,060
So there's maybe somebody will give
you a fucking had a boy every once in a

252
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:47,140
while. Um, anyways, I, uh,

253
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,570
what else? What I want to fucking
absolutely. Literally nothing.

254
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,090
Charleston football. Oh yeah, yeah.

255
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,810
There's another isn't a
fucking sign of global warming.

256
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:01,930
Isn't it amazing how like sports,
like they, they don't give a fuck.

257
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,800
They'll talk about war,
they'll promote a war and all that shit.

258
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,850
But for some reason, global warming
or climate change, whatever that is,

259
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:12,880
just completely off limits.
I have never seen,

260
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,860
I never saw a football game called
or delayed because of weather.

261
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,380
The first, like, I dunno, 45 years
of my life, 40 years of my life,

262
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,310
and now it's like every
other fucking week.

263
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,210
Like the weather is too
bad to play football,

264
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,240
which you play no matter
what the weather is.

265
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:40,241
So either somebody sued the shit out of
a stadium because they just got a perm

266
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:45,461
and it started to rain and a football
game or we're just getting crazier and

267
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:49,550
crazier whether
you know it's gonna happen eventually,

268
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,350
you know, because we keep
saving all of these people.

269
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,070
When Mother Nature tries
to wipe him off the planet,

270
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:00,980
we fucking let everybody know
something is going to happen.

271
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,690
Get out of the fucking way.

272
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,770
So she's just going to have to start
swinging harder and harder and harder.

273
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:08,540
And it's going to be one
of these fucking times.

274
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,490
There's going to be a tornado that
sets down like write in a stadium and

275
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,420
everybody's just going to go flying
like they went through like a, like a,

276
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,220
a wood chipper.
Um,

277
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,640
you know something. If that fucking
guy, what the hell's his name there?

278
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,380
I always forget his name.
That guy, the guy he had als.

279
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,730
He was really smart and he was
always predicted negative shit.

280
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,720
I wish he was alive so I can ask him that.
Is it Steve or something like that?

281
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,120
Mike and one have regular names.
Hey Tim.

282
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,823
Billy.

283
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,180
Okay,

284
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,500
Kevin. Kevin's a little, it's
a little bad for white people.

285
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,800
That's a little flavor in your
name back in the day anyways. Um,

286
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,080
I would ask them to, hey dude, you know,
not for nothing. What, when, what year?

287
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:03,830
Yeah.

288
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,330
He was like,
he was like one of those fucking,

289
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:07,430
you know when you go to like Coney
island or something and you get like the

290
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,530
bearded lady and then there's
a guy guessing your weight.

291
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,980
He was like the guy that guests you
wait before, like super smart people.

292
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,040
He was always saying all that crazy shit,
you know?

293
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:17,950
Okay.

294
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,780
And 20, 38 there's gonna be no
more apples. You know, he just,

295
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,230
he added down the polar ice caps
are going to fucking, you know,

296
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:30,550
just fucking gloom and doom that guy had,
you know,

297
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,430
you guys think I'm bad. That
fucking guy, Jesus Christ.

298
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,930
I would have loved to ask
them and been like, hey Ricky,

299
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,040
when is a tornado going
to fucking set down?

300
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,600
Yeah.

301
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,740
In a fucking football stadium
that we don't even see coming.

302
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,920
He could actually probably
within the fucking week.
Well, actually, wait a minute.

303
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,240
What did that guy ever predicted came
true and I gotta be honest with a lot of

304
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,830
his predictions, they were pretty fucking
obvious. It's kind of was saying, yeah,

305
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,390
we're going to fuck this whole thing up,

306
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:06,380
which is kind of the direction we're going
in. But you know what your day to day

307
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,450
you gotta take like little,
like happy things that happen.

308
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,040
Like seeing the lions,
the bills and the browns all win.

309
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,860
You know, bills, fans a conch.
I've been to two games out there.

310
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,520
They're fucking grumpy cunt.
You know what I mean?

311
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,110
They'll like the south. They
never got over the loss, you know,

312
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,970
I'm fucking with you. Um, they never
got over those Superbowl losses.

313
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,560
They're just like, it's,
it's fucking with them.

314
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,780
It hangs over that city.
It's a great city.

315
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,260
They're great people. But I'm telling
you, do they put on a bill shirt?

316
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,690
I know the feeling, believe it or
not, back in the day I see it too.

317
00:18:56,691 --> 00:19:00,350
Like whenever the red sox were that
the throwbacks with the pad patriot,

318
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:03,110
I get up my, me and my older
brother, we get sick to our stomach.

319
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,360
Okay.

320
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,200
When you look at it, he's like, oh
my God, I don't mind if they ever,

321
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,180
what they wearing with the black cleats
then it kind of looks like the original

322
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,530
days of the AFL.
I don't mind that.

323
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:16,310
But if they go out there with white
fucking cleats and they wear that fucking

324
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:19,460
Pat Patriot thing,
that's all I think about.

325
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,730
All I think about roughing the passer

326
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,940
fucking the 46 defense.
Dan Marino,

327
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:33,890
lightness up the buffalo bills where they
had Jim Kelly kicking the shit out of

328
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:38,480
us. Uh, there was a minute
there with the jets were good.

329
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,130
Okay.

330
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,370
When they had the New York sack exchange,

331
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,850
this can't all be football every week I
get people around the world listening to

332
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:49,970
this shit and they just don't give a fuck.
So I got up at some point,

333
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,670
switch off to something that's
going to be a little bit,

334
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,350
a little more mainstream.

335
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,840
Okay.

336
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,660
You know, I, oh, I also watched the,
sorry, I'll look there was watch football.

337
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,960
I watch the fucking Falcon Saints.
Um,

338
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:07,360
I dunno what the fuck is going on in
the NFC south, but that take the over.

339
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,780
None of those teams are going to win.
Shit.

340
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,920
Did you see those two fucking guys and
like their twenties couldn't track,

341
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,630
couldn't tackle 39 year old drew Brees.

342
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,540
Okay.

343
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,110
I was,

344
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,950
that was fucking ridiculous that if that
was a boxing match you'd say was fixed.

345
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,620
Um, but today, right now I don't
know what Matt Ryan's Diet is,

346
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:31,580
but I want to be on it.

347
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,220
Okay.

348
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,050
That guy,
he's gotta be like in his thirties now.

349
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:39,070
He doesn't get his fucking face is
all taking it looks like an astronaut.

350
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,080
Yeah,

351
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,890
those guys always have nice faces cause
they spent so many years out there in

352
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:46,960
the fucking space and is like no gravity.

353
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,350
Okay.

354
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,920
That's going to be like the next thing
that rich people do is everybody else

355
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:55,400
gets poor. They're gonna, they're
gonna just orbit the earth.

356
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,350
It's really good for your face.

357
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,650
It is going to be up there just
flying around. We're like no gravity.

358
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,270
You know,

359
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,580
if you're rich you get botox.
But if you're super rich,

360
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:17,690
you orbit the planet and you very
young, you know, want wanted to do that.

361
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:21,410
Wanted to go to like Mars or something.
Didn't lance bass want to do that shit?

362
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,940
The fucking people out of their mind.
Don't you know?

363
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,520
You don't remember when
that teacher went up.

364
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,110
Okay.

365
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,060
Then you remember like how much balls
it takes to be a fucking astronaut.

366
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,720
You getting on top of a stick of
dynamite, Yadda. Your fucking mind.

367
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,400
Yeah.

368
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,350
That's like chuck Yeager.
Shit.

369
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,640
Some fucking guy in a toll booth
yell get in that thing. Oh will you?

370
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,130
I think it's almost like,
yeah,

371
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:57,060
it's like it's disrespectful to the
other fucking people you know. Did they,

372
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,780
did they put you in that centrifuge and
shit before you go on there to make sure

373
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:02,970
you're not going to be yacking
all the way to the fucking moon?

374
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,740
Could you imagine that? The first,
you know the first one? The first one,

375
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,150
okay.

376
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,480
Okay. That they send up there with a
bunch of civilians. There is going to be,

377
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:17,481
somebody is going to freak the fuck out
and I guarantee you they are going to,

378
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,810
they're going to, they're going
to have something, some soda,

379
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,980
some guy just runs down the island
and just like puts a syringe. Right.

380
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:30,060
Do Your fucking neck so you don't freak
everybody else out when it finally hits

381
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:32,130
you that you're leaving the planet.

382
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,650
Like God,

383
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,750
there is so many things that
scares the shit out of me.

384
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,060
Yeah.

385
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,060
But I got to admit when George Clooney
just spun off into space and that fucking

386
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:53,260
movie, whatever the hell it was,
but he was so nonchalant about it,

387
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:57,400
like I didn't care about his character
and he's just like, Oh yeah, look at that.

388
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:02,200
There's a Serengeti. Oh he's like at this
time of year and he just floated off.

389
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,160
They made them to heroic. All
right. Cause I don't give a fuck.

390
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,840
You know how much balls you have as an
astronaut and you do you have balls the

391
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:14,540
size of my fucking head, which is
huge. If you don't know who I am. Um,

392
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,300
did you never taking a gander at it?
Um, I don't give a fuck who you are.

393
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,830
You start slipping off into fucking space.

394
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,370
I don't care how fucking bad ass you are.

395
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,470
It is the second you lose your grip on
the space station and you start floating

396
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:34,840
off and the other people in there asleep
or some shit and you're just, that's it.

397
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,703
You're done.

398
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,800
Okay.

399
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
There's no way you just go like,
well you know I had a nice run.

400
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,760
I guess I'm going to set
the record rebated space.

401
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,170
You know you're not going to say that

402
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,690
it is going to be at the line.

403
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,200
It
just fucking gone.

404
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,600
That is a fucking lonely
ass God damn death.

405
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,050
Could I be saying more obvious shit?

406
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,910
Oh is it bill to slip off into
the fucking space by yourself?

407
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,390
Now what happens
when you're up there?

408
00:24:16,391 --> 00:24:19,680
Cause I know like some
fucking egg head figured out.

409
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,480
Okay,

410
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,650
why can I compliment them?

411
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,520
You know some guy who's way smarter than
I am somehow figured out that when you

412
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:27,780
went to space,

413
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,870
yeah,

414
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,820
because you are outside of the atmosphere.

415
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:34,640
The Sun's rays would be so god damn hot.

416
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,140
Yeah.

417
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,770
Your saliva would reach the boiling
point in your fucking mouth.

418
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,620
I remember that red bull guy when
he jumped, that was a problem,

419
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:47,390
like of his mass came off within, I don't
know how many seconds, like his, his,

420
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,570
he would lend,
it would go from like,

421
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,230
okay.

422
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,550
Hurdling through the atmosphere
with boiling water in your mouth.

423
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,100
Okay.

424
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,371
I mean,

425
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,610
you might as well get shot right directly
up your asshole with lightening at

426
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:04,250
that point that they just
make the Trifecta of horror.

427
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,513
MMM.

428
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,180
Hey,
remember the hole in the ozone layer?

429
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:12,220
How come they never fucking
talk about that anymore?

430
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,480
Is that thing going?
Do they fix it?

431
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,080
Oh my God.

432
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,760
I actually came up with an idea for a
fucking movie that I think you could make

433
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:30,700
a trilogy out of.

434
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,630
Okay.

435
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,430
And it's so ridiculous.
I'm actually,

436
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,490
rather than just saying it or
doing a fucking bit about it,

437
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,410
I actually just registered it,

438
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,920
registered it at the fucking writers'
guild on the way from the airport.

439
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,693
Okay.

440
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,400
Popped in there really quick.
It just fucking knocked it out.

441
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,933
MMM.

442
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,290
It's so like coming up with
this Scifi movie right now.

443
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,120
For some reason it's just really easy
because I feel like we're, we're,

444
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,140
we're there,

445
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,233
you know,

446
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,030
just all the shit that's fucking coming
out. All this shit that we're fucking up.

447
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,123
Nope.

448
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,910
60 years ago you had to
use your imagination,

449
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,940
you know ray guns and fucking pocket
doors that opened up what the Hedy,

450
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:21,820
your fucking body, whatever
happened on Star Trek, right.

451
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,503
MMM.

452
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,150
Teleporting and all of that shit you had
to like use your fucking imagination.

453
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:30,170
Now it's just like,
you know,

454
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,570
which skyping with each other.
Men Say Shit they did on Star Trek.

455
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,560
So I don't think it's that hard now to,

456
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,500
well actually you gotta be
ahead of the game. Right.

457
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,330
You know,
I haven't got an unlimited

458
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,560
would say this script is going to suck.

459
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,820
I'm probably going to
need some help with it.

460
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,183
Okay.

461
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:48,790
Yeah.

462
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,090
How funny it would be if I actually made
like a killer fucking trilogy of Phi

463
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,630
fucking movies and then every
other year when the movie came out,

464
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:59,610
I'd have to go to like fucking comic con.

465
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,250
That thing that I'd made fun
of so many fucking times.

466
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,620
I will actually went to it this year.
I had a great time.

467
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:08,520
People were actually cool. You know,
it's just fun to, I dunno what it is.

468
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,010
Isn't it fun to just make fun
of Shit that everybody likes?

469
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,880
Everybody gets all excited about something
and you just get to be a cunt. Um,

470
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,410
tickets are on sale for a, the all
things comedy festival. By the way.

471
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:26,400

473
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,090
all things comedy than
I am a small part of a,

474
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:37,290
we signed a deal with comedy central
to do four one hour specials,

475
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,660
the first one being Mr. Paul Versey.

476
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,410
Then we're going to do three other
killer ones for them next year.

477
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,820
We got some stuff in the works.

478
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:47,970
We're slowly becoming a little
fucking entity here, you know?

479
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,700
Oh freckles. He's built in
his own little kiosk out here.

480
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,290
That's how I view this business.

481
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,770
I view it like a giant fucking mall and
I got this little store right in the

482
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:01,680
middle. He knows once you walk by
and the guy is a little helicopter,

483
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,400
things that fly, you know which
cells key change. That's me.

484
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,700
I ain't fucking with Lord
and Taylor. Um, anyways,

485
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,210
plowing ahead and let me, let me
read, uh, uh, some of the, uh,

486
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:20,070
the advert or smudge the adverts.
It was something I wanted to go off on,

487
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:23,280
but I'm not going to fucking,
I'm not gonna fucking throw him.

488
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,330
I would just say this, you
know, uh, I can't fucking say.

489
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,470
You can't fucking say anything anymore.
He just, he gets fucking get in trouble.

490
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,670
You know,
there was a certain somebody on a certain,

491
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:38,240
something that was telling
people what they should have,

492
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:43,241
shouldn't be fucking saying in the same
business that this person was in and was

493
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:47,370
just like, wait, you know,
are you advocating censorship?

494
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,880
This is such a weird fucking,
these are lefties, lefties.

495
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,840
Um,
anyways,

496
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,510
is there anything worse than k?

497
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,700
When somebody does that?

498
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,270
There should be an APP.
You know

499
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,840
that if you ever Satan k like,
like so out of nowhere,

hall cans, but it's like padded,

You're right in the face.

502

another human being. Mm. Kay.

503
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,720
Um, bookie, my, unless you're a

505
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,160
ever since I started this podcast,
people had been asking me for advice.

506
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,360
Ask me what team to bet on. The truth
is, I don't know who's going to win.

507
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,860
Certainly not this fucking year.

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,060
I've definitely talked about that.
They do have fun new prints every month.

587
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:17,670
Three times softer than cotton. I Dunno.
I have no idea. I just know my junk happy.

588
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,170
Okay. Well my junks happy. I get
a little spring in my step kids,

589
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:25,860
my wife on the cheek. It puts
everybody in a good mood. You know,

590
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,370
if I wear regular underwear and exceed,
I'm slapping the parakeet.

591
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,280
Everything's fucking,
it's just off in the house.

592
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,450
Yeah.

593
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,100
I fucking hate people that own birds.

594
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,323
You know what I mean?

595
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,050
It's not bad to own a dog.
Thinks fucking stupid.

596
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:43,820
Was he go out there in the world? You
know, you can't let the fucking thing out.

597
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,120
It's too dumb.
You took all the wolf out of it,

598
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:48,763
right?

599
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,550
Yeah. The cat cats fucking
annoying. You know what I mean?

600
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,040
It comes and goes like a hookah.
Um,

601
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,320
Shit's all over the house and I
understand keeping that thing,

602
00:34:59,321 --> 00:35:02,200
but a fucking bird man. It's supposed
to be out there flying around.

603
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,373
Okay.

604
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,530
You got the thing sitting in a god.

605
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,150
It is something about a bird in a
fucking cage. It makes me just wait.

606
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,280
I gotta finish this copy here.
It's, it really bothers me. Um,

607
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,660
and I would never slap a parakeet.
All right.

608
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,160
I'd flick it right and it's fucking beak.

their ass as well. They're,

for the week. Moto GP. Hey Bill,

664
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:31,680
I haven't heard you talk about
the guy in the moto g a moto race.

665
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:32,790
Who gripped the other guy?

666
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,360
Other racers breaks in
the middle of the race.

667
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:38,650
How the fuck did he do that?

668
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,380
Maybe I had my headphones out while some
shit head I work with felt it necessary

669
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,570
to tell me about his weekend.
I don't give a shit about,

670
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,670
but would love to hear your
thoughts on the incident.

671
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:53,050
I gotta I gotta check this out.
Here we go. Let's search here.

672
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,710
Modot modot modot fucking
GP Moto GP breaks.

673
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:06,000
Oh, break grab. There it
is. Let's see what we got.

674
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,500
You know what I was just sitting there.
Do you remember Super Fuzz, that movie?

675
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,390
And then they were in the transition
between one seat to another. They had the,

676
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:18,900
the background singers. They
go super, super, super, super,

677
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:23,160
super. Um, all right. Yeah.

678
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,220
Did this guy get banned for life? You
could fucking kill somebody doing that.

679
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,500
The caption literally says,
the guy's going like, he
wanted to kill me. All right.

680
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,250
I have to sit through a fucking
ad. Oh, and of course here we go.

681
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,100
Your ad will play.
Your video will play after this ad.

682
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,580
Remember the Internet when it didn't
have a bunch of ads, you know,

683
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:45,600
that was a great fucking time. Now they
just, they just punish you. I mean,

684
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:48,990
it's not as bad as listening to me read
ads and you always have the option of

685
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:52,980
fast 40 through mine. He's fucking
assholes. While let me do it. Come on.

686
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:53,880
I want to see it.

687
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:01,360
I want to see it. All right. This is
gonna take too long, unfortunately.

688
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,880
But this fucking guy grabbed onto was,

689
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,630
I don't want your fucking channels.
Fuck we meet alone.

690
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,100
You don't know he's a fuck. I mean,
when you're on the plane and the,

691
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,360
and the and the, they shut off your
movie to do a God damn commercial,

692
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,210
but some who the fuck is going
to sign up for a credit card?

693
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,330
60,000 free air miles.

694
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,650
That's enough to get you from here to
Chile and Bagley. Say all this dumb shit.

695
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:30,460
It's like, yeah, but you're not going to
let me do it. So what's the difference?

696
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,480
Right? I'll only be able to use
these during like the winter months.

697
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,670
You'll let me fly to fucking Alaska.
What is pitch black out? All right.

698
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,710
Evidently there's can't grab this
guy's fucking breaks. What happened?

699
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,820
I don't want to blame the victim,
but what in God's name did this guy do?

700
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,120
Moto GP. Grape break grab. I just have to,

701
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,400
let me just read about it here.

702
00:40:59,210 --> 00:40:59,380
Okay.

703
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,240
Moto GP rider grabs competitors
break at 140 miles an hour.

704
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,030
This guy should be arrested.

705
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,220
How the fuck did he think that
no one was going to see this?

706
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,920
Does he realize it's televised?

707
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,810
Oh my God.
What a fucking asshole.

708
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,130
That's like right out of Wrestlemania
and the ref didn't see it.

709
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,300
Holy Shit. That guy's an amazing
writer. W that was his front brake to,

710
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,080
well I guess they always use the front
brake. It's a back. You don't want to use,

711
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:37,920
I don't know shit about motorcycles.
All right.

712
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:42,930
This grace mode to rider
Romano for naughty,

713
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:47,030
all the Italian. Ah, Jesus.
Then you know, at this finally,

714
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:48,620
no mob shows on TV.

715
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:51,860
They would turn in their fucking
reputation around and this guy's,

716
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,600
he's got to go full soprano on him.

717
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,420
The guy deservedly lost his spot
on the Marinelli snipers team.

718
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:02,660
All they kicked him off the team after
he attempt to one of the more dangerous

719
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:07,340
stunts we'll see in
competitive racing. Ah, man,

720
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:10,810
he's 22 years old. He's a fucking
hothead. He just ruined his career. Uh,

721
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,980
boy has fun.

722
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:16,220
Any road beside competitors
to Farnum Monsey.

723
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,960
I wonder if there's any history between
these two families. You never, no kidding.

724
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,670
At the San Marino GP.

725
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:28,671
The 22 year old reached out and grab
man sees break at 140 miles an hour.

726
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,000
Luckily man's,

727
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:36,001
he didn't fall off his bike and
Finetti's is it fanatics antiques were

728
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:41,310
completely called for.
That's one of the worst sentences.

729
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,400
Luckily Mansi didn't fall off his bike.
Oh,

730
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:48,600
as for Nannies,
antiques were completely uncalled for.

731
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,650
Phonetic was shown the black flag and
disqualified from the race for attempting

732
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:54,810
to harm an opponent.

733
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,190
While he was banned for two races
and fired from his team fanatic,

734
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:03,360
he thought the penalty was unfair.
Still,

735
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:06,480
he added that he had no
plans to race again. What

736
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,600
wow,

737
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,870
the world is. That world is close
to me. I'll not race any more.

738
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:19,830
He said an interview he
granted to the Lara Publica.

739
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,410
It isn't my world. There is. There's too
much injustice. I was wrong. That is true,

740
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,700
but nobody cares about my pain.
I was in a real man.

741
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,620
I was unable to control my anger, but
Mansi could have killed me too. Well,

742
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:36,780
what happened before that?
Dude, I'm telling you,

743
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:41,370
this is why you have to get into racing.
I, it's like the real housewives for men.

744
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,460
These fucking guys like how
mad they fucking get at each
other in the petty shit.

745
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,120
That's not really petty. But like
days of thunder, all of that,

746
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,030
you watch that movie, you like
Alice again, this is fucking silly.

747
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,650
Like that shit really goes down.

748
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:58,460
Okay.

749
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,560
I guess it's better than a car cause she
could fucking slam into people. It's,

750
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,550
you know, for some reason that's
not considered attempted murder.

751
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,120
MMM.
Wow.

752
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,710
I guess maybe because I have a temper,

753
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:16,711
I feel bad for that guy or also maybe
because I went after a dream and made it

754
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:19,690
come true and that kid did too,
and he just fucked up his dream.

755
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,660
I actually on some level feel bad for him,

756
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,753
uh,

757
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,460
that he's, maybe he was just emotional
after the fucking race and just said,

758
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:29,420
I'm done.
You know?

759
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,223
Uh,

760
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,040
I hope it just wasn't cause
he just couldn't beat the guy.

761
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:39,810
The guy was always getting
the best of them. You know,
many, we pulled like a bill.

762
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,260
Laimbeer you're like those players
whatsoever while you're better than me,

763
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:45,510
so I'm just going to wait till you leave
your feet and I'm just gonna take your

764
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:49,650
fucking legs out. That's still on
my favorite things of all time,

765
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:54,410
Bill and beer saying we tried to play
a mind game. It's like, you know, like,

766
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,310
like there was a lot of
layers to that. It's like, no,

767
00:44:56,311 --> 00:45:00,630
you're just out there hurting
people. Um, all right.

768
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:05,430
Football and pizza. Oh
my God. Oh Jesus Christ.

769
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,880
This is one of the best ones ever.
Hey Yo, Billy colorless calves.

770
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,260
There's never been a truer statement.
My legs, I swear to you, they, they,

771
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:19,020
they are the color of milk.
Um,

772
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,630
I'm happy you're enjoying
getting in shape.

773
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,530
Most people don't get past
the first week of eating, uh,

774
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,850
eating well and a,
and it's a shame because it,

775
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:33,540
all it takes is one good week of
clean food and breaking a sweat. Well,

776
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:36,660
not if you like a hundred
pounds overweight, but I
know what you mean. He said,

777
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:40,770
I started doing long distance biking in
my twenties. You know what's hilarious?

778
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:45,390
I just had my bike fixed up.
I bought a bike in 1983 that I still have,

779
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:49,050
I bought a 12 speed with
my paper route money. Um,

780
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:50,590
okay.

781
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,330
I was 15 years old.

782
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,470
Yeah,

783
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,580
and I, I quit the my paper route the
year before, I think. I don't think, no,

784
00:45:57,581 --> 00:45:58,660
I don't think I did.

785
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:03,550
I went from having a paper
route to have a part time job.

786
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:08,551
I do remember that I had a paper from
third grade to ninth grade and then I had

787
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,010
to sign a form or something

788
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,120
because I was too young to work
on. No. Then I started caddying.

789
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,600
I was a caddy for awhile. Did that
feel like a fucking year or something?

790
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:27,390
Then I just started. I always had a
job. It was great. I always had money.

791
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:30,660
The worst fucking thing
in the world now is that

792
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,830
little boys and girls,
they can't be taking,

793
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,850
they can't be paper boys and girls
anymore. It was the fucking best.

794
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:43,410
He didn't have to hit your parents
up from, I just, I had fucking money.

795
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:44,490
Do you understand that?

796
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:45,950
Okay.

797
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:50,690
I was making like eight, nine, 10
bucks a week when I was in third grade.

798
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:51,770
Okay.

799
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,560
I mean I was stuffing it in the walls.
I had like no overhead.

800
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:58,930
I mean I went the fuck was I going
to spend it on football cards.

801
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,980
That's what I spent it on.

802
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,520
And I had a little bank and I
just stuffed it in there and uh,

803
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:09,430
anytime I wanted something, if I,
if I wanted to, uh, I used to like,

804
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,110
I had a job and I was so young. Then when
I had a job I would buy toys with it.

805
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,680
I Buy Football Cards and candy,

806
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,880
soda and all that Shit.
I just was fucking great.

807
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,450
Or one time I rode my bike all the way
to fucking Mcdonald's with a buddy of

808
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:35,830
mine. We both lied to our parents. We were
riding down a fucking two lane highway.

809
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,400
Nobody reported us cause
there was no phones, you know,

810
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,540
we drove all the way down there
and when didn't,

811
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,030
it was the coolest fucking thing I've
been at. Parents had no fucking idea.

812
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:52,900
I was exhausted because it was one town
over and I just had this little piece of

813
00:47:52,901 --> 00:47:57,770
shit read coaster bike. Um,
and then when I got older I,

814
00:47:57,771 --> 00:48:01,120
I then I, I had, uh, I had
the Raleigh Beach Rambler.

815
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,350
I remember I pointed the bike as I thought
it looked fucking stupid because they

816
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:09,010
had white wall tires on it. And I pointed
on it and laughed and my dad was like,

817
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:13,030
oh, I liked that you liked that? And I
was afraid of him, so I just said, yeah,

818
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,780
but this bike I didn't like and that
everybody made fun of me at these giant

819
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:21,490
peewee Herman fucking tires on it.
But then one day,

820
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,820
you know, we ride down the hill and
everyone was slamming on the brakes.

821
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:27,190
Like that's what you did for fun
to see it look sort of skid mark,

822
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:30,070
you could leave.
The tires was so fucking big.

823
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,270
Everybody else's just went like that.
When my skin,

824
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,560
it actually sounded like a car. I went
yep. And everybody thought it was cool,

825
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:43,720
but it had the big fat ass
fucking seed on it. Um,

826
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:49,060
but I had a paper route and it's
fucking snowed out and, you know, rain,

827
00:48:49,061 --> 00:48:52,990
sleet or snow, you had to look,
deliver the paper. And Mine, uh,

828
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,970
delivered the Herald and then I
delivered the Boston Globe. And, uh,

829
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,240
I remember the kid down the street,
he had the, he had the coveted route.

830
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:04,870
There was used to be this paper called
the Patriot ledger and it was an

831
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,390
afternoon paper that makes
any fucking sense. Um,

832
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,780
and it reported on,

833
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:15,580
I guess I don't know what the stories
that the other papers already reported on.

834
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,360
How am I, how they had advanced over
the last, I don't know how many hours,

835
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:22,030
whatever. So anyways, uh,

836
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:27,090
he had it and it was a Monday through
Friday fucking route and it was like,

837
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:31,780
that thing was with the holy grail
of paper routes in my neighborhood.

838
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,320
And the oldest brother got it and he
passed it onto his next brother. It's,

839
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:40,660
it's stayed, they had like three boys
and they all had the fucking route.

840
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,820
And the youngest kid was my age,

841
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:45,730
so there was no way to ever
get the fucking paper route.

842
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,680
So we had the globe, Harold's
first, then the Boston Globe,

843
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,950
and that thing was seven days a week,
three 65.

844
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,980
And I had from third grade to a,

845
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,810
yeah, ninth grade. And I, I don't think,

846
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:08,500
I haven't missed a day unless
I had a ruptured appendix.

847
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:14,020
I messed up a couple of weeks that time
and we took a family trip one time when

848
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:18,340
I was a kid and, uh, and I remember
it's sucked. You'd come back,

849
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,380
these fucking asshole adults would do
your route and he just, you know, I said,

850
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:24,160
put it in the door.
It was always dry.

851
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,070
They would put a fucking rubber band
around it and elastic, whatever,

852
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,470
fuck you call it. And they
would just drive down the
street and fucking throw it.

853
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,530
You get all these complaints and everyone
would get mad at you and all this shit.

854
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:38,480
Um, so anyways, I ended, I saved
up my money and I bought that unit.

855
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:43,190
They get new ovo sport, right.
Really Nice fucking bike. And um,

856
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:44,800
okay.

857
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,470
I Dunno,
my parents never threw it out.

858
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,590
And I came home one day in my
thirties and I saw it. I was like,

859
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:55,300
I'm gonna fucking take that thing. All
right. Because, and you just, you know,

860
00:50:55,301 --> 00:50:58,330
represents something to
me. Working hard, you know,

861
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,420
then if you work hard,
you get stuff right.

862
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:06,250
So I fucking got that thing and it was
all like originals and all that shit and

863
00:51:06,251 --> 00:51:06,671
I just,

864
00:51:06,671 --> 00:51:09,850
it just fucking finally died on me
from years of fucking riding and stuff.

865
00:51:09,851 --> 00:51:13,000
And I decided, um, our guests
sitting in my parents' garage,

866
00:51:13,001 --> 00:51:15,520
I decided that I was going to fix it
up and I finally brought it over to

867
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:16,354
somebody.

868
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,500
It literally costs me almost the same
amount of money that the bike cost me in

869
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:22,670
like 1983 when I bought it. And, uh,

870
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,410
I want to get back to riding. I just
have to find where you can ride in La.

871
00:51:26,411 --> 00:51:29,860
That's like safe. I know what the
Santa Monica you can and fucking, uh,

872
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,253
mmm.

873
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,270
I don't know, maybe some of
the parks along the La River,

874
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:39,870
but I always feel like you're gonna meet
some fucking serial killer down there.

875
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:44,810
You know, I'll get attacked by a fucking
mountain lion. Ellie is a weird place. Um,

876
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:47,310
so anyways, let me get back. And I
used to ride that thing when I got,

877
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,080
when I got older,
when I was 21.

878
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,320
Yeah.

879
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,400
I got into the best shape of my
fucking life. Uh, 80 shape, you know,

880
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:55,480
so no squats.

881
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:59,110
But what I did for legs was I rode the
bike and I used to ride 11 miles every

882
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,230
day, Monday through Friday, after working
in a warehouse. That's how young I was.

883
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,690
I had the energy to do that.

884
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:07,960
And on the weekends I would write 18 miles
and I would take one fucking day off.

885
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,753
MMM.

886
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,830
Needless to say,
I won't be doing that again.

887
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,550
I'll fucking take a little
five mile. John's on the
left. One fucking level land.

888
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,490
All right. Sorry. That was in
my entire history with bicycles.

889
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,830
Bikes used to be a big fucking deal,
by the way.

890
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,650
I don't think they're big deals
to kids anymore. Who is freedom?

891
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:28,500
He just fucking left.
You'd find other kids.

892
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:33,120
He just fucking wrote around did
shit. You know? I don't know.

893
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,610
I started doing long distance biking.
He said in my twenties,

894
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:39,420
I was never in bad shape, but I certainly
wasn't in as good as shape as I am now.

895
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,620
Having said all that,

896
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:44,640
I really hope that once this year you
are able to order yourself a pizza crack

897
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:48,870
open a highlife and watch nine hours
of football. Yeah, that sounds perfect.

898
00:52:48,871 --> 00:52:52,620
He said none of the hypothetical.
Uh, what would you be,

899
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,160
what would be your combination of
pizza and beer for that occasion? Uh,

900
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:01,470
I go with a local joint here in
Massachusetts, originally from Cleveland.

901
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,050
Go browns.
Congratulations on your victory.

902
00:53:04,051 --> 00:53:08,130
He said Anna Killian's Irish red
a beer that no one drinks anymore,

903
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:09,120
but it's delicious.

904
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,980
MMM.

905
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,230
I gotta be honest with
you. I am, I am male.

906
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:20,110
I am white trash when it comes to beer.
If I could find it,

907
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:20,921
you know what I would do?

908
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:25,921
The first beer I ever got drunk
off of was a Michelob light there.

909
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,440
My pizza spot was in Stoughton,
Massachusetts, the town spa.

910
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:36,230
So I'd have one of their pizzas.
I rarely have a plain one

911
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,210
extra crispy, whatever they do,
you know, well done. And, uh,

912
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:46,140
I would have a Michelob light and I'd
have it in one of those giant fucking

913
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:51,030
goblets that they used to have at the
end of the Miller lite commercials. Um,

914
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,750
less fill in? No. Was it less
filling? Tastes great. That's right.

915
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,670
That's what I would do. Um,
New York, my pizza spot,

916
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,120
I haven't lived there a long time. The
pizza place, I used to go to his right,

917
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:07,940
right next to danger fields cause I would
always ended in that spot and I would

918
00:54:07,941 --> 00:54:10,400
go, it was Sutton pizza,
I think it was called.

919
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:14,300
And I always thought that they had a
nice sauce and the cheese was on it in a,

920
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:18,770
complimented the sauce rather than
destroying even being able to taste that

921
00:54:18,771 --> 00:54:23,180
there was any sort of sauce there. Uh,
but I know there's a bunch of, you know,

922
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:24,770
I haven't lived there in
like fucking 11 years,

923
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:28,880
so I have no idea what everybody liked
that Joe's pizza down the village was a

924
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:33,110
big one. Um, but I dunno, I liked
that. That Sutton pizza man.

925
00:54:33,111 --> 00:54:37,290
I fucking like that shit. All
right. Old podcast question. Ah,

926
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,860
dear Billy. Been doing it forever, uh,

927
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,940
was listening to a throwback
on the Thursday podcast.

928
00:54:43,941 --> 00:54:47,150
Great taste in music by
the way. Uh, that's Andrew.

929
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,290
That's his taste in music. If you listen
to mine, it would just be like, yeah,

930
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,440
it'd be bunch of hair metal.

931
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,730
And I was wondering if your feelings
have changed on downloading music and

932
00:54:58,731 --> 00:55:03,110
movies illegally. You are ranting
on and on how terrible it is.

933
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,350
And I'm too young to remember
that controversy. I'm 20,

934
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,310
but you had me convinced it was
certainly illegal and not cool.

935
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,940
Um,
I dunno if it was ever a legal,

936
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:18,680
what happened was the technology came
about that you could do it. Uh, anyways,

937
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:22,390
it said something said he had naps.

938
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,310
My friend said he had Napster
in high school and everyone did.

939
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,250
Maybe you said your older brother,
you left out that word.

940
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:33,080
I guess it's like looking at celebrity
leaks. Celebrity nude photos.

941
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,110
Yeah, it's wrong. But who doesn't
want to get a glimpse of that?

942
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,000
I never look at those fucking things,

943
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,340
but somebody hacks somebodies phone there.
Text messages or emails.

944
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:46,780
That's none of my fucking businessman.
I see.

945
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,550
I really can't believe like
what fucking voyeurs people are.

946
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,700
I don't give a shit what anybody does.
You know,

947
00:55:52,701 --> 00:55:56,030
and I don't give a fuck what you said
on your phone. And I think if, you know,

948
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,840
like if somebody ever like, oh, can
you believe this person texted this?

949
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:02,120
This is offensive. It's like,
well they didn't text it to you.

950
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,900
They texted privately to somebody else.
You're not supposed to be reading that.

951
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,960
Don't read other people's text messages.
You won't get fucking offended.

952
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:12,500
You have no idea what the tone of
that was. This could be a joke.

953
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:14,300
This could be dead serious,
no fucking idea.

954
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,130
And even still it's like reading stuff,

955
00:56:16,131 --> 00:56:18,680
but I love reading somebody
else's mail is fucking illegal.

956
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:22,870
But like hacking someone's phone is
fine. I have no idea. Anyways, um,

957
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,600
I guess the only part that I thought you
might have changed your mind on is how

958
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:31,620
people around the world have heard you,
cause they got it illegally.

959
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,030
Listening to your podcast helps me
sort out my feelings on lots of things,

960
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,050
but also your points make me realize that
the world's has virtually no black or

961
00:56:40,051 --> 00:56:43,050
white issue as well. If you're talking
about my podcast, my podcast is free.

962
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,253
MMM.

963
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,010
But I would say,
um,

964
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:51,060
okay.

965
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,540
Has it changed? Yeah,
I still pay for music.

966
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:55,643
MMM.

967
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,180
I go to a iTunes is where I do it.

968
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,080
I don't like those streaming services
because they fuck over the musicians and I

969
00:57:03,081 --> 00:57:06,230
know app I iTunes, they just fuck
him over, man. It's ridiculous.

970
00:57:06,231 --> 00:57:08,570
Itunes does it too. But like
I know, like one of them,

971
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:11,930
I remember they were talking about me
possibly streaming my, one of my albums,

972
00:57:11,931 --> 00:57:16,610
they're like, yeah, for every
thousand plays we'll give you a,

973
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:20,810
we'll give you a half a cent.
It's like, go fuck yourself.

974
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,350
They had all his advertising and
shit on the side and everything.

975
00:57:24,351 --> 00:57:27,320
So they getting all this credit and
making all this fucking money and then

976
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,850
you're not even roll in a penny towards
me there that shopping it in half and

977
00:57:31,851 --> 00:57:35,420
then sliding it across the fucking table.
Um,

978
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:40,100
I will say like, you know, I don't
police a lot of shit too much on youtube.

979
00:57:40,101 --> 00:57:43,400
I should probably do that more.
But um,

980
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,130
okay.

981
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,200
You know, I definitely saw the
advantages. You know, when I went to, uh,

982
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,190
when I went over to Europe,

983
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,780
I gave up my DVDs for free and told
people to upload them onto their youtube

984
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:57,350
pages because I wanted to get into the,
you know,

985
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,580
different language areas on youtube.
You know,

986
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:05,090
cause I one time I was trying
to learn to play the rhythm, um,

987
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,670
diverse section of walk this
way on the good on the guitar.

988
00:58:07,671 --> 00:58:10,730
And the only guy did a lesson was a
French guy and I clicked on his fucking

989
00:58:10,731 --> 00:58:14,300
video and then all of a sudden all my
videos to the right word in French and I

990
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:16,640
was like, wow, what part
of youtube has this?

991
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,840
So when I went to Norway and Sweden
and all those, I was like, you know,

992
00:58:20,841 --> 00:58:24,590
put clips to this up on your page.
I don't give a fuck. You know,

993
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,930
it's on Pirate Bay anyways.
What the fuck do I care?

994
00:58:26,931 --> 00:58:31,670
I might as well get in on this somehow.
So I kind of had to roll with it. But, um,

995
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:33,530
okay.

996
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:37,810
No, I, it's, it's still stealing, but
I pay for all my movies. I paid for a,

997
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,140
now that isn't necessarily true
though. There'll be a few, like I try,

998
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:43,340
I try to pay for movies.

999
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:48,341
Like if I go on like a Netflix and it
isn't there and I can't find it playing on

1000
00:58:50,031 --> 00:58:53,450
cable, you know, and it's something
I really want to fucking see.

1001
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,920
I will watch a movie for free.
I'll let, I'll admit that I,

1002
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:58,820
I've definitely done that shit.
Hey,

1003
00:58:58,821 --> 00:59:02,390
here's something I want to speak into
that I actually watched a couple of movies

1004
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,460
when I was on the plane there.

1005
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:06,263
MMM.

1006
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,640
I gotta I gotta show. I
gotta get a shout out to, uh,

1007
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:14,360
you know what sucks is
one of the fucking movies.

1008
00:59:14,361 --> 00:59:19,361
I can't even remember the name of the
movie and I really fucking enjoyed it.

1009
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,730
Um, fuck. What the hell was I?

1010
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:31,040
I literally watched it's,
Oh, something. Was it Gringo?

1011
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,110
Is that the name of the fucking movie?

1012
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,820
Charlie's Daren was in it and
she was fucking hilarious.

1013
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,010
And her character was, was fucking, I love
the movie. Absolutely loved the movie.

1014
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,580
Um, let's see. Gringo,

1015
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:51,470
Charlie's Theron, right? Is
that the name of the movie?

1016
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:55,430
Did I get it right? Yeah.
Gringo. Check that one out.

1017
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,870
Love that movie. And then I saw a, Oh
fuck. I gotta answer this. Hang on.

1018
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,810
All right, I'm back. Uh, so anyways,

1019
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:07,840
then I watched this other movie called
superfly and was fucking blown away.

1020
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,820
Like I couldn't get the fucking,

1021
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,420
all the actors names and there was so
many great actors and there was this kid,

1022
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,900
I hope it says name it.

1023
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,360
It's k a l a n Kr Walker collide.

1024
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:25,400
Kaylon I'll buy say right K or walk to
fucking white to get it right. Walker. He,

1025
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:29,210
his character was so fucking good.
I don't want to ruin the movie.

1026
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:35,600
I just thought the last time you saw him
should have been more of an event with

1027
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:36,830
how good his performance was.

1028
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:41,831
And then the kid who played Superfly's
righthand man was fucking great.

1029
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:47,660
Uh, I, I don't know how to do this without
ruining the fucking move. Sony. Oh,

1030
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:51,380
it's just, it's a really
fun fucking movie. Um,

1031
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,330
I've seen some good ones lately, but, uh,
you know, I'm writing this fucking script.

1032
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:58,040
I got into the whole world
are writing scripts now.

1033
01:00:58,041 --> 01:01:00,890
So now I'm actually watching movies.
I'm trying to find people,

1034
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,820
just remember them.
Oh, were in, in Gringo.

1035
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:08,180
That the fucking dude who played the
guys accountant in the beginning was

1036
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:12,890
fucking great. Uh, everybody
in that movie was great.

1037
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:16,220
So check those out, man. I hope I'm not
doing this shit where I saw it on a plane.

1038
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,300
So you're just like, this is fucking
great. It's taken up two and a half hours,

1039
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,730
but these were legit could find,
I think. I think they'll hold up.

1040
01:01:22,731 --> 01:01:25,240
Even if you just hanging
out at your house, you know,

1041
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,850
with your fucking virtual reality glasses
and whatever the fucking internet porn

1042
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,680
you're watching, I think you
can get through them. All right.

1043
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:33,350
Those are my recommendations from movies.
Uh,

1044
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:38,270
congratulations to the
fucking lions, man. A huge,

1045
01:01:38,271 --> 01:01:42,650
huge fucking victory for
you guys. He turned around.
I'm liking seeing, you know,

1046
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:44,480
the chiefs and all these,
these teams being, I mean,

1047
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:49,370
I obviously don't want the patriots
run to ever fucking end and uh,

1048
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:52,550
I've enjoyed the hell out of it.
And you know, I remember coming up,

1049
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:55,640
it was all about the cowboys and Steelers
and I remember thinking when the fucks

1050
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:59,690
our time and so when we finally had
our time, I enjoyed the whole thing.

1051
01:01:59,691 --> 01:02:04,460
I hope it's not over. Um,
but if it is, you know,

1052
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:08,030
it fucking is and I'll be happy for the
rest of my fucking life is what I mean.

1053
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:08,630
What am I going to do?

1054
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:13,100
I'm going to bitch about fucking 10 11
championships straight across the fucking

1055
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:16,370
board in a 15 year period.
It was incredible.

1056
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,010
But the red sox is still coming,
you know, who knows. Good

1057
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,410
keep could keep going on the
Celtics look fucking good.

1058
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,780
I still believe in the Patriots so,
but uh,

1059
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:29,781
it is a lot of fun to see all these
different teams doing well and I'm like

1060
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:35,580
beyond excited to see the next
Brown's game cause I want to see this.

1061
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:39,990
Baker may feel kids.
See if he lights it up again.

1062
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,600
That's exciting. All right.
That's it. That's the podcast.

1063
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:47,820
Have a great couple of days. I'll
check on Thursday. Go fuck yourselves.
