1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,651
Hey,

2
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:05,490
what's going on is bill burn is time for
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,210
October 10th,
2016 Jesus Christ.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,260
Holy Shit.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,310
That's what,
who else yelled at near Knoxville,

6
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,460
Tennessee when they'd running back
fumbled the ball and your quarterback is

7
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,680
trying to, God bless them. It's
trying to pick the ball up.

8
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:28,860
Why won't they fall on the fucking ball?

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,400
Everybody's just like, oh, I can
pick it up and then run with it.

10
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:36,080
Just fall the fucking thing.
It's not,

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,510
it's the shape of the fucking ball too.
Even if you fall on it,

12
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:43,440
it somehow fucking squirts out. Oh,
he'd die. 1,000 deaths is three. I was,

13
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:47,970
this street thinks that have probably
brought me closer as far as sports goes,

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,940
just generally speaking,
week after week,

15
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,880
like a bad cigarette or
drinking fucking problem. Right.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,510
The three fucking plays that get me.
I don't know what gets you.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,670
I don't pretend to know who you are and
I would never speak to me however I am

18
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:07,410
willing to share with you or
what the fuck did I just do?

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,580
There it is. Sorry. I swear
to God, I can't get this
fucking thing to do anything,

20
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:15,840
but if I brush up against anything,
the whole fucking screen disappears.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,040
You don't need people who suck at playing
video games. You know what I mean?

22
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,450
If you play playing like
one of those five games,

23
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,440
the other guy's kicking your ass.

24
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,630
You just start fucking hitting a million
of them and all of a sudden like these,

25
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,540
these clouds started forming around
your guy and he does a little fucking,

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,220
I dunno, spinning back fist with his foot,
whatever the fuck that's called. Right.

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,020
Um, that's what it happens to me
with computers. And then I then I,

28
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,810
you never know how you just did
it. Everybody was like, Oh shit,

29
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:44,790
what the fuck is that? I don't, I don't
know. So anyways, the three things,

30
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,610
how's this for controlling my add?
I'm going to stick with this year.

31
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,780
The three going to get back to it.

32
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:51,960
The three fucking things
that just make me die.

33
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:56,940
1,000 deaths is deaths.
Plural. Yes. Is um,

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,700
cause 1000 is more than
one. Stay on target, Bill.

35
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,300
Stay focused is not falling on a fumble,

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,610
dropping, you know, catching a
fucking ball run into the end zone,

37
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:11,490
returning upon returning to kickoff,
running with the fucking bank.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,390
Banks rarely do this.

39
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,780
It's always fucking receivers
and people who returned kicks,

40
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,670
I think they called kick returners
for whatever fucking reasons. Reason.

41
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,130
I don't understand why
these motherfuckers,

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,880
they get to write to the goal
line and then they booked.

43
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,630
They just drop it right on the half
yard line as if they bet the under.

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,870
That kills me.
Like how many?

45
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:38,100
Like you would think like the first time
you saw somebody do that, you'd be like,

46
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,770
Oh my God, I'm never fucking,
that's not going to be me.

47
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,820
I'm going to run to the back
of the fucking end zone.
Then I'll fucking spike it.

48
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,970
I'll drop it. I'll do my little fucking
moonwalk. Whatever the fuck it is.

49
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,190
All right. The freckled,
Fandango, whatever. My end
zone dance would be called.

50
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,240
I mean on Fandango means, I just know
it's an old Kevin Costner movie. Um,

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,690
okay.
That and then finally,

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,150
okay.

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,710
My favorite in yours, the prevent
defense. The fucking privilege giveaway.

54
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:08,281
The Mill,

55
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:12,810
Allah will give him a fucking 30 yard
cushion and rather than them scoring on us

56
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,540
on one play,
they'll score in five places.

57
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,380
But the amount of clock that they're
going to eat up versus the points that

58
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:23,880
they're going to score is slowly going to
kill everybody in our fucking fan base.

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,630
You know what I mean? It's really
hard to tell him fucking voice.

60
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:31,050
It's really hard to tell [inaudible]
that I'm not through puberty yet.

61
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,180
It's really hard to tell like truly who
was a great quarterback in the final two

62
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:39,990
minutes of the game ever since
the prevent defense. Cause I,

63
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,130
I think back in the day,

64
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,590
I mean I know that they didn't
want you to get behind him.

65
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,750
They must have done some
early version of it,

66
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:50,190
but there was like a few guys that
would go down the field. You know,

67
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,440
you're Roger Star, she, you, Terry
Bradshaw's, Ken Stabler, you know,

68
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,280
but everybody else,

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,040
I mean it was like three or four guys
that could do it and now it's just

70
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,000
everybody in the league because it did
just get, I swear to God, you could put,

71
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,430
you could put, I'm going to go
a little Mike and Mike here.

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,630
Don't write down. You could put me
under center during the prevent defense.

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,890
I could definitely,

74
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:14,850
I could complete a fucking pass as long
as they didn't know that. It always me.

75
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,130
Okay.

76
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,670
That that was not a
professional quarterback,

77
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,700
that this is actually a podcaster slash
comedian slash a crafter of shit jokes,

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,190
you know. Then of course they
just play defense, you know,

79
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,570
they blitz or whatever
the fuck they would do.

80
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:33,520
But if they gave me the
respect of an NFL quarterback,

81
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:38,110
I could, I could dump it off. That
shouldn't happen on any fucking level.

82
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:43,030
So whenever I was watching that,
the Tennessee, Texas a and m game,

83
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,010
what a fucking game.
You know,

84
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:48,940
I want to say that Tennessee
shot themselves in the
foot with their 58 fucking

85
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:52,300
turnover was, but you got to
give it up to Texas. I mean,

86
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:55,450
they just kept making them
happen. You know, I mean,

87
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,890
I want to think that somebody on the
coaching staff or the volunteers said,

88
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,520
hey guys,
what's say we protect the football?

89
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,390
What's say the next time we gained 80
yards on one fucking play on this team,

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,060
we talked the thing away,
you know,

91
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:15,620
put two hands on the fucking ball.
Um, I know that there was saying that

92
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,590
yet the turnover's just kept coming.
You know, it was just, I dunno,

93
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,950
it was fucking him. An amazing
game. And um, I have to tell you,

94
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,440
coming from a professional sports city,
you know,

95
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:33,230
the safe suburbs, as I always
say, ever since goodwill hunting,

96
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,570
everybody thinks she grew up in southeast.
You stole cars,

97
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:38,720
you're good at math and you like apples.
That's not me. That's not the guy I am.

98
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,250
I grew up in the safe suburbs.
There was street hockey dad,

99
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,860
there was a,
there was little league baseball.

100
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:48,410
We had a great place to get ice cream,
you know,

101
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,440
not saying that they weren't
fucking maniacs, you know,

102
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:55,160
that later got into fight next daily
bid people's ears off cause they were

103
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:57,890
biting on the air and that guy would go
to push them and then part of the year

104
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,770
would come off. I'm not saying that people
like that did not come from my town.

105
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,510
I'm just saying more so than not, people
did not bite other people's ears off.

106
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,080
Now you getting towards the
downtown area, like the, you know,

107
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:13,670
who knows what the fuck would happen. All
right. That's all I'm saying. Anyways,

108
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:17,170
let me get back to this shit.
So, uh, coming from a, uh,

109
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,700
the safe suburbs of a,

110
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,510
of a major fucking city that's
a professional sports city,

111
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,170
um, I, I can't believe that. I
haven't watched called football.

112
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,310
Like I've been watching it since 2007,
so I'm almost a decade in,

113
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,360
but the years that I lost, it's a fucking
travesty. I'd watch it a little bit,

114
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,200
but I have to be honest with you.
If you watch SCC football,

115
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,140
if you watch the Verne
Lundquist Gary Danielson,

116
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,050
if he just watched that game every week.
Okay.

117
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,550
Which is usually a fucking SCC game.
You watch an SCC football game.

118
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,540
I'm telling you the NFL
[inaudible] this time,

119
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,780
this particular time cannot
fuck with those games.

120
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,750
They're unbelievable. They're just
fucking, even even that last week,

121
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:07,520
that was an ACC game that Clemson
Louisville game was fucking crazy, man.

122
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,151
It kind of helps.

123
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:11,450
This year somebody was bringing up that
everybody seems to be scoring 30 and 40

124
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,310
points.
Speaking of which,

125
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:18,311
what the fuck happened to the Oregon
ducks did like the whole school did the

126
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:20,600
whole team from last year just say,
yeah,

127
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,170
we all want to be eligible for the draft.
I don't know what happened to them.

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,120
What's going on with you, Cleo?
You're all fucking itchy. All right.

129
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,990
Just lay down buddy. Lay down. You
don't know how to come up on the couch.

130
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:36,170
You don't your idea. You can't
just have your part of the couch.

131
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:39,470
You'd come up here and then you
just feel fucking, you know,

132
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,750
you're all over me. I understand it.
I like it. But I've got a podcast too,

133
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:49,550
so go lay down buddy. Go lay down
buddy. Go on. There you go. Um,

134
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:50,991
anyway,

135
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:55,850
so I ended up watching the Tennessee game,

136
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,780
um, at home in Los
Angeles. Now some of you,

137
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,030
if you listen to this podcast, you're
like, well, wait a minute, Bill.

138
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:06,980
How the fuck were you at home on Saturday?
And as they say in the Boston area,

139
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:11,981
why don't you come over on a fucking
Saturday as one little consonant in the,

140
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,740
it's Saturday. Come over.
Well, I don't want to say,

141
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,253
um,

142
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,870
he was supposed to be down
in the swamp at the Florida.

143
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:29,390
Lsu gained that fucking stadium.

144
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,840
I've wanted to go there since
Emmett Smith played there,

145
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,960
I always loved the colors.
The blue with the orange helmet.

146
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,890
Emmitt Smith was the
shit. It just, I just,

147
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,720
I've wanted to go there for
fucking ever. They've, oh,

148
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,000
they've always had great teams.
Florida football has always been,

149
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,930
it's just my whole, probably since
my teens, when Jimmy Johnson,

150
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,160
how boys came into fucking
University of Miami.

151
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,980
Then you had the other guy there
at Florida state with Billy Bouton,

152
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,070
whatever the fuck his name was,

153
00:08:56,071 --> 00:09:00,540
who couldn't feel goal kickers were always
wide left and wide. Right. You know,

154
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,560
um, I've been wanting to go to that
stadium forever. But of course the, uh,

155
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:09,480
the hurricane came in and, um, you
know, one of my buddies was saying,

156
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,090
you know, early in that week, like,

157
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,000
like we get so fucking crazy excited
cause that that's like you got,

158
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:18,570
and you got to have this as,
as, as a guy when you get older,

159
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,910
you have to have that thing that you do.

160
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,800
The guys weekend thing is fucking Coney
as they try to make it sound as much as

161
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,690
it sounds like a fucking beer commercial.

162
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,250
Like those are the things and women should
have them to whatever it is that they

163
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,770
want to fucking go do.
I know it involves wine,

164
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,340
their own way of getting fucked up and
everything and they like, you know,

165
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:42,960
food and all that shit. Um, I like to
stand out in a parking lot in the elements

166
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,080
eating stuff that I don't really
know, uh, what they put in it,

167
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,150
like hot dogs and that type of shit.
So anyways,

168
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,730
we get so excited to go to this fucking
game. Uh, my buddy got the tickets,

169
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:00,330
somebody else handled the, uh, the, the
fucking car service ticket over there.

170
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,160
And uh, I went out and I got the, I
got the cigars. All right. I came in,

171
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:08,580
they loaded for bear. I got
to hook up. I'm not going to
say, oh, whatever, whatever.

172
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,090
I had some fucking sticks.
All right.

173
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I had some fucking just picture every
fucking brand of Cuban cigars that,

174
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:20,984
you know,

175
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,250
Cohibas party gets partake in
over the fuck you say it. Tomato,

176
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,470
tomato. I had mono. Christos, I just,

177
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I had some fucking tremendous
sticks and I brought it up.

178
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:38,820
There was five of us. I was brought,
I brought 15 Cuban cigars, right?

179
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,600
We could eat smoke one every fucking
night and each one was going to get

180
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,670
progressively more insane.

181
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,660
Start with the mild one Thursday go
a little medium and then the fucking,

182
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:52,530
you know, we just, I dunno, we
just fucking won a world war.

183
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,170
That's the one you got a smoke
on the game day game, right.

184
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:58,500
So the beginning of the week we're all
fucking amped up with texting each other

185
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,570
and everything. And then my buddy
who lives on the east coast,

186
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:02,880
cause every on the west coast,
we don't pay attention to the east coast.

187
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,320
You fucking get up three hours before we
do. By the time we have a cup of coffee,

188
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:10,170
that day's half over. There is no, there's
no point of even reading the newspaper.

189
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,900
Everything has already
progressed like another 12 hours.

190
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:17,610
So I didn't pay attention and
my buddy texted me, he goes, uh,

191
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,080
there would have to be a fucking
hurricane this weekend. And I was like,

192
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,070
get the fuck Outta here.

193
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:28,050
Right in the game plan was we were
flying into Atlanta and like assholes. I,

194
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,160
we booked US Atlanta.

195
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:32,040
We were doing a Gig and then we were
going to Gainesville to do the show,

196
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,210
but like assholes,

197
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,890
we didn't book hotels until
the last second and already
100,000 people coming in

198
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:41,820
to see the fucking game. There was no
hotels. So guess where we got our hotels?

199
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,780
Take a wild guess what?
Florida city.

200
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,100
We got our hotels rooms,
Jacksonville, Florida.

201
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,980
That's where we were going to go.

202
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,000
So we were going to fly down from
Atlanta and then pick up a rental car,

203
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,780
drive over to Gainesville, do
the gig Friday night, drive back,

204
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,080
drop off the rental car, go back
to the hotel, smoke another stick.

205
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,670
Fucking jumped in the car service.

206
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:11,671
Go over there and see fucking a legendary
football program and the greatest

207
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:15,580
conference that's out
right now. The Sec, right?

208
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,930
So I hear the hurricane's coming,
so I got right. You know what?

209
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,300
They're probably going to cancel
bunch of flights. Fuck this.

210
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,260
So I get a rental car. I get
a rental car. I'll clear.

211
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:31,030
Please don't puke on the rug. Do you need
to go outside, buddy? What are you doing?

212
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,270
Huh? Was that just you or was
that me? That was you. You okay?

213
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,060
Don't step on the recording,
cleo.

214
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,020
God dammit. Just sit down. Just
sit down. Just sit down please.

215
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,260
Can you please sit down? Sorry
guys. Anybody else's dog? Eat Grass.

216
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:55,360
And even if they're not failing,
even if they're feeling well,

217
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:58,240
they just fucking eat grass.
Why do you do that, Cleo?

218
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,820
Huh?
Sometimes you've just talked to them.

219
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:06,000
They get so focused on you and they
put the rose up. No, no. Go lay down.

220
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,260
Go lay down. Do you need to go upstairs?
You want to go see mommy? All right.

221
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:10,790
Hang on a sec.

222
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,380
Hang on one sec. All
right. Can I go see mom?

223
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,640
Hold on.
Oh,

224
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:23,870
that was a great one for us,
but she did a few picked up something.

225
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,140
There it goes. That sock. Alright. Anyway,
so that was the game plan. So I was like,

226
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:33,360
all right. So you know they're,
they're going to be overly cautious.

227
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:37,200
They're going to cancel the
fucking flights and Baba Baba Baba.

228
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:41,760
So we'll just fucking drive down. Well,
everybody's leaving the hurricane.

229
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:45,300
We're going to fucking drive
down the 75 south. Well,

230
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,220
so we fucking land and uh,

231
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:51,540
they're supposed to make
a decision Thursday at one
o'clock and they don't make

232
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,100
a decision.
So me and Bart,

233
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,880
nick around the fucking or in the lobby
more excited that they didn't make a

234
00:13:56,881 --> 00:14:00,360
decision like, yeah, dude, come on man,
this is fucking, this is the south.

235
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,800
They're playing this fucking game.
They're playing the game. They don't,

236
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,780
they don't want to cancel this fucking
game and have to fuck him or refund

237
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:10,340
100,000 tickets and try to figure out
when to reschedule their fucking plane.

238
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,600
And we got excited and we had hope and
then the whole fucking thing it, it,

239
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,350
you know, it went up to a category
for it and all fucking went to,

240
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,170
went to shit.
But I got to tell you actually,

241
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:26,310
if I was even trying to
drive down to the south,

242
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:30,480
like they evacuated so many people
smartly, by the way. I mean,

243
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,830
only three people died in a category
for, well you know, down in Haiti,

244
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:39,270
like you know, a couple of hundred,
they said even more died. Uh,

245
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,810
granted we're first world, we have
better structures and that type of shit.

246
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,730
But you know, back in the day,
I mean that would have been us.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,360
Like I was thinking about that
back in the day. Like you know,

248
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:51,530
when you didn't know a hurricane was
coming, I mean you saw like signs,

249
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:55,730
but like by then you only had like six
hours to try and get the fuck out of

250
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:56,900
there.
What am I trying to say?

251
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,950
Long story short is even
if we try to drive south,

252
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,390
they just completely closed off
the southbound 75 at some point.

253
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:10,250
And it was just like all of Florida
driving up so it didn't work out.

254
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:14,720
So then we were like, okay, how do we
save this weekend? Because my buddy,

255
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,010
the one who told us about the fucking
hurricane, he had not even left yet.

256
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,240
So he's at home with his wife and
his kids. He's a total family man.

257
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:27,560
In once a year he goes out, you know,
has some beer, smokes a stick. It's just,

258
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,220
you know,
and he goes,

259
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,600
this was the one weekend where his
kids didn't have any sports. All right,

260
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,480
we got to make it happen for this guy.
So we started looking around,

261
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:39,680
where the fuck can we go? The
Georgia bulldogs home? No,

262
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,680
there in South Carolina. South Carolina
is three and a half hours away.

263
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,030
Let's fucking drive to that one.

264
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,500
And then we find out it got fucking moved
to Sunday. Fuck. Can't go to that game.

265
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,390
What else do we got?
UNC?

266
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:53,960
I just went to UNC and I want to watch
him play Notre Dame. Notre Dame stinks.

267
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,350
Or is that NC state? NC state was
playing them. I was like, look dude,

268
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:59,710
I'm not driving into the fucking
Carolina. It's the God. Damn.

269
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,800
The fucking storm is coming up that
way. All right. What about Tennessee?

270
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,150
Let's go to the voluntary.
Well, do it right.

271
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:09,890
Let's go to where all fuck.
We're in a panic.

272
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,100
Who's Tennessee play at
Texas a and M Aggies.

273
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,360
Great fucking game where they
play in college station. Fuck.

274
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,600
All right. Who's next?
Who's next to Alabama,

275
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,750
where they play, who they played
with it. They're playing Arkansas.

276
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:31,580
Where they playing in Arkansas.
Alright. Auburn, Auburn war.

277
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:34,760
Eagle War Eagle. Who Do
they got? Who they got?

278
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:39,020
Mississippi state is sippy state where
they play it. Auburn, Mississippi state.

279
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:45,340
It was just three of us standing at this
fucking over the sports page trying to

280
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:52,030
salvage this fucking weekend
looking everybody was a way,

281
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:55,330
the only way to get to any of the games
that we wanted to go to that worn in the

282
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:59,260
path of the fucking hurricane was
that we were going to have to fucking,

283
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,310
you know, we were like Clemson, what
about Clemson? They playing BC. Ah,

284
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,600
they're going to kill them.
Were they playing Boston College?

285
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,020
Shack's right over and over and over.
Right.

286
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,240
So the only way we're going to get to
them as if we fucking, uh, you know,

287
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,930
I don't know if we jumped on a plane
and I was already not working the next

288
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,290
night, so we're just going
to hang in Atlanta, then
jump on a plane. It was just,

289
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,660
it got to be too fucking crazy. But
for half a second, we did consider, um,

290
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,890
we did consider the Alabama
Arkansas game, but, uh,

291
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,840
so it didn't end up
happening. But, um, you know,

292
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:36,550
what do you, what the fuck are
you going to do? It was still,

293
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,680
it was still great to, you know,
it was cool when I got home,

294
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,790
I got to chill with my wife and I got
to watch all those great games and, um,

295
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,010
I didn't have to be in the
path of a fucking hurricane.

296
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,970
I wasn't another asshole that the poor
fire department had to try to fucking,

297
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,820
because I didn't listen to their
warnings, you know what I mean? And, uh,

298
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,570
so anyways, um, Jesus Christ,

299
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:58,920
that stone was fucking nasty men.

300
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,660
My condolences to anybody down in
the Jacksonville area, you know,

301
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:04,980
I hope you made it out.
All right.

302
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:09,030
As far as I think pretty much people
made it out. But I hope your stuff is,

303
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:12,670
our rec has, God knows those fucking
insurance companies, you know,

304
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,030
they just, Oh yeah, we don't
cover that. If you see that shit,

305
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,350
that one that spike Lee made
about New Orleans where they,

306
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,720
like they just were looking at the
waterline will cover anything below the

307
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:27,960
waterline there. Like anything
above it, it's your fault.

308
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:30,750
It's just like you mother fucker

309
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,300
Chris Mad. Like why, why,

310
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,880
what kind of people are
you, you know, I dunno.

311
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,420
Anyways, so can you tell him most of the
typing in my password here? So anyways,

312
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,780
oh,
I got,

313
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,210
I got some more iPhone stories for you
now at a time for a quick iPhone story.

314
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,080
So I got the iPhone seven
now. All right. And uh,

315
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:55,210
I want to thank everybody who tried to
help me out with even the condescending

316
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:59,320
ones or this new generation people
who were saying they were cringing.

317
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,060
Me and my boy had to tweet. My boyfriend
works at the apple store or an,

318
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,080
I work at the apple store too.

319
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:08,980
And we both cringing as we were
listening to you talk about like, why,

320
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,950
why are you see you're cringing from,
I wouldn't cringe for you. Like,

321
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,560
if I watched you two geniuses,
tried to change a fucking tire,

322
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:19,210
I drive a stick shift as they say you
millennials can't do. If that's the truth,

323
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,910
I wouldn't crunch.
I tried to teach you how to do it

324
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,730
cringing. I felt so bad. I was so odd.

325
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,620
I really think this whole generation of
the reason why they're always using that

326
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,830
term awkward is because they
were so sheltered that I
don't think that they kind

327
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:38,910
of work shit out amongst themselves
as kids the way we did. Now,

328
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,900
granted my generation was
too far the other way.

329
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,870
They didn't know what the fuck we were
doing. And I think what millennials,

330
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,640
there was an overcorrection.

331
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:51,240
I think this next generation they're going
to get it right. It's like, you know,

332
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,900
he can't have him fucking
join. You know, the,

333
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,190
those groups where there's
all these pedophiles, you
know, you know what they are.

334
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,890
I am not going to say him. One rhymes
with, with the, uh, the rubs louts

335
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,110
the rub shouts.
You also don't want to,

336
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,740
when they're very young, it's
probably not good to have them take a,

337
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,540
uh, I can't even say it,
right. A Herati class,

338
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,940
um, you know, shit like that.

339
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,140
They're the kinds of places and
then you can just say church groups,

340
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:31,380
church groups, and one of the big one, you
just, you just can't have them fucking,

341
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,370
you know,
but you have to let him play outside.

342
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:37,440
You got to let him solve Shit,
you know,

343
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,320
interact with each other and shit
like that. Like, you know what I mean?

344
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:44,970
Like I think we went too far the other
fucking direction and I can say that

345
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,420
having never had a child.
So anyways,

346
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,480
um, somebody told me
that, you know, when I,

347
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:55,150
when I sat there and counted all
my contacts, I didn't realize,

348
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,880
and this is all shit that you
guys can laugh at me about,

349
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,700
but I know there's a lot
of you, especially in my
generation, do not know this.

350
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,180
If you scroll down to the
end of your contacts, it'll
tell you how many you have.

351
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,580
Um, I was off by one, I said one 13. I
had one 14 who knew who the fuck knew.

352
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,960
Um, I, and by the way, if
you didn't use the cloud, uh,

353
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,070
getting all your contacts back,
not a big deal, not a big deal.

354
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:21,520
It's just as you need the person's
number. You're like, fuck,

355
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:24,370
I don't have the number. Who Do I know
that knows him? He just, you know,

356
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,550
by then you have that person's number and
you gradually put it all back together

357
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:30,490
again. It's so, it wasn't
as bad as I thought.

358
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,310
And then somebody gave me
a great suggestion and say,
well, there's, there's, uh,

359
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,390
these places you can go to that they,

360
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,450
they can retrieve lost data
or whatever the fuck that,

361
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,470
whatever the computer term is that.
So I might try that with my phone.

362
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,510
I have not turned it on since then.

363
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:48,820
I'm going to try sometime
like Tuesday morning,

364
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,970
hope that I can turn it
on and grab a couple. Um,

365
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,270
you know, the guy who used to work on
my truck, he moved to Arizona and uh,

366
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,930
he recommended this great
place here in California,

367
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
the tune it up and all that type of shit.

368
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:07,000
And I lost his fucking number
and cause he's a crazy car guy.

369
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:10,720
Like his website's still has
like a fucking California number,

370
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:13,780
so I should probably just give it
a try. But anyway, so, so anyways,

371
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,620
so I had to get the iPhone seven cause I,
I fucked up my phone.

372
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:22,330
I've got it all wet and shit. And
um, so now this one's waterproof,

373
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,790
so they had this little fucking
umbilical cord off of it.

374
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,980
And I was sitting there going,
there's no fucking way,

375
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm not going to lose this thing. I have
to be on my best behavior with this.

376
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:35,041
So I was literally carrying that little
cord around in the iPhone box with me

377
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:39,370
while I was on the road because I was
too paranoid to even leave it into the

378
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:42,700
phone. Cause I was afraid I'd go to
put my pocket pop out. I wouldn't know.

379
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,670
I don't know what. So, um,

380
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,310
I somehow make it across this country
and back. I still have it. Um,

381
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,560
I went back to my house to use my gym,
you know,

382
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,420
I said finishing up the
fucking kitchen, you know, um,

383
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,710
and I had it there and I went to
grab a few things and I dunno,

384
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,020
I get back to the place that I'm renting
and it was just gone. It was gone.

385
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,260
And I started to have a meltdown and I
was just like this drive, she wife nuts,

386
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,680
don't do it, don't fucking do
it. And I tore apart everything,

387
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:21,250
couldn't find it in the house.
I drove back to my place,

388
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:24,400
I couldn't find it there and I just said,
fuck this.

389
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,110
And I drove over to the apple store and
somewhere over there I just got into

390
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:33,310
this fucking zen place. I was like,
dude, this is 100% your fault.

391
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,740
It's not Steve jobs fault.
It's your fault.

392
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,900
You should just left the
fucking thing in your phone.

393
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,190
I'm sure you can pick up the phone and
fucking shake it. And I'm sure nothing,

394
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,030
you know,

395
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,430
I'm sure it probably doesn't even come
out cause they'll probably already knew

396
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:51,320
that that was going to be a fucking
concern. So I drive over there, you know,

397
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:53,120
I pull in,
I just said fuck it.

398
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:57,110
I valet my old Prius dirty as shit right
now because I still have to get the

399
00:23:57,111 --> 00:24:00,710
dense taken off from that fucking
road rage. Cunt slammed in the person,

400
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:04,850
two people behind me. Um, so I
just got that thing has got dense,

401
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,580
I'm going to get pulled out. Why get it
washed? So it's, it's really looking bad.

402
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:11,710
So I pull in and the valley place at
the mall, they go like, yeah, what's,

403
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,620
what's your phone number? And I'm just
like, yeah, none of your business. I go,

404
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,020
I don't give out my phone number. That's
what I used to say. Now I just go,

405
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,540
I don't have a phone cause they're just
going to call you. And it's just, it,

406
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,280
just all of those things,
by the way,

407
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,900
all of those phone numbers and
all of that Shit, I'm telling you,

408
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:28,280
it all gets bundled and it gets,
it gets sold. There was a lobby,

409
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,270
there was something, a
lobby, there was something,

410
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:32,660
something going on in Washington where
they, what, what they were saying.

411
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,460
What I was saying much more intelligently
and written down on paper saying that

412
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:40,040
you ought to get a piece
of it and something's going
to sell your information.

413
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:43,490
Shouldn't you get a cut?
Right. 10% something.

414
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm sure that got shot down. But anyways,
uh, so I just pulled up and I just say,

415
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:49,310
yeah,
I don't have a cell phone.

416
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,790
So then they just take your name down
and there's always ways to get around it.

417
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,410
You just say, yeah, no
I can't do that. Right.

418
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,580
So I go into the apple store and I walk
up to one of the geniuses and I said,

419
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,350
yeah, Hey I need the little
fucking umbilical cord.

420
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:02,300
And they said that right there over the,
over there on the wall.

421
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,900
And I just walked up and I
grabbed five of them. Okay,

422
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,290
I grab five of them and I grabbed this
other cord where it was, you know,

423
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:12,740
where you can plug it into your phone
and someone else can also plug their

424
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:16,370
headphones in while you
plug your headphones in and
you can both listen to the

425
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:19,040
same song. And I did that, cause whenever
I'm on a plane and he's always like,

426
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:22,070
listen to the thought,
it was a great thong and I was just like,

427
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:23,540
I'll get that one for her,
right?

428
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,920
So I walk up to one of the dudes with the
fucking iPad and I just say, yeah, Hey,

429
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:31,970
I wanna I want to fucking,
I want to buy these. Right?

430
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,930
So they're all looking at me like, what
the fuck? Right? Why do you have so many?

431
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,850
It was two geniuses and one of the,

432
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:40,850
one of the people who just trying to
buy some shit there and it's one of them

433
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:44,720
finally goes to me. He goes, I gotta ask
Ya, how come you're buying five of these?

434
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,330
And I was like, uh, because I
know what kind of a moron I have.

435
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,530
And the dude was like, what?
I go, everybody's a moron,
so you've got to include me.

436
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,290
So you've got to figure out what
kind of moron you are. So, uh,

437
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,620
I'm the kind of moron that's going to
lose at least four of these in a year.

438
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,080
So I'm getting five.
And they all fucking laughed.

439
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,440
And I joked to her night somehow is
able to joke my way through the whole

440
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:10,940
fucking experience. I kept it light
and I, and I didn't lose my shit.

441
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:16,580
Uh Oh. Except when I got into it, that
one guy, I forgot when I was driving back,

442
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,100
this guy came barreling
up the street and I,

443
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:22,190
and I live on a street where it's
one of those streets where it's like,

444
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,650
it should be one way,
but it's two way.

445
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,810
And he came flying up
and I was rushing over,

446
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:29,960
so I just had to slam on the
brakes and just kind of gestured,

447
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,280
like really do it and it back up.

448
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,200
And then he pulls up alongside me and
he's big fucking Jaguar and he goes,

449
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,130
he goes, yes. Is there a problem?
He said, I go, I go, yeah,
I tried to stay calm. I go,

450
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:44,380
yeah man, I got you. You're driving too
fast through the neighborhood here, blah,

451
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:47,520
blah, blah, blah, blah. He
goes, I go, hey. I go, you
know, it's a one way street.

452
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:50,400
He goes, it isn't a one way
street. I go, yeah, but what
the car is parked, you know,

453
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,360
you know, I go, you coming through
here like 30 40 miles an hour. He goes,

454
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:57,210
this car won't go forward,
which I don't really know what that means.

455
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,740
Won't go 40 on this street. I have
no idea. I was just like, dude,

456
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,730
this kid's on this street.
And then I lied. I go, dude,

457
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:07,320
I have a kid just trying to
make my argument better. He
goes, I've got three kids.

458
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,430
And he holds up the fingers to like,
alright.

459
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,070
And then he just said something.
He goes, now do you feel stupid?

460
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,220
He said to me, he goes,
now do you feel stupid?

461
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:24,210
And I so I wish I could go back to that
moment and just say to him like, dude,

462
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:27,780
I always feel stupid,
but this has nothing to do with that dude.

463
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,790
You're driving like a fucking
maniac. You got three kids. Yeah,

464
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:34,890
I bet they don't live on this street. Shit
can't. And I was trying, I was trying,

465
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:38,870
cause I've done this before, people on
that street, I just speak in a slow turn.

466
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:42,630
It's going to, I got kids, you
know, I s line, I say kids plural,

467
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,310
just totally lie out my ass.

468
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,890
The reality is I don't want to have a
head on collision with somebody. So, um,

469
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,600
in our last couple of times I did it the,
even like the young punk kids and shit,

470
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:57,750
you know what the fucking hats that
match the fucking shoelaces. Even there,

471
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:00,240
they actually all, all right, cool. All
right. Sorry. You're like, yeah, cool.

472
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:04,140
No problem. You know, and uh, this guy
just wasn't having it. He just goes,

473
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:08,080
now do you feel stupid? And then I
just, once he said that, I, and I go,

474
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:11,820
fuck yourself.
We both drove away.

475
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,900
Uh, so that did happen on the
way over there. So anyway,

476
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:21,901
so I go to buy all of these fucking
things and I'm making fun of myself cause

477
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:24,600
guys, I'm really trying not, I mean,
it's funny when I do it on stage,

478
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:26,850
it's not funny when I do it in
real life or around the house,

479
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:30,450
I'm really trying to work on my temper.
So I was making fun of myself going, yeah.

480
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:33,020
And the kind of fucking moron that's
going to lose four of these in years.

481
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,300
So I'm buying five. So they all laugh
and the guy's like, all right. And I go,

482
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:38,490
what's that going to be
like $7,000 and he said, no,

483
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:41,580
it was like 75 bucks or something.
If he's little ass fucking wires,

484
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:44,700
five I'm like 25 a whack, a 20 a
whack, whatever the fuck it was.

485
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:45,750
But plus I had the other thing.

486
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,200
So I go to open my wallet to take out my
credit card and what is sitting in the

487
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:54,570
fold of my wallet is the fucking
attachment. It couldn't fight.

488
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,780
I must've put it in the same pocket.
And I just laughed. I go seek my days,

489
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,240
look at this. There it is now.
Now I got six, I'm a fucking war.

490
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,150
And they were just all
laughing and made me feel good,

491
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,160
even though they were laughing at me.
It just made me feel better that, uh,

492
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,840
you know, I dunno, I, I gotta be, I
gotta learn how to fucking do that man,

493
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:17,610
because I am a, I am a lot, you
know, I'm funny. On a podcast.

494
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm funny for an hour, but after that
dude, I, I can be a lot to live with.

495
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,950
So anyways,
I'm working on myself.

496
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,280
I'm actually considering going
to speak to somebody and uh,

497
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,950
you know, cause I swear to God
like two things I want to do.

498
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:36,720
I want to just actually sit down and
maybe read some instructions on my iPhone

499
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:41,500
and actually make it something that I can
use and computers actually maybe learn

500
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:46,090
about them rather than screaming to
anyone who listened about road robots and

501
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:50,980
being microchipped, you know? And
then also I would like to, to, uh,

502
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,330
if I could just have the same sense of
humor I have about big shit when big shit

503
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:00,730
happens,
I do not flip out a little shit happens.

504
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,840
Like I lost a fucking little cord
on my phone. I fucking lose my shit.

505
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:07,190
So if I can just somehow,
you know,

506
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,190
not lose my shit in the car
and the technology thing,

507
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:11,230
those are my two biggest fucking goals.

508
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:14,620
If I could just laugh my way
through that shit, I would be,

509
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:17,350
I'd be a much better person. I've been
going to be a lot easier to deal with,

510
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,390
you know, um, and I'll just go after
it the way I go after other shit.

511
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:27,391
I've never really tried to fucking like
full on trying to fix my temper the way

512
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:34,240
I try to lose weight, workout, play
drums or whatever. By the way, dude,

513
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:37,630
I am in a fucking iron
maiden rabbit hole right now,

of the beast album. It's just,

515
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:47,230

554
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,830
Today. Speaking of which, has
anybody watched a Luke cage yet?

555
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,980
I loved that. I brought that
fucking dude up. Why? Oh,

556
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,020
long time ago on this
podcast, man, that was my,

557
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:14,670
one of my favorite comic books was a
Spiderman and power man one when it was

558
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:17,070
about the NYP a f fire department.

559
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,700
A buddy of mine actually ordered
it on Ebay and got it for him.

560
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:24,600
And I hadn't seen that since
like 1978 or 80 when it came out.

561
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,420
And I watched the first episode.
I liked it.

562
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:31,830
They did the usual shit that they do with
superheroes. Like it, like, you know,

563
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:34,260
we just sit there like, well,
you fuck this chick already.

564
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,560
Why are you letting this
guy slapped me in the head?

565
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:41,190
They always have them do that shit
before they just fucking, you know,

566
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,380
throw somebody through a wall. I
watched that and I also watched, um,

567
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,530
a Westworld, which you want to hear
something hilarious. I love that movie.

568
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:56,130
When I was a kid, I loved
Yule. Brenner was huge. I mean,

569
00:33:56,131 --> 00:33:59,940
nobody said draw like him when he drawl.
He did this fucking,

570
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,440
he just had the best voice ever.

571
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,700
Bad Ass with the fucking shaved
head and all that shit. Uh,

572
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,980
I love that movie to the point.
I remember like 15 years ago,

573
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,780
not 15, which will be like 10 years ago,
actually called my agent and I said, hey,

574
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:20,880
how much would it cost to
buy the rights to Westworld?

575
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:22,920
Because they just started redoing
all these things and I'm like,

576
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,530
there's no fucking way you could
make a killer movie out of that.

577
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,740
And of course they came back, it's
like, it's like nine zillion dollars.

578
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:31,860
I didn't realize it was a Michael
Craig Mu Book and all that shit.

579
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,860
So I obviously didn't have the money
and thank God I didn't have to fucking

580
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:39,060
rights to it cause I have to tell you,
I watched the first episode of Westworld.

581
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:44,250
They completely 100% took it to another
fucking level. Updated it. It's,

582
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,390
it's unbelievable. I actually liked that
pilot better than the Luke cage one.

583
00:34:48,391 --> 00:34:50,850
Slightly better.
I thought the Luke cage one was the shit.

584
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,450
So now I got two new shows
back bay to fucking watch.

585
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,250
Definitely check those out. And
if you want a laugh, by the way,

586
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:03,300
I ran into a buddy of mine, uh, Willy
Garcia, who I'm seen in fucking forever.

587
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,800
He's still real deal is a fucking
hilarious comedian and he has a standup

588
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:08,760
special,
uh,

589
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,330
that he just put out and I wanted to give
him a shout out if you get a chance to

590
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:15,320
check him out. Uh, all right, let's get

599
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,430
They put the whole label
on it and framed it for me.

613
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:32,370
they're always trying to break them up,
but there's a lot. Let's do three and two.

614
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,570
All right. Three against two here, right?
Blue Apron, everybody? No, not all.

615
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,540
Not all ingredients are created equal.

616
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,880
This is like reverse JFK. Uh,
fresh, high quality ingredients.

617
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:48,450
Make a real difference. So it's important
to know where your food comes from.

618
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,090
Talk about your personal experience
with Blue Apron, the meal you cook,

619
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:56,490
the ingredients overall, how it tasted,
how it felt, it felt, cooking it,

620
00:36:56,491 --> 00:37:01,290
et cetera. Well, I haven't used it yet,
but it sounds amazing. How about that?

621
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,410
That's my experience. I made a potato
pancake for the first time today,

622
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,520
gave it to my wife, put a little
salmon on it with some fucking,

623
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,170
what's that White Shit? Sour cream. And
a little bit of dill on top. All right?

624
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,910
Couple eggs over easy eggs over each.

625
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,040
And I gave it to her and I actually walked
out of the room because then I had to

626
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,730
make my eggs because how do you make
for fucking eggs over easy with the

627
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:26,160
standard fry and panty. Can't
do it. Somebody has to suffer.

628
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,090
So I came walking in afterwards and I
tried a little potato pancake and I got

629
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:32,250
that tastes pretty good. And
you know, and my wife said,

630
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:37,320
she said that was better than the
one that I had at brunch. Bam. Okay.

631
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,190
And I'm gonna tell you right now,

632
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:41,100
when you start making meals
like that field lady in the,

633
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,170
everything else goes to the next level.
All right?

634
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,590
I wish that there was a blue apron
when I was a kid. Uh, Christ,

635
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:48,240
we had to grow our own fucking potatoes.

636
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,940
These people going gonna bring them right
to your God damn door for less than 10

637
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:51,570
bucks per meal.

638
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,440

640
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,270
What sucks the most when you
fucking make it a meal is taken out.

641
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:03,600
The little fucking measuring cop in
the little fucking teaspoon. Who is it?

642
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:06,010
A teeth did a table throat.

643
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,610
They eliminate all of that.

644
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,250

00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,840

649
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,690

way to get in shape too.

653
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,870
You don't have to go to the grocery store.
You're eating well.

654
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,710
You'd be making the ladies fucking like
you or the fellas. Waiter was hard, right?

655
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,140
Ladies, you know, not
trying to be massage.

656
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,000
Monistic not saying that a
woman should actually go out,

657
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,200
maybe cook her man and meal
every fucking leap year.

658
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,790
Choose delivery options to find your
needs. There's no weekly commitment,

And then we just got two more.

671
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:32,390
I'll read those later.
Um, is that my accent?

672
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,380
Is something done when the cookies done?
What's going on here

673
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,920
by the way? Uh, was I gonna
say, uh, I weighed myself today.

674
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,920
I'm in the buck seventies,
which is perfect to get my saw.

675
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:48,100
I want to be one 72 or think I'm going
to come in about one 75, but that's fine.

676
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,250
All right,
that is going to be fine.

677
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,670
Tipping the scales at one 75 as long as
I got that seven is the second number,

678
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,830
uh, I'll be all right. You
know what? I'll tell you,

679
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:00,820
I walk around weights
about two 10, two, 10.

680
00:40:00,821 --> 00:40:04,810
If I could eat and drink the way
that I wanted to, um, by the way,

681
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:09,220
guess what came the other day?
Guess what came I ordered it back in June.

682
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,960
My Jaguar came. I fucking
picked it up today. I can't,

683
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,960
I'd like the Catholic guilt that I
fucking had that actually went out and

684
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,390
fucking, you know, did this,

685
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:22,030
but it wore off the second I
got behind the fucking thing.

686
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:24,460
I came walking into the showroom.
Dude, I ordered the color,

687
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,720
everything underrated under fucking rated.

688
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,620
Ordering a car.
You just go to the website,

689
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,430
everything that you want. You just
fucking order it. It's like blue apron,

690
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,090
except it's a fucking car,
right? Everything is perfect.

691
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,730
This fucking car. Oh my God.
It's, it's, it's fucking insane.

692
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,210
Um, I'll post Christian,
am I going to post it?

693
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:54,190
But I don't want to post a picture cause
no one has this color out here. Um,

694
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,250
I'll be like that chick driving around
in that pink Cadillac got fucking

695
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,800
corvette out here. But, um, even
Nia, cause she's all like, you know,

696
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:06,250
you know women dude, like when a
guy gets excited about some stuff,

697
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,620
I swear to God, it's like you're looking
at another woman. They always Gail,

698
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:13,600
he's gotta fucking take you down.
It's kind of cute and kind of annoying,

699
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,770
you know, but I'm mostly annoying and
way less cute so I, you know, whatever.

700
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,080
And uh, so I come walking
in, they got the whole day,

701
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,880
they actually backed it into the show
room and they put a car cover over the

702
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:29,720
fucking thing. Right. And they fucking
did the unveiling. They took it off to it.

703
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,990
It's just fucking, it's the
fucking, I don't give a shit.

704
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:36,740
It's the British racing green with the
black rims black grill. I got that,

705
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:40,460
that the fucking,
I had the analog gauges.

706
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:43,250
I didn't get all wheel drive cause I
wanted the rear end to kick out a little

707
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,190
bit. I got the rear
wheel, 390 fucking horses.

708
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,490
I'm going to take it over to Galpin
to get a new exhaust system on it.

709
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,620
Cause right now it's very,
are very refined sound.

710
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:56,510
I like a little more of a growl in it.
It's, it's dude, it is the fucking shit.

711
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,980
It's like what if Steve
McQueen drove a fucking, uh,

712
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:06,590
what a Steve McQueen drove a Jaguar and
had two kids because it is a four door.

713
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,180
Let's not get crazy. Let's
not get crazy. Um, dude,

714
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,770
it is. It's fucking awesome. And uh,

715
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,760
I love it because everybody out here
that has a four door sedan either has a

716
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:20,750
Mercedes, a BMW and Audi, and
then to a lesser case, Alexis,

717
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:23,240
but that's more of a younger
person's car. I feel, uh,

718
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,330
those cars are all fucking great and um,
I blown away.

719
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:30,020
It's like those have kind of become the
muscle cars of today are the four door

720
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:33,380
sedans, which is perfect. He
can actually put somebody in.

721
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,940
It's like an adult persons car.

722
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,353
MMM.

723
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,170
Oh my God. Like I absolutely
love with this car. So,

724
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:42,963
mmm.

725
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,840
It was fucking hilarious. And I got
the price. They wanted everything.

726
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:50,240
So then of course, dude, I just did, I
did everything right. I got these foot,

727
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:52,790
the floor mats are a,

728
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,890
they're not like the carpeted ones and
after a while they start wearing out and

729
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:57,420
everything.
I ordered these,

730
00:42:57,421 --> 00:43:00,360
these like these rubber fucking
match that looked like the shit.

731
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:03,300
They say Jaguar on them and,
and they actually,

732
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,190
they're a little bit different color
black than the, than the carpet.

733
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:07,500
So they kind of pop a little bit.

734
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:11,190
I mean the car is the fucking shit and
it's going to kill me the first time

735
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:12,630
somebody opens a door into it.

736
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,010
But I was just thinking of the week Steve
McQueen drove that current bullet the

737
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:21,300
way those good old boys drove that
fucking uh, 69. What was the challenger?

738
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,250
They fucking broke one of
those every week. Fuck it.
He was supposed to drive it.

739
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,370
I remember fast and loud one time
they bought a Ferrari like f 40,

740
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,120
and the host of frame had been bent and
all that and they saw it and they were

741
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:35,100
all laughing. They were just
going like, you know what dude,

742
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:37,830
if you buy a car like this,
at some point it should look like this.

743
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,310
Obviously you shouldn't crack up your car,
but

744
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:46,410
they, they're meant to be
driven. But, um, I dunno,

745
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,510
I can't believe that I have that, that
nice of a car. So I want to thank him.

746
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:53,350
Stopped before I keep fucking gloating
about the car. Thank you to everybody.

747
00:43:53,351 --> 00:43:57,810
Kevin came out to one of my shows and
watch my shit and told people about it

748
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,770
cause uh, you know, uh, yeah, I
wouldn't have that car if you didn't,

749
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:07,210
so thank you. And um, I'm actually
going to miss the Prius self. Um,

750
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,510
I actually selling it to a, uh,
to a friend of mine. So it's got,

751
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:12,100
it's getting a good home
and I got to tell you,

752
00:44:12,101 --> 00:44:14,980
underrated the fucking Toyota Prius.
I had nine years,

753
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,930
85,000 miles on the fucking thing. I
changed the oil. I did everything on it.

754
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:20,770
It's a fucking,

755
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:25,420
that thing will go for 200,000 miles easy
if the next person changes the oil and

756
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:27,550
and on and all the lubricants
and all that type of shit.

757
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,470
Just regular maintenance
and all that type of stuff,

758
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,590
but they're just fucking great cars. He
knows. I also found that the Prius Dude,

759
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,060
when people, all my friends found
out that I was getting a new car.

760
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,370
I like half a dozen people go and
do what he doing with the Prius.

761
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:39,204
I'll buy it off you.

762
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,850
All these comics are loving it
because it has good gas mileage.

763
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,160
They actually have a decent resale value.

764
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,370
So the amount of shit that
those cars get mad, they're,

765
00:44:46,371 --> 00:44:50,220
they're kind of a good investment.
The fucking cheap, the cheap on gas.

766
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,530
Like I know the whole fucking time,

767
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:54,450
every time the gas went
up and went fucking crazy,

768
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:59,451
I never paid more than like between 35
and 38 bucks is the most I ever paid in

769
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:05,400
the rest of the time.
It was about $27 to fill the fucking tank.

770
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,690
And, uh, when it would drop really low,

771
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,680
like when we would start producing oil
and then Saudi, the Saudis would be like,

772
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:17,880
Oh fuck, let's put them out of business.
And then they would overproduce, you know,

773
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,650
all the fuel and all that type of shit
and then it would just plummet. I mean, I,

774
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:26,620
there was, there were days I filled that
car up for like 18 or 19 bucks. So, uh,

775
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,480
I will definitely, I'll definitely miss
that thing. But this thing is just,

776
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:35,310
I'll just fucking, it's a beautiful
car. Red Calipers. Um, all right, let's,

777
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:38,160
let's, let's plow ahead here. Uh,

778
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,250
I have yet to watch the
Japanese Formula One.

779
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:45,470
I feel like I got you guys all excited
who are into that type of racing. Uh,

780
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,200
we're in a racing, I guess just
to say, and uh, and I've just,

781
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:51,070
I've dropped the ball on,
um,

782
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,360
Singapore and Malaysia and now Japan.

783
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,300
It's just because this fucking house,

784
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:01,800
some rent in this guy has like cable from
like the fucking 18 hundreds. And uh,

785
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,890
I got all the racist tapes.
I've watched Singapore.

786
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:06,270
I haven't watched Malaysia yet,

787
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,990
where our Lewis Hamilton was going to win
the race. And then for whatever reason,

788
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:14,760
his engine just fucking blew up.
I have no idea who won the Japanese one.

789
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:17,160
I haven't gone on the Internet.
I'm not looking at my Twitter feed.

790
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,040
I'm going to watch that tomorrow.
Um,

791
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,790
and me and he actually knew a couple
people that are over in Japan and I was,

792
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,640
you know, they having a baby or
something. So they have, they're doing a,

793
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,360
a baby moon, which I guess is
people before they have a baby,

794
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:34,960
they go some foot fucking place and uh,
you know,

795
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:37,990
they're in Japan. So I was seeing a
knee. It's hilarious. Typical guy, shit,

796
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,260
this is typical guy, women shit. Like
I say, Oh fuck. They were in Japan,

797
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:45,160
what will text so and so let them know
that the Formula One races there tomorrow,

798
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:46,270
man,
that he should go.

799
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,990
And then my wife's just like immediately
just looking at it like a check. Like,

800
00:46:49,991 --> 00:46:53,050
yeah, she's not going to want to do
that. And I'm thinking like, yeah,

801
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:57,600
but he was fucking guys like in a
motorcycles and cars and off road.

802
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:01,480
But why the fuck would you want to
do go to a Formula One race in Asia?

803
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,320
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm telling you if you,

804
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,940
even if you're not into that shit,
you got to watch the Singapore,

805
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,700
the Singapore race was fucking incredible.

806
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:17,040
Like they do it at night and then
after when, um, the city and beautiful,

807
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:17,874
right,

808
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,390
granted you're not allowed to do anything
and one of the guys spit gum on the

809
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:25,290
street and they fucking
detained him for six hours. Um,

810
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,050
I think they would just show it off
because when I was there, I was like,

811
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:31,270
I heard if you spit on the, on the
street, you get arrested. They go, Nah,

812
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:33,940
they'll give you a fine.
It's not like that.

813
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:35,780
And maybe they were soft
pedal in at the hotel.

814
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:38,260
She would be afraid to go out and
go spend some money. I have no idea.

815
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:42,910
All I know is this one of the fucking
guys from the Ferrari or Mercedes or

816
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:46,690
somebody spit some guns.
They fucking detained him for six hours.

817
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:52,260
Um, but anyways, they ranted
at night and that city is,

818
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:57,010
is gorgeous at night. It's beautiful.
And then when, uh, who won that one?

819
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:58,990
Nico,
when Nico Rosberg won that race,

820
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,700
they just shoot off all of these fireworks
bed and they go all the fuck out.

821
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,700
And uh, so I've yet to see
the, uh, the Malaysia one,

822
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:13,000
so I'm going to watch that
and the Japanese one tomorrow
if I have the time. Um,

823
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:18,000
all right. What else? What else did I want
to talk about? What else was a big, oh,

824
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,090
you know what I started to watch,

825
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,030
I started to watch before I
came down and I'm taping this, a

826
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,110
taping this Sunday night, I
started watching the Trump
Hillary debate. I mean, I,

827
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:33,120
I just still cannot fucking believe
these are two choices and a dude Trump,

828
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,810
I got to give it up to Trump. Dude,
that guy's one liners. All right.

829
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:41,230
Just for a politician.
Jesus Christ, he's fucking,

830
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,820
he kills the guy fucking kills.
He's great on his feet. He's,

831
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,230
he'd make a terrible president.

832
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:51,320
It's got no idea what the fuck he's
doing or what he's even talking about it.

833
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:53,410
It's just like the dope
verse, the Devil. Okay.

834
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:58,200
You know when I know everybody,
all that all fucking, you know,

835
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,360
that shit that he said, I just
got up, I grabbed by the pussy. I,

836
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,930
nobody just does that.

837
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,850
I felt bad for Billy Bush. You know,
he was just sitting there. He's like,

838
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:13,950
can you sit near some fucking
unknown 2005 you know, he's still

839
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,120
kind of unknown,
you know,

840
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,330
by a Billy Bush. I'm going to talk
about people who are in movies.

841
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:23,800
He's not in a movie. You know, he's a
talking head. Cut The guy a little slack.

842
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:26,530
He's sitting there with the
dawn that Don's talking shit.

843
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:30,550
He's talking about women. You know,
as guys do, I just walk right,

844
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,520
get up and I'd kiss me you. I
grabbed right by the pussy. You know,

845
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,090
Billy was just like this. Donald Trump,
you know, you get caught up in the face.

846
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,280
Oh yeah,
grandma.

847
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,560
He just went along with it. You
know, stay strong. Billy Bush.

848
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:47,160
She shouldn't have deleted you
to fucking Twitter account. Man,

849
00:49:47,161 --> 00:49:49,590
he should have hung in there.
Fuck these people. They just,

850
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,110
they get mad for like three fucking days.
You know what I mean?

851
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,980
It's unfucking believable.
He's going to get more shit for that.

852
00:49:55,981 --> 00:49:58,200
That fucking Hillary's going to
get for the Goddamn, you know,

853
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,650
classified fucking emails,

854
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,090
classified information
through her own fucking email.

855
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,510
Just some of that all goes into the rug.

856
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,720
I cannot stand and I can
tell when Hillary's lying
to she that smile. She does.

857
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:14,790
She can see it arise when she's lying.
Trump is like,

858
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:18,120
I just don't,
he's like a fucking cartoon character.

859
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,680
Like Alec Baldwin as Trump is more
believable than Trump as Trump.

860
00:50:22,681 --> 00:50:27,650
That's how fucking nuts this
guy is. So I started watch it.

861
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,190
Oh Man. Trump had some funny
ones. He said to Hilary said,

862
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:32,990
if I was running this country,
you'd be in jail.

863
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,660
You know, it's funny to really see how
hard Donald Trump goes. This is a clip.

864
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:47,430
I don't know if he could still find it
that the first time Donald Trump was on

865
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:52,200
Letterman and he and Rosie O'donnell
had said something about him and he went

866
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:55,710
off on Rosie O'donnell and he goes,
well, you know, she's a degenerate.

867
00:50:55,711 --> 00:50:58,920
And like it was just so over,
the top.

868
00:50:58,921 --> 00:51:01,320
Letterman was laughing just going like,
Donald,

869
00:51:01,321 --> 00:51:05,540
you just can't go around saying that about
people. And he's just like, yeah, no,

870
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,160
it's true. She's overweight.
He just fucking like,

871
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,590
just no filter. Just went
right after him. And uh,

872
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:18,540
he hasn't changed at all since
he's become a politician.

873
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,060
Having said that, like, I, you know,

874
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,480
it doesn't mean he's going to make a
good president. He's just, you know,

875
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,500
I can't get, I can't get past how many
overtly racist people love the guy.

876
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,300
And that's, that's always
a major red flag. You know,

877
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:33,310
what the fuck it is with
this fucking election.

878
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,020
It's like either got the guy that's
going to rally up the fucking neo Nazis,

879
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:41,290
the guy that rallies up the white guys
that think that there's something being

880
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:45,460
taken away from him, you
know, or you got Hilary,

881
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,650
you know, but he's actually, you know, Oh,

882
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:49,630
you've got Hillary
who's actually going to,

883
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:55,000
she's going to be in bed with the
corporate clients up at the fuck.

884
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,800
It's like a lose lose either.

885
00:51:56,801 --> 00:52:00,520
You got somebody like rallying up this
fucking cess pool of people at the bottom

886
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,020
as far as mental. I'm not talking
financially, mentally speaking,

887
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,290
or you got Hillary who's just, you know,
she's going to give them their wars.

888
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:12,610
She's going to let the fucking robots
be made and I'll let you know. I Dunno.

889
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:18,160
I Dunno what that, oh my God, he's just
fucking and her fucking pants suits.

890
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:22,360
That's the only thing I like about her.
I love the pants suit. If I was a chick,

891
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:24,200
I would wear fucking pants
suits. I mean, you can,

892
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,160
you got to go with it at some point.
As a woman,

893
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,250
you reach your pants suits age
and you just gotta give into it.

894
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,020
That's like a man at some point.

895
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:35,650
You got to stop wearing your tank tops
and you've got to put on a sport coat.

896
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:41,170
All right. Try to keep the carbs
low, do the best you can. You know,

897
00:52:41,171 --> 00:52:44,450
at some point you just get
to that fucking edge. So, uh,

898
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:45,231
I know a lot of you were like,

899
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:48,140
why didn't you bring up the Tom
Brady's back and all that type of shit.

900
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,120
Cause you know what,
we played the Cleveland Browns,

901
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:54,410
no disrespect but Cleveland browns of
where they're at and congratulations to

902
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:58,190
the fucking Indians.
You guys look like you're kicking our ass.

903
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:02,570
We're down o two I watched
like per Detroiters first
at bat and the plane landed.

904
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:05,540
So I missed all of that game,
uh, missing every fucking game.

905
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:07,220
Cause this guy doesn't have
a god. I mean, this is,

906
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:10,820
this is when I come in with
my brand new red sox hat. Um,

907
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,360
but I do know the Blue Jays
were up two games to none.

908
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,190
I don't know what's going on
with that series right now.

909
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,600
They were up three to two. The
last I saw in game three. But, uh,

910
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,550
Tom Brady's back. Gronk
Kowalski's back. We won, um,

911
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,040
buffaloes on a tear there looking good.
Uh,

912
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,890
I dunno, I just was just
great to see Brady back. Uh,

913
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:37,530
it's unbelievable. That whole fucking
thing that, that's I'm telling you,

914
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:41,520
I give it 20 years. And then NFL films,
when they look back on it and be like,

915
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:42,840
do you think that was fair?

916
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,830
Do you think it was fair that one of the
greatest players in the history of the

917
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:51,540
game had his entire fucking integrity
questioned by one of the biggest scumbags

918
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,850
to ever own a fucking team?
Um,

919
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,880
who basically hired a guy for an
in house investigation? I mean,

920
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,600
I still cannot, I cannot fucking
wait for that. How old will I be? 68.

921
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:09,690
Um, all right, Tom Brady will be 58. All
right. 60 minutes everybody. All right.

922
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:13,620
Hey, bill, I saw your tweet
about 60 minutes about a row.

923
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,990
About the talking robot piece.
Yeah.

924
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:20,670
Charlie rose was sitting there talking
to this artificial intelligent robot that

925
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,730
really moved bad, speaking
of fucking Westworld, right?

926
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,910
And he asks the robot what its goals were.

927
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:32,640
First of all that a robot would
have goals like a person. Okay.

928
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:34,080
And the robot said,

929
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,930
my goal is to one day be smarter
than human beings. So I tweeted,

930
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:45,390
you know, I basically treated,
please unplug that fucking thing.

931
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,200
Right? So he goes, um, I
come somewhere between,

932
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:51,150
unplug it and fuck it.

933
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,800
It seems like everyone knows
the machines will be our doom,

934
00:54:55,950 --> 00:55:00,840
but I feel like everyone involved and
even everyone else just looking on has a,

935
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,890
but will they take over type of curiosity?
My question,

936
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,600
I don't know what you
meant by all of that.

937
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:11,601
My question to you is that if in 10 years
the robots are filling in his clerks,

938
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:15,300
had stores or working the lobby of hotels,

939
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,440
would you be comfortable as a customer
in those location all sleep? Also,

940
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,280
I highly recommend the new
Westworld remake on Hbo. Yes.

941
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,220
I thought that was
Netflix. My fault. Hbo, uh,

942
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,100
it's totally up your alley and I'm sure
you remember the original with Goodall

943
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,200
Yule Brenner House funny and said,
yeah, you hit the nail on the head.

944
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,570
I already talked about it. I loved
it. Um, this is what I think.

945
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:40,320
I actually think that, uh, that those,

946
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,370
um,
robots will make human beings obsolete.

947
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,360
I know that sounds fucking
crazy, but they will. Okay.

948
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,430
And they don't have to sleep.
They don't have to fucking do anything.

949
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,200
They'll outwork us and all that type of
shit and they're going to act like that.

950
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:00,450
Then we finally get to sit around
and chill out. Right? Like that was,

951
00:56:00,451 --> 00:56:04,410
that was the big promise of all of this
technology that was going to be coming

952
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:08,100
out in the future. I mean, there's always
technology, but the, the newer technology,

953
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:10,860
it's technology of the future.
You know, the three day work week,

954
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:13,910
they used to make fun of that on the
Jetsons. Sally's three day workweek.

955
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,490
So brutal.

956
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:19,380
People are working more than they have
ever worked in their fucking lives in

957
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:24,340
this race to wa, I don't even
know what the fuck, why the kinks?

958
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:28,030
It's somebody. Please tell me
what the fuck we need robots for.

959
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,310
What do we need any of this shit for?
You know what I mean?

960
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:36,090
Like I feel like somewhere in like
the mid nineties that was good.

961
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:41,660
We advanced enough with cars travel
through advanced than us with medicine and

962
00:56:42,601 --> 00:56:46,800
that type of shit. I mean basically from
1995 on if you fucking die. And then,

963
00:56:46,801 --> 00:56:47,634
I mean,

964
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,070
yeah,

965
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:52,460
I mean, I don't know the amount of shift
did you could sidestep tuberculosis,

966
00:56:52,461 --> 00:56:56,690
polio, all of these fucking things. Deed
all those plagues from back in the day.

967
00:56:56,691 --> 00:56:59,510
They were all gone. I mean,
something, I don't know.

968
00:56:59,511 --> 00:57:02,630
It's hard when it's somebody you know and
love or obviously if it's fucking you,

969
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:03,700
but like,
um,

970
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:05,690
okay.

971
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:08,650
I Dunno. I think the population, I've
always talked about it, I always,

972
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:12,020
it's a major fucking problem and
I don't know how they go. Like

973
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,300
I just feel like those things will come
along and they'll just be like, well,

974
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:20,230
you have those things that don't need to,
they don't need a flat screen TV.

975
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:21,730
They don't need any of that type of shit.

976
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:26,050
They can do the work of 10 people or
they say they can do the work of four

977
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:28,570
people. Then there's three extra
people out there isn't there?

978
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,470
Or there's forks to people out there.
Let's fucking cut this thing down by 25%.

979
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,080
I mean there's already too many
fucking people walking around.

980
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:36,940
You can have a bunch of
robots walking around too.

981
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,520
At some point something's got to give.
All right.

982
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:42,410
And I can guarantee you one thing,
robots are never forming a union, right?

983
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:46,400
All right.
They're not gonna so

984
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,110
I think there'll be smart enough
to not get him to do that.

985
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,890
But the greed of going after the dollar
and making one that's just a little bit

986
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:58,380
better, just a little bit better.
Like these fucking iPhones.

987
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:03,000
I think we could get ourselves
into a tough situation. And um,

988
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:04,770
okay,

989
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:09,360
here's a question I have. Uh, if
you kill a robot in the future,

990
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,270
like is that going to be
considered property damage?

991
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:17,050
At what point will that
actually be considered murder
one or murder two or robot

992
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:21,240
slaughter that they have all these
new laws, you know what I mean?

993
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,660
Like what if they make them
like what they're trying to do?

994
00:58:24,661 --> 00:58:27,090
Like they probably try going to
make up fuckable at some point.

995
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:31,170
Like that fucking movie I saw
like a year ago. You know what,

996
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:35,160
if you go out and you fuck somebody
else's robot, you know like, Hey,

997
00:58:35,161 --> 00:58:38,550
that's my robot. You just came in
my fucking robot. What the fuck?

998
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,060
Yeah.

999
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,510
Even though it's self cleaning and all
that shit, I can't fucking do that. Right.

1000
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:44,680
Okay.

1001
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,280
You just really opened it up and
fuck a can of worms there. Um,

1002
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,850
alright. Clown sightings. Uh Oh shit.

1003
00:58:53,851 --> 00:58:54,570
And he is calling me.

1004
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:59,570
My episode of the Simpsons is on
tonight is an on of doing the podcast.

1005
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,860
I know he was supposed to be done.

1006
00:59:01,861 --> 00:59:06,000
It's hard than like a minute while
I can hit pause. Hey, come here.

1007
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:10,260
I don't want to miss it. Puts
your eyebrows done. You're
like, what are you doing?

1008
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,120
I don't want to miss it. Hey, how nice
is my car? It's very nice. It's awesome.

1009
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:17,503
Oh,

1010
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,410
I thought you when to go harder than that,
I think.

1011
00:59:19,411 --> 00:59:22,340
When you say it was a gorgeous, all
right. How good was a potato pancake?

1012
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,590
That was delicious.
That was better than the restaurant.

1013
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,760
Is it me or did you guys just have like
a distinct lack of fucking passion?

1014
00:59:29,761 --> 00:59:32,630
This is totally you like,
this is what I want you to do.

1015
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,320
This is what I want you to do now for
the love of God. Go fucking do it.

1016
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:39,470
And I'm sitting there like a little six
year old, mommy. Look what I can do.

1017
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,180
All right, just hit pause. I'll
be up there in a second. Pause.

1018
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,770
There's no DME. Oh, all right.

1019
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,330
I know this guy's fucking depression era.

1020
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:57,140
Fucking a cable. All right, I'm just
going to hit pause here and then we'll,

1021
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:58,310
we'll come back and finish this.

1022
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,160
Okay.

1023
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,760
All right. You know, and after
all that, it wasn't even on Becky.

1024
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:06,970
She fucking went off on how
great the potato pancake was.

1025
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:10,210
She thought the car was gorgeous. You
see where they do? See what they do.

1026
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,630
You see what they do? How all of a sudden
I'm fucking bragging a little bit. Ah.

1027
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:18,430
Oh. It goes out. They're always trying to
fucking not knock it down a little bit.

1028
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,340
All right, here we go. Clown sightings.

1029
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,710
Okay,

1030
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,950
you're listening to one right now. All
right. Clown sightings do have freckles.

1031
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,750
Have you heard about this clamp?
Steria sorry.

1032
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,640
Have you heard about this clown hysteria

1033
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,610
freaks are dressing up as creepy clowns
and going out in public trying to scare

1034
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:39,540
people.
Yeah,

1035
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:44,100
I've seen those just search creepy clown
sightings as a bunch of and a bunch of

1036
01:00:44,101 --> 01:00:45,850
shit pops up.
Uh,

1037
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:50,040
other people are now starting to go out
to go clown hunting and beating the shit

1038
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:54,210
out of clowns that they see in public
now.

1039
01:00:54,211 --> 01:00:56,760
How the fuck do you go about doing that?
Isn't it?

1040
01:00:56,761 --> 01:00:59,070
There's like nine people in the
country that have done that.

1041
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,360
Okay.

1042
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,900
Let's go out clown hunting.
Wake where to clowns hang out.

1043
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:08,340
Do they have a natural habitat? Is there
a bush she can go to the clown Bush.

1044
01:01:08,341 --> 01:01:12,180
Shake it a little bit. Throw some rocks
into it. Anyways, my question is one of,

1045
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:13,410
yeah,

1046
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:17,700
is if one of these clowns charged
that you what, what would you do?

1047
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:21,060
Do you think it would be legal to run
over slash beat the shit out of the

1048
01:01:21,061 --> 01:01:24,570
fuckers that she'd,
you let the misfit go without harming him.

1049
01:01:24,571 --> 01:01:26,040
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

1050
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,930
I think at this point, I've seen
enough of those videos that somebody,

1051
01:01:31,931 --> 01:01:35,620
if one of them came running at me with
like dragging the body and it's just so

1052
01:01:35,621 --> 01:01:36,910
fucking over the top.

1053
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,420
Uh,

1054
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:45,650
I dunno, but you, you'd have to just out
of respect for you sell your own safety,

1055
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:47,930
you'd have to fucking backup
or runaway. Yeah. I mean,

1056
01:01:47,931 --> 01:01:50,480
if a guy came running at
me because of my luck,

1057
01:01:50,481 --> 01:01:55,250
this would be the guy who isn't
fucking around. I'd be like,

1058
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:58,010
Yo, what's up youtube? Worldstar whatever.

1059
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,320
Take a fucking axe to the head.

1060
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,413
MMM.

1061
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,520
But, you know, I don't think
that you should go. I'm, I don't,

1062
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,620
I clown hunting to me is hilarious.
Like,

1063
01:02:08,621 --> 01:02:13,621
how the fuck would you even remotely
begin to know where to look?

1064
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,291
You know what I mean?

1065
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:18,280
Like that was that thing for a while
where people putting train horns in their

1066
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:21,470
vehicles and those people,
uh,

1067
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,880
it should be prosecuted because,
you know,

1068
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:26,610
my years of fucked that from years of
going to concerts and playing drums and

1069
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:30,030
shit and like somebody did that
one time when I went by. You know,

1070
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:31,730
it's funny watching people jumping ship,

1071
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:35,490
but like it was close enough that it
did even more damage to my left ear,

1072
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:36,360
which is fucked up.

1073
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:40,110
And it's like that's something now that
I have to live with because this person

1074
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:43,920
wanted to have a laugh. I mean the ring
and went away. But they definitely,

1075
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,670
uh, and when you do shit like that,
I mean you are kind of asking,

1076
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,240
you are asking for it.
You shouldn't do it like the other people.

1077
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:53,730
You shouldn't go beat the shit on the
part that just fucking around trying to

1078
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:57,110
make a funny video. I mean, you really
have to go beat the fuck out of them. Uh,

1079
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:00,960
but when you do scare
somebody to that level, uh,

1080
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:05,580
maybe that is a thing that
you can kind of expect.

1081
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,410
I don't fucking, I don't know what
the rules of clowning is. All right,

1082
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,750
now she's texting me saying
that it's starting. All right.
Hang on. Stop. And again,

1083
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,650
every time I get momentum, you know,
we get a fucking hold and call.

1084
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:21,300
It just kills the drive.
All right, now back again,

1085
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:25,470
guess what? It wasn't even the
episode was the wrong episode.

1086
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,400
There was a pre episode, so the episode
that they're going to show that I'm on.

1087
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:34,290
All right. Anyways. Um, all
right. Waterproof electronics,

1088
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:40,260
waterproof electronics. Alright. Uh,
dear Billy, what, what phone? Uh,

1089
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,460
just to let you know,

1090
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:45,210
the waterproof or water resistance
rating on electronics is bullshit.

1091
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,570
The same goes for watches in
any other water resistant item.

1092
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,990
Here's how they determine
the water resistant. I mean,
that makes sense. I mean,

1093
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:56,490
you pour water on to anything it's going
to gradually seep through, right? Um,

1094
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,430
although boats don't,

1095
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,770
ah, that must be the dumbest I've
ever sound boats to. Okay. Uh,

1096
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,580
they stick the phone in water and a
water filled tank and then increased the

1097
01:04:10,581 --> 01:04:12,800
pressure until the phone has problems.

1098
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:17,000
The water in the tank is perfectly
still and the pressure stimulates,

1099
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:20,780
stimulates the depth below sea level.
Um,

1100
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,840
it's a bullshit tests because the water
you drop your phone into is probably spa

1101
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,860
splashing all about and your phone is
going to move in the water as it sinks.

1102
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:36,140
Um, if you don't drop your
phone into an ocean or a river,

1103
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:40,010
you might drop it into the kitchen full
of detergent or some other situation

1104
01:04:40,011 --> 01:04:44,030
that isn't perfectly still water
pressurized under test conditions.

1105
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,320
It's another marketing trick,

1106
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:49,010
which technically legally
correct for the fine print,

1107
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:53,990
but as bullshit for the day to
day life. Um, I dunno, I don't,

1108
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:54,824
I don't,

1109
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:58,040
it's gotta be better than the shit that
isn't waterproof where he just fucking

1110
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:01,970
sneeze on it. It doesn't
work. Um, I know my watch,

1111
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:05,180
I kept wearing it while I was doing cardio
and all of a sudden was fucked up and

1112
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:09,110
it was just cause it was on my wrist.
I'm just sweating every day. It got wet.

1113
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:14,300
Um, I don't fucking know. I have no
idea. It's probably all bullshit.

1114
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:18,160
I know when they, when they do miles,
you know how much a car miles per gallon,

1115
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:22,050
they drove it like they drive it like one
mile an hour with no headwind for most

1116
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,340
of the fucking test.
Um,

1117
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,210
clear what is going on with you buddy?
What is going on with you?

1118
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,760
Go lay down Jesus Christ.
Are you allergic to the rug?

1119
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:38,170
Every time he come down and you
start flipping out. All right. Um,

1120
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:42,070
let me do these last couple of reads
and then I can finish with the questions

1121
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:46,450
here. Sorry for the whole fucking pause
and then going out this week. Alright.

1122
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:51,490
MVMT watches everybody
pronounced movement. Oh,

1123
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,530
that's I'm supposed to say.
All right. Movement watches.

1124
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:57,910
Everybody was founded on the belief
that style shouldn't break the bank.

1125
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:03,600
The watchmaker's goal is to chart change
the way consumers think about fashion

1126
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:09,730
by offering high quality minimalist
products at revolutionary prices with over

1127
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:14,090
500,000 watches sold to customers in
160 plus countries around the world.

1128
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,140
Movement watches have said solidified
itself as the world's fastest growing

1129
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,110
watch company.
Um,

1130
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,080
podcast slash radio evergreen copy.

1131
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,680
Why would you tell me that?

1132
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:29,220
What's the difference between this
and what you'd see on television?

1133
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:33,090
I guess the company started by two
broke college kids that wanted to wear

1134
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:36,120
stylish watches, but they
couldn't afford them. Okay.

1135
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,660
So they started their own company.
That sentence never makes sense to me.

1136
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:43,870
The two broke college kids, they
can't afford a watch. A stylish watch,

1137
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,970
so they start a company.

1138
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:52,970
Why can't afford a g five jet, uh,
dig all started jet company. How is,

1139
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,430
how is this like,

1140
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,470
how is this like how you started built
a following launched into podcasts,

1141
01:07:00,471 --> 01:07:03,170
youtube, radio, et cetera. I'm not
supposed to be reading this shit. Oh,

1142
01:07:03,171 --> 01:07:07,520
I'm supposed to be like, oh, these guys
remind me of how I fall, how I did it.

1143
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:12,510
Uh, movement watches start.
I don't know where I am in
this copyright. Now. This is,

1144
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:13,950
this is a shit show movement.

1145
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:18,560
Watches start at just 95 bucks
at a department story. Uh,

1146
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:22,440
you're looking at four to five and a
bucks moving movement figured out that by

1147
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:25,650
selling online they were able to cut
out the middle man and retail markup

1148
01:07:25,651 --> 01:07:28,290
providing the best possible price.
All right, we're making sense again,

over 500,000 watches sold over

Seriously. You got to love it.

1154

you're going to get compliments.

1155
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:52,140

game without breaking the bank.

Go to MVMT watches.com/ [inaudible]

1157
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:01,870
it's fucking hilarious, right? I want
a pure bred dog. I can't afford one.

1158
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:05,990
So I started pure breeding dogs.
That's not even a good example. I mean,

1159
01:08:05,991 --> 01:08:08,810
wouldn't even know he'd fucking do that.
I wanted my own island,

1160
01:08:08,811 --> 01:08:12,080
but I couldn't afford one. So
I bought island. I started,

1161
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:17,010
I started a company that made islands.
Bill, get it. All right. All right.

1162
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,863
Stamps dot.

1163
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:20,590

Buy and print official US postage. Using
your own computer and printer was there.

1166
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:31,110
Stop, calm. There's no guesswork.

They make it easy to get exact
postage for any letter, any package,

01:09:01,201 --> 01:09:06,201

on the

enter bird. There's no reason to keep
going to the post office. All right? Okay.

1178
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,390
Let's get back to the
fucking questions here.

1179
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:13,870
Okay.

1180
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:16,960
Um, let's see. Where the hell was I?

1181
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:21,750
Okay. Water dear Billy, what phone?

1182
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,270
All right. We did that one. Okay. Uh,

1183
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:32,090
it's all your listings at ps.
Uh,

1184
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,090
keep a little black book full of
your phone numbers from now on,

1185
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:36,620
so you never lose another contact.

1186
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:39,440
I'm actually doing that with
a couple of little red books.

1187
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,560
I couldn't find the black ones.
All right.

1188
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,570
Ceo a there.
Billy boss.

1189
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,630
If you could become CEO of any
company for a couple of months,

1190
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,360
which company would it be and what
would you try to change at Monsanto?

1191
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:56,170
When I'd stop poisoning the food.
Oh,

1192
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,360
Andy.
Monsanto just now on by bear.

1193
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,830
Bear doesn't care. Uh, imagine, uh,

1194
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,460
you have a few months so it's not like
you get to get fired day one for joining

1195
01:10:07,461 --> 01:10:10,490
apple and changing the name to
orange for selfish purposes.

1196
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:15,700
Also you pick apple and can also pick
any other company you talk less about as

1197
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:20,600
well. Ha Ha. Thanks for
everything. I think I answered
it. I think it was, I also,

1198
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,170
my dyslexia kicked in and none of
those sentences made sense to anybody.

1199
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,120
Those last two ones.

1200
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:27,590
Okay.

1201
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,410
What did it say? That one gives a shit.
Yeah, that's what I would do. I would,

1202
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,510
I don't know. It would be nice
if the way corporations will run,

1203
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,870
you know, it's some point you made enough
money and at some point you thought,

1204
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:41,600
well hey, what would this be doing to
the environment? What would this be?

1205
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,400
You know,
I actually heard that they're lobbying.

1206
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:45,620
They got all these lobbies
going on right now.

1207
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,533
Two,

1208
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:52,570
make marijuana illegal again at the
state level because allegedly, uh,

1209
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:57,770
prescriptions, medication
has dropped drastically, uh,

1210
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:02,200
in states where marijuana
use is illegal and uh,

1211
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:06,370
so they want to make it legal or illegal
again. Evidently my question is, is, well,

1212
01:11:06,371 --> 01:11:09,290
why not the big pharmaceutical
companies just start making weed. Yeah.

1213
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,160
Okay.

1214
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,740
You know, and phase out
these other fucking pills do
not work in ways, you know,

1215
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:16,830
they don't work, you know, all
those fucking side effects. I mean,

1216
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:20,160
it's fucking nuts.
This is shit that you can take literally.

1217
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,870
That's just for something like really
basic. And if you get on it for a while,

1218
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:26,940
if you come off it,
if you come off a too fast,

1219
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,330
there's a chance you might kill yourself.
I mean,

1220
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:32,490
they never had stuff like
that when I was a kid.

1221
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:34,743
You know,

1222
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,000
somebody was all over the place.
They were, they were fucking,

1223
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:42,040
they will call the spares.
There was a fucking spares, man.

1224
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,750
He's all over the fucking place.
You know what I mean?

1225
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,920
I know it's a bad word in Scotland.
My apologies,

1226
01:11:45,921 --> 01:11:48,560
but that doesn't mean shit to us. And
you guys say cunt, every other word.

1227
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,103
MMM,

1228
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:52,870
yeah, I guess. Uh,

1229
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:55,840
okay.

1230
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,673
I Dunno.

1231
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,680
That's one of those super depressing
kind of questions because when you really

1232
01:11:59,681 --> 01:12:00,161
think about it,

1233
01:12:00,161 --> 01:12:04,030
there's really no fucking reason for
our behavior towards one another.

1234
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:08,730
You know what I mean? Um, I dunno.

1235
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:13,420
I think it just comes down to
this just really, you don't,

1236
01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:15,410
you don't remember when you
watch like planet of the apes,

1237
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,050
it was like the champs.
They were the fucking doctors.

1238
01:12:18,051 --> 01:12:20,120
Then he had the orange ones,
they were the old ones.

1239
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:23,480
And then he had the gorillas and they
would like to fucking maniacs or whatever.

1240
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:27,470
Um, which was sorta oddly racists.
They were the darkest of all the apes,

1241
01:12:27,471 --> 01:12:28,041
you know what I mean?

1242
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,850
They were the worst and I guess what
the chimps were subtly supposed to.

1243
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:34,430
I can see orange ones were supposedly
gingers and we were supposed to be the

1244
01:12:34,431 --> 01:12:37,550
best of people. I don't know. You can,
you can always read into all of this shit.

1245
01:12:37,551 --> 01:12:41,390
But like, I dunno, I think, I
think people are kind of like that.

1246
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,120
You know what I mean? You got fucking
nice kind of, hey man, you know,

1247
01:12:44,121 --> 01:12:46,070
whenever you taking the Ambien man,
you know,

1248
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:49,820
and then he just got fucking complete
psychos who will literally stab a baby in

1249
01:12:49,821 --> 01:12:51,230
the head to get another inch forward.

1250
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,690
And I think those people
really succeed in life.

1251
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,660
Like when you just don't
give a shit about, you know,

1252
01:12:56,661 --> 01:12:59,420
and I'm not saying I'm a fucking perfect
person cause I've done some horrific

1253
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,940
shit, but I'm just saying, you know,

1254
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,840
that's just the pain that I've
caused on an, on an individual level.

1255
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:09,350
Forget about it. If you're doing it
at the fucking corporate level, um,

1256
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,770
I dunno, I just love those people
go, well, if I didn't do it,

1257
01:13:12,771 --> 01:13:15,200
someone else would be doing it.
That, that's, that's usually a good,

1258
01:13:15,201 --> 01:13:18,260
that's usually a nice red flag that
you're doing something fucked up. But

1259
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:19,803
MMM.

1260
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,210
I really think that we are,
uh, this is depressing.

1261
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,690
You might want to shut it off
now. I think we are the, uh,

1262
01:13:28,691 --> 01:13:32,860
there's a flaw in our design and
the way we are wired. We are,

1263
01:13:32,861 --> 01:13:36,840
it's inevitable that we're
going to destroy ourselves. Um,

1264
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,900
it's just,

1265
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:40,063
you know,

1266
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:43,580
and I really don't think that it's
not even necessarily human thing.

1267
01:13:43,581 --> 01:13:46,910
It would be like whatever the
next thing on the food chain was.

1268
01:13:46,911 --> 01:13:49,310
If we weren't here,
it would be taking too much and it,

1269
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:53,150
and in its own fucking way would be
fucking up the balance in nature and all

1270
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:57,110
that type of shit. But uh, I
don't know if I 100% believe that,

1271
01:13:57,111 --> 01:14:00,380
but I just look at it that way
cause then I don't, I can just,

1272
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:04,380
I can deal with some of the
shit like a, that I see.

1273
01:14:04,381 --> 01:14:05,550
I do have to say though,

1274
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:08,970
this presidential election in these two
choices is one of the most depressing

1275
01:14:08,971 --> 01:14:13,780
fucking things. Uh, I've been around it
in a long fucking time. I can't believe,

1276
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,670
I just can't fucking believe it's a
reality TV show star or the fucking devil

1277
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:24,370
who, oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.
All right. Halloween costume.

1278
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,770
Just get off that topic.
Hey Bill.

1279
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,220
When was the last time you
dressed up for Halloween? Uh,

1280
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,130
two years ago I dressed up as John Bonham.
Um,

1281
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:35,640
if you had to go to one of
these celebrity dresser parties,

1282
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:40,300
like we're Heidi Clume goes all out
every year and shows up looking like an

1283
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:44,530
extra from the Tom Cruise movie legend.
What would you dress up as a,

1284
01:14:44,531 --> 01:14:49,531
when millions of women look at
a US weekly at the hair salon,

1285
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:53,050
who will they see Billy
red face dressed up as a,

1286
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:57,760
when they get to the celebrities wear
stupid costumes just like us a section.

1287
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:02,140
Um,
well first of all,

1288
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:05,530
those are all the beautiful people
self. I'm out. I'm not in that section,

1289
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:06,364
so I don't think they were,

1290
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:09,610
let's just say all the beautiful people
got hit by a truck and it got all the

1291
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:14,200
way down to I, you know, was
in that thing. Let's see.

1292
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:18,400
I, I would probably John Bonham,
I've done that one enough.

1293
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,950
Who would I dress up as?

1294
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:22,950
Okay.

1295
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:26,670
Somebody like debts known but sort of
obscure because you only to be the like

1296
01:15:26,671 --> 01:15:29,310
the 12th Douche to show up,
you know,

1297
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:31,740
dressed as like Donald Trump
is going to be like the,

1298
01:15:31,741 --> 01:15:35,790
everybody's doing that or Hillary,
you don't want to dress up as Steve Jobs.

1299
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:40,020
I still think he's fucking known well
enough. You gotta you gotta dress up like,

1300
01:15:40,021 --> 01:15:43,470
uh, uh, let's see here.

1301
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:49,060
Who'd be a good one? Who's a
good fucking, they were the sh,

1302
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:54,000
you know what I mean? Like if you were
going to dress up like somebody and uh,

1303
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,003
okay,

1304
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,820
you know what? You got me,
this is how I would have,

1305
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:01,340
this is something you just
can't fucking pull this gem out.

1306
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:07,610
Like, you know what? Dressing up like
the professor instead of Gilligan.

1307
01:16:07,611 --> 01:16:11,870
It's basically that formula, but not
that example. You know what I mean?

1308
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:16,650
Like who the fuck lost
the last presidential race

1309
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:21,870
Obama ran against? Who Was it? Mccain?

1310
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:27,000
I don't know. But Tina Fey
did the fucking, the chick,
she did that one to death.

1311
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,101
I Dunno,
you know,

1312
01:16:31,101 --> 01:16:35,420
some bill Bellacheck might be a good
one for as well known as he is. I'm,

1313
01:16:35,421 --> 01:16:37,490
Tom was out in here in la
and I just dressed like him.

1314
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:40,220
I think people would love it.
A hoodie with the fucking cutoff sleeves,

1315
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,900
you just have it up, you know, maybe him.

1316
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:46,400
Okay.

1317
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,450
You know what I, I would
go, Vince Lombardi,

1318
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,720
maybe an old football
coach go out as Tom Landry,

1319
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,070
but I got to pick some with a
fucking blockhead like mine,

1320
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,160
something like that.

1321
01:16:56,970 --> 01:17:00,210
Something along those lines rather than
like the hacky once, you know, want to go.

1322
01:17:00,211 --> 01:17:04,740
And I was fucking Chewbacca. Anything
from star wars, any superhero.

1323
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:10,040
I mean that's just fucking lame.
Trump, Hillary, that's fucking lame.

1324
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,940
Obama, you gave you me, you're going to
get in trouble for being in blackface,

1325
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:18,440
so you got to leave them alone. Ah, Shit.

1326
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,670
That's a good question.
I go out,

1327
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:27,590
I was like Phil Rudd Drama for ACDC
and people say,

1328
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:30,080
who are you? I'd say Phil Rudd. And
they, and people said, who's that?

1329
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:33,380
And I'd be like, Ugh, you gotta be ashamed
of yourself and you just walk away.

1330
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:37,280
So you get to like have a cool costume
and scold people. There's a way to go.

1331
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:41,810
You know, pick somebody who
people you, you feel should know,

1332
01:17:41,811 --> 01:17:46,400
but they don't know addresses Clive birth.
Um,

1333
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,710
I dunno. I don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about anymore. All right.

1334
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:51,470
That's the podcast for
this week. Everybody. Uh,

1335
01:17:51,471 --> 01:17:55,460
I'm going to watch those
Formula One races. I'm hoping
the red sox can come back.

1336
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,160
I just want to be able to sit
down and watch a fucking game.

1337
01:17:58,161 --> 01:17:59,180
I don't know anybody on the team.

1338
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:02,270
I know Petrolia and I know
big poppy and when he leaves,

1339
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:05,130
I'm just going to know Pedroia um,

1340
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:09,830
plus this one Cleveland fan
was like fucking talking
shit to me. A buddy of mine,

1341
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:11,660
he's going to call fucking,
you know,

1342
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:15,500
Tito is playing a chess game with the
fucking red sox and I jokingly wrote back

1343
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:17,150
like, yeah, you don't need to talk to me.

1344
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:20,000
You don't need to talk to a red
sox fan about Tito playing chess.

1345
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:23,390
I saw him play chess a few times when
he was here and it just completely went

1346
01:18:23,391 --> 01:18:25,760
over the guy's head.
You know what I mean?

1347
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,620
I Dunno sometimes just sitting
there going like, hey man,

1348
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:29,930
you guys are looking pretty good.
Nothing

1349
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,440
bullpens, dorming, any were fucking

1350
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,040
where juries and then meals.
I was like,

1351
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:39,730
I hope you can stone when another one is
60 years. I was fucking rooting for you.

1352
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,030
Um, AH, fuck. Do I have
another phone or tomorrow

1353

these guys. Hey, I'm going
to be on the sports junkies.

1355
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:56,650
I love these guys. I haven't talked
to these guys in fucking forever.

1356
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:00,710
The sports junkies, I remember lurch
would always be so fucking sitting there.

1357
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:05,590
All splay old.

Once again,

1368

to buy that car. Um, thank you for,

1375
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:14,310
my tour schedule. I always have a good
time when I go, when I run through there.

1376
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,040
And who's kidding who? I got to get
back to Gainesville to make that up,

1377
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:21,780
which I think I might be
doing in February. Cause uh,

1378
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:24,840
in February I'm going to be
going to the Daytona 500.

1379
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:28,710

1385

All right.
