1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,570
Two three.
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,730
my name on it.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,330
Hey,
what's going on?

4
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:19,331
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast for August 12th,

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,630
2013. How you doing? How'd you like
that intro? Wasn't that pretty cool?

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,830
That was actually, you probably go on
the whole, who were those fine singers?

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,060
Okay.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,530
Jesus Christ. That was the, that just
human beings doing that by themselves.

9
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:36,830
No auto tune was Kanye West.
Dot.

10
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:40,490
In there with a leather fucking skirt
on singing about getting his Dick Schaap

11
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:45,320
despite the fact he just
had a baby daughter. Um,

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,920
uh, fuck. One of my ears is
ringing. I hate when this happens.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,420
Does anybody else have hearing damage?

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:51,820
Yeah,

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,700
come on. Stop ringing. Um,

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,230
every once in a while one
of my ears just goes, Woo.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,530
Okay.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,730
And then it fucking,
you know,

19
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,770
like some heavy metal singer from
fucking decades ago. Like say,

20
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:10,060
remember your childhood, you acid
wash jeans. Anyways, that was the, uh,

21
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:14,530
members of a truth, that salvage
company. Um, I got to know those guys.

22
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:19,390
Uh Oh, it's getting no, through
Busan. I met Deb drama, Bill Smith.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,630
I was out on a drunken night and he
came over to me and he said, hey, hey,

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,070
my name is bill also. Why don't you
tone it down? You freckled cunt.

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,910
And I had to respect
them. No, I'm kidding. Um,

26
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,970
they have a new album out called a pick
me up that's available on iTunes and a

27
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:40,390
new single called Appalachian hilltop.
If you actually like human beings,

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
if you like, if you'd like, yeah,

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,620
if you'd like some sort of heartbeat in
like your music at this point, you know,

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,740
not saying that you guys out
there on your designer drugs,

31
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:51,940
eating each other's faces,

32
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:55,750
watching some guy with a mouse head and
your glow sticks is not a good time.

33
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,410
You know, if I got sucked into heavy
metal, you know, when I, when I was, uh,

34
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,280
coming up in the 80s,
if I was coming up now,

35
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:04,990
I would fucking by probably be there.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,753
I definitely would be.

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,130
I'd sit dead jumping up and down in
unison is that guy played his stereo,

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,650
some club. Um, am I doing the
thing that all old people do?

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,010
I get fearful and I'm just
trashing all the new stuff.

40
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,290
I was reading something recently when, um,
when airplanes first came out, actually,

41
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:28,701
believe it or not,

42
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:33,000
people sometimes I do read and I was
reading this book about when airplanes

43
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:37,800
first came out and, uh, this guy was
pitching, we basically all we had,

44
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:41,100
we had like, we had the army
and the navy and that was it.

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,970
And this somebody in
one of those branches,

46
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:48,630
cause I already fucking forget because
every other word reminds me of something

47
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:50,580
in my life. And I just
start thinking, you know,

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,780
Tom Sawyer got on a boat. I
remember I got on a boat. Yeah.

49
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:57,790
Maybe that digging in
that Kid's pool party.

50
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:01,450
And I flipped over and I got underneath
and then my eyes keep going and like six

51
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,530
pages go by and I have no
fucking idea what I read. Um,

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,110
so I don't,
can't remember the guy's fucking name.

53
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,810
And I think we just had an army and a navy
at this point.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,630
And this was, I know in the, in the
teens, maybe the twenties of law,

55
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,230
I'll just say last century as opposed
to people try to confuse you and go the

56
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,160
20th century,

57
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,923
you know,

58
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,200
the 18th century, 18 hundreds was
the 19th century. You got to do that.

59
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:30,780
Fucking carry the one shit last century.

60
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,803
All right.

61
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,840
And he, he basically said to the army
and the navy, he was like, hey man,

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,620
like these planes, man, they're
going to like change shit. And like,

63
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,900
I don't know if you guys are
going to be ready for it man.

64
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,570
And all the old guard were like,
Rah Rah,

65
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:51,190
go fuck yourself if you got them Kleenex
and your dental floss and your little

66
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:56,020
lawn mower motor that you have in that
thing and engine, right? Fuck you.

67
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:00,130
What are you going to do to make my
iron sides over here? So he's like,

68
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,760
well listen man, like I don't really
want to take it to that level,

69
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,230
but why don't you pull one of
your bad ass boats out? Damn.

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,970
We'll bring her fucking planes over. See
what happens. So they said, all right,

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,820
so this sitting there laughing at him
and shit and they got this fucking thing

72
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,280
that's like sixth,
I don't know.

73
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:19,680
It's really thick and it's really
hard to sick and they keep an AP

74
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,030
little lawnmower fucking engines and they
sank the fucker in like 12 minutes and

75
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,870
there was actually navy admirals crying.

76
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,500
Yeah,

77
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,650
they couldn't believe it.
Um,

78
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,150
they were out of a fucking
job. They thought. So anyways,

79
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,080
is that what I'm doing when
it comes to like dubstep boy,

80
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,300
that shit like I guess I should be
into it. I Dunno. I like these guys.

81
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:54,440
Truth and salvage company. I, I,
they have my stamp of approval.

82
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,400
If it means anything.

83
00:04:55,401 --> 00:05:00,401
I saw them when they opened a for the
black Crowes where the fuck were we?

84
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:02,840
Somewhere in La.
I don't know what.

85
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,900
So I don't know if you like that kind
of music. Give these guys a shot.

86
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:08,360
If you're into other kinds of music,
just keep listening to that shit.

87
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:11,990
I don't give a fuck, but I don't need to
hear your fucking reviews of it. Okay.

88
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,770
I'm just suggesting this is our
defenses being on Twitter makes you,

89
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,210
because no matter what you suggest,
you could just say something simply,

90
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,890
simply like, you know, ice cream is
delicious and then you will curry flavor.

91
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,950
You get it all that she will,
you know,

92
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,010
the fucking someones inverted it,
you know,

93
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,640
and he's got to deal
with these fucking cunts

94
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,050
then as it's coming from a
con. All right, so whatever.

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,870
I feel bad cause I only mentioned Bill
Smith and a band and I probably just

96
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:49,800
fucking created a bunch of
infighting in their van. Right?

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,400
If you're in a fucking band, you got to
be riding around in an event, don't you?

98
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,390
Isn't that how it works? Um,
anyways, let's plow ahead.

99
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:02,360
Shall we people I am,
I am still here in New Orleans.

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,250
As you can tell the quality of
this podcast, the audio, the audio,

101
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,430
at the very least, okay. Is A,

102
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,700
is much better than last week's because
the lovely Nia I actually sent out my

103
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:18,560
bow is strip or the chord, whatever
the fuck you call it. And um,

104
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,450
so at least she can hear me.
At least you can hear the attempts,

105
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,380
you can hear the big swing and a miss.
And I gotta tell you something.

106
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:31,730
I actually was actually rooting for
Alex Rodrigues this week. You know,

107
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,580
I really was not because I liked the
guy that cause I'm all of a sudden a

108
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,230
fucking Yankee Fan.

109
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,550
The bed bath and beyond of the
major league baseball community.

110
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,400
Um, I just really yeah, the
uniforms look like towels.

111
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,150
Very nice towels,
but towels nonetheless.

112
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,910
Okay.

113
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,050
I'm sorry I'm drinking some water here.
I burned my tongue.

114
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,430
Isn't that the fucking worst? I
actually, I ordered room service.

115
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:06,110
I got a grilled cheese and tomato
soup as old people do. And um,

116
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,960
I uncovered the tomato soup,

117
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:13,160
which was way too fucking hot and
I had the grilled cheese there.

118
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,730
So I'm an American.
I can't just eat the grilled cheese.

119
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,520
I've got to take that grilled cheese and
I got a Dunkin into the fucking piping

120
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:24,380
hot tomato soup, so I stick it in my
fucking pie hole. Big Bite of that shit.

121
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,330
It's a lava hot. So what
do I do? I use my brain,

122
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,060
my brain says, hey bill, that's like a,

123
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:34,550
you're not gonna have much tongue left
if we don't do something about this.

124
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,000
How about grabbing some Colt?
So my right hand was like, oh,

125
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:41,570
I got this and reached over to
that nice ice cold glass of water.

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,650
But the,
the,

127
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,710
they had plastic on top of its cellophane
so it wouldn't spill when the lovely

128
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,430
brought it up to the room. So
my right hand's like, you know,

129
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,670
this ain't going to fucking work.

130
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:58,690
And then the rest of my body went
into panic mode and I went boom.

131
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,040
And I just spit out,
spit it out instantly.

132
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,500
I thought it was actually a smart move,

133
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,200
but I immediately started laughing
thinking that that would have been the

134
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:09,350
greatest vine ever or
one of a nice one anyways

135
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,220
is a bill burr each burns
tongue is that it was, you know,

136
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,570
can you actually do a vine where
it's actually just one thing.

137
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,980
It's not a bunch of Shit splice together.
Actually,

138
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,210
I know what the fuck I'm talking about.

139
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,040
I'm just saying it burned my
God damn tongue. All right.

140
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:30,850
People just trying to tell the story.
A fucking puke that thing out.

141
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:33,370
Like, like you have a see a snake when
it's in the middle of eating and all of a

142
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:36,760
sudden you walk up to it and it's like,
oh fuck, I think I'm going to get eaten.

143
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:40,480
And then it's just sorta opens his
mouth in that Yak comes out of it.

144
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,940
And then the snakes sitting
there like, now what's up?
Huh? You want to do this? Um,

145
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,920
basically walking up to a snake while
it's eating is like what happened to me

146
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:54,160
when I went to that buffalo bills
game with my patriots hat on.

147
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:58,740
And they waited till I was taking a
piss. All right. With my Johnson out.

148
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:01,290
And then they pushed me in the back.
Cause that's what they do up there

149
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,450
in the city of lights.

150
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,180
Other than eating the fucking
wings and losing Superbowls,

151
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,690
they wait til you get your
dick out in Buffalo. Don't
ever forget that. All right?

152
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:17,350
So when you go up there to the falls
over there in Niagara, all right?

153
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:20,080
And all of a sudden you get that sensation
that you've gotta take a piss looking

154
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:23,140
at all those.
Just know,

155
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,480
just know that the great grandson of
Joe [inaudible] or whatever the fuck you

156
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:30,834
said his name.

157
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,010
Okay.

158
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,450
You know Fred smartlist junior,

159
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:37,080
my fucking pushed you in the back
is all I'm saying. All right.

160
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,700
Not trying to cause any static
with that great city.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,310
Okay.

162
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,230
Formerly great city, that city that will
rise again like Cleveland, like Detroit,

163
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,390
like de Moines. Um, that'd be tell
you guys how much I love those cities.

164
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,130
I like, I'm a fan of architecture and
when I go there I always just look at,

165
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,090
I'm like this eventually this fucking
place is going to blow up in a good way.

166
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,580
I mean that in a hip hop kind of way.
Look at me,

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,510
look at me straddling the
fence of my whiteness. Um,

168
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,720
this is another sign that I'm getting old.

169
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,260
I have a real problem with that new
Kanye West album that, you know,

170
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:24,060
cause I want to settle down and be a
fucking parrot and all that type of shit.

171
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,500
So I look up to other people that finally
fucking do it and I'm thinking, Whoa,

172
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,880
is this guy going to,
you know,

173
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,520
it's easy going to be changed
somehow with this new fucking album.

174
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:38,350
And it's just still talking about
losing his diamond ring in some girls

175
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,060
snatched.
Isn't that what it's all about?

176
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,583
I Dunno.

177
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,280
Sometimes I glad I looked the way I look
and I was never able to enter the club

178
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,940
scene other than to be ushered
quickly back out the side door.

179
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,610
Um, anyways, what are
we talking about here?

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,490
This is the Monday morning podcast and um,

181
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,860
IOP having a nice August. The summer's
coming to a close, but you know,

182
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,120
this is the golden age of global
warming waters. A little warmer.

183
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,860
It's just starting to tickle your toes,

184
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,180
but you don't have to worry about getting
eaten by a shark yet and you fucking

185
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:20,210
living room. So, you know, I think
you might get an extra three weeks,

186
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,470
three weeks of the summer.

187
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,350
Okay.

188
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,780
You know, what's the greatest is the
football season is starting and you know,

189
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:30,790
I've become a huge college
football fan over the is. And a,

190
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:35,530
I actually realized that my
Lsu Tigers, my adopted. Okay.

191
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:38,320
Before anybody bet rouge
gets mad at me. Like, man,

192
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:41,680
you ain't from prepare you I from air.
Nope.

193
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:45,130
They Call Him York targeted our targets.
Um,

194
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,230
cause that's what everyone in
the south sounds like to me.

195
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,700
Okay.

196
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,800
All right.
Whether you do or you don't,

197
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,800
you do in between ringing ears.

198
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,330
Evidently they're starting their season
and their guests who they're playing,

199
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,540
guess who's back in my life.

200
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,930
They're playing. They're playing
those jackasses on the kickoff day.

201
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,250
I know Alabama's playing somebody else.
Uh, I don't know who the fuck their plan.

202
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,360
Alabama. Can you believe those? You
see what those cuts did this week?

203
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,380
You see what they did to fuck in the
Aggies, you know that came from them.

204
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,670
That horse shit about
Johnny Manzel sign and Shit.

205
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,900
You know that came from an Alabama
booster. You know what did you know it,

206
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,480
you know why? You know, I think it came
from them cause they're fucking scared.

207
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,490
They're scared that skin that's skinny
motherfucker is going to run all around

208
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:45,670
the field like the white Michael Vick.
Alright.

209
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,240
And he's going to fucking beat their
ass as again. I actually saw the replay,

210
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,010
the end of the game last year,
where a Jesus Christ,

211
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,300
you never saw sadder looking faces
when they cut to the stands after that

212
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:03,170
interception, right down there in the
end zone. Tremendous. Oh, look at that.

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,590
I'm looking out on the Mississippi
River that goes a paddle boat.

214
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,260
Whether it was Tom Sawyer once,
you know,

215
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,490
way back in the day when food was fresh
and everybody was dropping the n word,

216
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:17,110
every other word, right? We will
exterminate the Indians. Oh,

217
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:20,710
what a beautiful piece of history.
Um,

218
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,630
all right, what am I doing here? Is it
time to do a little, a little advertising?

219
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:30,260
Would you say? Well, I don't give a shit.
I'm in control of this thing, right?

220
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,580
I'm running, I'm running this motherfucker
fucker. All right. Dollar Shave club,

things in this world that irritate me.

222
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,490
Canadians, fans, script tattoos.

223
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,580
People will get to the front of the
line and shoot the shit with the ticket

224
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:45,660

fucking id out and getting on the Goddamn

225
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,930
plane. I was so many things late
in the world that irritate you.

226
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,810

and come on bill. Pull it together.

233
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:23,620

cans. Let it go. It's time to move on.

I've been a huge fan of that guy since
the first time I saw him and I've never

279
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,860
got to work with them in this capacity.
So I'm really,

280
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:17,870
really excited about doing this.
And uh,

281
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,980

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,530
the daily show's Al Madrigal,
Emmy Award winning.

286
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,330
Al Madrigal you like that?
I have a friend that won an Emmy.

287
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,730
I knew I used no al Madrigal
when it was owl al Madrigal.

288
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,230
Now when I talked to him,
I have to go, excuse me,

289
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:59,130
Emmy Award winning Al Madrigal.
Yeah, me, him and some other guys.

290
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:03,360
We all started this comedy network
called all things comedy. Um,

291
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,620
just cause you know we saw podcast
blowing up in artists always create scenes

292
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,070
and then they never end up with the money.
The business man comes in and a,

293
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,250
we own your podcast and we get all
the money and you get great exposure.

294
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:18,270
Go Fuck Yourself, have fun and
behind the podcast music on VH one.

295
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,420
So we created like a co op
where everybody owns this shit.

296
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,040
We all come together like a cap side
ship trying to keep the sharks away until

297
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,420
the fucking coast guard comes.

298
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,090
It's called all things comedy
and we're doing a live show,

299
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,840
our official kickoff of this wonderful
network that I'm going to begin blogging

300
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:38,670
on. I've already written a blog. Um,

301
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,670
and we're going to get that up
hopefully sometime this week. And, uh,

302
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
that's going to be an August
on August 28th at Largo.

303
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,370
It's going to be featuring as many
people from the, uh, the all things,

304
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:52,470
comedy family. Al's going to
be there. I'm going to be,

305
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:56,360
their top pop is going to be there.
I believe Tom Segora, we've got a,

306
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,350
and those who aren't are
going to try and make videos.

307
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,300
It's going to be a great night.
All right.

308
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:03,780
It's at Largo on La Cienega
here in Los Angeles,

309
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,270
August 28th. All right. Back
to the God damn podcast.

310
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,200
Um, so anyways, uh,

311
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:13,920
the past couple of weeks I've been
talking about the food down here in New

312
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,280
Orleans saying how delicious slash
unhealthy it is and how you can't find

313
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,700
fucking Kale, excuse me, as a drink,

314
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:25,200
more cold water for my fucking
scalded tongue, blah. Um,

315
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,200
I actually bought a juicer this week to
somehow combat all the fried food that

316
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:36,190
I've been eating. And a, I started
drinking that shit that, that guy and uh,

317
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,900
uh, fat dead and kind of sick,
whatever the fuck is called,

318
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,160
fat sick and nearly dead.

319
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,370
Okay.

320
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:48,250
Just sick, fatty with dead
fucking something, whatever. Um,

321
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,910
I've been drinking that Shit, man. I
gotta tell you something that's delicious.

322
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,840
Not only is delicious,
you crave it after awhile and uh,

323
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,210
okay.

324
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,670
Yeah, I think I dropped like four
or five pounds. Good pounds too.

325
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,180
You know the flabby once I was joking
on Twitter saying how I was in,

326
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,900
I was in buttoned down shirt shape
and I actually want to get into like,

327
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,350
I want to be in shitting
down no shirt on shape.

328
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,380
Okay.

329
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,830
I Dunno what, I know bill Cosby
did a bit on this, but he's,

330
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,520
so what the fuck happens
when you sit down?

331
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,020
You stand up and look
sideways and Mariella Guy,
you know what? That is a bad,

332
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,650
dare I say it's kind of cue shows
that I like the occasional snickers.

333
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,140
Right. And you should, they're pitching
it yourself like you're in an old,

334
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:43,790
old school, special k commercial
going on. Right. That's not that bad.

335
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,624
It's not that bad.

336
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Then you just sit down and like three
of shit just lands on your thighs.

337
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,813
You know,

338
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,240
for the life of me, I can't,
what is, what happens?

339
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,010
The hip bones move up to your fucking
man tits and everything just gets blown

340
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:06,600
out. I have no idea. But sitting down
without a shirt on, you know, that's,

341
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:10,470
that's the truth moment of your fucking
physique that you're going to see all

342
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,180
day. Stop standing up, sucking
in your gut. All right?

343
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,580
You want to see,
you want to see the damage you've done.

344
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,970
Maybe you're not ready for

345
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,993
all right.

346
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,450
This is like the ring. When you
looked at that fucking chick's face,

347
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,980
you judges opens up and you land
in a fucking walk in closet.

348
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,130
Oh my God. I don't know what happened
to me. I'm not even that bad a shape.

349
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,380
So I said, fuck this.
I got a juicer. And um,

350
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,800
I just did a quick gig up in Chicago,
came right back, this private thing. Um,

351
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,320
so I don't know. I ate halfway decent
up there. I did find a Vegan restaurant,

352
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:52,650
but then of course they had
had some Chicago Pizza. Um,

353
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,130
yeah.

354
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,850
So now I came back and I had my little
fucking grilled cheese sandwich and

355
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:58,684
tomato soup.

356
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,720
So now my body is starting
to pull me back to the,

357
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,440
to the bay,
the dark side.

358
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,270
And that's what I've really learned
about trying to stay in shape.

359
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,830
It's all about keeping your
brain out in front of your body.

360
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,290
Okay.

361
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,030
Keeping your fucking wits about you.

362
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,430
Okay.

363
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,940
Like this shit, it's like food. You don't,
when they need to say food is a drug,

364
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,310
I didn't believe him, but I,
I'm totally convinced of it now.

365
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,690
It's like when you're reading bad,

366
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,920
when you just go on like a three month
bender have just eaten bad and in your

367
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:31,790
head like,
Oh God,

368
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:35,930
I got to stop by of fucking cheeseburger
and you just keep going and then that

369
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:37,640
makes you want cookies
and all that type of shit.

370
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,090
It's the food equivalent to like locking
yourself in a Roman just free basic for

371
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:49,130
three months. That's what you
doing. So when I tried to do,

372
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:50,690
when I'm eating,
eating bad like this,

373
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:54,470
I just talked to a buddy of mine outside
of the business who's trying to lose

374
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:55,520
some fucking wait.

375
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,780
I was trying to tell him that like you
gotta keep your head out in front of it

376
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:03,530
and just go like, I want that,
but I'm going to eat this.

377
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,400
Even the in,
in,

378
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,650
in that moment when you're looking at
that apple as opposed to that fucking

379
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,820
glorious, whatever
you're looking at, right?

380
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:18,650
Toasted roast beef and cheese with the
fucking pickles and the chips and all

381
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:22,830
that. The last thing your
body's like, that's fine.

382
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,820
Just what the fuck I want.
And you got to reach for that apple.

383
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,580
You got to fucking hit that,
that crack pipe instead.

384
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,870
And I'm telling you the second you
get two, three bites in, you're like,

385
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,790
oh thank God, thank God I did that.
Then you fight cause so from what I've,

386
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,070
what I've read the braid little,

387
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,710
I've read your body is
actually craving nutrition.

388
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,723
You know,

389
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,990
that's why we eat Chinese food.
Like fucking 35 minutes later,

390
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:54,270
you're hungry again because your
body's still craving nutrition.

391
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:56,250
There wasn't like a fucking
ounce of it in that shit,

392
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,360
at the risk of getting sued by that
entire fucking continent of China

393
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,360
country. Go Fuck Yourself. Um,

394
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,800
so that's what I would say
if you could try to do,

395
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:14,920
that's what I'm trying to do as I'm
trying to keep my head out in front of us.

396
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:18,640
So I got that grilled cheese sandwich
and I got to tomato soup and I said,

397
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:21,010
all right, I gotta get back on
the fucking Green Gumbo here is,

398
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:24,670
I'm calling it because I'm in
New Orleans and uh, that's it.

399
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,960
I'm back on that shit for the last two
tomorrow morning to wake up and make

400
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:32,380
another one. Bingo. Bango
I'm trying to do two a day.

401
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:36,370
Jewson and then one day having
the fucking, uh, you know,

402
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:39,850
a healthy dinner and then I'd go
on the treadmill for a half hour.

403
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:44,680
There's no fucking way you're not going
to drop away. All right, so there you go.

404
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,950
So stop doing those stupid ass fad diets.
EA.

405
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,820
It's the fucking cornflakes died.
Oh, I do it. He could plagues.

406
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,690
They can eat as much as I wanted.
That bullshit veggie eventually.

407
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,390
Okay.

408
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,750
You don't really, I think the really,
it really is, is not even like,

409
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:05,460
it's not even the fucking diet. It's
the, once you get to your weight,

410
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,150
what do you do then? You know,
once you get down to your weight,

411
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,950
at some point you're going
to be looking around.

412
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:15,000
It's like he got out of jail and
there's some ice cream right over there.

413
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,130
You're an adult.
You don't have to go more.

414
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,830
Right? That's how you become
a fat fuck as an adult.

415
00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:27,490
There's no one to say you had enough
cookies. So on you fair enough.

416
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:31,540
Boots put on a condom.
It's all on you.

417
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,920
You gotta be your own fucking parent
until you get a lady and your life.

418
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,380
And then she starts
fucking nagging at you.

419
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,850
[inaudible] get out the rug ass.
Fuck you lady.

420
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,060
Where did you become so angry?
Um,

421
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,420
so that would be my advice when
you're just on, if right now,

422
00:25:57,421 --> 00:26:00,210
if you listen to this shit and
you're on a bad fucking road,

423
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,860
I'm telling you one of these days in
the future, you're going to wake up,

424
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,990
you're going to be sitting
down on the side of your bed,

425
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:10,260
you're going to glance it to a mirror and
you're going to be like, what the fuck?

426
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,740
What have I done to myself?
You just stand up real quick.

427
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,310
You can try to suck it in and try
to deny the truth that you just saw.

428
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,511
Hear that?

429
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:26,190
That's the steam engine coming back
on the fucking racist genocide.

430
00:26:26,191 --> 00:26:31,050
One Oh one. Um, the fuck am I to, yeah,

431
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:34,080
just make yourself eat an apple
or just eat a fucking salad.

432
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,960
You gotta you gotta turn that
you've got to turn the boat around.

433
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,850
Yeah.

434
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,800
That's what I'm trying to do.

435
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,390
I've got to do what I fucking went back
up to like almost a buck 90 and now back

436
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:49,260
down to like the mid one seventies.
I got to the fucking worst.

437
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,930
Just trying to lose like 15
pounds is the fucking worst.

438
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:56,370
I can't imagine people who got, uh,
got to lose more than that. So, uh,

439
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,610
you know, I don't, I don't know how this
became more of a weight loss podcast. Um,

440
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,280
but I think it's working enough. This guy
actually sent me a letter. He said, uh,

441
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,520
podcast success story,
Dear Wilbur,

442
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,170
you sir are a god amongst men.
Ah, Jesus, I wish that was true.

443
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,880
He goes, I used to be a depressed
piece of shit. You're a,

444
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:21,690
your typical, the world is
against me. Nobody likes me.

445
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:24,360
Nobody wants me fucking moron.
That's who I was.

446
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,600
But your advice on stepping back and
making fun of every negative annotation I

447
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,310
have. Is that a word? Did he write that

448
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,140
d type that correctly?
Or My homeboy annotation,

449
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,790
I dunno not to make you depressed
again. I don't know how to spell. Um,

450
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,810
he goes, I have fucking change
my life. I'm 80 pounds lighter.

451
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,740
I got a great girl and I've gotten
two count them two promotions.

452
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,640
You're a comedian.
You're not obligated to be Oprah.

453
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:54,020
Amaury but you still make a
difference. Thank you, sir,

454
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:58,490
for knocking me back into cohesion. Uh,
you probably make 20 times more than me.

455
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:02,900
I doubt that sir, with the
two big promotions there. Um,

456
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,900
but I know,
but I owe you a drink next time I see you.

457
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:09,950
And if you're in Canada or being town,
you stay classy, sir. Wow, that's great.

458
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,400
Good for you sir. Look at
that. He turned it around

459
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,790
somehow. My negative, whatever
the fuck my shaming, my fat shame.

460
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,930
My for shame has been working.
Um,

461
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,640
all right, enough about that
shit. So that's what I'm
doing. I'm drinking the, I'm,

462
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,710
I'm doing that fat,

463
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:35,711
sick and nearly dead juicing thing
and it's like all green stuff.

464
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:40,850
It's Kale, celery, a couple of
handfuls of parsley, cucumber,

465
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:45,320
Zucchini, and then alignment to
take the bitterness out. And uh,

466
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,290
I get tell you it's fucking delicious.
I love it.

467
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,710
And um,
I dunno,

468
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:54,930
I think I'm going to incorporate
this in every couple of months.

469
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:56,100
Just go back to that.
Well,

470
00:28:56,101 --> 00:29:00,330
just juice for like four or five days
just so I stay out in front of it just so

471
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:04,080
I don't have to have sit down one
day and have that fucking beach ball.

472
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,400
I got a thing on my button down shirts.
It's the one, two third button down.

473
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,750
When that button's starts to look like
it's doing the iron cross between both

474
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:17,100
sides of my shirt. That's an
amazing guy. He fucking jerk off.

475
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,570
All right.

476
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,570
And then what happens is they lay off
the beer and then I just start slamming

477
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:24,450
whiskey.
Like that's my initial when I've,

478
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,770
we've begun our initial
defendant until our dieting is,

479
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:31,860
I go from drinking Pale Ales to whiskey.

480
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,020
I really am a freckled
mess. All right. Um,

481
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,650
so anyways, I had a lot
of downtime last week. Um,

482
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,520
I wasn't working. I had a couple of
days off from my episode of Glee.

483
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,430
Um, it's really long episode. You, I can't
believe how long the film in this book.

484
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,000
You know,
I guess this is how they do it over there.

485
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:57,940
I'm to sell a hell of a budget.

486
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,743
MMM.

487
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,470
I got into one on Netflix and I
started watching a Ken Burns the war.

488
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,510
I know. I'm like, that came out like five,
six years ago. If you haven't seen it,

489
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:12,370
if you like me and you
late to the party dude,

490
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:14,560
like that's my
recommendation for the week.

491
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,460
It's a seven potter on World War II.

492
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,800
Each one's is about an
hour and 50 minutes long.

493
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:24,740
And I know that sounds like I just told
you to watch every episode of lost.

494
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Um,
just,

495
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,910
it's effortless to watch this thing other
than the amount of times you have to

496
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:37,710
hit pause and go, Jesus Christ,
I haven't done shit with my life.

497
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,200
That's what, that's what it
makes me feel like. I can't,

498
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,160
okay.

499
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,850
I can't even begin to, uh, you
gotta you just gotta watch it.

500
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,811
You've got to watch it.

501
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:51,730
And what's great is it really
ties the whole war together.

502
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,740
Where for me, I've always seen
like, they'll always do stuff on it,

503
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:01,741
on the history channel that there'll be
talking about the war in the Pacific or

504
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:06,250
they'll talk about the blitzkrieg or
they'll talk about d day and occasionally

505
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:07,870
they'll talk about northern Africa,

506
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,030
but this thing kind of
goes in chronological order
of the whole damn thing.

507
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,000
And um,

508
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,590
okay.

509
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:21,180
It's, it's, I don't know. I can't
explain it. It would be like,

510
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,230
what the fuck was that movie that they
showed and it showed it backwards and the

511
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:28,560
guy tattooed shit on his arm.
I can't remember what the fuck it was.

512
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,880
It's like finally seeing
that thing going forwards.

513
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,330
Um,
it's just,

514
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,720
it's unfucking real what?

515
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,610
Jesus, I'm too stupid to fucking just
go. Just go watch the God damn thing.

516
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,170
Why don't you people 17 years old lying
saying they're 18 and just going out on

517
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:51,770
the front lines and just listening
to these fucking Bob's whistle again,

518
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,190
seeing all your friends
getting blown up and just,

519
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,440
just having to resign to fate while this
one's either going to hit me over it.

520
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:00,980
It isn't, and I'm still going to
be fucking shooting at these guys.

521
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,813
MMM.

522
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,490
They, that the stories that
they see, they talk about that,

523
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,990
that the guys who were flying over on
the bombardiers before they had the

524
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:13,720
escorts and Shit and you had to do
25 fucking missions before, you know,

525
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,500
you had basically completed
your obligation and nobody
had ever made it past 14.

526
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,810
It's a fucking suicide mission. And, uh,

527
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,400
they had a guy who actually survived
the ship because he was in that little

528
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,670
fucking skylight at
the bottom of the plane

529
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,610
and he got shot the fucking arm and
went through him and killed one of his

530
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:36,400
buddies and I don't he,
and then he still went back,

531
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,190
flew another one and got shot again.
And that's the thing that I,

532
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,980
that basically saved him was
because he kept getting shot

533
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,440
okay.

534
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,740
That he wasn't physically well enough to
go back up in the God damn plane again.

535
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,461
And you know,

536
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:53,080
and I actually have the fucking
nerve to be afraid of flying.

537
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,100
I'm landing in fucking El Paso,
Texas going, oh Geez, oh gee,

538
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:01,660
there's nobody shooting at us.

539
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,510
I never felt like such a fucking
pussy in my life till, I mean,

540
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,870
I feel bad enough when I watched
like a UFC event, you know,

541
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,440
or I watched one of those, uh, the one
of those shows about going to prison,

542
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,691
you know,
I,

543
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:21,340
I watched the training for UFC and I
would be like that the I three times

544
00:33:21,341 --> 00:33:23,590
kicking that,
that heavy bag with my leg,

545
00:33:23,591 --> 00:33:27,040
it would be all bruised up
and I'd be like, it stinks.
I want to get out of here.

546
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,510
It just, can I be the guy
who washes the tee shirts?

547
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,370
Can I mop up the mat? The Mat that
you guys wrestle on, you know?

548
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:38,963
Okay.

549
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,820
I Dunno. He just, whatever.

550
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:44,150
Ken Burns the war and he's done a whole
bunch of documentaries and now he's

551
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:48,430
doing one right now that is, uh,
that's about the Vietnam War.

552
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,760
Now I'm all paranoid that I
said his name wrong. You know,

553
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,330
all of a sudden that sounded like some guy
in Espn, but that's Candy Maine, right?

554
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,040
Yeah. Ken Birch. There we go. All right.
I've got the right guy. All right.

555
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,950
He's the one writing
one right now. He's, uh,

556
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,470
making one right now on the Vietnam War,
which I'm definitely gonna Watch.

557
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:10,070
You know, he already made one
on the civil war, so I'm like,

558
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,100
I'm going gonna fucking watch all of
these things. And then, uh, I dunno,

559
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,240
six months later I'll forget most of it.
I'll probably combine a couple,

560
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,180
two or three wars.

561
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,800
I'll get drunk and I'll just start
spewing out information about Lincoln

562
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:26,090
speaking in a, he would Jima. All right.

563
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,230
Anyway, let's get on with the podcast.
Highly recommend that if you, uh,

564
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,400
if you get a chance, if you have seven
hours to kill, I highly recommend that

565
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,590
if you have chicken pox,
it'd be a great way to, uh,

566
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,800
forget about the itching
for a good seven hours. Um,

567
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,080
yeah.

568
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,050
What else? Oh, tonight. Oh, last night.

569
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,380
Okay.

570
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,100
This is weird because I'm
taping this on Sunday. Um,

571
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,640
right now I'm taping this Sunday
afternoon, New Orleans time and uh,

572
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:59,450
I'm actually really excited
obviously because, uh,

573
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,710
the season five, I guess the
second has of seasons, season five,

574
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,990
the breaking bad premiers tonight.

575
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,800
Did I start like 12 sentences there?
Let me try that again. These seasoned,

576
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,830
the second half of the season five
series premiere of breaking bad starts

577
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:19,684
tonight.

578
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,660
Okay.

579
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,230
Do you guys ever wonder why it never
became a game show host is cheesy as I am.

580
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,740
Or like ever like hosted the family
feud or was standing next to Billy Bush

581
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,300
[inaudible] like they have to read stuff.

582
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,443
Okay.

583
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,530
You know, I know I have the head to
be on. I don't have the hairline,

584
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,580
but I do have the head,

585
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,940
you know, I fuck it. Who gives
a shit anyways, breaking bad.

586
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:49,490
It's coming back tonight
and I can't fucking wait.

587
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,860
I thought there was only five episodes.
It's just fun. What? There's eight.

588
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,040
So I'm psyched about that.
And um, I've already,

589
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:59,660
I think I've already gotten past the
sadness that it's ending and I'm just

590
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:01,950
talking as a fan. Forget about
the fact that I used to, you know,

591
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,790
get in there every once in a while.
Um,

592
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,280
yeah,

593
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,280
I can't wait for this thing
to come out on box set and,

594
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:16,330
uh, and just go back and just go
through that whole thing again.

595
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,153
MMM.

596
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,651
A couple of months back,

597
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:24,040
I actually watched the first two
episodes of breaking bad and just seeing,

598
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,370
you know, Cranston's character, Walter
White has the hair and he's just meeting,

599
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,230
uh, Jesse for the first time. Do you
know, I heard, I don't know if this true,

600
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,740
but I heard that Jesse was actually,
that character was gonna.

601
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,500
They were gonna have him killed in the
first few, but he was such a good actor,

602
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,010
uh, Aaron Paul that they are, and
they liked the character so much.

603
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,220
I don't know if that's true.
I should stop fucking making up shit.

604
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,520
I think I remember reading this. Like
what, why would you do that bill?

605
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,391
Why would you,

606
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:54,570
it's one of the few bridges you can
actually cross in this business and now

607
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:57,000
you're going to burn it by
putting out misinformation.

608
00:36:57,001 --> 00:37:01,830
What the fuck is wrong
with you? Um, anyways,

609
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:06,210
I was, I was somewhere at killing time.
Oh, yesterday when I was in Chicago.

610
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,573
Okay.

611
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,210
And I was a in the hotel and they had a
marathon on of those doomsday preppers

612
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,463
and uh,

613
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,050
they're all fucked.

614
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,390
Do you know why all those
doomsday preppers are fucked

615
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,330
is because they're loners.

616
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,710
They might survive some initial shit.
They might last a month,

617
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:34,320
they might last a year,
but they're just,

618
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,600
instead of ripping the bandaid off
like me and just getting fucking,

619
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:42,960
you know, bludgeoned to death
within the first 24 hours

620
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,370
or vaporized from something blowing up
that that's, that's my doom state plan.

621
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,770
My Dooms Day prepping that I do is that
I live in probably the most dangerous

622
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:02,390
city that you could possibly
live in as far as earthquakes,

623
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,640
as far as the water supply,

624
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,120
as far as the fucking inability
to get the fuck out of there.

625
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,810
I really should get a helicopter license
and tried to go on Ebay and buy some

626
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:15,530
fucking use chopper.
Cause other than that I'm fucked.

627
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,630
But there's,
there's a,

628
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,850
there's a piece that you gain from just
being completely fucked is you just

629
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:22,684
saying,
what am I going to do?

630
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm fucked.
All right.

631
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:33,320
Oh, I get a great idea. I'm
going to sell a doomsday prepper,

632
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,980
um,
kit

633
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,820
for people who don't want to
prep and what it's going to be.

634
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:45,821
It's going to be a beautiful locket
that you where they'll have a mail once,

635
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:46,671
a little more masculine,

636
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:50,600
like put some spikes on it or some shit
for male or female and when you open it

637
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:55,280
up, there's one little cyanide
pill in there. There you go.

638
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,480
You just off yourself.
That's all it is collapsing.

639
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:04,430
There's fighting in the street. You just
pop it in there and that's it. It's over.

640
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,103
You know

641
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,680
you want to live in beyond dead body
patrol going out there with the fucking

642
00:39:13,261 --> 00:39:14,940
scheme as gone,
having a barrier,

643
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:18,720
all those cuts before they
give out disease because
that's what you're going to

644
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:20,010
be doing if you survive.

645
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:23,610
If you're a low level human like
myself where you're really not bringing

646
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,330
anything to the table,
if they let you survive,

647
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,740
if they decide out of the
fucking glue to let you survive,

648
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,580
that's what you're going to be all that's
going to be your first fucking jobs.

649
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,160
Okay?

650
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,010
Other than getting naked and have him
throw the fucking lie all over here,

651
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:42,900
whatever they fucked Lyme, is that
what they throw it? Lie, lie Ma.

652
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,150
You got to get rid of the body lice,
your job,

653
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,210
you're going to go out there and some
sort of Tarzan fucking bikini bottoms with

654
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:55,300
that powdered sugar all over you.
And you're going to just start,

655
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:56,134
you're going to up,

656
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,123
it's gonna be yet.

657
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,040
So my suggestion is either get some
cyanide or learn how to use operate a

658
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:06,630
backhoe cause other than that,
if you survive,

659
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:10,320
you're going to be standing there with
a shovel getting a fucking sunburn that,

660
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,440
uh, the, the, the, the
modern world has never seen.

661
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,433
Okay.

662
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,460
Anyways, I'm watching this, this
doomsday prepper thing and uh,

663
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,020
they got all these guys doing this shit
and they got this one dude who's just,

664
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,280
you know, he's got like fucking
three years worth of shit.

665
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,940
He's got flat screen TVs,
got all his fucking stuff down.

666
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,130
So I love the flat screen TV.
That's hilarious to me.

667
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,060
Like it's the end of the world,
but somehow cable still exists.

668
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,910
Somehow somebody is at the head
of the cables, cables central,

669
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:46,601
wherever that is,

670
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:50,790
flipping the switch so you can see the
final eight episodes of breaking bad. Um,

671
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,120
despite the fast, everybody
connected with Hollywood is now gone.

672
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,733
Um,

673
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,240
yeah.

674
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,100
Except for Wesley Snipes. I'm sure
he's got a bunker somewhere. Um, yeah,

675
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:05,140
if you've got the Ballston and
I pigged the government taxes,

676
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:06,010
you definitely got you got,

677
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:09,610
you have a strategy in place
and plus just even if that shit,

678
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:12,520
even if he didn't take martial arts,
just the sword swinging alone,

679
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:15,370
that he had to learn the choreography
that would scare the fuck out of most

680
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:17,220
zombies and they turned
the other way. Right? Yeah.

681
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,863
MMM.

682
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,340
So he's got all of this stuff and
he's sitting there talking about he,

683
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:28,260
he's still afraid of the
Russians and a nuclear holocaust.

684
00:41:28,261 --> 00:41:31,410
He's been prepping for 30 years because
that's basically what they used to scare

685
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:36,200
the shit out of us about. Um, I came
in in the tail end of it in the 70s,

686
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,690
and, uh, this guy was older than me,

687
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:43,580
so they psychologically fuck this guy
up so bad that he was now, you know,

688
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,940
stockpiling this hole in the ground.

689
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:49,070
And then he found out that,
uh,

690
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,330
recently declassified information said
that the Russians had detonated some

691
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,340
fucking, I dunno, 200 mega ton
fucking something or other,

692
00:41:58,341 --> 00:41:59,840
but the biggest bomb ever detonated.

693
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:03,290
They did it and he realized
that he wasn't deep enough.

694
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:08,660
So he went out and he bought this big
steel fucking tube and the whole time he's

695
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:11,270
doing this,
this guy is like 200 pounds overweight.

696
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:12,650
Yeah.

697
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,460
And it's like, dude, you better,

698
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,440
you better deal with that first.
Like you,

699
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,580
you're going to drop up a fucking heart
attack before they drop a fucking bomb

700
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,740
on us. And he finally addressed
it. He says, you know,

701
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:26,570
I probably should get
myself in better shape.

702
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,740
Of course he was sitting down the entire
time and even with the tee shirt on,

703
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:34,580
the guy was so fucking fat, you could
tell that he was finished. But um,

704
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,210
so I actually liked the guy cause he
finally addressed the fact that he was out

705
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:42,350
of shape and needed to do something
about it. But towards the end,

706
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,550
there was this 15 year old
kid who since the age of 12,

707
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,210
um, maybe it was a little bit older, one
was 2008. That was five years ago. He's,

708
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:53,050
what's 17?

709
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:57,700
He was 12 one to 2008 a
banking collapse happened.

710
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,470
So he went on and he,

711
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,010
he internet and he started reading up
on banks and probably saw the conspiracy

712
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:06,220
theory that I did. And it scared the
fucking shit out of him as a 12 year old.

713
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,940
And this fucking kid has been like
scavenging slash stealing shit wherever he

714
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:13,600
can because he doesn't have any money.

715
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,920
And he has all these guns and he
has these fucking swords and shit.

716
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,810
He dresses in fatigues and stuff.

717
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,200
And his mother is just sitting
there going like, you know,

718
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,940
I always wanted a normal thought.

719
00:43:24,941 --> 00:43:29,290
I don't know why he feels he has to
do this and that. And now he's got,

720
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:31,180
he's brought a friend into a fold and the,

721
00:43:31,181 --> 00:43:34,810
and then they brought it a into the fold
and he brought a third person into the

722
00:43:34,811 --> 00:43:39,640
fold. And it's literally like,
lady, Lady, did you see Colin?

723
00:43:39,641 --> 00:43:43,540
Bye. All right. I'm not
saying this kid is like that,

724
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:46,270
but like what the fuck
are you doing? Her, her,

725
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,160
her big parental moment was
he's not allowed to go to
the gun range without her.

726
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,350
She goes there and let some practice in.
This fucking kid was great.

727
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,590
His spread was basically from,
you know,

728
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,030
one ventricle to the fucking
other. All right. This,

729
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,200
is there two ventricles or is that an AOL?
I don't fucking know.

730
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,080
I'll Google map the heart at
the end of this. Um, yeah,

731
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:18,800
he was basically hitting it
all center mass right around,

732
00:44:18,801 --> 00:44:20,720
right around your fucking
heart. Right. And,

733
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,040
but then he goes home and he's got the
ammo when he has the guns in his fucking

734
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:30,020
bedroom. And um, you know, he's
like, I'm thankful Lou, uh,

735
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,040
grow up with guns.
He doesn't even

736
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,160
have a southern accent.
Why am I fucking trash in the south again?

737
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,850
Okay.

738
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:41,230
Hear this fucking awful haircut. He didn't
have a girlfriend. He's a fucking, he's,

739
00:44:41,231 --> 00:44:44,410
he's going down this rabbit hole
and she's just letting them do it.

740
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,090
And, uh, I find it really disturbing.

741
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,940
I don't find it disturbing when like
I see those kids smiling and they have

742
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,760
rifles and their parents have
gotten them into hunting.

743
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,950
I know people out where I live
and when I lived in New York City,

744
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:06,720
they freak out about that stuff.
Um, really intolerant of it,

745
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,790
you know, as they eat a
fucking chicken burrito. Uh,

746
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:16,000
but I don't, I think you should know how
to hunt and do all that type of shit.

747
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:20,170
You know what? I didn't know
I could fucking kill. I could
kill a pig, a wild boar.

748
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,490
I would love to go out and do that.

749
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,340
Yeah.

750
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,440
Fucking shoot that day.
You know,

751
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,210
I want to hear it from the rednecks
out there. What am I in for?

752
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:31,800
Yeah.

753
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,160
If I miss and I think comes
up when we don't, they just
start fucking eaten. Yeah.

754
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,380
The pigs. Right. They fucking
eat anything. What I scare
them or what I look like.

755
00:45:40,381 --> 00:45:42,300
One of those white
chocolate covered pretzels.

756
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:45,603
Okay.

757
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:51,340
They think my freckles was
salt. It'd be all over it. Um,

758
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,170
would it be okay? Can slips
in somebody, you know,

759
00:45:53,171 --> 00:45:54,880
next time I do one of my
southern towards here.

760
00:45:54,881 --> 00:45:59,020
Can you guys take me pig hunting and uh,
I want to fucking do it up.

761
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,850
I want to go Rambo style with a crossbow,
but I do want to have a backup Uzi.

762
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,110
And I know if you're a redneck,

763
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:09,790
I know you have a fucker newsy that's
been fucking handed down since the the

764
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:09,850
eighties.

765
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,090
Whenever the fuck who's came out before
the laws prevented you from getting them?

766
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,390
It's for while I'm hunting quail.

767
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:17,720
Okay.

768
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,330
Uh, it's just America. Um,

769
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,040
okay.

770
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,730
All right, let's get into some
questions for the week here. Uh,

771
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:27,500
I'll read the last couple of advertisers.
What don't I do that? All right,

772
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:31,670
here we go. He had a bad first quarter.
I did great in the second quarter.

773
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:35,570
Let's get out. We've got another 30
minutes. It's when this game, here we go.

774
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,240
Last couple legal zoom,
everybody.

775
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,970
Most Americans don't have a will.

776
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,110
But why you don't want government rules
dictating what happens to your property

777
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:48,320
and minor children. Do
you, so why procrastinate?

778
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,250
Most people say it's too expensive
or it's too time consuming.

779
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:56,030
My answer is legal zoom.com too expensive.

780
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,690
You're going to love legal zooms,
reasonable prices, too. Time consuming.

781
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:04,310
Most people finish the online process
and just 20 minutes and we're not talking

782
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:06,410
some fill in the blank bs form here.

783
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:11,360

794
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,270
but they are not a law firm. Law Firm.
God Dang it. I had it till the end.

795
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,460
All right, eva, you're screening calls,

796
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:05,080
closing deals and making money all while
lounging poolside in the summer sun.

797
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,700
Thanks to eat voice,

798
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,810

your people that drive your business.

you are, he voiced, we'll find you.

801
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,470
Um,
if you don't have time to take a call,

802
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,040
it's routed to your voicemail and you
can read it at your convenience as a text

803
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:27,550
message. Evil not only gives you
an edge over your competitors,

804
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,970
it takes away the edge the big
companies have over you right now.

805
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,600
That's a huge point right there. People,

839

bur that stamps.com enter birth are right.
There you go.

840
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,970
There you go. Into the wild
blue yonder. All right,

841
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:41,910
let's get into the uh, the rates
for this week. Italy. Hey Belle.

842
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,590
You mentioned a couple of weeks ago that
you were thinking about going to Italy

843
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,390
and you wanted some advice about
where to go. My lady is Italian,

844
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,240
so I've been there a bunch of times.
Here's the deal.

845
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:56,420
First you should decide if you
want to see the north or the south.

846
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,950
The North is more industrialized with
lots of interest in interesting cities.

847
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:04,100
Yeah. And San Marino too. All right.

848
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,570
Isn't that where the blue bloods day a
good food and as a more vibrant urban

849
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:13,370
feel. The South is more country style
with good weather and beautiful nature.

850
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,870
I think I kind of liked that.

851
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,800
You could think of it being very roughly
like the difference between New England

852
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,780
and the south back of the states.

853
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:24,710
And the winner of the north will be
pretty cold and the south will be a little

854
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:29,500
more ball. Me, they both are the shit.
All right, cool. Ah, where's Rome?

855
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:33,630
Rome's like right in the middle.
I got to get to know that type of stuff.

856
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,660
Okay.

857
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,760
I can't wait to go.
Um,

858
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,140
and that's what I'm going to do
right before my a European tour.

859
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:40,470
Yeah.

860
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,530
Uh, is I've got to go to Italy for a
couple of days, like two, three days.

861
00:51:43,531 --> 00:51:45,780
Why the fuck wouldn't you if you're
going to be over there anyways,

862
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,790
I'll get acclimated to the time,

863
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,380
the time change while eating some of
the best food on the planet. I mean,

864
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:55,890
my two favorite kinds of food
is a Italian and Japanese.

865
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:57,990
Those are my two favorites.

866
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:58,870
Okay.

867
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:03,490
I love them both fucking delish.
Um,

868
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:06,730
so I got to figure out where I'm going
to go on because I only have three days.

869
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,700
Okay.

870
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,270
I don't want to go there and
try and do a bunch of things.

871
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,520
Okay.

872
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,010
I think it just want to go there
and eat a big into stadiums.

873
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,220
Maybe I would see the Roman Colosseum,
but uh,

874
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,420
okay.

875
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:25,220
I think I just want to, um, I
don't know what I want to do.

876
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:30,221
I just want to eat some fucking just
great place and tastes really clean food

877
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:34,460
with like what I show respect
about Italian. Just how,

878
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:38,410
how much they give a shit about
the food making process. You know,

879
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:41,740
I've told the shit the
foist just to no more ice,

880
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,830
no more Italian guys back in the day when
I was living in Boston and I swear to

881
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:45,491
God they would watch,

882
00:52:45,491 --> 00:52:49,390
we make a meal and it would
like be upsetting them and
eventually they just have

883
00:52:49,391 --> 00:52:51,890
to take over, be like, just,
just, just get out of here.

884
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:59,950
Like they would watch you fucking up
a piece of meat. It would literally,

885
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:02,350
it would,
it would owed upset them.

886
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:04,020
Okay.

887
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:08,700
You know, so you gotta respect
it. All right, here we go.

888
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,340
Salads. Oh by the way, that's
another great part in the, the,

889
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,670
the Ken Burns documentary is um,

890
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,420
okay.

891
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,860
You know, I always saw Mussolini
given the speeches. Yeah. Oh,

892
00:53:19,861 --> 00:53:22,740
he's got one great one. When he's, he
keeps doing this thing with his hand like,

893
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:27,390
Hey, let them have Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah. Like he's just fucking talking shit.

894
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:31,740
Like Hitler makes me want to speak German
and Mussolini makes me want to speak

895
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:36,420
Italian. Just watching those speeches,
watch it. Hitler's screaming and yelling

896
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,990
like, you know, we used to be quiet,
no sock up second a shit. I mean,

897
00:53:41,991 --> 00:53:42,824
is that what he's saying?

898
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:47,800
I want to know what the fuck is he
yelling about and Mussolini that look at

899
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:51,830
confidence on his face. I just want to
hear what the fuck he's talking about.

900
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:53,460
I'm sure this transcriptions,
but it's,

901
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:56,790
it's gotta be better if you
actually know the language. Um,

902
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:01,190
and I got that fucking Irish thing where
I got to do everything the hard way. Um,

903
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,060
so all I would ever see was him a
Mussolini given the speeches and then him

904
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:08,180
fucking hanging by the meat,
hook him with his fucking girlfriend.

905
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:09,720
Okay.

906
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,920
MMM. And I always wonder
what the hell had happened.

907
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:15,780
And I didn't know that
he had gotten captured

908
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,690
and then the Nazis came in and freedom.

909
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,160
Yeah,

910
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,270
you don't like the fucking expendables
Assam Shit. Is that a right reference?

911
00:54:25,271 --> 00:54:27,420
I never saw one of those movies, but that
seemed like they what they were doing,

912
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,650
like they will rescue the people and uh,

913
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:31,350
okay.

914
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:31,900
And then he got,

915
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,650
he got caught again and he tried
to talk his way out of it again.

916
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:38,580
And his last words were,
was basically saying no,

917
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:44,010
like, no, no, no. It's fucking Christ.

918
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,580
What a fucking way to go out.

919
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,280
Yeah,

920
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,930
it, I've been talking about that
in my act. It's just that guy,

921
00:54:53,931 --> 00:54:57,440
like a year's time he
went from just like being,

922
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:02,530
having a boy band fame and everybody's
screaming and throwing bras at him and

923
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:07,790
shit to be like on his
knees. Like keep fucking,

924
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:12,920
they killed him, man. His woman, I
love it too. It was his mistress,

925
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,680
I believe is what they call,
I don't fucking remember.

926
00:55:15,681 --> 00:55:18,650
I remember you starting to forget the
shit and then they brought him into town

927
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,310
and everybody was kicking
him and dig his face. Just,

928
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,740
they just kicked the shit out of his face
and this spitting on him and they hung

929
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:25,670
up by a meat hook.

930
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,093
Okay.

931
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:32,880
It's like what happened? You know,
you think it's bad to be like,

932
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,110
you know, in, in old town, try
being a fucking dictator, man. It's,

933
00:55:39,111 --> 00:55:41,070
it's brutal.
It just does.

934
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,730
That's why they never have a behind the
music for dictators because, you know,

935
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:49,260
how would it, for the most part, I would
fucking ends. You don't end, you know,

936
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:50,670
you're not lying in bed.

937
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:52,160
Yeah.

938
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,070
You know, going through some
fucking Buddhist, this is
the death process. You know,

939
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,660
where they teach you how to die peacefully
and you're surrounded by fucking

940
00:55:59,661 --> 00:56:02,510
loved ones or whatever.
This is the exact opposite of that shit.

941
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,323
Okay.

942
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,950
Hitler blew his brains out.

943
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,470
Okay.

944
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,460
What's his face?

945
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:11,910
Okay.

946
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,400
Mostly Lady. I just told you
what the fuck happened to him.

947
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,450
Sudan will say they dragged
him out of a fucking hole.

948
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,740
He went out like a gangsta though, man.
That Jesus Christ, he refused the hood.

949
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,500
We put the rope around his neck and
he was getting heckled.

950
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,240
This is his shit. Like when
people talk about, you know,

951
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:34,810
when they go and they look at comics
getting heckled and taken on the crowd,

952
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,870
he has to have the best one for,
for dictators.

953
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:42,760
He was standing there and he's getting
heckled and he's giving him shit right

954
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:47,290
back with a fucking rope around his neck.
He got to respect that math.

955
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,870
I would have been like Muesli
and me trying to fucking
wriggle my fed out of it.

956
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,640
I definitely would have taken the hood.
Um,

957
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,100
who else does that get that?

958
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,720
The fatty over there in a
little fat boy in Korea.

959
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,280
I wonder how he died.

960
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,450
He's probably watching like little
house on the prairie or something.

961
00:57:10,451 --> 00:57:13,660
He was a weird guy.
It was in the movies and shit.

962
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,810
He actually, he lived, it's very few that
actually get to make, make it that far.

963
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,644
You know,

964
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,340
they get to continue where it's like
actors who get to continue working on into

965
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:29,200
their seventies and still doing like
Oscar winning work. It's very difficult.

966
00:57:29,201 --> 00:57:33,340
Most people fall by the wayside. All
right bill, we get it. Okay. All right.

967
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,490
You know I'm into that shit.
Alright, salads. Hey Bill.

968
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,970
I would like to get into eating
more salads, but I'm only 20.

969
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:43,930
And what the fuck do I know about salads
do I didn't know shit about salads.

970
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:48,370
I wish I started eating salads when I was
20. I wouldn't have this fucking mess.

971
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:54,610
Jesus Christ and it's
pasty. It's even worse. Uh,

972
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:59,530
should I get into spinach? Some good old
iceberg lettuce. What do I put in Salad?

973
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,120
What's the point of making a salad?

974
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:04,030
If I just cover with ranch dressing
and put a bunch of Bacon on it,

975
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:08,530
I'm not even sure what Balsamic
vinegarette is. Is a boiled egg.

976
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:13,370
A good thing to put in is appreciated.
Gotta be a Dick here and say hi. Hi.

977
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,110
Blackhawks won while you want.
You get the fucking brag about it.

978
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:19,900
You can't listen.
I don't know shit about nutrition.

979
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:23,410
I'm just starting to learn about it.
I know iceberg lettuce is like 90% water.

980
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:26,590
I think a spinach is good shit.
I like that.

981
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:29,980
I like a regular um,
kales awesome.

982
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,470
And um,
yeah,

983
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:37,060
don't go through all the crappy eating
that shit and then put a bunch of

984
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:40,900
dressing on it cause you know,
you're adding all those extra calories,

985
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:44,320
I guess Balsamic vinegarette this
is all shit that I've overheard.

986
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,290
I heard that that's the healthier one.
But even then I try to avoid drowning.

987
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,700
And uh, what's great about is
when you start eating them,

988
00:58:51,701 --> 00:58:56,500
you start craving them and that becomes
one meal a day. And that's just, you know,

989
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,340
you got to start looking at like a steak
and cheese sandwich or something like

990
00:59:00,341 --> 00:59:03,700
that. A pizza. That's just, it's
just a plate full of setups.

991
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,970
You know,
I fucking hate going to the gym.

992
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,920
I like going to the gym
cause I want to look good.

993
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,690
I hate going to the gym
cause I fucking have to go,

994
00:59:10,691 --> 00:59:14,260
which is what I'm doing right
now, which sucks, you know,

995
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,830
you know what's another bad one is when
you fucking sitting up in bed like I am

996
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:20,410
and you'll hold your iPhone up to you
and you get the reflection of like,

997
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:21,710
you're fucking nine Chin's

998
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,600
start to get that Pelican
neck. Ah. Anyways,

999
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:35,080
so, um, there's a bunch of recipes out
there. You can find it, but I would, I,

1000
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,180
I'd stay away from iceberg.
That's stinks. Romaine is like,

1001
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:42,320
that's like halfway decent.
All right. Iceberg lettuce.

1002
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,780
They're like the,
uh,

1003
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:45,650
yeah.

1004
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,950
I Dunno. What will you want? You
want to go sports on this one?

1005
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,510
We'll go sports and I'm not talking
about what they're gonna do this year,

1006
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:56,420
what they did last year. I would just
say what they've done in my lifetime.

1007
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:01,710
All right. Iceberg lettuce is like
the fucking Detroit lions. Uh,

1008
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:05,390
even though they're good now, they weren't
then. So that's probably a bad example.

1009
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:10,250
The Cleveland browns of lettuce,
sorry everybody in Cleveland.

1010
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,490
Although I did promote your city and I
saw a lot of fucking knock construction

1011
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:14,324
going on there.

1012
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,490
A romaine lettuce is like dead fucking
team that every once in a while makes the

1013
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:24,230
playoffs but never fucking wins it there.
That's like the Falcons of lettuce.

1014
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,780
Um, and then you get into a
rural girl loves the cowboys.

1015
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:34,790
Kale, I would say is the
40. Niners and uh, I dunno,

1016
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:35,601
I dunno.

1017
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:39,650
Maybe I should have said the packers
and Steelers or the Steelers and packers

1018
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:43,010
packers are the most successful.
So I'd say the Kale,

1019
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:47,450
I'd say Steelers not just shut
the fuck up. Okay. A Russian guy.

1020
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:49,730
Outwits banks. Oh, I
like this one already.

1021
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,630
Hey Bill thought you might enjoy reading
this article about a Russian man who

1022
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,560
outwit it, a bank by writing his own
terms into their credit card contract.

1023
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,890
Jesus Christ. That's fucking
phenomenal. I hadn't held it.

1024
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,461
That's like beaten.

1025
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:09,460
Bruce Lee had karate or
Kung Fu a Jean funky,

1026
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,630
whatever the fuck he did article.
Here we go.

1027
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:15,350
The idea of beating the banks at their
own game may seem like a rich joke,

1028
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:20,270
but to me, tree, uh,
Gara Cove, a Gar cove,

1029
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,940
I don't know, 42 year old Russian man
sounds like he plays for the Redwings,

1030
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:28,210
doesn't hae a 42 year old Russian
man may have managed to do it.

1031
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,830
Unhappy with the terms of the,

1032
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:34,860
of an unsolicited credit card offer he
received from an online bank tin cough

1033
01:01:35,351 --> 01:01:38,410
credit system at Gar cough.
Sorry.

1034
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:41,620
If you're listening and I'm butchering
this story. If you have Russian descent,

1035
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,350
uh,
he scanned the document,

1036
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:47,530
wrote in his own terms and
sent it through the bank,

1037
01:01:47,531 --> 01:01:50,890
approved the contract without
reading the amended fine print,

1038
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:55,210
unwittingly agreeing
to a 0% interest rate,

1039
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,780
unlimited credit and no fees as well as
a stipulation that the banks at the bank

1040
01:02:02,231 --> 01:02:06,460
pay steep fines for changing
or canceling the contract.

1041
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,133
Okay.

1042
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,740
The bank has so much money, they'll
be able to get around this. But what,

1043
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:15,430
that's fucking genius.
What a hero. A Garco.

1044
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:17,460
I've used the card for two years,

1045
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:22,610
but the bank ultimately it
and sued a Gar car for $1,363.

1046
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,570
The bank said he owed them charges,
interest, and late payment fees.

1047
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:31,080
A court ruled that because of the no fee,

1048
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,660
no interest stipulation to
guard cough had written in,

1049
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,380
he owed only his unpaid $575 balance.

1050
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,130
Look at this two minutes left in the
game. People, are you going to win this?

1051
01:02:42,131 --> 01:02:42,964
A what?

1052
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:48,410
A God carve is now suing the bank for
$727,000 for not honoring the contract's

1053
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:52,680
term.
And the bank is hollering fraud.

1054
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:56,790
They signed the documents without looking.
They said what used what?

1055
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:59,610
Usually they said to me,
what?

1056
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,810
Usually their borrowers saying
court, we've, we've not read it.

1057
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:08,700
A golf club's lawyer said, uh,
the shoe's on the other foot now.

1058
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,450
Sorry, I really butchered their
ending of that reading so well,

1059
01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:17,270
I got to pay attention to that.
Well, they'll settle out of court.

1060
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,630
I Dunno, man. That's,
that's a hard, I mean,

1061
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,900
the fact that you got to just
got out of paying the fees.

1062
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,260
I gotta put this in my,
uh, my computer here.

1063
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:31,260
I want to pay attention to a Gar cough.

1064
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:32,420
Okay.

1065
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,710
Russia
bank case

1066
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,430
Ak. So it's still at that point. Hey,
anybody in Russia listen to this thing.

1067
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,800
Can You keep,
please keep me abreast of this.

1068
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:49,520
I want to see if he gets any
of that. $727,000. All right.

1069
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:53,600
I want to do a little pre game
analysis here. I'll tell you right now,

1070
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:56,720
I gotta tell Ya,
if I'm the bank I got to be taken out of,

1071
01:03:56,721 --> 01:03:59,210
we ended up in this situation,

1072
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:04,560
I would actually guess that they're
not gonna pay any of that. Um,

1073
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:08,480
they probably got enough politicians
and judges in their pockets. I mean,

1074
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:09,740
it's corrupt enough over here.

1075
01:04:09,741 --> 01:04:13,090
I can't imagine what the fuck it's
like over there. No offense, but, uh,

1076
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:18,890
it is what it is. Um, yeah.
If anybody I know Estonia,

1077
01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:22,130
Latvia, get close enough, you can
pay attention, they'll let me know.

1078
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,120
I'd appreciate it. Lithuania, the Ukraine,

1079
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:31,430
Belarus, look at me. I've learned some
shit. Uh, I'm an attention whore. Bill.

1080
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,690
Bill Burke Marshall.

1081
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,580
I'm a 16 year old guy and I've recently
come to terms with the fact that I love

1082
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:42,130
attention. In most instances, this
would not be too big of a deal. I mean,

1083
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:46,280
look at you. You made a career out
of it. Hey listen, you fucking cunt.

1084
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,170
Just cause you find
out that you're a dick.

1085
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:50,750
You don't get to rub up against
me and get your stink on me.

1086
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:52,170
Okay?

1087
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:56,430
You know? Did I say I didn't like
fucking attention? You asshole.

1088
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:57,870
Yeah.

1089
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:58,661
Jesus Christ.

1090
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:02,430
You know I was actually
going to compliment you with
the fact that you actually

1091
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:02,730
could.

1092
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:07,170
You could step outside yourself and see
something that could potentially be a

1093
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:12,110
floor. Wanting attention is not a bad
thing. It's all how you do it, you know?

1094
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:16,170
All right, here we go. I
constantly sit in class loudly,

1095
01:05:16,171 --> 01:05:19,480
cracking jokes and can usually
get the whole class laughing.

1096
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,740
Plus I don't have to worry about the
teachers yelling at me because I'm such a

1097
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,583
manipulated,

1098
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,640
manipulative son of a bitch that I
have ensured that they all liked me.

1099
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,850
Here's the problem. My
friends hate it. All right?

1100
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,230
This has taken a different turn here.

1101
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:39,670
The jokes I make with them are far
different. I actually think they're funny.

1102
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,460
You see the jokes I make to the whole
class or Shitty hacky, cheap, cheesy,

1103
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:48,100
douchey jokes,
targeting a group laugh.

1104
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,760
The jokes I make with my friends
are normally riffing on something.

1105
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,410
They might actually be creative.

1106
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:54,780
Okay.

1107
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,880
Oh, all right. So you kind of,
when you're with your friends,

1108
01:05:56,881 --> 01:05:59,550
you're actually a comic's comic,

1109
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,070
but when you're in front of
the crowd, you, you're, you're,

1110
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:07,240
you're playing to the masses. Well,
you've got to pick a road here, son.

1111
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,980
Um, or maybe it don't,
I mean it's not you,

1112
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,800
you're trying to be a
comedian or maybe you are,

1113
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:13,240
if you're going to be a comedian,

1114
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,410
I would try to make the crowd laugh at
the jokes to make your friends left.

1115
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:20,320
All right, here we go. Now.

1116
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:24,100
Now I know the simple solution seems
to be stopped being a class clown,

1117
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:25,330
but I just loved the attention.

1118
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:29,830
I'm so emotionally undeveloped that
I craved the CRAs class approval and

1119
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:33,380
attention. Dude, you're not
emotionally undeveloped.

1120
01:06:33,381 --> 01:06:37,730
This is unbelievable that you have this
sort of a knowledge of self. It's 16.

1121
01:06:37,731 --> 01:06:42,200
I certainly didn't what you know at 16
I don't think I knew until I was 36 so

1122
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:43,070
you're, you're, you're in a,

1123
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:44,480
okay,

1124
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,960
you're in a good situation. Here he goes,
I love being the center of the class,

1125
01:06:47,961 --> 01:06:52,760
making everyone laugh to spice, knowing
that I'm being fake and not myself.

1126
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:53,820
Yeah.

1127
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:54,780
What should I do?

1128
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:59,250
Should I stop cracking the shit jokes
in class or should I tell my friends to

1129
01:06:59,251 --> 01:07:03,870
get over it and keep being that guy?
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Ah,

1130
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,900
first of all, I don't know what the
fuck your friends have a problem with.

1131
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,750
I mean, how bad are these
jokes? Just say and, and

1132
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:13,120
yeah,

1133
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,890
you're basically what you're doing
is in class. Sounds like the first,

1134
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,530
I dunno, three to six, seven,

1135
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:24,910
eight years of being a standup comedian
were once you figure out how to make the,

1136
01:07:24,911 --> 01:07:28,720
uh, the crowd laugh, you then
try to be like, well, I want to,

1137
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,223
okay,

1138
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,070
I want to be like, say what? I
really want to talk about up here.

1139
01:07:34,071 --> 01:07:37,460
Basically find your voice. So, um,

1140
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,140
I don't think that you should make
a change because of your friends.

1141
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:44,800
I think you should make a change because
you want to make the change, you know,

1142
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:49,630
when that makes sense. If you like
the attention and that type of shit,

1143
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,470
who gives a fuck?

1144
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:51,960
Okay.

1145
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:56,100
But, uh, if you want to take your
class clown or to the next level,

1146
01:07:56,101 --> 01:07:57,930
I would go with some of
the more creative stuff.

1147
01:07:57,931 --> 01:08:01,620
You don't have to always go with a shit
joke, but I have to commend you that you,

1148
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:03,270
when I used to be a class clown,

1149
01:08:03,271 --> 01:08:05,670
I would always get in trouble
and the teachers didn't like me.

1150
01:08:05,671 --> 01:08:09,990
So the fact that he able to
do that is great. And uh,

1151
01:08:09,991 --> 01:08:12,510
I think you're going to be real
successful in like in life.

1152
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,690
You could do anything.
Politics Show business sales.

1153
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:19,410
Okay.

1154
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:22,050
If you like, if you could
actually talk to a crowd that,

1155
01:08:22,051 --> 01:08:26,940
that really puts you ahead of the game, I
would think. All right. He also says, ps,

1156
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,490
as a Blackhawks fan,

1157
01:08:29,491 --> 01:08:33,210
I would just like to personally thank
Boston fans for being so classy,

1158
01:08:33,211 --> 01:08:34,050
respectful,

1159
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:38,420
and dare I say Saint Lake St
like from the bottom of my hat,

1160
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,030
my black cock hard. I would like to
personally thank each and every Bruin fan.

1161
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:45,570
You were all models of fandom.
Thank you for fucking mocking that.

1162
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,800
Um, or just trying to rub it in.
I don't give a shit at this point.

1163
01:08:49,801 --> 01:08:53,040
That seemed like years ago and
we just want a cup, so I'm good.

1164
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:54,630
So congratulations to you,
sir.

1165
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:58,740
Good luck with trying to find your
voice as a class clown. All right.

1166
01:08:58,741 --> 01:09:03,630
God Damn ex-girlfriend.
Dare Billy boy.

1167
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,710
Um, your podcast is killer, man. Thanks.
Well thank you. I appreciate that.

1168
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:13,140
And he says, I'm writing you to get some
insight on my ex girlfriend situation.

1169
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,700
About six months ago, my ex dump my
ass and totally crushed my heart.

1170
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:22,190
That's the worst. Did you got
to go throw it though? Uh,

1171
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:24,120
he says I was fucked up for a while,

1172
01:09:24,121 --> 01:09:27,270
but it took some of your advice and
focused on improving my own shit.

1173
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,970
I never called her texts
or a did any asshole.

1174
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:37,930
It's for six months. A couple
of months ago, she texts me, ah,

1175
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,420
fuck.
And I know it.

1176
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:44,310
I know it now without reading
this thing she's texted you now.

1177
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:47,970
Either she legitimately wants
to get back together with you,

1178
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,690
which if you still love her,
that would be a good thing or

1179
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,770
whatever the fuck she,

1180
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:00,860
whatever path life path she went down
over the last six months has hit a hard,

1181
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:06,080
is it a bump in the road and maybe she's
having second thoughts or maybe she's

1182
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,900
completely evil and she's like,
wow, he just never called me again.

1183
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:11,700
Why don't I call him up in mind?
Fuck them.

1184
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,230
Those are my three guests on the,
uh,

1185
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,950
the cont genie lamp player.
All right? So she texted me,

1186
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,950
she wanted to know what I've
been up to and how I was doing.

1187
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:28,050
She also wanted to know why I unfriended
her on Facebook. And he writes,

1188
01:10:28,051 --> 01:10:29,730
why do you think you'd dump cunt

1189
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,850
that, wait a minute, did you
unfriend her because of my advice?

1190
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:39,150
Did you do that on your own?
That's a great thing. You got,

1191
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:41,520
you got to get cut the cancer out.

1192
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:44,610
You can't be watching
what the fuck she's doing.

1193
01:10:44,611 --> 01:10:48,280
All you're doing is prolonging that
pain in your heart. You got to watch,

1194
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,310
I'm telling you,
if you gotta,

1195
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,740
you gotta cut off all contact and
then you got to go Chris Bosh.

1196
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:58,470
We just got to drop to your knees a
couple of times a day and cry it out.

1197
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,320
Don't be afraid to fucking do that and
I wouldn't do it in front of a bunch of

1198
01:11:01,321 --> 01:11:05,340
men, but you know, do it
on your own like as a man.

1199
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:08,850
You have to understand that the reason
why you're able to cry is because you

1200
01:11:08,851 --> 01:11:12,870
supposed to because if you don't,
you keep it in your chest and it becomes,

1201
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,050
and then you yell at your kids.
All right.

1202
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:20,190
I resisted the urge to tell her to go
fuck herself and kept my responsible,

1203
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:22,590
my responses. Cool and casual. Dude,

1204
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:26,820
you are on the road to a post breakup
blow job. That's where you are right now.

1205
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:29,550
Let's see if you keep the car on the road.
Here's my question.

1206
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:34,620
How the fuck do broads know when you are
finally getting over them and that they

1207
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:37,590
should get ahold of you and
make you feel like shit again.

1208
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,900
Also d say I know it.

1209
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,450
Yeah.

1210
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:41,931
Also,

1211
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:46,931
do you think it's a dick move to get a
hold of an x if you're the one who dumped

1212
01:11:47,111 --> 01:11:51,380
then when they haven't gotten a hold
of you since the breakup. Finally,

1213
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,010
how do you think I should
handle this going forward? Um,

1214
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:00,690
well you know what? You, you basically,

1215
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:04,680
you learned one of life's tough lessons.
Is that a

1216
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:05,900
yeah,

1217
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,020
my amino something.
I might be being a dick here.

1218
01:12:09,021 --> 01:12:11,300
Like baby got guys do this shit too.

1219
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,510
All right guys do do this shit too.

1220
01:12:14,511 --> 01:12:18,790
That you got those guys who they break
up with a girl but then they keep her in,

1221
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:23,000
in, they try to like hold onto
her so no one else can fucker.

1222
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,500
You know guys who do that shit.

1223
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:27,110
So this is really like I'm
being a sexist more on as usual.

1224
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,543
MMM.

1225
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:31,900
I'm coming from the male perspective.
That's all I got. All right.

1226
01:12:31,901 --> 01:12:36,040
Trying to show a little empathy here.
Um, how do they know? I don't know,

1227
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,900
but they're great at it.

1228
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,560
So rather than trying to figure it out
because I don't know that you can as a

1229
01:12:43,721 --> 01:12:46,480
guy,
just respect that they have that ability.

1230
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:49,410
All right.
Um,

1231
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:55,080
you might want to consider changing
your cell phone number so she can't text

1232
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,790
slash mind fuck you again.

1233
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:58,743
MMM.

1234
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:05,440
What if it is the fucking worst? They
just the fucking worst in that situation,

1235
01:13:05,441 --> 01:13:07,180
dude. You just, you got
to walk away from a man.

1236
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,940
So I can't remember what
the fuck you asked me.

1237
01:13:09,941 --> 01:13:12,370
I'm going through all the breakups
I've been through mentally right now.

1238
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:13,803
MMM.

1239
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,181
All right.

1240
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:19,230
So the first thing you said is how the
fuck do broads know when you finally over

1241
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:24,200
them, I don't know, change your cell
phone number is my solution. Um,

1242
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:24,741
also,

1243
01:13:24,741 --> 01:13:29,060
do you think it's a dick move to get
ahold of an x if you have no intention of

1244
01:13:29,061 --> 01:13:33,830
getting back with them? Yes, I do.
And you have to accept the guilty.

1245
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:36,890
You feel that you broke somebody's
heart and you have to own that.

1246
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,040
You can't like calling, just calling
to make sure you're doing okay.

1247
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,500
You're not helping that other person.
If you have no intent,

1248
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:46,550
you're giving them a half a second,
a hope and then you know,

1249
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:50,420
you're just, you're, you're, you're
ruining them. You gotta let them go.

1250
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,910
Um, and lastly, how do you think I
should handle this going forward?

1251
01:13:55,911 --> 01:14:00,530
Yeah. I would say don't
respond to her texts or uh,

1252
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:01,581
even that,

1253
01:14:01,581 --> 01:14:05,150
just her texting you and seeing your name
and knowing that she's thinking about

1254
01:14:05,151 --> 01:14:08,920
you and your heart's still going to be
like, well, maybe, maybe two minutes.

1255
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,070
You can night together. I would just
change the number. Start over again.

1256
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,770
Go Bill Bixby. Get a
backpack. Walk out of town.

1257
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,300
Who Do go down the fucking street.
Um,

1258
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:22,570
start working out. Get some new women
in your life. That's another thing.

1259
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,320
Go out there and go hit kid on
something he thinks out of your league.

1260
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,810
Gives a shit.
Go have a good time.

1261
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,350
I'm hitting on a girl that's odd.

1262
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:37,360
That's so called rd or league is like
playing a sport against people who are

1263
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:42,430
better than you. It makes you
better it up. She's game. All right.

1264
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,120
So then when you, you play
against somebody who's only
little out of your league,

1265
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:49,870
your actually, you used to play
and beyond and you're not nervous.

1266
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,650
You used to that speed, you
know? Does that make any
fucking sense? I hope it does.

1267
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,310
Anyways, that is the, uh, the podcast
for this week. Everybody. Thank you.

1268
01:14:57,311 --> 01:15:00,760
As always for everybody who's contributed
with the questions and everything that

1269
01:15:00,761 --> 01:15:05,290
really is the last half of
this podcast every week. MMM.

1270
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:09,250
And also, I forgot to mention
that, uh, the last couple of weeks,

1271
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,800
if you'd like to support this podcast,

1272
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:15,400
a very easy way is if you plan on buying
on some something on amazon.com just go

1273
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:19,720
to billboard.com first click
on the podcast page and
click on the Amazon banner

1274
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:22,960
that we have that'll take you right to
Amazon and you don't have to do shit

1275
01:15:22,961 --> 01:15:25,120
after that.
It doesn't change the prices of anything.

1276
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:29,740
They kicked me a percentage of the
sale for driving traffic their way.

1277
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,820
I take a percentage of that,
send it to the wounded warriors project.

1278
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:38,080
So it's a two for one as far as
supporting me and supporting the wounded

1279
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:42,570
warriors project and also hard
copy versions of my DVD, uh,

1280
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,840
of my standup special,
sorry,

1281
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:48,870
DVD copies are available on my website
and also available for download,

1282
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:53,900
um, for five bucks. And it's uh,
the, you people are all the same.

1283
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:56,990
So people have asked me when
I'm doing another special,

1284
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:02,470
I've begun talks about planning about
doing one in the first half of next year.

1285
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:07,740
I basically I do them every other year.
Um,

1286
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:13,540
as basically outworks I
spend one year having fun,

1287
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,720
right.

1288
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:19,160
And a new hour and then I spend the next
year fine tuning it and then when I'm

1289
01:16:19,161 --> 01:16:22,610
done with that, then I shoot it. That's
basically a, that's basically what I do.

1290
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:27,110
And uh, that's the formula it's been
working for me, so I'm sticking with it.

1291
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:31,460
And then also people in Scotland
had been asking me about my,

1292
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:33,830
am I still doing Scotland
because they didn't see a date.

1293
01:16:33,831 --> 01:16:38,510
I am definitely doing a date. Things got
moved around. I do two shows in London.

1294
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:42,050
I'm still doing one in Scotland.
Um,

1295
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:45,230
it's going to be at this theater,
I forget the name of it,

1296
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:49,490
but I'm somewhere around the fourth of
the 5th of December or something like

1297
01:16:49,491 --> 01:16:50,870
that. But, uh,

1298
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,650
hopefully at some point this week I'm
going to get an official date and I'm

1299
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:55,580
going to tweet about it.

1300
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,570
I will Facebook about it and I
will podcast about it next week.

1301
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,710
And a thank you to everybody over
there who's been buying up the tickets.

1302
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:08,990
It starting off really strong and,
uh, somebody actually sent me a,

1303
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,160
um, for the, uh,

1304
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:17,630
the advertisement in Stockholm and it was
really cool. It was other than my name,

1305
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:20,960
obviously, if it's all written and
fucking Swedish and shit, and it's just a,

1306
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:26,270
it's the coolest fucking thing
ever that there's people in an,

1307
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:29,090
on the other side of the world speaking
a different language and they're writing

1308
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:32,390
about a show that you gotta
go up there and go, do, you
know, he's fucking awesome.

1309
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:35,850
So anyways, I'm really
excited about that. And, uh,

1310
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:40,340
all the shit that I have coming up. Uh,
oh, by the way, if you're in into a,

1311
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:44,780
if you're not into motorcycle
racing or you'd like to get into it,

1312
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:47,870
they got one of their grand prixs,
I think it's in Indianapolis or something,

1313
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:52,090
somewhere in the states this
weekend coming up on, uh,

1314
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,620
August 18th,
I believe.

1315
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:58,230
I'm actually going to watch it now
that I got a motorcycle license be,

1316
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:03,240
I watched that documentary on Netflix
about all those motorcycle races,

1317
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:08,120
races and that type of shit. It's just
fucking the balls that that takes.

1318
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:10,850
It's like you weren't
in a formula one car,

1319
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:12,710
except you don't have
a roll cage around you.

1320
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,420
It's unfucking real the
balls of that takes.

1321
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:19,430
So I'm hopefully going to have
time to watch it next Sunday.

1322
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:22,520
I'm definitely gonna try to find
a buy out here. And once again,

1323
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:25,640
thanks to everybody in New Orleans, been
having a great time coming around town,

1324
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:30,230
going to the open mics, doing
the, uh, doing the standup shows,

1325
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,170
been getting a wonderful reception.
And I've been trying a lot of new stuff.

1326
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:34,490
So I'm having a ball down here.

1327
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:40,060
I'm going to be down here for another
week and a half and then I'm back up.

1328
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:45,170
Where the hell do I go? I go up to
Connecticut to do the MGM and then I do,

1329
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:47,420
I think the University of Cincinnati,

1330
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:51,140
and then I'm back out to la and that's
the deal. Everybody, that's the podcast.

1331
01:18:51,141 --> 01:18:55,400
Go fuck yourselves.
Have a great week and I'll see you later.
