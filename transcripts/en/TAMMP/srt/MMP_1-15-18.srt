1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,620
Hey, what's going on and spill burned his
time for the Monday morning podcast for

2
00:00:05,621 --> 00:00:10,480
Monday, January 15th,
2018 what's going on?

3
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:15,100
How, why, how are you?

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,990
I'm in San Francisco would still Sunday.
Uh,

5
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:22,850
the second half has just begun.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,070
The saints go marching in
verse the Minnesota Vikings.

7
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:30,230
This saints was my pick this weekend.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,560
I loved drew Brees going into Minnesota
and fucking having everybody crying at

9
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:39,380
the fucking mall of America
by the end of the game.

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,070
And so far the vikings
are up 17 to nothing,

11
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:46,260
although I think they just
fucking went three and out. Oh,

12
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:50,090
case key to just got put
down on his fucking Keester.

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,843
MMM.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
We'll see. We'll see. You
never know what's going to
happen, you know. I mean, look,

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,480
look at the fucking Jaguar's.
The Jaguar's when just came right out,

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,860
gave the Steelers the old
right there. Fred, all of a
sudden they're running back,

17
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:08,690
twist his ankle. Right. I don't
feel, I can't put any weight on it,

18
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:09,680
man.
Right.

19
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:13,580
Then all of a sudden the Steelers come
roaring fucking back and I'm saying

20
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,110
[inaudible] gone. This game's over the
Pittsburgh Steelers. It's in Pittsburgh.

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,930
This shit is over. No Way. Uh, uh,

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,810
what the fuck's his name? Bryce
Bortles. I kicked, by the way,

23
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:31,550
I can't keep up with these
fucking names from the 90s. Okay.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,880
The cases, the Bryce, the boltons
the fuck. I don't know. You know,

25
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,650
a lot of comics have done bits about
it, but you know, back when it was like,

26
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,600
you know,
Bill,

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:46,601
Bob fucking Steve Joe Greatest quarterback
of all fucking time at one point was

28
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:53,480
named Joe. You know Joe
Nemeth, Joe Montana,

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,400
Joe size man Joe.

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,260
Okay.

31
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,840
Fucking Blake Bortles I, you know,

32
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,080
whatever. I'm just, I'm
an old crabby fucking man.

33
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,970
I guess the nineties, it was really
big to name your kid after a c name,

34
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:15,500
considering all the quarterbacks.
Right. Kurt Carson case.

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,020
It's like, did Roger Clemens
fuck all these women now?

36
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:26,870
But he did that. You had like
fucking nine kids and he get Cody,

37
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:30,740
Kyle Conti, Chris,
right. They're all case.

38
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,940
They are all case. Yeah. Why would
you have them have their own identity?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,620
Let's fuck it. Have their name
be about your fucking career. Um,

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,010
what do you mean you want to be a
veterinarian? Get the fuck out there.

41
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,150
Pick up a baseball and throw some hay.

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,623
MMM,

43
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,040
sorry. That was my impression of what
it's like inside their households.

44
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,440
Like I have any idea.
All right.

45
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,820
Yeah.

46
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,690
I have nothing against the Clemens family.
I love Roger Clemens.

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
You know,
fuck it.

48
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:04,450
Did some great things with the red
sox before he went to Toronto. Well,

49
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:08,270
we let them go. Right then he fucking
jumped on that poor police horse.

50
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,940
Jesus Christ.
You know,

51
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,850
that horse was wishing it was a fucking
clydesdale when he got on his goddamn

52
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,960
back.
Um,

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,680
okay.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,180
Uh, just in a bad mood because
I'm in San Francisco, right?

55
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,740
I fucking came here yesterday
and no guy has even looked at me.

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,460
No.

57
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,460
I came here yesterday and it was sunny
up one of the rare sunny beautiful days

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,460
and San Francisco when it is sunny out,

59
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,170
when the weather's nice
can fuck with any city.

60
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,760
I'll even say in North America, forget
about the continental United States,

61
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:44,020
including Alaska,
Hawaii,

62
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:46,540
and some of our tributaries
like fucking Puerto Rico there.

63
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,650
I say Fox with any city. Okay. However,

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,670
on the usual cloudy,
rainy day,

65
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,940
this place, there's, there's a misery
to this fucking place. This it's cold,

66
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,200
wet air blowing against you as you
walk up yet another fucking hill,

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,440
you know,
nothing is ever down a hill.

68
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,030
It's always up a hill around a corner
to an even steeper hill, you know,

69
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,740
when they still have all that
mamas and Papas, you know,

70
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,780
although leaves are brown Hippie
vibe going out here a little bit,

71
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,700
even all the evil people from
fucking a silicone valley,

72
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,370
which I still never know
quite where that is.

73
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,830
It's somewhere down near like San Jose.

74
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,230
I just don't know where it
begins and where it ends.

75
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,510
But silicone to me and
my level of intellect,

76
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,550
the amount of books
that I've read in life,

77
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,500
silicone to me is and will
always be what's in fake titties.

78
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,840
So, you know, I don't know what
they're doing. I actually flew up here,

79
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,220
okay.

80
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,680
Uh, rented a helicopter and flew
up here with a couple people,

81
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:58,150
had a great fucking time,
picked up a couple of hours and um,

82
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,200
we went by this giant building that
was this huge circle and I was like,

83
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:07,860
what the fuck is that?
That looks like, I dunno,

84
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,280
it looks like like the Pentagon.
If it was groovy man, right.

85
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,260
That's was like, what is that? And my
buddy guests, he goes, it's probably,

86
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:20,760
maybe it's apple. I never seen a building
like it. It was just a total circle.

87
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,400
Then in the middle there
was like all of this,

88
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:26,760
like it looked like a jungle
in the middle, you know?

89
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,730
And if you look down you could see
the employees screaming and waving.

90
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,170
Don't get me Outta here. He still
alive. Steve is still alive.

91
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:35,190
I think that's what it's set up.

92
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:39,300
But I was too busy focusing on not hitting
somebody else while I was up there.

93
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,550
It turns out it was the apple building.
Very impressive,

94
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,160
very in fucking impressive structure.

95
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,240
And then we went right by
Stanford and saw that stadium.

96
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:51,150
I buddy was hitting me with a
trivia before we got there. He goes,

97
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,790
I went to a game,
I went to a Superbowl,

98
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,100
he claimed it was the only super bowl
ever played at a college or something like

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,380
that. Which isn't true because they
played a bunch of the rose bowl,

100
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:04,640
most of the two lane maybe. He said the
last one played it a college stadium.

101
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:08,480
Was it that, I forget what it was. Don't
blame him. Blame me for not remembering.

102
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,180
And uh, I was able to get
sad. I said was the, uh,

103
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,680
40 niners dolphins at Stanford Stadium?

104
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,500
Only because I had recently read that
that's where they played that game.

105
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,120
And because I got that right, he then
had to be like, what was the score?

106
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,280
I was like, I dunno. But Fulton Walker
took a kickoff back for the first time.

107
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,290
Super Bowl history. It's like 35, 10.

108
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,693
So anyways,

109
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,030
we fucking land at San Francisco
International Airport, which it's so,

110
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,320
it's so much different.
You know, when you,

111
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,220
and when you actually
get to see how cool it,

112
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,620
fuck it looks when you sitting in
the back of the tube, you know,

113
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,830
and you're just looking out the
back, just praying, you know,

114
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,660
just please get this thing
on the fucking ground.

115
00:06:57,661 --> 00:06:59,700
It's different when you come up there.
It's fucking amazing.

116
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,020
It's expensive as shit, but
it's amazing, right? So we land,

117
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,240
everything's going great.
And uh,

118
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,230
okay.

119
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,350
I ended up doing this thing with the,
what is it?

120
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:13,940
The San Francisco,
uh,

121
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,380
sketch fest and um,
I did this,

122
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,930
what was it? The, uh,
who's the guy from Cuba,

123
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,070
Castro,
the Castro theater with Kevin Pollak.

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,970
And we just went out and,
uh, sort of an interview,

125
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:36,940
just riff and fucking around that people
came up and ask questions afterwards.

126
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:39,430
I want to thank everybody who showed
up was like one in the afternoon.

127
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,160
All of these people showed up.

128
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,590
It was a great time and a campus,

129
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,610
just the greatest fucking dude ever.
And we actually,

130
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:52,990
I got to do a scene with them in a
movie coming up called a front runner.

131
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,750
It's coming up this year.
Um,

132
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,340
we had a great time doing that.
And uh, you know, San Francisco,

133
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:02,770
why in a bad mood belt? The south
sounds great. It's all great.

134
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,030
It's all fucking great. Then
I get to my hotel, of course,

135
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,120
I show up right in the lady
takes my driver's license.

136
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:13,570
I forgot to not just show it to her like
she took the driver's license, right?

137
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,830
So then she starts clicking on a keyboard
and say, Hey, can you do me favor keen,

138
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,400
teeny, not type any personal
information on a license.

139
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:25,420
And she got all this fucking
attitude. She goes, I am not,

140
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,570
I will tell you what I'm typing in and
bubble and his whole fucking, you know,

141
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:31,360
snap to the 12th to the sex,
whatever the fucking kids say,

142
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,450
I want to be like Lady Lady,

143
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,180
you're not going to tell
me what you're going to do.

144
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,380
I'm going to tell you what you're
not going to do, you fucking cunt.

145
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,030
But of course they can't say that,
you know, I can't say that too.

146
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,490
I don't know what the fuck
happened to customer service,

147
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,370
but her fucking attitude,
the way she talked to me,

148
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:53,620
it was like I told her
how to parent or kid.

149
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,390
So then she looks at me up.

150
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:00,870
Of course they don't fucking have me down
cause I probably miscommunicated when

151
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:05,400
I was going to come up here anyways. I
just didn't say a fucking word. Right.

152
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,570
And then she went out of
her way and actually got me,

153
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,280
you know she didn't get it. I mean out
of the way she fucking did her job.

154
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,280
Fuckers still fuck her sir.

155
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm going to tell you one bit like what
enough. I felt like I was getting booked.

156
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,570
I just, I, I fucking, I don't understand
what has happened to customer service.

157
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:32,290
So then I was just like, all right,
all right, fucking whatever. All right.

158
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,260
And then this hotel turns out they don't
have the two things that I need in a

159
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:35,710
hotel.

160
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,210
The only two fucking things I need other
than a fucking door that doesn't open

161
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:44,560
up out into the parking lot. In other
words, I'm not staying in a motel. Okay.

162
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,000
And all I need is some sort of gym
and an ironing board. That's it.

163
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,860
This hotel has, neither has,

164
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,700
neither has little steam fucking machine.

165
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,710
I don't want to steam my fucking clothes.
I practice my drum shit,

166
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,170
but I'm on the road.
It bring a little practice pad.

167
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,640
And after all these years of trying to
find a fucking table that fits right.

168
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,510
The ironing board was there the whole
time. He just play standing up. Okay.

169
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,580
And you can adjust it down.
If it's not high enough,

170
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:15,420
he just put a couple of towels underneath
and then it's at the height you need

171
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:16,590
it to be.
They don't fucking happen.

172
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,583
MMM.

173
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,390
And then lastly, I went to go
get a burrito and I fucked up.

174
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,640
Like San Francisco makes
the best burritos. Right?

175
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,220
They got the best break perfected them.
I don't know where they came from.

176
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,040
I believe France invented the Burrito.
I'm not sure.

177
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,903
MMM.

178
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,640
So there's this fucking,
I'm not gonna name the Burrito place,

179
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:39,670
but evidently they got a great spot in
the mission and I'm all the way down near

180
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:43,000
the fucking touristy area where they
got like rides to Alcatraz. I'm like,

181
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm not fucking going
all the way out there.

182
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,580
I want to watch both these fucking
football games. And the one behold,

183
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,280
I find that there is,
there's a guy that,

184
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:54,850
there's a one that's in on everybody's
top 10 list that makes a fucking Burrito

185
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,350
in the mission but also has another
location down near the fishermen place.

186
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,900
Right. The wharf down here.
So I'm like, all right,

187
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:05,460
well I know it's probably not going to
be as good as the original cause that's

188
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,090
the original oven and blah blah blah
blah blah. So I fucking go to the new,

189
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,820
obviously the second one that
they opened, I show up. Right.

190
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,440
And uh,

191
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,050
yeah,

192
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,850
dislike fucking,
I dunno,

193
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,270
a group of Ford Front me in a group of
two in front of me and you would have

194
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:27,420
thought the amount of time it took
them to order a fucking Burrito,

195
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,810
you would've thought that they
were trying to like, you know,

196
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,500
it was like war time and they were trying
to catch the last flight out before

197
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:37,170
the, you know, the impending
regime or whatever.

198
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,020
It's going to send them
to a fucking labor camp.

199
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,940
That's like how long they
were negotiating this.

200
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,990
And what kills me is these four people
that took for fucking ever then the two

201
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:50,991
people behind him who had enough
time to fucking go on Youtube,

202
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:54,850
find out what's in a Burrito,
go to a fucking supermarket,

203
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:59,200
buy the shit and cook one.
That's the amount of time they had it.

204
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,580
They step up to the register.

205
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:03,730
It's their moment of truth to order a
Burrito and they will start looking at the

206
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:06,030
menu. Uh, we're good.

207
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,883
Ugh.

208
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,790
Fucking ridiculous. Fucking ridiculous.
So I get up there. What do you want?

209
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,140
Give me an original burrito.
Chicken

210
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,640
chips and salsa in a water to go cash.
Thank you.

211
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,360
Step aside over,
how hard is that?

212
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,250
You know what it is is somewhere in the
last century it became illegal to punch

213
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,610
somebody in the back of the head when
they were taking too long and align.

214
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:38,580
And now everybody, they just, you know,
they just a little too comfortable.

215
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,470
They just a little too comfortable.
So I'm standing there and uh,

216
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,270
you know, now in behind the fucking couple
that you know, over at the salsa line,

217
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,370
Salsa line, salsa, salsa line and uh,

218
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,380
I'm behind them again and it's taking
them forever to get fucking salsa.

219
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,530
Fucking looking around and they're
looking at other people. It's like,

220
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:10,220
use your fucking braid. Mild, medium hot.

221
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,350
Okay.

222
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,700
The fuck
damn saints.

223
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,630
Or when the saints go
marching in but up up,

224
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,370
oh, oh, plenty of time left. No,

225
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,570
there isn't.
What am I talking about?

226
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:32,930
I thought that was fucking one
18 into the third quarter. Well,

227
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,370
I guess there's plenty of time left,
right?

228
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,760
This is the way the game is
played nowadays. It's like,
do they go for two here?

229
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,770
There's only a quarter in a minute.
13 left. Kick the fucking extra point.

230
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,470
Um,
yeah.

231
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,520
Jesus Christ. That guy just had a
soul patch on the back of his head.

232
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,620
Wow. You know, tough.

233
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:01,010
You have to be to have that because
if somebody just how hard it would be,

234
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:03,200
do not tell that guy how fucking
annoying that. It's like, dude,

235
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:06,800
I just want to fucking, can you
just grow it out? A shave it off.

236
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,573
MMM.

237
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,630
All right. Touchdown Saints
touched my prediction lives.

238
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,020
This is such a disturbing commercial
with this guy falls off the cruise ship.

239
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:24,780
This is one of my biggest fucking
fears in life. You know what I mean?

240
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,070
Yeah.

241
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,140
Just being in the fucking ocean,

242
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,820
praying for hypothermia
to set it before summer,

243
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,090
something comes up to you and
just takes a bite out of you.

244
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,890
Can you imagine when you see that
fucking shark fin? Just break the water,

245
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,150
you know, and you know,
you smell the thing.

246
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,770
Fucking wild animals. You could smell
them from a mile away to the point.

247
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,810
I don't understand how
they're able to kill anybody.

248
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,180
You know?
You didn't.

249
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,360
You ever go to the fucking sue when
you just smell those God damn lions?

250
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,110
I guess every, everything
stinks out there, you know? Um,

251
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,590
yeah.

252
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,750
Anyways. Then they just leave.
The guy in the fucking ocean

253
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,920
fucking really bothers me. I this gotta
be somebody complaining about that,

254
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,173
you know,

255
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,320
once a year that seems to
happen or every couple of years,

256
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:23,940
like somebody goes on a honeymoon and
their spouse fucking falls overboard.

257
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,773
You know,

258
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,250
I gotta look that up. How many fucking
times? What do you, what are the odds?

259
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,850
Are the odds higher on a honeymoon
or FTE been married for awhile?

260
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,800
Like how many times somebody who's like
fucking thrown his spouse overboard,

261
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,460
you know, and if it's anywhere
near the number that I think it is,

262
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:50,070
I want to know why it
doesn't have its own Hashtag.

263
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,460
I think we need to start
a Hashtag on Twitter.

264
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,220
Let me just do fucking three seconds of a

265
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,720
research here.
Spouse,

266
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,120
how do you spell spouse?
I just spelt spas,

267
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,080
spouse, what would I look up? Your spouse,

268
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,443
dead

269
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,840
cruise ship.
Uh,

270
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,810
significant other question mark.

271
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,370
What a passionate your dyes
and see what you need to know.

272
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,230
Oh my God, what do they do? Do they
have a burial at sea? You know,

273
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:37,730
with the Carnival cruise line flag and
they try to make it look official is just

274
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:42,230
sitting there looking at
fucking Gilligan. And Gofer. Um,

275
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,900
so the guy's name go for the
guy became like a senator.

276
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,910
Husband pleads not guilty and wife's
cruise ship killing. Oh my God.

277
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,390
Geez. If they, if they figure out, ah,

278
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,460
can you imagine that?

279
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,730
Wow. That's, that's just
cruel and unusual punishment.

280
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,960
It bad enough you killed somebody.

281
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:07,070
The fact that you would send them
to that of a lonely, brutal death.

282
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I Utah Man who allegedly brutally murdered
his wife last month while onboard and

283
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,790
Alaska. Oh, he just,
he killed her on, yeah.

284
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,663
Fourth.

285
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,690
All right,
well Jesus,

286
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:21,520
this and fucking serious music
dude who compose that, hey,

287
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,900
this guy killed his wife.

288
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,030
This guy killed his wife on a fucking
cruise ship and this Guy Jay, we need,

289
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,760
we need music for that. And
that guy, he'd just come,

290
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,320
I can't get back to the fade in that war.

291
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,390
That was what the Jimmy page
army a fucking guitars there.

292
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,821
Can you imagine that?

293
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:44,280
You wanted to write the next stairway
to heaven and now you just write in

294
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:49,050
fucking music, you know, that fits
people dying on a fucking cruise.

295
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,360
Okay. This dude is accused of first degree
murder in the death of his 39 year old

296
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:57,830
wife.
Uh,

297
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,350
she must've fucking choked her and
shuffleboard or something. I'm sorry.

298
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,370
A Kennis wife was found dead in
her cruise ship cabin on July 25th.

299
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,490
That's the couple had a domestic dispute.

300
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,950
Oh my God. D there's, you know, they
should throw this guy overboard.

301
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,610
Jesus Christ

302
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,220
said blood was spread throughout
the room on multiple surfaces.

303
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,560
Who's immediately detained by ship
security in a witness said that the,

304
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:38,110
the defendant allegedly told him
she would not stop laughing at me.

305
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,770
Jesus Christ

306
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,450
waterfall. She ridiculing him. You know,

307
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,380
it's funny if this was
the other way around,

308
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,470
I think the woman goes free if,
if she just said he was fat shaming her,

309
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,900
like she put on some baby weight
or something like that and he just,

310
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:05,640
he wouldn't stop laughing at me and
I just made me feel like I was small

311
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,760
each year over 4,000 men
laugh at their recently,

312
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,080
not pregnant wise,

313
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,090
causing them to feel bad
about themselves. Um, okay.

314
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,800
He had been acting terrible all night.

315
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:24,530
The source claim adding at some point
that evening. He, yeah, she wouldn't stay.

316
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,960
Somebody not stop laughing at you.
You go for a walk.

317
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,330
What if,
wow,

318
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,320
what was going that that guy is not
just a straight up fucking psycho,

319
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,723
you know

320
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,810
like what the fuck was going on?

321
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,000
How many movies could you
make out of that relationship?

322
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,551
Like if,

323
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:50,810
if that guy never did anything wrong
in his life and she was just so fucking

324
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:54,110
sadistic, sadistic and hits,
so gotten into his fucking head

325
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,690
that her just laughing at him, Pete,
that he fucking snap like that. You know,

326
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:02,820
I'm just playing the other side.
I'm just playing devil's advocate here.

327
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,240
Interception Sal.
Window saints.

328
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,850
Go marching in yet that
day. Dot. Bada boom.

329
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,630
How annoying am I? Do the fucking
person next to me. Cascade them.

330
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,580
Case, case and drew.
Those are the quarterbacks

331
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,190
used to be Joe Verse Phillip

332
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,310
Roger Verse Terry.
What was some of the great rivalry names?

333
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,760
Yeah,

334
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,910
Dan Verse Kenny.

335
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,710
Dan Fouts first, Kenny Anderson
and that fucking freezing bowl. Oh,

336
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:48,160
we definitely stepped out of bounds.
You can see right there. That's exactly

337
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,960
what happened there. You can't see any
grade between the white wide gay scheme.

338
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,550
Got out a giant IPAD.

339
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,080
It's going to play a little donkey
Kong put on a hat. There you go.

340
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,760
Hugs all around like the game
has been one on the safe side.

341
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,490
Is it made of the saints?
The uniforms look a little cheap.

342
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,383
I don't know what's going on.

343
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,850
[inaudible] they take some
stripe away in their shirt.

344
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,230
It looks like they should be playing on
half a field inside a hockey arena. Um,

345
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,110
I right drill braise.
He's got the ball.

346
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:24,830
Hey hands that off and that
guy immediately is tackled.

347
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,170
What a waste of a play.

348
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,620
One or two to go in the
fucking third quarter.

349
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,420
You want me to announce the rest
of the third quarter for you?

350
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:37,940
Some of you guys like when I do this shit.
All right.

351
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,720
Yeah.

352
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,040
Number 29 he's upset. What
is he upset about? I Dunno,

353
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,700
but a guy with fucking night vision
glasses is talking to them. Listen,

354
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:50,820
I just got from the gun range. I didn't
see what happened, but I believe in you.

355
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,380
Okay.

356
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,410
29. What the fuck is he doing out there?
That's a running back number, isn't it?

357
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,903
Yeah.

358
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,750
Maybe he's mad at,
maybe he's mad at case.

359
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,530
Okay,

360
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,240
get off my case.
Keenum sorry.

361
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,990
Jubilees drops back to pass
over the fucking middle.

362
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:12,880
When those sates get a fucking first down.
Woo.

363
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,540
Why don't I give a shit about this game?

364
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,140
It's literally just cause I told Paul
Versey that I thought the states are going

365
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:18,471
to win.

366
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:22,540
That I need this to happen to fill me
up in life because I'm a married guy and

367
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,730
you know, and the compliments, you know,
they're, they're on it. They're on a, Oh,

368
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:28,220
we're, we're on. I'm on
like a compliment ration.

369
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,060
I get one a season and
there's only one season in La.

370
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:37,760
I used to get four a year when I
lived in New York. Now I'm out in La.

371
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:42,440
I get about one. Um, how'd he
get that job as water, water guy?

372
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,920
Like how do you know who's
fucking thirsty? Nobody
ever points to their mouth.

373
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,050
You just kind of walk up. You
stick it, you know. All right.

374
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,090
I swear to God,
the Black Guy.

375
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:56,580
And this commercial looks like they stuck
his head on like an eight year old's

376
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:57,414
body.

377
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,623
Yeah.

378
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,640
Um,
although I do like this commercial

379
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,140
build, nobody gives a fuck. Most
people aren't even watching this now.

380
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:08,460
They don't even know what
you're talking about.

381
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,820
You're literally doing common commentary
for fucking Youtube video that doesn't

382
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:15,870
exist while they're listening
to your podcast. Get back
on the fucking game here.

383
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,160
Um, fucking Steelers. What are
the, what is what this steel is?

384
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:24,760
How many times are they going to look past
the opponent that week? That's, that's,

385
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,990
that's what they say it out there.

386
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,530
They're saying that they focus too much
on the New England patriots because you

387
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:36,520
know, who's kidding who they beat the
Patriots earlier this year, you know?

388
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,050
Yeah.

389
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,480
That was a touch. I don't know. You know
what I don't understand about, you know,

390
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,700
whether it's a catch or
whether it's not a catch,

391
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,390
is the fact that the ground can't
cause a fumble if you're running.

392
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,340
But if you're, it can, it can cause
an incomplete pass San how it works.

393
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,533
I Dunno,

394
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,740
I have no idea. But I liked that
commercial. I just saw that guy was like,

395
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,900
practice in speed skating,
like in his living room.

396
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,870
That'd be like the latest
thing people will get.

397
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,790
Rather than reading about nutrition,

398
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,280
they'll literally spend like
fucking 10 grand on that thing

399
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,840
and then they'll have some sort of app
where they can project it onto their TV,

400
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:18,640
where they can, you can be, you know,

401
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,350
in different speedskating
arenas around the fucking world.

402
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,860
I saw this picture today on the Internet.
It just fuck it.

403
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:30,370
And it made me feel so God damn
old. It was this woman, right?

404
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,970
Where's that place where people go
to vacation? Right? It's like the,

405
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:38,510
the ocean looks absolutely perfect.
And then Z, these grass, like the,

406
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,130
these huts and the hover out
over the water, you know,

407
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:46,900
one tsunami and everybody's dead. Right?
But it looks like absolute paradise.

408
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,090
Okay. And the picture of
this woman, she's in a thong,

409
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,360
right leaning on one leg.

410
00:24:55,361 --> 00:25:00,361
So her butt cheeks sticking out and she's
looking at the huts and over her head,

411
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,250
she, she's making, you know, those,

412
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,280
that stupid thing where you
make the heart with your hands.

413
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,710
She's still with that. You know, and
that it made me feel so fucking old.

414
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:16,711
It's like what even happened to just go
into a fucking unbelievable place and

415
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:20,440
just geeking out and taken a picture of
yourself and you have that look on your

416
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:23,290
face like you can't believe you.
They're like,

417
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:28,291
she literally used that paradise
to enhance her whole fucking like,

418
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,280
okay,

419
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,340
I don't know what the word is.
Her Harness,

420
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,300
I dunno,
the Selfie just,

421
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:45,130
it just makes everybody act like a dude
who doesn't know how to behave when they

422
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:49,630
get their road show. In other words,
they behave like myself. What's going on?

423
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,610
I stepped out of bounds, eight
yards. He picked up eight yards. Oh,

424
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,140
I'll tell you right now.
You know what I tell you?

425
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:58,210
Who's going to make a big
a lot of fucking money?

426
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,690
Whoever owns the Kleenex
store in the mall of America,

427
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,180
it's my prediction that every one of
these Minnesota fans are going to fucking

428
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:08,080
at the end of this game,

429
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,990
or they're all going to go down to the
mall of America and they're going to go

430
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:13,900
into the Kleenex store. They gotta
get their own fucking, you know,

431
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,010
Kleenex with their own initial on it
because everybody's fucking special now.

432
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:19,480
And you could take a Selfie,

433
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,210
but how sad you are actually,

434
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:27,310
you know it would be amazing is if
the vikings go to the Superbowl, okay.

435
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,670
And they play a home game.
Ah,

436
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,090
ah.

437
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:34,861
Oh.

438
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:39,861
When no saints go marching in there
down to the fucking two yard line.

439
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,680
You guys like Pete Fountain, okay.
Huh? Put on the old gray bonnet.

440
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:51,390
I love Pete. Phone. Fucking
always had a killer drummer,

441
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,400
right?
Played the shit out of the clarinet.

442
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,600
Okay.

443
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,020
You know what I mean? And he's never
had any sexual harassment scandals.

444
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,690
Um, anyways, plowing ahead
here. Oh, Jesus Christ.

445
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,270
This fucking guy. There's a guy,
he's hurt. Now what happened?

446
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,140
What happened to the guy? Does he
got to go inside the tent? Well,

447
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:17,080
thank God there's an 80 year old bald
white guy to help him off the field.

448
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,350
The dude was so short,
he couldn't even lean on him.

449
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,110
He's probably going to
have a separated shoulder.

450
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:29,810
By the time he gets over to that
little fucking a little pop tent,

451
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:30,644
they put them in.

452
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:31,960
Okay.

453
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,160
Um,
hey,

454
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:36,880
I think I found the MP three player that
now that I'm seeing this poor bastard

455
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:39,910
with the umbilical cord hanging on,
I'm getting out of the apple world,

456
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,410
right as I said that, that Weirdo just
stared at me in the galaxy commercial.

457
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,920
Like he knew I was going to fucking do it.
Um,

458
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,770
I'm going to get a new, uh, NP, I'm
going to go with one of those. Sonys

459
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:54,810
yeah.

460
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,290
You know, and I want to tell you guys
the exact model so you can be like, dude,

461
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:01,080
oh my God. Really? You're going to buy?

462
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,780
Yeah, I am. I am. Because
I have a bunch of music,

463
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,810
but I didn't get on fucking a apple
and those round building costs.

464
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,051
Okay.

465
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:18,910
But the forest in the middle with a
reeducate their employees that want to ask

466
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:22,600
for more money or maybe pay the poor
bastards that put together their products

467
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,200
so they don't jump to
their fucking deaths. Uh,

468
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,060
how crazy it would be if they still
advertise on this podcast after that. Um,

469
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,260
yeah, I want to fucking get out of
that world. I want to, I'm like,

470
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,660
I still want to use this shit,

471
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:39,930
but I suppose I don't like how they
were all there. Like fucking a,

472
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,670
this is our shit over here. I should
only works with our, with our shit.

473
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,650
None of about shit works with other
people's Shit. Why don't you just shit,

474
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:53,010
you got to buy our other shit to use
our shit. Fuck people's other shit.

475
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,550
We're going to fucking own everything.
I don't say, wait, what is your problem?

476
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,750
How many billions of dollars to you?
I swear to God at that point. Um,

477
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,120
I know a promoted like that,

478
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,240
I know promoted like that he wants
to make all the money, you know,

479
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:09,340
it's not enough that he's
making the most money.

480
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,670
He wants to make all the money
and it actually gives them joy

481
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,450
when, when other people, uh, when
other people's, uh, you know,

482
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,130
other promoters in his town are
not doing well, he'll just say, oh,

483
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:27,280
did you hear about so and sold?
They bought I, I took a bath.

484
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,820
Okay.

485
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,230
And I'd be like, ah, I bet that makes
you happy. Oh, I fucking love it. Um,

486
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,710
anyways,
I guess I never gave you guys a Hashtag.

487
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah.

488
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,070
Uh, for the cruise ships. Why don't
you guys come up with one? Oh,

489
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:46,360
here comes the tent. The pop up tent.
Dick's sporting. Good. All right,

490
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:49,390
let's see a dick. What happened? Did he
hit your left ball? You're right, ball.

491
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,300
All right,
we're going to freeze it here.

492
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,660
We're going to do a little fucking put
a little desk, sit next on it. And a,

493
00:29:55,661 --> 00:30:00,250
I think it'd be all right. All
right. Drew Brees hands the ball off.

494
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,850
A knee guy runs into everybody. Evidently
there was supposed to be a hole there.

495
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:04,631
You know,
when I was a kid,

496
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,480
I thought that running backs rather
than running around the outside,

497
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,440
the reason why they ran in the middle's
cause they thought they'd get famous for

498
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:15,090
trying to do something so impossible.
Um,

499
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,560
what do you guys thinks going to happen
here? Actually, you already know,

500
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,440
I say that they're going
to score on third goal,

501
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,743
right?

502
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,470
Unless they try and run
it three fucking times.

503
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,460
How about a little play action fake here?
Drove for the love of fucking Christ.

504
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,470
Oh, by the way, congratulations
to Liverpool, Liverpool.

505
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:35,940
Be fucking man city.

506
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,660
Cause you guys didn't realize I've been
paying attention a little bit to the

507
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:42,510
premier league.
That soccer for everybody here at north,

508
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,710
it's America. Drew Brees throws
a dam and then say it's go ma.

509
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,150
Hmm. It's fucking 17
too, mother fucking 13.

510
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,160
Oh right. Okay. Case Kate Cascade.

511
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,320
[inaudible] he's on the case. Kanombe
they must do a bunch of shit like that,

512
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:06,790
right? Anytime. Uh, you know,

513
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:10,480
they always have the punch, right?
You must do a bunch of those things.

514
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:13,780
Jesus Christ. This is, that's
becoming a tale of two halves.

515
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,900
It comes drew Brees.
He's going to break their hearts.

516
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,750
I'll tell you right now
then, there, right now,

517
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,770
the last ride on the rollercoaster
at the mall of America is happening.

518
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,140
There's an overall sadness that is
going to descend on that mall right now.

519
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:33,460
There's a bunch of people
that do not give a fuck. Okay?

520
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:36,550
Two white guys trying to do
a cool handshake. They, uh,

521
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:37,480
I don't know what they just did their,

522
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,420
some sort of jerk off fucking motion by
drew Brees. Has He gave the okay sign?

523
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,960
You know, these are the times. Is
it okay that I'm stroking your deck?

524
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:47,920
I think that that's what that meant.

525
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,010
I think that was very
progressive by drew Brees. Um,

526
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,190
all right.

527
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,130
If you could tell I'm doing this thing
early and I've yet to get any of the

528
00:31:57,131 --> 00:32:00,730
advertising. I don't have any fucking,
uh, any of the questions or anything.

529
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:05,380
So at some point I'm going to have to
fucking hit pause or I could text my

530
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,010
fucking guy here to send me the
bullshit. Right. That could happen.

531
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,110
That could happen. Right.
Let me hit pause. You don't
listen this fucking crap. Oh,

532
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:16,690
do ya Johnny. Oh, do you?

533
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,750
The fuck is going on with the
Black Hawks this year. Let me,

534
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,240
let me, I got to hit pause and not put
you through the shit. All right, I'm back.

535
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:27,881
Oh,
you know what I,

536
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:32,881
I was gonna say is if Minnesota wins
this game and then goes to the Superbowl

537
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,540
and uh, I'm actually a vikings
fan from way back in the day,

538
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,880
to be honest with you. I don't know why
I'm, I'm just being a Douche, right? I,

539
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:43,220
like I said, I just predicted this upset.
I don't care if the vikings went, ah,

540
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:45,680
right up the middle for first dad,

541
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,060
they're teen oh two to go in the
game. He's not, and he's not in like,

542
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:52,300
they didn't just give up
14 points in a row. What a,

543
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,840
every fucking guy now acts like they
just reinvented football. Look at this.

544
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,880
All those people blocked for him.

545
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,440
And then when there was finally a fucking
guy who could tackle them, then he did.

546
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,660
And this guy gets up like he's, he'd
ever see Jim Brown get up fucking nod.

547
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,740
Oh, the old man, this is, this
is what you sound like it,

548
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,540
the closer you get to death, you know,
he's like, well, why isn't it went away?

549
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,640
It used to be case Keenan.

550
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,930
He is on a strict no passing diet right
now. They saw that last one. They like,

551
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:27,540
fuck this guy just handed off. Now why
aren't you nodded? Okay. You're not. No,

552
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,374
I don't know

553
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,620
if I've got stuff for it
that God damn line everybody.

554
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,710
Anybody makes a good play at that point.
At the name of the back of the Jersey.

555
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,520
Anytime they fucking don't make a play
that looking for a flag or they run off

556
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:43,040
the field. Anyways, if I can
get through this God damn point,

557
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:47,540
if Minnesota actually goes to the God
damn Superbowl, it's a fucking home game.

558
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,220
Okay.

559
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,910
All right.
Everything there is purple.

560
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,380
There's no way you got to have
like a prince themed halftime show.

561
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,500
Do you think he would have played it and
think he would have come to the woulda

562
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,670
had to have prince come back?

563
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,030
Look at that fucking throat case kingdom
shaken off the interception of the

564
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:07,870
saint. Say it's not a catch. They say
it's not a catch. Right. Says, oh my God,

565
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:11,830
I can't even deal how fucking great and
it's driving me crazy case keyed and

566
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,570
everybody stopped shouting, settle
down. This is a great fucking throat.

567
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,880
Oh, he just drops it right in there.
I Dunno. A little bit of wobbly there.

568
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:25,270
In the end, he caught it. But
did he catch it long enough?

569
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,790
Case Kingdom gets to the, they get
it or not in time. Not In time.

570
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,630
The challenge flag
this degenerate gambling.

571
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,330
Looking at head coach. It's fucking
wife probably cries herself to sleep.

572
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,480
That's such a terrible thing to say.
Why would I say that? All right.

573
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:48,430
He's on the ground. He has it. He has it.
He has it. He has it. He still has it.

574
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,460
If they call this not a fucking catch.
Look at a shit. All right. There you go.

575
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:57,750
That's a catch. He's got it. He's got it.
He's got it. He's got it. He's got it.

576
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,193
He's got it.

577
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,800
What are they going to look at?

578
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,350
Jesus fucking Christ.
How long do you have to have it?

579
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,770
Oh my God. Now I got to see this
replay. 58 fucking time that he,

580
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:20,550
as you see right there daily as
it against his naval and his, his,

581
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:25,110
his fucking happy trail.
Um,

582
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,190
it's got pleading his case.
Take back your Red Hanky.

583
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,753
Uh,

584
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,650
all right.
I know you guys do you guys,

585
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't think you want
to fucking love this.

586
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,620
I've really limited my goddamn audience
here. Let's talk about fucking,

587
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,600
let's limit it even more and I'll talk
to my six British fans over there.

588
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,630
Um,
man city.

589
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,560
Oh fuck.
Oh Fuck

590
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,120
Jesus Christ. It was like a full fucking
bottle of water and it's heavy on too.

591
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:59,340
And I fucking hate that shit.
Evian.

592
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,060
There's minerals in it. Yeah, I can
taste it. It tastes fucking weird.

593
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,840
Okay.

594
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,660
The water rushed through a plastic rock.
Why does it taste so fucking awful? I,

595
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,890
I fucking hate every yard.

596
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,653
MMM.

597
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,810
Anyways, this was to be
like the best bottled water.

598
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,690
It tastes like shit. I done. How do
I know it's from the French Alps?

599
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,110
I answering anything. Poland
spring to Disani smartwater.

600
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,910
I'll drink that box water.

601
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:33,160
I don't give a shit even though it tastes
like you're drinking out of a shoe.

602
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,340
Oh, that fucking wet cardboard. I
know it's better for the environment,

603
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:44,360
but Jesus Christ,

604
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,023
ugh.

605
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,550
You know what's the worst was when you
were a little kid and you drank out of

606
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:53,040
the garden hose and you didn't
realize it was sitting in the sun.

607
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:57,150
You'd had that fucking hot
blast of Stale fucking water.

608
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:58,740
They'd probably been in there for a week.

609
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,350
Jesus Christ.

610
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,310
So you know, they've taken out your
fucking small intestine. Um, all right,

611
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:08,990
let's look up this man city shit.

612
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,210
All right, man. City Man City lost
four to three, to Liverpool. Now.

613
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,000
Now for those of you who live in
the United States, a Merker of Marg,

614
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,813
um,

615
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,090
man city evidently was fucking
undefeated the whole year.

616
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:28,430
I guess that's really difficult.
It's difficult to do on any sports,

617
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:32,690
but I wasn't sure with soccer just seems
like you score one goal and the game's

618
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:35,840
over. But I will tell you lately
they four to three, seven goals.

619
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:36,830
You've got to love that.

620
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,660
Got a fucking love that they lost the
Liverpool homer, the fucking Beatles.

621
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:42,494
That's all I know.

622
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:43,900
Yeah,

623
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,580
that's all I know about touch
shit. Oh, let's talk about,
let's talk about dot. Hey,

624
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,320
Dani fog case. Kate, I'm sacked.
Oh No. He got the ball up,

625
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,200
Donald fucking Trump. I
got to say something, man,

626
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,550
that was a low,

627
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,650
that is a low point in modern United
States history and that's fucking saying

628
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:04,484
something.

629
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,550
Okay.

630
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,710
You just can't, uh, you know,

631
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,170
you know, you just can't, you can't
feel it. It's a fairly linear,

632
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,720
not even apologize and say, you know, I
shouldn't have said it that way, but blah,

633
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,020
blah, blah. That was just a fucking like,

634
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,380
yeah.

635
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,420
I don't know why people
still sticking by the guy.

636
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,120
What ea she tell it is.
All right.

637
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,300
This is number two.
Guy Number four is going to hold the ball.

638
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:36,460
The little skinny guy, he kicks
the ball right down fucking metal.

639
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,400
It was one at one horn flash. What?
What is the Minnesota Vikings?

640
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,790
What is this saints
Guide bitching about now?

641
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,573
Right?

642
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,680
What is he complaining about?
I'll tell you right now, okay.

643
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,200
If a fuck that fucking apnea,
she would've said no catch. Yes.

644
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:56,000
You would've guessed you want.
If you just like my wife,

645
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,590
you just like my fucking wife.

646
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,893
Okay.

647
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:05,590
Do you know you're fat? When you can
see a Manta Sunday. The windbreaker. Oh,

648
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:08,950
he was saying the guy was down.
All right. Nobody cares. Bill.

649
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,530
This is one of the worst podcasts
I've ever done. I apologize. Okay.

650
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:14,950
And I'm sure you guys will
let me know. All right. Oh,

651
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:17,650
so the burrito ended up getting like that.
It just sucked.

652
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,670
Wasn't wrapped tight or I guess I'm
supposed to keep it in the foil.

653
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,960
I have no fucking idea. And then the
chicken was like overcooked. You don't,

654
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:29,920
this is what happens. This is what
happens when you go to a city and you go,

655
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:31,840
you know what?
These people are known for this.

656
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,300
And then you as a tourist
don't know where to go.

657
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,920
And you just go out and get one and then
you go back to your city with the, the,

658
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:43,590
the wrong information saying,
I went there, their burrito's
sucked. It didn't take,

659
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,150
I could make a better breeder than
that. You know, that's like, you know,

660
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:49,750
people go to Chicago, New York and they
say that their pizza sucks. It's like,

661
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:53,530
well, who did you hang out with?
Will you with people from the city?

662
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:58,330
Did they tell you where the fuck
to go? Um, Oh, you know what?

663
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,990
I want it to look up because people
are sitting there saying, oh,

664
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,510
they got it when peach fucking Donald
Trump. And it's just like, well,

665
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:08,710
they impeach Bill Clinton. He got
impeached. I was like, Holy Shit.

666
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:09,690
Okay.

667
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,040
Hey, he's going to have to leave.
And then he, he didn't, he just,

668
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,790
why didn't Bill Clinton leave?

669
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,580
And then I'll just write in
peach, right, that she gave me.

670
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,380
How you spell impeached.
There you go. Impeached.

671
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,540
If Bill Clinton, why did he finish
Cape Bill Clinton was impeached.

672
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,320
Why did he finish up? I don't understand
how he could have been impeached,

673
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:39,810
but he did not leave office.
All right.

674
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:43,440
Being impeached doesn't guarantee the
person in peach has to leave office.

675
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,370
Here's some historical examples.
Uh,

676
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,790
the problem with your question is he was
not impeached in a way to have to leave

677
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,740
office.
I see.

678
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,620
You really don't understand the difference
between impeachment and having to

679
00:40:55,621 --> 00:41:00,150
leave office now. You didn't have
to be that fucking conti about it.

680
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,560
Not True. He wasn't peached for
a public official in peach. Well,

681
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:07,830
this is just people arguing.
Bill Clinton was acquitted.

682
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,550
The Senate did not reach the two thirds
majority needed to fully process is

683
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:13,620
impeachment.
To further break it down,

684
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:17,580
Clinton was impeached by the House on
two charges. The first being perjury,

685
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,460
the second being obstruction
of justice following this,

686
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,020
he was acquitted by the Senate.

687
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,603
Okay.

688
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,940
The impeachment process takes
place in two steps. First,

689
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:30,690
the president has to stick a cigar
in somebody pussy. No, that's right.

690
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,130
First the president, it has to be
impeached in the of Representatives.

691
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,060
That is the equivalent of an indictment.
Ah.

692
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,440
Then the president has tried in the Senate
with the chief justice of the United

693
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,080
States presiding, oh, this is
why all the lefties are saying,

694
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:49,640
we got to fucking kill these elections
in October so we can get Trump out.

695
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,260
I was going,
what the fuck are they talking about?

696
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:56,261
So then they could actually indict him
in the house and then impeach him in the

697
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:57,794
Senate.

698
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,720
Yeah.

699
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,930
It requires a two thirds vote of the
Senate to remove and impeachment.

700
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,520
You think if he got impeached,
right?

701
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,650
If it went to the Senate
and he got impeached,

702
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,270
like I actually think that he would
leave before they took the vote.

703
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,190
He would get on his own fucking plane and
he would just leave and he'd be on the

704
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,100
like just so his ego could
handle it. Like, you know,

705
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,970
you're not going to come walking in here
and have me pack up my shit and have me

706
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:26,050
escorted out like I just get fired at,
you know, some fucking corporation.

707
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,640
All right?
I haven't been,

708
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,420
I don't take the amount of time that I
take to comb my hair over the top of my

709
00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:37,230
fucking head to be treated this
way. All right. Seven deadly.

710
00:42:37,231 --> 00:42:40,020
They fucking didn't
think the guy was down.

711
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,833
Yeah.

712
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,720
I'm literally commentating a game that
you already know the results of that

713
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:48,440
you're not watching. This is the
stupidest fucking thing I've ever done.

714
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,040
All right? I'll be honest with you.
I'm just, I'm fucking lonely. Okay.

715
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,000
I just felt like talking to somebody can,
can you guys just be there for me?

716
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,560
All right. The fucking fucking guy
did his God damn job. He hit it twice.

717
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,960
Hey, how about a round of applause for
the person who's making the field goal

718
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:09,050
kickers, helmets. Now they finally,
you know, they gave him like two bars.

719
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:10,660
Okay.

720
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,900
You know I went back in the day,
they just had that like Fred Cox,

721
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:18,280
Joe size been all those guys just had
that one bar across the front of their

722
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:22,250
fucking,
I mean I dunno.

723
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:25,290
I Dunno how those people
survived. All right. You know it.

724
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,560
This is going to be a
mercy pause right here.

725
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,490
I'm going to just wait for the all the
information to come from my fucking

726
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:34,880
podcast so I can actually
do this. Okay. Yes.

727
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:38,870
We'll send over in five getting
advertising now. Alright.
I still got advertising.

728
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,880
Um, all right, I'll talk
to you two seconds here.

729
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:45,780
Okay.

730
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,310
All right. I'm back and I got all the
materials I need here. By the way,

731
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:54,870
all when does say it stayed fucking
scored again? They were up by one point.

732
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,480
That's where I am in the game.
They just,

733
00:43:57,481 --> 00:44:02,481
Vikings just got a pass interference
call with number 19 or some shit on the

734
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:06,060
vikings who has the smallest shoulder
pads I've ever seen in my life.

735
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,970
Remember the eighties,
how big fucking shoulder pads were?

736
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,810
What do they make those things out of now?
I guess if everybody has small ones,

737
00:44:12,811 --> 00:44:17,580
then it's a fucking, it's a
fair game. Oh, by the way.

738
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:18,414
So

739
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:24,590
basically what happened with Bill Clinton
was he got indicted in the House of

740
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,560
Representatives and then when
it went to the Senate, the,

741
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:30,390
I needed two thirds of the vote and none
of the Democrats voted to impeach him.

742
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,610
So that's how we got off the liberals
look the other way with the sexual

743
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:36,444
harassment.

744
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,750
And you know,
it's all just politics.

745
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,240
It's not like one side's better than
the other. If it was a Republican,

746
00:44:46,241 --> 00:44:47,200
they would have voted the,
oh,

747
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:49,030
they all would have voted the
exact fucking opposite way,

748
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:53,050
except maybe one or two fucking
actually decent human beings. Um,

749
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,010
Eh, the result. But, so
Bill Clinton got acquitted,

750
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,950
but he did lose his license to
practice law because of that.

751
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,580
That fucking unbelievable
unfuckable would have. Oh, I,

752
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,270
one of the hardest things I think is
to become a lawyer. Just all like,

753
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,100
like trying to pass the
bar and all of that.

754
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,840
You go through all of that shit and
then what do you do? You stick a cigar.

755
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,920
It's some fucking woman's pussy. That is
it. Your wife and then you lie about it.

756
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:25,330
And then all that studying goes
right out the window. Jesus Christ.

757
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:31,340
I love cigars and I love women,
but I'm telling you if I learned anything,

758
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:33,680
you got to keep them separate.
All right?

759
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:41,780
Okay, let's do some advertising

779
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,060

00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,250
Are they going to be crying at
the mall of America? How much?

865
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,220
How many yards does he need?
They need like another 15 yards.

866
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,010
Oh.
Oh,

867
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,880
okay. Here we go. The
Vikings are one play away.

868
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,530
Yeah.

869
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:12,520
Unless this guy comes in and just
kits like a fucking 70 yarder. Oh,

870
00:52:12,521 --> 00:52:16,180
you got to catch that.
You got to catch that.

871
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:17,710
Okay.

872
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,110
Hey, fuck you. I want to
throw it was right there.

873
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:21,800
Yeah,

874
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,633
drew Brees.

875
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,670
Okay.

876
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:27,060
Oh God. The coach has on his reading
glasses. He's already in the f off season.

877
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,940
It's going to read catcher
in the rye or some shit.

878
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,650
Okay.

879
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:36,080
Come on man. Come on Dro.
Why do I give a shit? I, I,

880
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,330
the vikings have had a drought.

881
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:40,200
The the states one in 2010
I just want to be right.

882
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,280
I said the states are going to win.
I apologize to everybody in Minneapolis,

883
00:52:44,281 --> 00:52:47,990
Saint Paul Duluth.
Oh No.

884
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:52,170
First Down fucking fun.
The sates.

885
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,110
Oh my God,
I have to turn this up.

886
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,100
Okay.

887
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,360
Oh my God.

888
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,560
He's in the guys feel
goal rage. Oh No, no.

889
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:05,490
Yeah.

890
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,670
You know what's funny? I Love Minneapolis.
I don't want you people to be sad.

891
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:12,390
I was just joking around.
Oh,

892
00:53:12,391 --> 00:53:15,870
case Kate and puts it head on and takes
it off. Puts it on, holds his head.

893
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:21,200
How am I ever going to talk to
my loved ones again? Holy Shit.

894
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:26,190
Ten nine eight Jesus Christ.
Route. What are we doing? I learned

895
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,850
from Tony Romo, Hasa play clock. You
fucking moron. Alright, 40 seconds to go.

896
00:53:30,851 --> 00:53:35,260
I was like, Jesus, he's nonchalant. I
learned from Tony Romo. You want to,

897
00:53:35,261 --> 00:53:37,290
you want to kick it
with four seconds left.

898
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,430
I think it's four seconds left cause then
you don't have to kick off like that's

899
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:45,930
how long it feel gold takes.
But with Tony Romo after it's done,

900
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,830
Bob Lynn it, it probably takes 11 seconds.
Oh, come on. He shits on Deion Sanders.

901
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:52,560
I can give him a little fucking rough
time. I love Tony Romo, by the way.

902
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,533
All right.

903
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:58,250
Practice. Tee you alright? He kicked
it. Okay. I put it into the net.

904
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:04,530
37 seconds to go. Oh my God. Is this

905
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,670
the mall of America?
God,

906
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,530
why didn't I invest in the clean
tech store at the mall of America?

907
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,180
One of the dumbest things I ever did.
Blitz and true

908
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,060
breeze. Fucking picked
it up. It's a catch. Oh,

909
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:24,830
I'm going to talk so much
shit. [inaudible] I'm
going to talk so much shit.

910
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:28,850
Diversey what did I say? I called it. Oh,

911
00:54:28,851 --> 00:54:31,310
he's a ball was bobbling.
Now he got it. He got it.

912
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:36,170
Did he catch it enough times for it to be
a kid and all that. Dot. Nope. Nope. No.

913
00:54:36,171 --> 00:54:37,004
That's not a catch.

914
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,100
The little tail was hanging down
in the bottom. See, now here go.

915
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,390
He goes all the fucking drama.

916
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,880
This is going to be 20 fucking
minutes of this shit. All right.

917
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,840
I'm not even looking at this goddamn
game at this point. That is not a catch.

918
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,660
The vikings come.
You gotta throw the challenge flag.

919
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,280
Did the vikings coach just
come from the gun range?

920
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:56,820
What with those God damn glasses.

921
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:58,400
Okay.

922
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,120
That I duh Duh Duh.

923
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,030
Okay.

924
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,020
You can see the point of the ball
touches the ground or right there.

925
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,630
Yeah.
It's not a catch.

926
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:14,200
Everybody knows it's not a catch for
the fucking love of Christ. All right.

927
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:19,010
This is hilarious. The first letter that
I got this week, there's the water guy.

928
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,280
Now how did he know the guy wanted the
water down his back when that be annoying.

929
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,610
Top of fuck is the name of this one.
Dear Billy Booze Hound.

930
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:32,250
I had been a big fan of the podcast
and you stand up for several years now.

931
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,700
I am writing you to tell you that I
owe you a lot. Oh Jesus. Look at this.

932
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,440
It was about a year ago.

933
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,220
I heard you first say that every now and
then you would look into the mirror and

934
00:55:42,221 --> 00:55:46,400
call yourself a tub of fuck.
I do.

935
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:51,160
I thought it was hilarious and it made me
realize I was at top of fuck as wealth.

936
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,470
Look at that.
We're bonding.

937
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,503
MMM.

938
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,360
Fucking sound. ICLOUD preferences. I don't
know. My password and you won't give me,

939
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:02,210
you won't give me a second chance, so
I don't want to update it. All right.

940
00:56:02,211 --> 00:56:03,470
Since last February,

941
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,370
I have woken up every morning and
told myself that I am a tub of fuck.

942
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,350
I made my phone wallpaper,

943
00:56:09,351 --> 00:56:14,351
a picture of me when I was at my heaviest
two 55 so whenever I unlock my phone

944
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:19,220
there was a reminder of the tub of
fuck I am and no longer want to beat.

945
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:24,010
That's great. I'm proud to announce
that I have lost 70 pounds in

946
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,460
11 months. Dude, that's
awesome. And honestly,

947
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,840
I owe you a big thanks for giving me
the motivation to do this because of you

948
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:35,440
and Joe Rogan, probably more Joe
Rogan. He's actually a shape.

949
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,770
I have done a lot of things in the
last year that have taken me out of my

950
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:42,910
comfort zone. You've been
a great inspiration in my
life in many different ways.

951
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:47,080
Hope you and the loving Neil and the baby
have a great 2018 from one tub of fuck

952
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:49,960
to another. Go Fuck Yourself.
Well that was just, you know,

953
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:53,560
for all you guys know that I wrote that
there was really no question there.

954
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,450
After further review,

955
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,660
did he say that was a catch?

956
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,423
What?

957
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,830
How the fuck was that a catch?
You saw that little cone of the ball

958
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:15,130
case kingdom cannot grow a
beard. God dammit. He's trying.

959
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,740
What the fuck?

960
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:22,520
Yeah.

961
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,570
Oh my God.
Everybody's got on their granny glasses.

962
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,970
All right, drew Brees. What's he gonna do?

963
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:35,660
He's gonna get a hands off the
fucking ball and nothing happens,

964
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:39,650
but he didn't fumble it. All right.
You guys want to listen to this shit?

965
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,150
Do you want to listen to the sound of
a bunch of 80,000 people have already

966
00:57:44,151 --> 00:57:48,740
started crying to go to the mall of
America. If I ran the mall of America,

967
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:52,940
I would say free rollercoaster
rides for the entire month.

968
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,690
Well, maybe for the week. You know,
they've gotta make that money over there.

969
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:57,950
Can't imagine how much.

970
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:00,003
Okay.

971
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:00,963
Oh my God.

972
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:02,590
Okay.

973
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,510
How does this always happen
to the fucking vikings?

974
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:07,580
It always happens to them when they're
at home. Everything with like 15 in one.

975
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,510
The dirty birds came in and it just,

976
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,153
okay.

977
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:17,370
Somehow came in and fucking beat him.
It's unreal.

978
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:17,670
Done.

979
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:21,060
Then they have a game against like the
fucking red skins or something like that

980
00:58:21,061 --> 00:58:21,894
and 88

981
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,260
yeah.

982
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,780
Well they had the game won and
then it just fucking went away.

983
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,280
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

984
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:30,710
Yeah.

985
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,510
All right, here we go. Bobby. A bears

986
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:39,820
fucking lining up for the kick.
The kick is up la and it's good.

987
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,680
Oh No.

988
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,633
Yes.

989
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,850
Oh,
when the saints go marching in?

990
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:50,640
Oh my God.

991
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,673
Okay.

992
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,260
The game is not over
cause they got case Keenum

993
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:58,300
perfect.

994
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,440
What the fuck?
I'm already typing in capital letters.

995
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:07,330
So Paul Versey. What the fuck
did I say? What did I say?

996
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,920
All right. Let me turn this down.
What did I do to the fucking thing?

997
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,710
Is there an exit button?
Exit.

998
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,830
Holy fucking shit.

999
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:26,580
I can't, I can't fucking believe
they came back and won this game.

1000
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,080
I knew. I just say, you know, I
don't know shit about football.

1001
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:34,200
I just had a feeling set of feelings.
I was like drew Brees.

1002
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,000
He's like third all time passing. He never
gets the respect. He fucking deserves.

1003
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:41,250
I think he's good.
I said it last week on the podcast.

1004
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,200
Okay.

1005
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,230
Uh, I'm texting Paul Versey
right fucking now Paul for Z.

1006
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:55,620
Should I do, I should wait. Right? What
is this guy takes it back. All right.

1007
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,050
25 seconds left case.
Keenum

1008
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:04,660
it's going to present his case that he
is, he is the key. Numb to them. Winning.

1009
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,170
Sorry. What the fuck? I mean,
they did a bunch for Aaron. Judge.

1010
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,980
I can't have fun with case. Keenum steam.
That's what I'm going to do someday.

1011
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:14,200
You know,
when I retire from being a comedian,

1012
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:17,770
I'm going to ghost write
headlines for sports pages,

1013
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,823
you know,

1014
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,650
and I'll finally get to do all my pun
jokes that I'm not allowed to do in a

1015
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:25,810
comedy.
You do a pun jokes in a comedy club,

1016
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,870
you're going to get a grown and
people can you do enough of them?

1017
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:32,680
People going to ask for their fucking
money back. All right. The Daily News,

1018
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:36,040
the New York Post, all of these
guys, they live on it. Oh, I'll fall.

1019
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:37,270
Start false start.

1020
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:39,200
Okay.

1021
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,970
Everybody's pointing at everybody else.

1022
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:44,690
A little disco dancing on the Vikings.

1023
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,733
Yeah.

1024
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:50,470
Oh Jeez. Look at that guy. How much
is his breath stink? I fucking beard.

1025
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:54,490
He's probably still get cereal
in there. Oh, that wasn't good.

1026
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,050
That's not the way you want.

1027
01:00:56,051 --> 01:00:58,120
That's not the way you want to
start your two minute offense.

1028
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,770
I like the Vikings when I was a kid
cause purple was my favorite color when I

1029
01:01:05,771 --> 01:01:09,370
was a little kid. I wanted to, I
wanted to be a painter now like of art.

1030
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,410
I would just wanted to paint houses.
I thought it was going to,

1031
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,100
that would be a cool
job. And uh, all right,

1032
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:19,150
prevent defense there on the 38 yard line.
Don't take a dump penalty.

1033
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,043
Okay.

1034
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,320
Um,
I just,

1035
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,230
I just wanted to paint houses and I was
going to paint everybody's house purple

1036
01:01:28,231 --> 01:01:30,330
whether they liked it or not,
cause that was my favorite color.

1037
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,470
So right out of the gate,
you know, I was a con.

1038
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,570
Um,

1039
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,813
yeah.

1040
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:47,310
Uh, Jesus, here we go.
Paul Versey. Here we go.

1041
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,600
Okay.

1042
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,350
I'm actually going to,

1043
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,780
I'm going to text it right now
cause if I'm wrong you guys will,

1044
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,620
I will put the sound on,
you'll get to listen to be deleted,

1045
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,030
dude.
I fucking called it called.

1046
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,870
It's why is it so much fun
being right about sports?

1047
01:02:06,871 --> 01:02:09,570
It's probably cause you know I'm
so wrong in the rest of my life.

1048
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,140
Just feels good.
Every once in a while incomplete.

1049
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,960
It only took fucking two seconds
off. All right. You know what?

1050
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:20,250
This is going to be boring the amount
of time this is going to fucking me.

1051
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:25,080
Read the next goddamn question. Is it
going to be another love letter? Oh,

1052
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:26,730
bill tip on making oatmeal.
Okay.

1053
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:30,720
I started eating steel cut
oats and uh, they, they,

1054
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:34,950
they have this glee consistency. Unless
you just keep stirring the fucking thing.

1055
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,881
He said,

1056
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:40,110
get an instant instant pot and you could
make steel cut oats in like three to

1057
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:43,830
four minutes.
They're like $90 on Amazon.

1058
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:44,880
Okay.

1059
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,250
I should use honey.
See if I can get it for 87.

1060
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,980
If you go to your website
and click the link,

1061
01:02:50,981 --> 01:02:54,400
they'll even throw you a little
bit of cash. The chief, uh,

1062
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,410
the fuck is an instapot.

1063
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:58,840
Okay.

1064
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,690
It's, do you mean like
a microwave? Insta Pot?

1065
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:08,120
Let me see this. It's like a
vaporizer for oatmeal. Insta pot.

1066
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:10,463
Okay.

1067
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,420
I need to Google a fucking picture of that

1068
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:19,060
Insta pot that looks like I've
complete piece of shit. Oh,

1069
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,670

What does that,

1070
01:03:21,671 --> 01:03:24,610
what you wrote my losing my mind.

1071
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:31,340
Where is it now? You wrote
Insta Pot. It's instant.

1072
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,450
Instant pot. Like I'll have this
breakfast made in an instant.

1073
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:36,630
Okay.

1074
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,790
Oh,
but then on Amazon it says in step pot,

1075
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,460
maybe the instant pot is
fucking ripping them off.

1076
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:43,530
Okay.

1077
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:46,880
All right. What is it? It's ball
on young 39. What down is it?

1078
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:53,060
Case Kane and back for fucking
pass throws the ball and complete.

1079
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,400
Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Yeah.
That's what it is. Instapot is

1080
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,150
120 bucks.
So I'm like,

1081
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:06,910
this is just going to be something else
in my fucking cupboard because I can't

1082
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:10,670
wait an extra 26 minutes.
So my oats, you're like, oh,

1083
01:04:10,671 --> 01:04:13,270
this person was just trying to help me
out and I'm still being a jerk about him.

1084
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,800
I am into, uh, I didn't see that New
Matt Damon movie about downsizing,

1085
01:04:17,801 --> 01:04:21,430
but I am all about that shit.

1086
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,950
I had a lot of layoffs in my wardrobe.
I just sent everything. Fuck,

1087
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,510
I'm gonna I'm going to be like,
I'm gonna have like three pairs of pants,

1088
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:33,280
one black, one blue, and then just one
for every shit moment of my fucking day.

1089
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,680
Uh,
oh.

1090
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:41,080
Oh my God. No. Fuck it.

1091
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,310
That could not have just happened.
That could not have just happened.

1092
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,030
Oh my God.

1093
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:57,450
I feel I can't fucking police the greatest
podcast ever that could not have just

1094
01:04:58,331 --> 01:04:59,164
happened.

1095
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,260
How do you let that happen?

1096
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,640
Holy Shit. All right. Wait.

1097
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:09,470
Okay.

1098
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:11,780
Unfucking believable.

1099
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,550
Oh, you know what? I didn't save
the thing when I've texted Diversey

1100
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,470
I almost said, dude, I fucking call that.

1101
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:25,000
How did that fucking just happen
on the last play of the game.

1102
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:27,070
Okay.

1103
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,680
And that he missed him and
knocked his own guy down.

1104
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,350
Okay.

1105
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,540
You have to be fucking kidding me.

1106
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:39,210
Okay.

1107
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,500
I've literally seen it all.

1108
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,330
Okay.

1109
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,520
I cannot fucking believe
that just happened.

1110
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,640
Okay.

1111
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,850
Are you fucking kidding me?

1112
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,163
Okay.

1113
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:01,600
Exactly. Case Keenum. Oh my God.

1114
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,180
I just saw it when the guy
caught it. I was like, holy fuck.

1115
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:09,770
Are they going to have
time to kick a field goal?

1116
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:14,773
Okay.

1117
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,910
Why won't anybody hug case Keenum

1118
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,243
okay.

1119
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,030
Look at the wide receiver.
Acted like he just did something to me.

1120
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:27,940
He caught the ball,
but that saves completely fucked up.

1121
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:32,770
He act like he faked
out that guy. He, wow.

1122
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:38,110
Oh my God. I don't know what the name
of that St is, but I got to feel in,

1123
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:41,710
everybody's going to know that
name by the night. Holy Shit.

1124
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,183
Okay.

1125
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,880
I cannot fucking believe
that just happened.

1126
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,373
Okay.

1127
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,380
There was another med when drew
Pearson caught that fucking ball.

1128
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,610
The Vikings are finally on the
right side of one of these place.

1129
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:05,860
Okay.

1130
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,570
Holy Shit.

1131
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:12,883
Okay.

1132
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:16,690
Oh my God. I cannot fucking believe. I
cannot fucking believe that just happened.

1133
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:22,600
That was unbelievable.
Happy for Minnesota,

1134
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:25,330
but Jesus Christ's sad for the saints.

1135
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:28,440
What the fuck now?

1136
01:07:28,441 --> 01:07:33,441
How if you're that guy in the saints
that miss the guy completely didn't even

1137
01:07:33,871 --> 01:07:37,230
put your fucking arms out and
then took out another player.

1138
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:40,290
How do you go into that locker room?
What do you say?

1139
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,290
What the fuck do you say?

1140
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:46,913
Okay.

1141
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,260
Oh my God.

1142
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,000
Okay.

1143
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,850
What were the fucking odds? I was going
to be watching this game the entire time.

1144
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,610
Oh Jesus. Now the rest got to
look reviewing the score. It's a,

1145
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,060
he didn't step out of bounds.
Don't take this away from football fence.

1146
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:09,320
Don't take this away. What did
he do? He just put his head down.

1147
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,430
That's like some pop Warner shit.

1148
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,340
Oh my God.

1149
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:25,090
Ruling a field has confirmed the
ref taken a lot of time here.

1150
01:08:25,091 --> 01:08:26,020
He never gets cheered.

1151
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,293
Okay,

1152
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,920
we must kick the field goal.

1153
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,453
Okay.

1154
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,160
I just shut it off. I cannot wait
a minute. I got to leave it on.

1155
01:08:38,161 --> 01:08:41,580
What if they fucking block it and
scored score. Fucking touchdown. Right.

1156
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,290
I got to leave that on.
I can't,

1157
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,910
I don't believe what I just saw.
I cannot fucking believe that.

1158
01:08:50,911 --> 01:08:51,870
How many times have I said that?

1159
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,130
That was fucking unbelievable.

1160
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,573
Okay.

1161
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:08,430
How do I follow this up with questions?
I just did all of that.

1162
01:09:08,431 --> 01:09:12,330
Now my next question, do you
miss the Prius? I swear to
God. That's the question.

1163
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:15,443
MMM.

1164
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,470
Oh,
now they're going to clear the field.

1165
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,340
We have to fucking kick the extra point.
The saints are gone.

1166
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,350
Now they got to come
out of the locker room.

1167
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:29,760
Can you imagine if the guy
just fucked that play a block,

1168
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:32,100
this extra point and ran
it back for a touchdown?

1169
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,330
That would be like watching
a tosh point. Oh. Like,

1170
01:09:37,331 --> 01:09:41,440
you know when he has the people be able
to do the redemptions without needing

1171
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:46,990
tosh point. Oh, it'd be a
self contained episode. Um,

1172
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:52,000
alright. Hang on a second. Let me
fucking get my password in here.

1173
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:57,040
Let me read this Prius. Think
while we're waiting. Uh,

1174
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,910
okay. Do you miss the
Prius? What up Billy Buick?

1175
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:04,320
I actually love a Buick back in the
day. I love [inaudible]. You know when,

1176
01:10:04,321 --> 01:10:07,350
when a Cadillac was a Cadillac
and a Buick was like, you know,

1177
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,880
you weren't quite a Cadillac guy.

1178
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,870
I wonder if this would have put
them at least in field goal range,

1179
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,210
the worst fucking attempt
ever at a fucking,

1180
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,870
the fact that that guy is a safety.

1181
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,540
Oh my God,

1182
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:34,340
I don't fight.
I seen a lot of shit.

1183
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,650
I have seen a lot of shit.

1184
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:41,590
What the fuck anyways.
Do you

1185
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,553
hmm.

1186
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,600
I know you're thrifty for years
while driving your Prius Bill.

1187
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,740
I was wondering if you still like driving
a nicer vehicle or regret spending the

1188
01:10:50,741 --> 01:10:54,160
money. I'm in the recovery
from buying new vehicles.

1189
01:10:54,161 --> 01:10:58,120
I wasted money for years on new cars and
never really got any satisfaction from

1190
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:02,170
it. For the past three years I've been
driving a 2007 Honda accord. Awesome.

1191
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:06,220
And surprisingly, I'm pretty happy with
it. Yeah, dude, once you get it paid off,

1192
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:09,850
it's a shit. I still have to fight the
urge to buy a new ride often anyways,

1193
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:14,280
happy new year from down in Alabama.
Um,

1194
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:19,620
uh, no, cause I didn't buy a
nice car till I could afford one.

1195
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:23,830
Uh, that's a mistake a lot
of people do. You know,

1196
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:27,790
the trying to get some lady's attention
or whatever the fuck it is or they just

1197
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:31,210
love cars so much. Like if
you're really, really a car guy,

1198
01:11:31,211 --> 01:11:33,550
I understand like along the way
you're going to have like nice cars,

1199
01:11:33,551 --> 01:11:38,551
but I was always about paying off my
house and getting the bankers off my back.

1200
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:44,080
I was into that shit. This is what's
fucked up is the saints right now.

1201
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:47,680
They have a chance,
a very small chance,

1202
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:49,240
but they have a chance don't they

1203
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:56,600
to block the extra point in return for a
touchdown. Can't that fucking happen? Um,

1204
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,960
anyways, yeah, I was always,

1205
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:05,680
I was always way into no debt or
working my way towards having no debt.

1206
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:11,300
Like, um, I,

1207
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:14,440
I just, I can't stress that
enough to young people,

1208
01:12:14,441 --> 01:12:18,590
but when you get like a credit card
and all that shit, it's just like be,

1209
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:23,630
be really careful with those
things and you can't like,

1210
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:27,740
um, oh, this is smart.

1211
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:31,330
They're just going to go for a two point
of conversion and just down the ball so

1212
01:12:31,331 --> 01:12:34,360
that can't happen. There you
go. That's smart. My dumb ass.

1213
01:12:34,361 --> 01:12:39,070
That's why I don't coach
on any level. Um, anyways.

1214
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:44,080
The um, yeah, I was,

1215
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:49,510
I just was always into like,
just not being in debt,

1216
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,020
you know,

1217
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:55,020
it just absolutely paralyzes you and it
affects your ability to go after what

1218
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:57,700
you want to go after.
I've told this story before,

1219
01:12:57,701 --> 01:13:01,150
like I kept a day job until I moved to
New York the first three and a half years.

1220
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,500
I was a comedian probably the last year.

1221
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:09,250
Well actually it's not true cause I was
still living at home with my parents.

1222
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,510
I could have basically,
um,

1223
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:18,270
you know, said, hey, hey, can you
help support me with my dream?

1224
01:13:18,271 --> 01:13:21,390
And I could have just been sitting around
the house, so just making comedy money.

1225
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:26,490
But I continued to work and
before I moved down to New York,

1226
01:13:26,491 --> 01:13:28,020
I paid off everything.

1227
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:29,970
MMM.

1228
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,970
I paid off my student loans.
I paid off my car,

1229
01:13:34,971 --> 01:13:37,040
which died right before
I went to New York.

1230
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:42,290
And I saved up a chunk of money and I
just moved down to New York. And, uh,

1231
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:43,760
I was never a ramen noodle guy,

1232
01:13:43,761 --> 01:13:47,270
but I definitely ate a lot of fucking
Rigatoni and Spaghetti and shit.

1233
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,330
MMM.

1234
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,670
And I just did that. So, um,

1235
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,010
okay.

1236
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:57,770
When I finally got it,
when I finally bought myself a nice car,

1237
01:13:57,771 --> 01:14:02,690
I could afford it and felt
like I earned it. And um, yeah,

1238
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:07,130
I loved it. But I also love the Prius. The
Prius is a fucking great car, you know,

1239
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:12,130
cheap as shit to fucking own. It's never
a problem. You Park it wherever you want.

1240
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:16,170
No one's trying to steal a fucking Prius.
You know, I always joked like you don't,

1241
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:17,860
once mine was like
eight or nine years old,

1242
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:21,640
I literally could leave that thing on
with the door open in the middle of a

1243
01:14:21,641 --> 01:14:25,810
fucking, you know, riot and no one
would take it. Like, you know, you know,

1244
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:29,130
whenever they do the trap car, I try
to get people to steal that car. They,

1245
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,950
they've never, I will be willing to bet
they never did that with a fucking Prius.

1246
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,640
Now I want to know how many of those
Viking fan stuck around. You know,

1247
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:37,870
some people left,

1248
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:42,850
you know that they fucking left and as
they were winding down the fucking stairs,

1249
01:14:42,851 --> 01:14:45,700
they just heard every
going, oh my God, Oh my God.

1250
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,970
And they had to fucking run
their fat asses back up there.

1251
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:52,000
Congratulations to the vikings.
Holy Shit.

1252
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:57,770
The Vikings did not win that game.

1253
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:01,970
That was a the biggest
fuck up I have seen,

1254
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,500
okay

1255
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,440
in a long goddamn time.
Ah,

1256
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,390
drew Brees and once again
drew Brees to silent assassin.

1257
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,960
Nobody knows how good that guy is and
now he's not going to get to prove in the

1258
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:16,340
NFC championship game. Potentially tried
to win a super bowl tragedy. All right.

1259
01:15:16,341 --> 01:15:20,720
Bulletproof glass bullshit. A
dear Billy dad bought, you know,

1260
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:21,620
that hurts.

1261
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,670
I was listening to your podcast a while
back where you read someone's email

1262
01:15:25,671 --> 01:15:30,671
concerning owning a store
with a bulletproof glass
where his grandfather was

1263
01:15:31,851 --> 01:15:36,851
almost killed and he was outraged at the
mandate and claimed the person pushing

1264
01:15:36,951 --> 01:15:40,640
the bill said,
bulletproof windows are racist.

1265
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:45,410
I just wanted to point out that it was
bullshit. Most people in this country,

1266
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:46,360
okay.

1267
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,990
Who get outraged over things
are oftentimes just misinformed.

1268
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:55,210
And because we live in a consumer culture
where the customer is always right. No,

1269
01:15:55,211 --> 01:15:59,890
they're not. That's old school.
The customer is not right.

1270
01:15:59,891 --> 01:16:03,460
The customer can go fuck themselves and
talk to a fucking robot on the phone.

1271
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:05,410
If you're bleeding to death,

1272
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:10,411
the press to the mindset has transitioned
to politicians saying the citizens are

1273
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:14,680
hardworking, honest, honorable
Americans rather than saying the truth.

1274
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:19,180
Most citizens are ignorant, entitled
tribal mouth, tribal mouth breathers.

1275
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:19,721
Sir,

1276
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:23,560
I don't know at what point in political
history politicians were saying that.

1277
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:27,220
They never said that either.
So you're kind of speaking in hyperbole,

1278
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:31,050
I believe is the expression. Uh, but
I understand what you're saying. Um,

1279
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,380
you're trying to build up your point.

1280
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:37,030
This is the bill that was proposed
regarding bulletproof windows. Um,

1281
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,490
I have not fucking reading all of that.
Uh,

1282
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:42,910
it's re regarding restaurants
and no other places of business.

1283
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:46,960
So that person that wrote you in fear
of having his bulletproof glass band is

1284
01:16:46,961 --> 01:16:48,820
basically an outrage over nothing.

1285
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,063
Okay.

1286
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,050
Oh, in outrage and
outrage, you mean? No D it,

1287
01:16:54,051 --> 01:16:56,730
it doesn't even affect him or his
grandfather. Well, that's good.

1288
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:58,740
It was never called racist.

1289
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:02,640
We want to make sure that there
isn't this sort of indignity,

1290
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:03,810
in my opinion,

1291
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:08,910
to serving food through a Plexiglas
only in certain neighborhoods.

1292
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:15,840
What?
That doesn't make sense.

1293
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:21,520
Well, who are you to say it's
indignant? I, you know what, that's,

1294
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:26,230
that's sneaky writing right there.
You're going to get offended for people.

1295
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,970
I don't understand what's going on here.
I don't know. It was never called racist.

1296
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:36,140
We want to make sure that there isn't
this sort of indignity, in my opinion,

1297
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:40,400
to serving food through a Plexiglas
only in a certain neighborhoods. Well,

1298
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:43,510
whenever I was doing gigs and bad
neighborhoods and they had that follicle

1299
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:46,850
bulletproof glass, I always
looked at it. Okay, heads up.

1300
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,850
Keep your head on a swivel.
I appreciated it being there.

1301
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,290
I didn't feel like fucking,

1302
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:57,470
I dunno what you tried to do here,

1303
01:17:57,471 --> 01:18:00,620
but I am in favor of hurting
some people's feelings.

1304
01:18:00,621 --> 01:18:04,400
If it keeps people who want to just
have the honest job of working at a

1305
01:18:04,401 --> 01:18:08,750
restaurant alive, um, I
would be in favor of it.

1306
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:12,950
I don't think it's plexiglass is,
is it? Plexiglass stops a bullet.

1307
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:16,400
I don't fuck it though.
Um,

1308
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:20,180
that's from Philadelphia.
Council woman. Cindy Bass.

1309
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:25,790
All right, let's look up Cindy.
Cindy can be your friend.

1310
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,300
Three 10.
She's your fucking council man.

1311
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,170
Why does it always take me
to fucking Wikipedia now?

1312
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:41,300
Oh, what the fuck? Where
are we Cindy bass images.

1313
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,880
Cindy Bass appears to be African American.
All right,

1314
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:49,190
so this person was saying that
she was being racist. Now,

1315
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,920
according to some people, it's
impossible for a black person to be ray.

1316
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,640
I don't even know what the fuck is
going on right now. I don't know.

1317
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:00,470
All I know is if I worked in Oh God damn
restaurant and somebody nearby had shot

1318
01:19:00,471 --> 01:19:03,290
someone in a restaurant to the point
that somebody felt that they needed to be

1319
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:06,680
some fucking glass up
there, uh, I would want it.

1320
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,310
But who the fuck am I to say what
people need in their neighborhood?

1321
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:16,150
Ah, well how the fuck did I get
signed out of that thing? Hey,

1322
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,940
when it's signed you out as it
goes, you want to make a report? No,

1323
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:23,590
I don't have time for that shit like
Kuwait where it's time to do that. Um,

1324
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:27,470
I was trying to do a podcast and you know
who it was, so nobody's showing dope.

1325
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,830
Um,
it was never called Kate.

1326
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:35,120
While I still don't agree that any type
of business should be mandated to remove

1327
01:19:35,121 --> 01:19:38,000
a type of security for whatever it was.

1328
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:43,001
Websites like steadfast and loyal.com
that wrote bulletproof glass is now racist

1329
01:19:45,021 --> 01:19:47,750
in their title. However, you know what,

1330
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:49,100
I actually understand
what you're saying here.

1331
01:19:49,101 --> 01:19:53,240
Cause that type of shit happens to
comedians all the time where they just,

1332
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:55,610
you know, if they float something
out there, Huffington Post,

1333
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:58,970
and then they try to get you in trouble
or make it more sensationalized so they

1334
01:19:58,971 --> 01:20:03,020
can get views. Uh, however,
in the body of the article,

1335
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:06,380
they admitted that the council woman
never used those words. But of course,

1336
01:20:06,381 --> 01:20:10,860
most people don't read beyond
this article. Yeah, see, I mean,

1337
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,780
that's the Internet. There's really
no, uh, there's no libel. There's no,

1338
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:21,360
there's none. I cannot fucking,
I got to hit with this guy said,

1339
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,720
uh,
God cared.

1340
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:34,910
God cared that this Guy Yeps God care
and the other guy had too much devil in

1341
01:20:34,911 --> 01:20:39,230
him, Debbie other that the safety on
the saints. He prayed to the devil.

1342
01:20:39,231 --> 01:20:43,010
That's what happened in the devil.
Misled to tackle air,

1343
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:44,950
to tackle his own fucking teammate.
Uh,

1344
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,240
I know you're a comedian and not
some fucking political spot it,

1345
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:51,320
so it's not like I'm trying to hold
you up to some Barbara Walters type of

1346
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:51,771
standard,

1347
01:20:51,771 --> 01:20:55,130
but I know some people in your audience
forget that and believe everything they

1348
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:59,210
read and everything they hear that
feeds into what they already believe.

1349
01:20:59,211 --> 01:21:01,850
Like you said, I am
bright.com. Yeah, well dude,

1350
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:06,020
nobody's coming to this fucking
website to become informed. Okay. Um,

1351
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,960
don't put that on me. Okay.
I did not pursue that,

1352
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,120
which is why I became a comedian.
All right.

1353
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:17,900
I tried to Siri, the serious world.
It didn't fucking work out for me.

1354
01:21:17,901 --> 01:21:21,170
I failed miserably. Okay. Failed my wife.

1355
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,560
All right,
dear Billy buddy guy.

1356
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:26,810
My wife and I had been
married for a year and a half.

1357
01:21:26,811 --> 01:21:31,811
We both have a child from prior
relationships and a seventh month old Jada

1358
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:34,700
together. She's an angel by
the way. Of course she is.

1359
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:39,410
She is Latina and I only bring that
up because she fits all the fiery

1360
01:21:39,411 --> 01:21:42,980
stereotypes. Both good and bad.
She completes my life with this.

1361
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,770
Although arguments can get very difficult.

1362
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,050
Dude, I thought you were talking
about your seven month old.

1363
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,380
That's fucking hilarious. She went
right into that. I thought you're good.

1364
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,890
You already have an arguments with
a seven month old and she's fiery,

1365
01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:59,310
blah blah blah.

1366
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:05,740
Fucking talking. Jibberish
okay. Your wife. Okay.

1367
01:22:05,741 --> 01:22:08,890
She's Latina and I only bring that up
because she fits all these stereotypes.

1368
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:10,630
She completes my life.
I Blah Blah Blah.

1369
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:15,930
I have some of the same temper issues
that you use to describe yourself and your

1370
01:22:16,121 --> 01:22:21,070
bit about kneeling on the ball when
I'm right has paid off huge. Uh,

1371
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,270
so thank you for that.
Yeah.

1372
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,150
I wish I should probably rewatch that
bit cause I have not been doing that

1373
01:22:25,151 --> 01:22:29,410
lately. I've been airing it
out. Anyway to cut to the chase,

1374
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:33,970
we decided together to fight
for primary custody of my son.

1375
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:37,870
The case is very complicated,
but for the sake of everyone listening,

1376
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:40,480
I'll summarize it with his
few details as possible.

1377
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:43,300
In family court before
appearing in front of a judge,

1378
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:48,330
there is a conference where a meteor
mediator tries everything they can to make

1379
01:22:48,371 --> 01:22:51,520
sure you can come to an agreement
and avoid a judge. Deciding,

1380
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:56,940
my wife and I had a plan going in to not
cut a deal with my ex at the conference

1381
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,870
and hold out for a judge to
rule on custody. However,

1382
01:23:01,871 --> 01:23:06,190
I had no idea the level of pressure that
they'd be able to put me and I buckled

1383
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:09,070
under it and made a
deal for the next year.

1384
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,030
Then I had to go home and explain to
my wife that I had failed our plan.

1385
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,760
I don't know if you've ever
completely disappointed your woman,

1386
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,640
but this is the worst feeling in
the world. Well, wait a minute.

1387
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:23,410
She's going to judge you because they
probably used your love of your own kid

1388
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:27,510
right against you.
Anyways,

1389
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,660
and as you can imagine over the past
day or so, she's cutting me into me.

1390
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,520
It just about every opportunity for all
the little failures and I can see it

1391
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:41,470
right in and arise that are man had a
moment of weakness and didn't come through

1392
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:42,220
in the clutch.

1393
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:47,220
Worse is that she absolutely hates my ex
and feels like I let her get the better

1394
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:52,180
of me. US. Yeah. You know,
I kinda had a feeling. Yeah.

1395
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,830
Okay. All right. Oh Geez.
You're in the middle of that.

1396
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,180
You're in the middle of the two ladies.

1397
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:01,250
You have ever disappointed you're
a woman with a grand fuck up. Yeah.

1398
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,440
About every three days.

1399
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,880
I guess a good boxing analogy is that
my hands are down and I don't know how

1400
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:10,780
long to let her continue jabbing at
me until I put them back up. Thanks.

1401
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:15,070
And Go fuck yourself. Uh, I wouldn't
take another ounce of shit from her.

1402
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:19,410
I, you, you just sit down and talk
to her and be like, wait a minute.

1403
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,250
I'm trying to get my kid back. I'm going
back with all of this emotion. Wait,

1404
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:24,240
let me make sure this is

1405
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:26,370
okay.

1406
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:30,600
You decided together to get
primary custody of your son.
Now who's idea was that?

1407
01:24:30,601 --> 01:24:35,601
Was that totally yours or was the hatred
your wife has of your ex wife played

1408
01:24:36,691 --> 01:24:39,060
into the thing?
Um,

1409
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:44,170
I don't know, Dude. I
don't know what's going on,

1410
01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:48,840
but it sounds when it went into my head.
Okay,

1411
01:24:48,841 --> 01:24:49,740
now no notice.

1412
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:53,970
No that everything that you say is now
perverted cause it went into my brain.

1413
01:24:53,971 --> 01:24:56,760
As I say, once you say something,
it's not what you said anymore.

1414
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:59,190
It's cut with the other
person's experiences.

1415
01:24:59,191 --> 01:25:02,310
It's like drugs that have been stepped on.
What you said was pure cocaine.

1416
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:06,900
Now it's in my head and there's all
this x selects, fucking laxatives,

1417
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:11,860
getting fucking put it. Um, all
I hear is that your wife, uh,

1418
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:18,380
your current wife presents your
previous fucking wife and uh,

1419
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,530
she's doing that woman thing where they
don't solve things with their fists.

1420
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,930
They tried to fucking make,
they just

1421
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:24,590
okay.

1422
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:27,080
Do that thing where they tried to make
the other woman as miserable as they

1423
01:25:27,081 --> 01:25:30,620
possibly can and she knows
probably how much it would break.

1424
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:31,440
Okay.

1425
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,190
Your ex, why it's hard to lose
a primary custody of your son.

1426
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:38,640
And she really wanted to do that to her
because that would make her feel better

1427
01:25:38,641 --> 01:25:41,550
and more secure in your relationship. I
don't fucking know. I have no idea too.

1428
01:25:41,551 --> 01:25:44,180
There's too many fucking variables here.
But um,

1429
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:49,170
I wouldn't take an ounce of shit if I had
a son from a previous marriage and you

1430
01:25:49,171 --> 01:25:49,291
know,

1431
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:52,140
I was trying to do what you were doing
and then I caved under that pressure.

1432
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:56,490
My wife won't understand it and if she
ever gave me shit, I would be stunned.

1433
01:25:56,491 --> 01:26:01,170
And then I would fucking read her the
riot act and I would go out to a bar and

1434
01:26:01,171 --> 01:26:03,980
have a couple of cold ones there.
That's what I would do. Okay.

1435
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,320
Now I get into a lot of
arguments in my relationships.

1436
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:10,700
We probably don't want to listen to me.
I have no professional background. Okay?

1437
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:14,180
I'm the type of man that once
that already types out, dude,

1438
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:18,500
I called it with 25 seconds left
in fucking jinx is the saints.

1439
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:21,350
Maybe it was my fault. Um, all right.

1440
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,030
I don't know what the fuck that was,
