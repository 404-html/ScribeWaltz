1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,560
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:06,561
It's bill burr and it's a very
special Monday morning podcast that a,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,110
we're actually recording on a
Friday and you'd probably be like,

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:13,470
why you're doing something so special
bill, because it's the holiday season.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,340
You know,
I love you guys and a lot of you,

6
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:20,490
a real country to me on, on, uh,

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,960
didn't realize I was flying back from
my big whirlwind tour of shaking my ass

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,390
over there in Europe.
So on,

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,000
I mentioned in the podcast I was going
to have one of my best friends here.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,420
Favorite people in the God damn business
has a huge comedy movie that actually

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,220
transcends the genre.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,690
It's better than any Meryl
Streep drama from an Anchorman.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,950
Two please welcome the one
and only Dave Kepner everyone

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,300
or a sounding boom bill burr.
What's going on man? Can kind,

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,050
yeah. Uh, how am I? I'm psyched. I
haven't seen them more. There you go.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,290
That'll bounce around then your heads
for a second. Folks. You got it.

17
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,350
You got it out of the way.
I'm here with bill burr.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,410
I cannot tell you how happy I
am. Folks. I know you envy me.

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,150
I envy me. No, they don't.
My podcast listeners, once
they heard me read out loud,

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,030
all the magic of anything
that I was doing went away.

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,680
What do you mean read out loud? When I do,
when I do the, uh, oh, the acidosis. Yeah.

22
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,230
When I'm ready to make funny you,
there's nothing.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,920
I think they actually feel bad for me.
I'm, it's terrible. That's not true.

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,790
This is what happened. I sucked at
reading out loud and school and that.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,570
So like now I'm reading out loud again
in the same thing happens where you're

26
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:36,510
just trying to get to the end of it.
So you start going faster and faster.

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,630
Like the amount of times that I
mispronounced my own name, your own name.

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,600
When I get to bill [inaudible] dot com.
What do you say? Like bill burr. Oh yeah,

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,920
it's embarrassing. I just start doing
it now. Like it's a golf thing. Okay.

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,060
And you know, I just realized how fucking
hot it's going to get in this goddamn.

31
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,700
So these were all things,

32
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:58,650
comedy podcast studios here for
the very first day interview.

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,210
And, uh, so we're, we're, we're working
out a lot of bugs. We've got, sorry,

34
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,720
we've got some echo.
I couldn't be happier.

35
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,620
Here's what we got and that
brought us some almonds. Yeah.

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,620
Because I'm going to enjoy an Alma. No,
they brought over a key here that ms,

37
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,290
she bought a beer. Okay. For
Bill and you also Brian Talents.

38
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,690
Let's make sure we get this out just
in case somebody lives under the rock.

39
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,480
Anchorman two,
the legend of Ron Burgundy.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,310
It continues after fans for 10 years.
We're asking when is it continuing?

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,060
It's continuing right now when we,
it, it was supposed to open today,

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,000
but if they opened it Wednesday,
two days early. Oh okay. Yup.

43
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,270
That's why we scheduled this cause this
was going to be the exclusive opening

44
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,620
date podcast. Right. But only
with a great bill. Burb so they,

45
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:41,970
the paramount did the
switch. It's okay. Didn't,

46
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:44,250
they didn't clear it with Billy to dirt.
It's a dirty business,

47
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,180
dirty business fairly.

48
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,270
So they knew what was going to happen over
here and are unheated echoing studios.

49
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,250
They didn't want to be with you. So, um,

50
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,330
what I want to take your dose. So
I, last time I ran into you. Yeah,

51
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,990
I was over, over in Dublin and I
sent, I send you a picture, right,

52
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,520
for the listeners here. I'm, I'm in
Dublin sleepy, and I see a nice go by,

53
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,460
back us up a little bit, rot me all you
will back us up a little fucking cock.

54
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,670
So I'm thinking, you know, I get
a few tickets to the premiere.

55
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:17,350
It's in New York City, uh,
not in Los Angeles, which is
typical. And I'm thinking,

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,160
uh, bill was able to drop by the set
when he came through Atlanta when we were

57
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,080
shooting.
And uh,

58
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,040
you're so amazing and magnanimous and
everybody in the cast like outdoors.

59
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,890
We don't do this to that podcast.
Too Bad you're going to take it.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,230
You're not going to give me shit.
I'm not going to be shot.

61
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,410
I'll fucking hype another
comedy. You'd do it. So anyway,

62
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,390
I still know what I thought.
I saw it coming out.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,570
Bill has to be whatever the fuck it is.
Bill burr has to be here.

64
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,750
So I invited bill and
his wife and he goes, ah,

65
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,260
I have a show in Iceland that night,
which was last Sunday,

66
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,170
the 15th. So that's all I know was like,
Oh bill, it will be out of country.

67
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,230
Uh, I didn't, I'm not,
not unlike you guys.

68
00:03:56,231 --> 00:04:00,850
I don't regularly check bills
blog. So I didn't know. Anyway,

69
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,270
I'm in London, so I put all my dates
on my blog write, I don't write,

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,860
I'm in London,

71
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,870
we're getting ready to do the premiere
and I get this text message from Bill

72
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,310
Blur. Yeah. Blow bar is I say [inaudible].
Yeah, it was coming from the uh,

73
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:19,180
the airport and I saw a bus go by and
it said at 10 we'll and all you guys on

74
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:22,250
the side of it and uh, it's,
you know, anchorman two,

75
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:23,520
the legend Romberg and continues.

76
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:26,770
So I took the picture and I
sent it to Dave going, hey man,

77
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:29,290
the hype in the cause they were
billboards where everywhere.

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,840
I was like the hype and the Shit out
of movie over here and the tablet like

79
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,680
Dublin, you're in Dublin?
Yeah, I'm in Dublin, Dublin.

80
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:43,660
That and I are London. I was in Dublin,
holy, shy, just fucking perfect.

81
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,360
And I, and I ended up doing,
and he goes, what? We got the,

82
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,710
we got to premiere tonight.
What time's your show? Em,

83
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:52,180
we can go out and drink a couple of
fucking Loggins put it. How crazy is that?

84
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,610
You can't make the premiere because
you're going somewhere else.

85
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,690
You're in Dublin the same night where
they're doing the premiere and you can't

86
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:02,830
do it because you're doing your
world tour of northern Europe,

87
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:05,050
but we'll call it all towards
sounds great. It's amazing.

88
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,460
I'll get to the rest of the world is so we
get was. So, uh, we do our little thing.

89
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,260
Dance Bill does his song and dance.
What the what theater, where were you?

90
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,341
I was at that,

91
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:19,810
the Vic Vicar Street theater
and I absolutely like so
much of my childhood now

92
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:22,770
make sense after that crowd?
I can't explain it man.

93
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,230
Just grown up outside of Boston.
And uh,

94
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,730
I think I told you those stories at night.

95
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:31,630
I mentioned them last Monday
on the podcasts. All kind
of, just to paraphrase him,

96
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,650
just not to bore the listeners, but like
I've been doing this bit about, you know,

97
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,180
hugging your children, saying, you
know, if your hug them too much,

98
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,330
they're pussies if you don't
do enough to become psycho.

99
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,700
So I always always weaving and go,
you know,

100
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,720
my mother didn't hug me that much when
I was a kid and no one has ever reacted

101
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:47,910
to that. And I'm like, literally like
15 20% of the Irish crowd just goes, aw,

102
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,370
breaking my balls. Like fuck you,
you need a hug you pussy now. It was,

103
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,480
but it was hilarious.

104
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,600
And then at the end I'm talking about how
I'm giving out a free DVD to everybody

105
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,880
who showed up to hopefully, you know, by
the carpet bomb my special over there.

106
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,930
Smart. Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:03,050
Well I guess I should've just put it on
Spotify according to this internet chick,

108
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,340
but a personal to have it.
Yeah. So as I'm telling them,

109
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,360
I'm giving you a free DVD that they're
listening and just some guy in the back

110
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:15,710
just goes out. Fuck off.
What hilarious. Wow.

111
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,650
Anything Nice. It was and
it was, it was no, but they,

112
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,060
they're doing it in a f yeah, breaking
your balls. And I told them, I said,

113
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,760
you guys have performed from a lot of
and miserable people be you guys are the

114
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,610
most miserable cons. And I didn't
even get to the end of the sentence.

115
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,760
They were already dying laughing.
Awesome. They were just like, uh,

116
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,600
I can't explain it man. Like I just felt
like these like I get it. I get like,

117
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,280
why I can't take a compliment.

118
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,080
Don't like fucking Nice Shit. If
somebody breaks my balls, I literally,

119
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:46,400
it will run through a wall for,

120
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,790
I'm like the second they look at you when
you think you lose your fucking shirt.

121
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,240
I'm immediately like, my heart fills
up like the fucking grand love.

122
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,690
But if you actually sit
there and pay you call,

123
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,400
you were trying to do at the beginning
of the podcast. No, I'll smash it.

124
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,830
Elastic chair over here. Like,
all right, that won't do,

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,040
I won't do that till you're a big
guy. When the guy from Missouri, yeah,

126
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,420
but bill burn, I got to
share a few pints, uh,

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,620
in some seller,

128
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,460
a bar of wherever we were staying in
Dublin with where the nice joints I guess

129
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,920
singing Christmas songs. Yeah. So
Your Cra and loud heal itself. Yeah.

130
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,850
Um, here's my favorite part of Dublin.
For me. We did this promotional thing,

131
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,720
maybe of the folks have seen any promo,
but we did all kinds of different ones.

132
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,160
And then this particular one,
there were some winners of some thing.

133
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,290
There were three groups of 20 and they
had gone on a pub crawl and at the end of

134
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,620
the pub crawl was a surprise. And it
was the four of us. It was, we'll Steve,

135
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:43,280
Paul and myself. No Way. When
this bar in Dublin called, uh,

136
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:47,590
I think it's to lease or Tony's Tunies,
it's one of the old bars. And uh,

137
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,440
so we're down there and we get a pint
of Guinness and we're like, ah, boy,

138
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:54,770
this is so needed right now.
This is perfect.

139
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,480
We just traveled from New York that
day. Ended up a bunch of press. Did the,

140
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,910
uh, we, no, this is before the premiere.

141
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,250
We're getting ready to go
to do a premiere and uh,

142
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:08,780
the owner of the place comes up to me
and he grabs me by the shoulders straight

143
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:12,260
on, right, right. Two on
either side. And he goes, uh,

144
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,410
you look like you enjoy a pint.
Tell me lad.

145
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,870
Oh yeah, Irish. I said, well actually,
yeah, my mom's side. He goes, I knew it.

146
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,910
And to me that's where the greatest things
that ever happened in my life because

147
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,310
he's like, you know, this is the best
pint of Guinness in all of Ireland. Right?

148
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,190
It's voted the best paint in
Dublin and knew what that means.

149
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,320
Was there a better pilot than Dublin? And
I was like, wow, I just went to heaven.

150
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,900
I know it's its way to these these people.
Then.

151
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,440
Then they'd bring them in in
groups of 20, we'd say, hi, hi. Hi.

152
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:45,980
They all had to gather round is take
one cup of white now they must freak the

153
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,410
fuck out there.
Let go.

154
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,100
They're all bombed now because they've
been on a pro pub crawl for you guys had

155
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,310
that wasn't so bad because the security
guys over there were amazing on the

156
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:57,600
international tour. They were like, okay,

157
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:01,380
here's what you're doing and take a
picture of boob. No more pictures. Boom.

158
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:05,310
You can't do selfies. You
can't do anything else. Get
out next group. But it was,

159
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,173
it was amazing.

160
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,180
So we did I think three pints
and a shot of a of Jamison.

161
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,100
This is making me wish I
was back there and yeah.

162
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,250
And then we went to the premiere and
this crowd was a mob in the greatest way.

163
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,000
It's the greatest energy I've ever felt.
And I asked will and those guys,

164
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,940
have you ever been through a gauntlet
like that? And they're like, no.

165
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,840
That was the most intense thing we've
ever been through. It was just love. Yeah.

166
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:34,650
They give it up over there. Yeah, I would.
You got to go to Scotland. Great. Yeah,

167
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,760
that whole area, man. Great. Great
Britain. Dare, dare, like, uh,

168
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,200
you know what's funny
as I've mentioned this,

169
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,800
like they're all going to get mad if I
actually say that people in London were

170
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,940
call half the people in England
are probably giving me shit,

171
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:49,140
but they're deaf and they're like the w
like each one of them has their own vibe,

172
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,160
the way they're coming at you.

173
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,350
And all of them kind of reminded me of
people that I like grew up with. Man.

174
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,910
Such a great, like if you're going
to Europe for the first time,

175
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,530
like that's such a great place to
start before you get oh yeah. You know,

176
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,860
cause Ireland, you know,
some people are like,

177
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:05,720
I don't want to not know the language
and shit. So that's a good way to,

178
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,570
to break yourself had before then you
start at zero and all these other great

179
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:13,160
places. Um, I was gonna ask
you, so like when, you know,

180
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,260
I've done like the standup tours and that
type of stuff and I'd done like radio

181
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,770
tours and shit. Like what is,
um, I mean, it sounds awesome.

182
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:23,260
You get to go to all these places, but I
know they like stick you in a room and,

183
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:27,690
and you just kind of go. First of all,
the hotels they put us in were amazing.

184
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,560
So and on this international thing, you
don't even touch her bag. All that stuff.

185
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,690
They pull the roll you up,
they put you each in an individual car,

186
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:40,140
which going back to what you know,
the way you feel is like, no, no,

187
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:43,190
we'll all write together. Yeah, you
don't need to put me in one like,

188
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,340
well there's a row row six cars with
one person in it. It's like, come on.

189
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:52,290
I'd rather write with my buddies. I
know. So the eagles, I heard the eagles.

190
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,970
So we do that.
They pick you up right outside the plane.

191
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,160
Like we don't even go to the
regular deportation thing
or not deportation, sorry,

192
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,850
immigration thing. They pick us up outside
the plane. They put us in these cars,

193
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:10,530
they take us a special little room.
They tenure retinas ideally right there.

194
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,080
They get your passports and you
wait in there. You have a ta.

195
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:16,740
If you want one or whatever,
then you're like on your way,

196
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,650
you don't even touch your bags,
you just go to the hotel. Oh fuck.

197
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:23,010
Did these movie stars Bitch about doing
these press junkets? Like that difficult.

198
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,470
That sounds fucking phenomenal.
Then they're too jaded and they,

199
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,410
they need to be brought down a peg and
they need to go out on tour and doing

200
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,530
standup at that little drink
isn't fizzy enough. Wow. That's,

201
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:33,300
I don't know how people get to that point.

202
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,020
I don't know how people get to the
point of bitching about convenience.

203
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,650
So that was amazing. We go through
all that stuff and then, you know,

204
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:45,570
then you go get a, have a pint,
a place like that. It was,

205
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,170
it was great, but it was like that
all over. It was, you know, uh, uh,

206
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,860
Australia we did and then we did a Dublin,
we did Sydney,

207
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,310
Dublin in London first class all the way
and yeah. So you had to sit in one room.

208
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,750
Oh wait, you went, you went to Sydney
first and then, then you came back to la,

209
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,020
back to la for Thanksgiving,
then New York.

210
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,890
I did Bristol did Sydney
Sydney's Greater Sydney is great.

211
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,930
You get a chance to look at
the beaches and stuff. I know.

212
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,950
Well I did climb some bridge. They have
your climb, which I didn't get to do that,

213
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,100
you know that is, yeah. Yeah,
but pretty amazing. So then,

214
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:21,400
but they take care of you all the
way. I mean, I feel so bad about it.

215
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,400
Like I need this suit
pressed is said okay.

216
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,410
If the pays for the suit because he's
been the suitcase and so want you far of a

217
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,450
deck, right. You've got to be
an asshole. Got It. You got it.

218
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:37,020
You got to add what is this into
your repertoire, right. So then, uh,

219
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,930
those first class all the way, it was
amazing. It's fucking awesome man.

220
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,100
But anyway, Billy couldn't come to the
premiere cause he's in Reykjavik, Iceland,

221
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:48,880
correct? That night. The
15th last Sunday. Yeah.

222
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,640
Crushing it and, or eating shit.
I'm not sure which way it went now.

223
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:55,300
I went good to the
understand you're back now.

224
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:59,050
Thank God they got bill burst humor. They
went great. I love that it's sold out.

225
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
I don't know, listeners sold out,
there was enough people that is,

226
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,870
that listened to, you don't know
half. Oh, I can't lie. I mean I think,

227
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,930
I think we did pretty good. I'm definitely
going, definitely going to go back. But,

228
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,930
uh, um, um,

229
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,950
I've been such a huge fan of
yours for as far as like the,

230
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:20,380
that full on cactus site and I did a
number of times and one of my favorite

231
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,900
characters is the,
as of Roy Roy,

232
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,030
you know what I love about it is it's
such a specific guy. Like we're not,

233
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:32,640
when I do like a gay guy, I do the
hackey one that offends them, you know,

234
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,980
like Jesus Christ. Guys,
can we all just be frowned,

235
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,860
which everybody has done.
Uh,

236
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,380
but on yours it's like the dude has like,
he has an eating addiction,

237
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:48,790
that one where he's, he's
cheesecake and one ever. Ah,

238
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,830
so Roy is at 350 pound gay man
who has a boyfriend's name is Roy.

239
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,870
He has two cats named Siegfried and Roy.

240
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,920
So it's really confusing and I'm
not sure which one's the most,

241
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,930
the biggest tomcat in the house.
It's my broil Dakar off. Okay guys.

242
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,550
He's passive aggressive. He's
aggressive, aggressive. He's made,

243
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,780
he's meaning please a suite because he's
hurt cause he wants to be loved and he

244
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:15,730
isn't in excel.
He lashes out.

245
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:19,450
He doesn't mean that it's such a fucking
like as opposed to my horse shit,

246
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:20,320
one dimensional things.

247
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,740
This is a fully fleshed out thing
like me and my wife needed neat.

248
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:27,130
We watched this and we'd
fucking laugh our asses off.

249
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,520
And then recently that terrains like that,

250
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,640
that crooked like bounty hunter one,
I actually came across that,

251
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:36,760
that I let creep along with like
the comb over. Oh Gerald. Yeah.

252
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,260
I'm not too familiar on him but that
was the another one completely. Uh,

253
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,580
he's a hillbilly cause he's,
he's a drifter,

254
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,790
a drifter and his best friends
or Hobos and I mean real hobos.

255
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,450
The guys that ride the trains has
named Gerald [inaudible]. Hey,

256
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:53,450
what's going on Bill Burr? It's
cold in here. What does that,

257
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,960
how do you, how do you cut it?
You come up with that shit.

258
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,460
That guy's kind of based on this.

259
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,810
This roofer drifter they came through in
my small town when I was 15 working at

260
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:05,960
my uncle's gas station,
beer joint restaurant.

261
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,040
And this is when you'd still pumped
gas and this guy was or make somebody a

262
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,970
steak. Yeah, I would. I swear to God.
Here's what a typical day was. In fact,

263
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:16,610
they're usually take someone's order.
You go back,

264
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:20,870
you get their soda or someone else has to
get their beer. You start their burger.

265
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,370
Ding, Ding. And remember the old
days when you'd go to a gas station,

266
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:24,960
ran over there,

267
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,970
there'd be an air hose that that red
that rang a bell inside the main summit.

268
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:33,710
Go pump gas. Dang. Dang. So Burger, you
don't flip it yet. You go out, pump gas,

269
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,740
get their money,
go give them their change.

270
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,780
And this is when gas was under a dollar.

271
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,230
This is 1977 under a dollar.

272
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,150
So go back end.

273
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,380
And then I dip my hands into the dish
soap that's in the sink. That's it.

274
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:52,250
There wasn't even a dishwasher dip 'em
in you rent some a little bit and then

275
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,084
turn that Burger,

276
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,680
throw some cheese on it and go
serve the God damn thing as it has.

277
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,660
His tank is filling up. Yeah. Dang. Dang.

278
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,160
He's inside his car with the windows
up smoking with the baby in the back.

279
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:08,460
He doesn't know. Yeah. That's actually
something, I bet if you brought that back,

280
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,860
do you think as far as
like a business model,

281
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,690
if you brought back an old school gas
station where it was service with service,

282
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,280
it's a full service thing and you
could actually get a burger. Um,

283
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,740
would people be willing to do
it? I know hipsters would. Yeah.

284
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,090
And they would pull up and act like
they didn't notice that this isn't what

285
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:30,540
every gas station is like. Right. But
like just for somebody, cause like for me,

286
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,020
like I was basically came of age in
the eighties but it was a kid in the

287
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:37,230
seventies so I,
I'm trying to think the lowest side.

288
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:41,700
I think I remember 89 cents a gallon.
Wow. Lotus. I remember something like, uh,

289
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,550
like the mid seventies or something, but,
uh, I, I've always wondered like if I,

290
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,460
that's, maybe that's just something
because I grew up back then. I'm like,

291
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,410
I would love if you could bring back the
shit that I remember that when you go

292
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:56,450
to New Jersey and you've got to wait for,
when you go to New Jersey,

293
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,930
you got to wait for somebody to pump.
Your gas is kind of a pain in the ass now.

294
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:02,610
Right now. I actually love
that. You do. I love it.

295
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,460
I love not getting out of the fucking
car and I'll pay the extra whatever a

296
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:06,620
gallon puts you,
let love it.

297
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:09,720
People and their eyes are bloodshot
because they're huffing fumes all day long

298
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:12,480
and you're like, Jesus, it's like
a peel. The toll booth workers.

299
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:15,510
I worry about them. Why aren't
you wearing a, an oxygen mask?

300
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,150
What was it like when you, you're a
Missouri Guy, right? Yeah. Growing up, um,

301
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,220
out there. What you athlete
football gloves. They'll look at me.

302
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,300
What we have bullying? Nothing.
No, no. I like six to 600 million,

303
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:31,410
but I grew up in Atlanta. You put
our bus driver and a full Nelson on.

304
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,100
You don't remember that. Well then tiptoe
while tipping over a fucking couch.

305
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,780
I know you're in rare form.

306
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:41,670
Well I had a few pints and I watched
Bill Bernie turned into the hulk.

307
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:45,180
Happy Pretty. She could put and
then Paul Rudd, but for the record,

308
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:46,920
for the record and drug me out of this.
Right.

309
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,370
And then rod put you in a full Nelson.
But by the way, if everybody listening,

310
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:53,310
it was all, it was all fucking around.
Yeah, it was fucking round. Yeah.

311
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,240
But then I apologize to bill via text
the next day and bill said that couch had

312
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,030
it in.
I was like,

313
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,670
cause I was shit phase two and
you kept tipping it over and pee.

314
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,920
We kept picking it up and every time I
look back you had tipped it over again.

315
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,030
What an idiot. No, you're
not. You're hilarious. You're
not tipping over furniture.

316
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,500
You're singing Christmas songs.
You're a a few self.

317
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,040
Oh Merry Little Christmas.
That's all we need to know.

318
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,160
We didn't know the end and have yourself
a merry little Christmas day that we

319
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,550
send it that we sent. What do we
say? I think we're saying gay. Okay.

320
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,690
We're acting like we couldn't remember it.

321
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,380
So we'd throw a different word and
every time I'm speaking to that,

322
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:38,710
did you see a,
well,

323
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,830
I shouldn't bring that up cause
everything's all controversial.

324
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,290
Or was it just said Duck Dynasty guy?

325
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,800
You know how long was it before anyway,

326
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:49,020
there's going to figure it those guys out.
You give that guy enough.

327
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,290
You know what? I don't understand.
I'm going to talk about some state,

328
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,130
so I don't want to run in the Bin,

329
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:57,420
but just the fact that they keep coming
after these guys who keep quoting that

330
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:01,800
book, why don't you go up to the book?
What's the book? The Bible. Oh boy.

331
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,060
You know why that pockets at too
deep. Yeah. So they go after Sunday.

332
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,690
Got just some guy shooting
pigeons on a boat. Yeah.

333
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,450
Well that shit was pumped
into his head when he,

334
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,760
before he grew his first whisker. Yeah.
You become like dementia. Every candidate.

335
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,310
Well has he made, is he recanted his
statement yet? Does he come out and said,

336
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,920
this is mia culpa and go on.
Sorry. It was my fault. Uh, uh,

337
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,870
he'll, he'll, he'll go
to some, there's just,

338
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,390
I don't think it helps homophobia
to make a guy loses his job.

339
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,480
And I think you have to come at somebody
in a more understanding way as opposed

340
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:43,050
to just like, uh, I don't know
how far you go on your podcast,

341
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,320
but I filmed him getting
a Bj from a super queen.

342
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,280
Okay. That's when he hit it.
He hit her with his beard.

343
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,150
So now he's trying to save face.
I don't know what's going on.

344
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:59,540
Why would I drag him into that? You're
here. Why not? I don't, I don't,

345
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,740
I shouldn't matter to me. I'm here to talk
to Bill Berg. What do I care about? Um,

346
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,880
but I don't care about that guy.
Whatever. Uh, you know what?

347
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:09,660
You learned your lesson. Hey, time to
evolve. I think that's the lesson here.

348
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,370
Like the Fox report is going to Santa
Claus is white. My thing. How can I say?

349
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,450
You know, there's Fox News shows said
Santa Claus is white. Isn't he fun?

350
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,190
The Netherlands what? And
Jesus is white too. Yeah.

351
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,900
Then he, he ever
happened? Yeah. I mean, I,

352
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,100
I honestly selling clothes at
react guy ever happened. Which one?

353
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,500
Santa Claus or Jesus. Oh,
Jesus. Santa Claus is real.

354
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,810
He's in your heart is in your
heart and your heart. Look,

355
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:38,010
I don't give a shit what color he is.
It comes down my chimney. He comes down,

356
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,890
he still does. Gives me a couple
of Cuban cigars, you know?

357
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,730
Is that what your thing is?
Cubans. Yeah. I Dunno. Listeners,

358
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:48,940
I allegedly might've brought some entity.

359
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,960
I enter the country in your luggage.
Are you uh, that's not a cigar smoker.

360
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:56,480
I can't do anymore. I used to
be carry a pitching. I, uh,

361
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,030
when I got to be about 45,

362
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,730
I'd always have a cigar at the end of
the night if I'm out with my buddies

363
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,470
drinking. And um, which was every
night. But, uh, when I was about 45,

364
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,270
uh, I had one deal, the nightmares, I
was like, oh yeah, they can get you.

365
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,950
If you get a strong one
and get half of that in.

366
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,100
I've done that and all send you start
puking like you play in a Frat can't do it

367
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:18,970
anymore. Yeah. Which is good. It's a
good thing. Not as a good time anymore.

368
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,380
I do it well. What I liked about
it was when you smoke a cigar,

369
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,220
this is feeling that of accomplishment
and whether you did anything or not.

370
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,210
So if you had a bad day, it's a
great choice. You know? I mean it's,

371
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:35,530
sure the health side effects is bad, but
it, it's, it's a wonderful thing to do.

372
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:36,700
You don't have to
inhaler, which, you know,

373
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:39,750
you just get mouth cancer and that lung
cancer I guess. Oh is that right? Yeah.

374
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,910
So what happens? You're not inhaling,
how do you get mouth cancer,

375
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:46,150
but just it's just, it's damaging
to the cells. I'm guessing.

376
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:49,900
I don't know what it is, but it has
less, probably less carcinogens than,

377
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:53,140
than cigarettes. Cause they fill all that
stuff with ammonia and everything else.

378
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,270
Well, can somebody figure out like how
many, you can have a month, cigarettes,

379
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:00,790
cigars, not die. Can
they hit you up on your,

380
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,130
on your website and let you know somebody,

381
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,200
there's a doctor out there that listens
to you, who will give you advice.

382
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,250
So any oncologists out there, I want to
give builders when you buy them overseas,

383
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:11,380
like they don't fuck around. I
go over here, it says, you know,

384
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,070
as surgeon general warning or did
they have, they go smoking causes, um,

385
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,100
mouth cancer and they show a picture
of a guys cancerous mouth time.

386
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,870
I was in,
uh,

387
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,040
recently I was in Toronto and I was buying
some cigars and I was at the airport

388
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,330
with a, I forget her, the one,
another comic I was looking
at, he was like, Jesus,

389
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,150
like the first time you saw, I'm kind of
immune to it because you've seen enough.

390
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,680
But I, at the first time I
saw it I was like, oh my God.

391
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,830
So I go through periods
where I've cigar smoking.

392
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,630
Obviously when I come back from overseas,
like I'm going to do some damage. Okay,

393
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:47,350
next. My you want as your wife feel
about it. Uh, she's cool as hell.

394
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,320
Dod Jordy, talk about your,
your marriage and, and, uh, uh,

395
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,430
what had happened and how it happened
because I don't know this now.

396
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:57,660
I didn't really, I didn't bring it up
because, so what's the best service? No,

397
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,360
I didn't do it. Yeah. Cause
I wanted to just, uh, people,

398
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,260
people know the name of my dog. They
know, you know, my girlfriend at the time,

399
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,990
they just knew a lot and I
was just kind of, it was a,

400
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:09,910
I just hit like they're not told
them that you're married now.

401
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,540
I mean when you go to my show is,
I mean, I say I am, but I have,

402
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,270
I guess I haven't said it
on the podcast yet. Okay.

403
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:18,730
I wanted to have something that was kind
of like, you didn't have a big ceremony.

404
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,040
No. Okay. Because I would have been hurt.

405
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,090
We buy and we went out to a duck pond
and we had a couple of homophobic guys in

406
00:23:25,091 --> 00:23:27,190
boats.
Who Marius,

407
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,550
no big American flag headbands on.

408
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,070
Um, so anyway, if you had a reception,

409
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,440
what's the reception for your, for your
nuptials like a big party. A celebration.

410
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,680
Um,
just say no cause you invite me.

411
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,190
I think we had three. We had an engagement
party. I think we had an old farm.

412
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,630
Emmett, how are you doing dude? You're a
fucking movie star. You're flying around.

413
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:54,650
I didn't know you wanted to come to that.

414
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:57,950
Like I looked at it like I didn't know
you wanted to come to that or come on,

415
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,550
I'm in love of Bill Brown. She says,
here it is. I'm going to get shit.

416
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,030
You should get shit. Listen,
are you registered anywhere?

417
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,910
My registered anywhere you
register when you get married,

418
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:11,360
you were registered places for people
to buy you gifts with these questions.

419
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:15,710
Can you tell who handled everything?
Your wife? Yeah, I know I've done it.

420
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,710
Yeah, he went through it. It's good.

421
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,010
And as long as you give her a Christmas
card from us this year too. I've been,

422
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,640
I leave won't be good at one of the Bro.
I'm taking you off the list.

423
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,530
Just so you know. That's
all I'm saying. Well, this,

424
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,810
I think that's a little
challenge. Is it childish? Yeah.

425
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,550
You won't invite a guy to or something.
I felt like the staging point.

426
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,820
You met him,
you had this chip on your shoulder.

427
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,150
So why don't we not agree now
the way Aaron everything out.

428
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:41,720
Why don't you just get it off your
goddamn chest. The bag of almonds

429
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,560
and
smells.

430
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,650
Very nice. Um, sports affiliation.

431
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,270
Sports are big on this podcast.
They're gonna wanna know Kenzie g,

432
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:04,610
some commie Pinko kindly you watch city
chiefs tends to say cheese right here.

433
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,450
I think they're gonna make the super bowl.
How do you think he coached?

434
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,400
Looks in the new red versus read.
Doesn't look good. I me come on,

435
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:17,090
but don't matter. I think he's lost a few
weight. A few pounds. I think it's good.

436
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,930
I think he, I knew he could hide when he's
in Philly with that forest green. Yeah,

437
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,370
we can't hide. You can't, you
know, reading is not slumming.

438
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,210
All I know is the dude is winning.
He brought in 24 new coaches.

439
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,160
He's changed the organization.
They weren't,

440
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:34,810
they won two games last year and now
they've completely turned around. What?

441
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:39,620
We weren't nine. Oh, okay. Uh, were
the winning is captain, are you buying?

442
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,160
Are you selling? Oh, nice. That's
good. This, this comedian, uh,

443
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,090
for shall we were talking about that
stupid segment that they have on one of

444
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:50,300
those sports channels. He buy it,
he'll sell it. Kansas city chiefs,

445
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:53,390
the chiefs in the playoffs.
You sitting there with the plastic helmet,

446
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,690
two mugs of beer. You've already
beaten half of your children, right?

447
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,830
You're ready for game time.

448
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,770
W what do you think if you get home field?
Well,

449
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,080
who is stopping the chiefs?
Well,

450
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:09,810
Denver's done it twice so they can't
answer the third time. They can't yet.

451
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,800
And one of the only say on ESPN,
I'll tell you right now,

452
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,000
and it's really difficult to be a t three
types of one year. Not going to happen.

453
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,570
I like it. But who are we going to
wind up with patriots to the Paychex.

454
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:22,150
I want it done in the playoffs.
Tom Brady.

455
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,730
Tom Brady's haven't one of his best years
and people are sitting to going has he

456
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:28,870
fallen off? It's just like
everybody's been injured. I,

457
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:32,030
one of our best guys went to prison
and we didn't get anything for him.

458
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,140
When you got goes the president,
you don't, yeah, you don't
get draft picks. Okay.

459
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,320
And then,

460
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,320
and then our best guy at every level on
defense is as either been out or is out

461
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,580
for the season.
Our Best Linebacker,

462
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,480
I best down Lineman to week two of our
best down lineman and keep to leave like

463
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,980
the, our, our, our guy,

464
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:52,230
you just ignore him on that side
of the field when he's playing.

465
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,730
He said he just had a hip injury. Um,
it's been really a difficult year.

466
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,650
And then somehow if we
didn't lose last week,

467
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,700
we were actually in the driver's seat.

468
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,940
They have home field throughout the
playoffs. I mean him and bell check.

469
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:06,360
It's insane what they've
been doing this yet. But um,

470
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,550
you can, you can fool people.
And the regular season, I'm
not going to name names,

471
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,480
I'm not going to be a dick,

472
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:16,940
but there's a lot of people that
are absolute monsters, um, in,

473
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,740
in the regular season. And you get
to the playoffs, it's a different,

474
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,950
it's a different, everybody has a good
defense. Everybody has a good offense.

475
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,660
You might get away with it for a week,

476
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:28,050
but once you get into that second week
and forget about the third week, so,

477
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,130
you know, we've, you know, we beat some
teams that aren't the greatest teams,

478
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:34,890
padding our victories.
But I know when we go to the playoffs,

479
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,430
like I don't see us like
beaten the ravens. I mean,

480
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:41,300
I know Ray Lewis and those guys aren't
there anymore, but I just, they, oh,

481
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:44,700
they weren't with on there on the
foot. They want on their, on their, uh,

482
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,330
the kicker last week. Who did, uh,
the ravens. I did they, I mean, I've,

483
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:52,320
I've laughed. I missed the last
two weeks of a football. Oh,

484
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:55,490
you've been traveling around the
world. Wow. Remember that folks?

485
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,190
Bill's been around the world. He's
better than you. No, I haven't.

486
00:27:58,191 --> 00:28:01,820
I've just been better than you.
Hi, I'm Bill Berg. As what?

487
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,800
One thing you should know,

488
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:06,170
I'm better than you feel better than you
podcasts like that. No, I'm actually,

489
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:10,130
what I've been telling them last week
before you paint me with your broad brush

490
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:13,400
over there is that she
read, she's brush. I, yeah.

491
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,700
I say how bad I did in high school.
How much I fucked up in my life.

492
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:20,370
That if I can get to this,
you can do it too. There you
go. You're right. Yeah. Huh?

493
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,250
Have you, the fans heard your coaching
bit? Do you still do that one?

494
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,110
Which one is that? The,
uh, coaching you're talking
about? The Rutgers coach. Oh,

495
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:34,910
you know, that was a topical one, so
I had to kind of sound good. Yeah.

496
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:37,220
You know, a couple times I'm being on
stage and I'll remember, I'd be like,

497
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:41,320
that was really fun. So
good. So good. And you know,

498
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:45,620
do you don't do Schwartzenegger? No, I
put that out on the last special. Well,

499
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:48,170
I've had this run, you know, that thing.

500
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,070
I did a little bit of the
bit on on Conan and uh,

501
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,820
I ripped some of it that I
hadn't done. Um, which was the,

502
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,560
the disgrace channel and all that.

503
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,730
That was just something I
literally thought of that
night on the show and I was

504
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:04,550
like, ah, that would have had a lot
of legs. But once I do it on TV,

505
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:05,384
it's like I can't do it.

506
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,010
But the bit that I've been doing
it just interchanges with names.

507
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,370
At first it was Paula Dean and
then it became Riley Cooper.

508
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,230
You did the panel when that night
too and then it was somebody else.

509
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:17,180
And then yeah,

510
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:20,350
when I go on Conan and I always have some
sort of topical kind of thing that I,

511
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,600
I tried to do,
um,

512
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,630
I'm working my way up to have the
courage to tell a story on those things.

513
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:29,010
Cause um, you know, like I'm
not you, I'm just, yeah, I'm,

514
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,760
I'm getting my feet wet
as far as doing panel,

515
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:34,430
you guys are all experienced to him. I've
only done them a few times. So when you,

516
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:38,900
when you do a bit on national television,
you never do it in your act anymore.

517
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,990
That's it. No. Wow. Wow. Hmm. I
shouldn't say that. Like if I,

518
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:48,730
if I do a, like if I did stand up on where
it's, uh, you know, give us five minutes.

519
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,240
Okay.

520
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,560
And I do like a minute and a half
condensed version of an eight minute idea,

521
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,280
then yeah, I'll do it again.
Um, or if I touch on it,

522
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,060
if I'm doing panel and for, but I
don't go out on panel, like going,

523
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:02,130
I'm going to do bits.
Right.

524
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,430
It's more like I'm going to be having
a conversation and it's sort of a free

525
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:10,240
association. Right. And then
it's like, if it comes up great,

526
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,810
it goes well how about, how about the, uh,

527
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,560
hardworking mom's bit that you did on
Letterman? Did that go on? Especially,

528
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:20,290
I know, but like the Steve
Jobs thing, that was so good.

529
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,590
The Steve Jobs thing that
he did on native, too many
stores. We, yeah, that isn't,

530
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:28,030
but what I liked about
that was they, they, um,

531
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,820
they kept the whole piece of it. So
what I like about that is, you know,

532
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:36,640
I'm an old school music guy,
B sides and stuff.

533
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,240
That's a cool thing where it's
just like, oh, you can't get that.

534
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:43,150
You have to go on Youtube, got to go
find it and you got to go find it.

535
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,310
And if people just start finding out
my comedy, they see a special goal,

536
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,300
I want to see more of this guy. Like if
they'd just keep seeing different things.

537
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:54,660
What's gotten you the most attention
on Youtube? Philadelphia? Uh,

538
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,451
Phil was probably,

539
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:58,810
it was probably the first thing I
know I want to try to tell people.

540
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,970
Sherry's berries from a few weeks
ago was another one that got along.

541
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,210
When I tell people what they should
check out, bill burr on, on Youtube,

542
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:11,530
what should I say?
I say watch the thing in Philadelphia,

543
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,110
that's not his thing.
He doesn't take on the audience,

544
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,380
but it is so fucking beautiful that that
will give you the full essence of what

545
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:21,830
you have done as such.
Now.

546
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,370
You know how it got out of that and all
honesty was just knowing sports and,

547
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,680
and I lucked out where it was,
is this,

548
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,580
all those teams are there.
So I was just outside of Philly.

549
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:36,580
And you had teams from DC and
the Redskins hate the eagles.

550
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,440
You had people from Jersey and
the Redwings hate the flyers here.

551
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,930
People from New York and the Rangers.
But the next part, the plugin giants.

552
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,740
Was it 15 minutes? How much? How much
time did you have? It was 12 minutes.

553
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,810
12 how much longer? I'm during the fall.
12 yeah, I don't care. That was the best.

554
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,340
Well gale force winds of
ignorance blowing in your face.

555
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,440
Don't know how much more time. All
right, here we go. Look at you.

556
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:05,920
You're fat. Fuck. I hope you
have a fucking heart attack. Oh,

557
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,010
I don't know if I would
say it was of ignorance.

558
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,520
I would say it was more of a mirror that
the reason why I do well in front of

559
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:16,990
those drunk moron crowds is because
that's basically what I am, what I am.

560
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,480
That's who I hung around with.
Like,

561
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,970
and I don't mean like more and like
seriously as I should have done,

562
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,700
but you know those guys,
when you go to a sporting event,

563
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,400
being protective of your audience,
don't just the guys who are,

564
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,450
who are in your section and that Dick
Day are drunk and that kind of scaring

565
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,280
people,
but they're making this section laugh.

566
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,340
Those were the guys kind of
guys that I hung out with.

567
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:38,050
Those are the guys when I went
to sporting events, I like them.

568
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:40,130
So throughout the years,

569
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,780
like it just becomes a part of you and
then you do your act and then you attract

570
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:49,520
that. So when, when they're yelling at
me, I mean it just feels like, you know,

571
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,390
the Boston Garden when they would old
days when they would call offsides is some

572
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:56,060
bullshit penalty against the Bruins
and all of a sudden you feel like carry

573
00:32:56,061 --> 00:33:00,710
Frazier when you're down there. But
it's a familiar, more of a uh, uh,

574
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,300
a familiar sound. What do you have
club owners like you cause your,

575
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:09,440
your crowd drinks. Absolutely.
Mine does too. They go, oh,

576
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:12,050
you bring a drinking crowd. No
one. They love it. They like that.

577
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,670
And then you know what's
good too on the late show,

578
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,990
if you really want to hook
up, uh, the correct one to
kiss ass to the comedy club,

579
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,990
you tell the club owner and he said,
all right, if I go a little bit longer,

580
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:24,080
just put last call. And they love
it. They'll push it a little bit,

581
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:26,300
a little bit more. Yeah. You
get them that extra round.

582
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:28,690
He gets one extra round going
all the way around the room. Do,

583
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,540
do 15 minutes to do an hour
when you want it to show. Uh,

584
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,190
well at this fits theater is different
than a club and the club, do you have, uh,

585
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,690
if I, if I have an, uh, well I only got
one guy in front of me and theaters.

586
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,330
If I've got two guys in front of me,
I'll do like an hour.

587
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,390
If I only have one guy in front, me, I
do like an hour and 15. If I have to,

588
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,860
if I only have one show, I'll go
longer than that. So this, um,

589
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,430
this hour that I've,
I've written, you know,

590
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:59,540
I kind of was working on
a couple of standup skills
that I figured out how to do

591
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:02,600
them and then it wouldn't need to figured
out how to do something new. Yeah.

592
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,670
What Jack Lemmon, dude, come on man. You
got to keep getting better. I like it.

593
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,820
I liked that one. I liked I was Chang
what Jack Lemmon is my guy, Jack Lemmon,

594
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:15,400
19 boy he did,
he did the apartment and he,

595
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,480
I think he was nominated for an Oscar.
Okay.

596
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,530
And that was like in the early sixties
and in 19 early nineties when he did Glen

597
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,363
Gary,
Glen Ross,

598
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:27,490
Jack Lemmon in the early nineties blew
away Jack Lemmon and the in the early

599
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,190
sixties.

600
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,610
And there was that thing where despite
the fact that he was where he was at,

601
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,840
he kept going in and like I think what,
what uh,

602
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:40,790
you got to watch out if you create
for a living is when you do fill,

603
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:44,690
you finally fill up a place
and to get like, okay,

604
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,560
can this license not even, or you just
go, okay, this is my bag of tricks.

605
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,030
This is what they want me to do.

606
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,710
I don't want to divert from this
because I might lose this. And uh,

607
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:57,890
then then your creative life becomes
like that movie groundhog day.

608
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,320
So there was a couple of things
I've been working on and what,

609
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,280
what they did was they ended
up making three minute fits,

610
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:06,020
five minute pits in six minutes.

611
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,990
It's nine minutes and I'm not gonna
I'll say off the air what it is cause I

612
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:11,030
don't,
I don't want pull,

613
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:14,060
you just said you just figured
out some new standup thing.

614
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,240
Would you say some skills you said?
Yeah.

615
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,740
You just figured out new standup skills.
Yeah.

616
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,700
And when you mean is like you've been
able to extend bits or what do you mean

617
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:27,560
skills? I'll tell, I'll tell you. Well
it's like, I'll compare it to athletics.

618
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:32,150
Okay. Okay. Let's just say
you know your, your, uh,

619
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,120
you can't go to your left.
Oh.

620
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:38,310
So in one summer you just work on going
to your left and then everybody in the

621
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:41,460
leagues like, Hey man, he can't go to his
left. So they're working on your right.

622
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:43,890
You go to your left, you start scoring
more points and it's like, fuck,

623
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,140
he's doing this. And the
next year, what do you do?

624
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:50,370
You start clamping down on defense and
you just keep working, working, working,

625
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:52,590
working at that little subtle things.
And,

626
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,680
and then hopefully if people are
watching your specials close enough,

627
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,270
they're seeing the improvement.

628
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,150
And I've had people come up to
me a few times and said, man,

629
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:01,200
I've noticed some this special,

630
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,420
you went from this to this
and from this to this one.

631
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,290
Like my last special was
a transitional one. Um,

632
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,580
there was things that I was trying to
do in that one that I felt like I almost

633
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:16,320
landed but didn't quite land and now
and then those spy continued working on

634
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:20,330
those skills. This is one after
Fillmore? Yeah. This is the, um,

635
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,980
the fuck was that one called was my
last one called you people all the same

636
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,760
people. Okay. Um, so that
one was a transitional one.

637
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,680
All right. Like, um, why do
I do this too? To let it go?

638
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,390
Was me learning how to do that and then
I felt like I got it. I'll let it go.

639
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:44,040
And then this one, the last one. So I'm
hoping not to put pressure on myself. Um,

640
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,360
um, you know, but this is the,
this is, this is like, um,

641
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,900
what keeps me going and I'll write
it in an hour. It becomes like this,

642
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,830
not like this dreaded thing. Like, Oh
fuck, how do I come up with another hour?

643
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,640
You get excited. You're like,
I'm going to go left. Yeah. I'm,

644
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:01,260
I'm going to work on this
thing that I suck at.

645
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,270
So you feel like when you're going down
they, even though your strips traveling,

646
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,720
I just had to say it.

647
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:10,920
I can't imagine what you think you suck
at and no one else would think that.

648
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,090
It's because I've learned over the years
how to be struggling and make it look

649
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:19,450
like I'm not, I'm not even
bullshitting too. Like there's,

650
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,590
there's, yeah, there's, there's
all these fucking tricks,

651
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,420
which I would tell the fans, but
it would ruin them watching. Sure.

652
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,100
Like I'm not going to say what I'm
working on. Oh, I don't want to them.

653
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,490
Because then they stop listening and
laughing. They start watching like, oh,

654
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:35,550
that's the thing he's working on. Is
he sweating? Does he look comfortable?

655
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:39,360
So you know off air, I
can do it. I know, I know.

656
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:42,210
I can't figure you out anyway.
To me it's all a dream,

657
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,990
so I'm just like watching this thing. I
don't know how, how you put it together.

658
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,590
Then when you write, you write every
day. No you don't. I don't. Right.

659
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,940
Do you try and write all Tony v a
long time ago, a comic out of Boston.

660
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,200
I did this movie,
the heat with him,

661
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,040
he was in not the Brotherhood on
showtime for some fucking reason.

662
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,930
They left me hanging after the second
season. It's still kills me. Um,

663
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,190
you should definitely watch it, but
it's such a buzz kill to get to the end.

664
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,530
Like they set this whole is based on
the bolt yours. Yeah, White Whitey.

665
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,360
And that was his other brother's
name there, uh, Billy Ball jar.

666
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,540
And it was literally the biggest
gangster in the biggest like politician.

667
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,480
And when you're like yt bolt,
you're literally won the lottery.

668
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,830
He won the fucking lottery. And, and
uh, I don't know. The depart is based,

669
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:23,940
but basically it was,

670
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:27,300
guys are still so powerful that I
heard that when they did this, uh,

671
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,200
they made this movie, they switched
from Boston, this series. I'm sorry.

672
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:34,380
They moved it down to providence.
So it was based on that relationship.

673
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:35,160
We had one guy was,

674
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,430
one brother was a politician and the
other brother was a gangster and I

675
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:43,390
absolutely fucking love the show. Anyways,
Tony Memory was in that show. Yes.

676
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,600
And Tony Vee was in it. And, um,

677
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
like Tony Tony was the first guy,

678
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,880
first comedian Tony view was
the first comedian that I met,

679
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,900
also another cigar smoker. Um,
so I love running into him.

680
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,520
He was the first comedian that I met that
did not write down any material really.

681
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,170
And it blew my mind. And I
was just like, and I was like,

682
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,130
so how do you, how do you write?
And he goes, well, I go up on stage,

683
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:10,270
I just start talking about it.

684
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:14,770
And I just asked him like two or three
questions that he asked. I asked a bunch,

685
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,710
but two or three there, I
remembered the other one was, well,

686
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:22,250
what do you do when you forget a joke?
What about this great bit? Your hand,

687
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,280
you and you just forget to
do it? And he goes, well,

688
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,470
that just means it's
time to stop doing it.

689
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,950
And through listening to guys like him
and then starting off with a guy like

690
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:37,900
Patrice O'Neil, rest his soul,
who's the best comic ever saw. Um,

691
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,410
and he,
he,

692
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,840
he naturally knew that from day one,

693
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,501
like Patrice,

694
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:48,130
you still like he used to write in the
shower and he used to joke him and Dan

695
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,160
Cook. Dean was another one.
Dan was another guy. He said I,

696
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:51,640
I would think of shit in the shower.

697
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,800
And they were joking one
night to each other saying,

698
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,260
because when you're in the shower,
the water going over your head.

699
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,440
Sounds like an applause break. Oh,
that's so everything. It's all ego.

700
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,360
So everything, no, they were joking,
but say it just sounded like, you know,

701
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,910
like you are killing on stage.
So I I, that's interesting.

702
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:10,510
I will tell you the best bit I've ever
written was in the shower. Are you joking?

703
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:14,650
He's not joking at all. Yeah,
I'm not joking at all. It
came to me, the shower. Yeah.

704
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,460
I used to think as shit when I was in
New York, I used to, when I used to walk,

705
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,840
I used to walk around the city talking
to myself at night after I did shows and

706
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:25,720
that's when I came up with stuff. And
I used to be that guy. You need to,

707
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:26,471
I need to write.

708
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:29,560
And I would sit down with my notebook
is before fucking laptops and shit.

709
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,290
I'd sit down with the thing right.
Or at least when laptops,

710
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:35,530
we had like 40 pounds and then I would,
um,

711
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,970
and I just, one day it just dawned on me
like I think a shit when I walk around.

712
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:43,090
So I would just start going for walks,
uh,

713
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,550
in New York and go walk around
New York at night. I mean,

714
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,600
it's obviously a dangerous thing, but
it's also a great thing. Um, you just,

715
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:54,250
you just see the city in a different
way and uh, you just start, it just,

716
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,220
you start connecting stuff and then
there becomes this thing where you can't

717
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,730
write it down cause you're there and then,
you know,

718
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:04,560
cause you're not right cause
you're walking around. Um, and so,

719
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,110
and then when you get down to the comedy
club, if you can't fucking remember it,

720
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,700
that it was worth you, you gotta let
go of it. You have to, you have to,

721
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,550
you've got to just think back when you
were in high school and you will making

722
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,740
kids laugh.
He didn't have a fucking routine.

723
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,320
You came to school every
day and you improv.

724
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,520
And if something funny happened
to you, oh, on the weekend,
you didn't rehearse it,

725
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,503
you didn't do,

726
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,800
you didn't go to a buck 20 other fucking
high school cafeterias and try it out

727
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:34,940
and then go out there. Hey guys, I love
that I a wacky weekend. She just did it.

728
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,880
You did it and you acted it
out and you imitated people.

729
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:41,090
Maybe you stood up and you just did all
this shit because you are comfortable.

730
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,420
Yeah. So it's, it's really,

731
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,360
it gets you to that level of
comfortableness that you had with,

732
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:49,850
with your friends. Yeah. So that's what,

733
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,050
what you try to work towards where you're
as comfortable offstage as you are on

734
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:58,570
stage. And then you don't
have to necessarily, like,
I'm not gonna lie to you, man,

735
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,380
if I come up with, write a line or I'll
write a word, I usually do a word right.

736
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,560
Like, like for this,
this thing tonight, like,

737
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,430
I'm gonna go fuck around with
this thing tonight. I don't,

738
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:11,080
I kind of know what I'm going to say.
Um, where are you going up tonight?

739
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,090
I'm going to go up,
down to the comedy store.

740
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,010
You go up how many times a week
and when you're on tour? Yeah.

741
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:20,110
Well, because it's like going
to the gym if you don't,

742
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,770
I don't want people coming out on tour
to see me and see like three shows where

743
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:27,460
I'm at. Can, he's shaking the rest
of them. That's not fair to them.

744
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,940
And that's also a major, uh, uh,

745
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:34,150
fuck over of yourself
because they're not gonna,

746
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,890
they're not gonna come see
you again and they shouldn't.

747
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,870
We went on a double date one night
with bill and his now wife and uh,

748
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,410
so we go out to dinner and didn't have
plans for later and were like, oh,

749
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:46,650
we're just going to go see a movie.
Couple of this. It's a Saturday night.

750
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,730
And Bill's like, Nah, I'm going to go do
a set. And I was blown away. I was like,

751
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:54,870
what?
You don't have any really?

752
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,900
That was amazing to me. Yeah. I
just meant to me, it's like, wow,

753
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,100
you're never going to get there kicking
her whatnot. Well you also have you,

754
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,910
you got like how many kids?
You have like 19 five kids,

755
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,800
but we were just going out I guess.
I see. Yeah. I need to go out.

756
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,590
Well why we think the,

757
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:13,440
although the amount of material that's
at home but people don't want to hear

758
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:16,140
about your kids. Yeah,
they do. Yeah, they do.

759
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,660
Guys come up to me go eh,

760
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:23,760
too much kid stuff and I respect that
because Ah, some drunk in Atlanta.

761
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,150
Oh there you go.
You know,

762
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,480
I got to tell you where I've gotten in
my business in this show, businesses, I,

763
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:33,660
I've, I've based it all on some drunk
guy in Atlanta. Oh. Like, like his,

764
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,190
because I think that too is like,

765
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:39,770
I wouldn't want to just sit around and
just hear about your kids all night.

766
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,050
When I used to watch Carson Cosby
himself, fine. Is it, I have that.

767
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,130
It's like a fucking hour and a half
special. I put that right up there with,

768
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,930
with Richard Pryor, the one he did out
on long beach and with the red shirt I,

769
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:57,380
those are the two best specials I,
I've seen as far as like, you know,

770
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:00,620
just totally freeform
saying, you know, using all,

771
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:02,950
we'll call the language and
then work in clay. That's,

772
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,800
that's to me that is the whole comedy
rainbow as far as working totally clean.

773
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,520
A little bill says, Bill Cosby
says a asshole one time. Big Deal.

774
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,910
But like that is basically
him talking about his family.

775
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:16,640
And I saw that when I was like,
I think 14,

776
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,870
13 when it first came out and I loved
it. I watched it a zillion times. Okay.

777
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,160
And uh, I'd say is a great, is
a great standup thing to do.

778
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,500
I did it accidentally on an airplane.

779
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,350
Somebody next to me was watching bill
Cosby himself and I couldn't hear the

780
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:35,220
audio, watch it with the sound
down. He's fucking unbelievable.

781
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,120
Like you think he's just sitting there
killing you don't realize all the shit

782
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:40,770
he's doing because when he's taught,

783
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:43,350
when you hear that voice and
that thing that what he does,

784
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:46,510
I mean that guy is and,
and, and this is like the,

785
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:51,360
and this was him like like 30 years
ago. Right. But he's got just a little,

786
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:55,530
he had a whole attitude and just
one eyebrow raise. Yeah, no.

787
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,960
Did you ever see that? The
Seinfeld documentary? Yeah.

788
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,660
This is really getting comedy nerd
here, but I thought, but people like,

789
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,740
did you ever see the Seinfeld
documentary comedian, comedian?

790
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,500
Just so you know, Bill was hold a
clutching, uh, the micro Mike Sand.

791
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,460
He was likely to remember the name of it.
He was holding the microphone stand.

792
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,720
He was holding the cover of the DVD
was, I am known for night. Okay.

793
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,910
Remember what did I say earlier
when I was trying to say,

794
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:23,340
I know what you did last summer.
I said, no, he did last Sunday.

795
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,840
I'm the worst with those.
Terrible.

796
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,140
So my favorite part in that movie is
when Seinfeld goes to meet bill Cosby and

797
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:36,450
you see this guy, you see Seinfeld, first
of all, he turns into like a little kid,

798
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:36,631
you know,

799
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:40,830
like you just see him hanging on his
every word and caused me does this quick

800
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:42,450
little thing where he talks about,

801
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,540
I forget what it's something about
like drying the crowd in are gone.

802
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,403
It just makes us,

803
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:52,410
he makes this little movement with his
face and either he the lean forward or

804
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:56,610
came back and I was in the movie theater
in my seat and I leaned forward to the

805
00:45:56,611 --> 00:46:00,150
scroll. I was just like,
this guy is a Ninja.

806
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,500
Like he's unbelievable. So getting back
to what you said when you're going, like,

807
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:08,370
you know, you're still working on stuff.
I mean, I am like that guy, you know,

808
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:10,500
I just got off the ground.
Like that guy is in like,

809
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,410
he's like fucking out there with
those, uh, those cell phones,

810
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:18,240
satellite fucking things going
around the handles. Like so, um,

811
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,980
and I think that there's so many

812
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,500
unbelievably talented
people out there and, uh,

813
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,610
that you get sucked into doing other
things like writing scripts and that type

814
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:31,530
of stuff, which I'm not saying
it's a bad thing, right?

815
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,590
But there's just something about
standup comedy that I like.

816
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,090
That's where all my goals
like. So, uh, yeah. So I,

817
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:43,410
I keep working on that and then any acting
work I get, I just considered it as a,

818
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:47,790
as a bonus. It should be in fan fence for
years. You've promised me yes, that's,

819
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:51,390
you are going to hook me up in all
your movies. I was putting your hours,

820
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,470
the guy and he said, listen, I'm doing
this little stock car movie called uh,

821
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,820
Talladega Nights. We didn't
know each other. How do you,

822
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,330
how do you look in a virus? Know
each other then? And I, and I,

823
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,330
I cried when that movie came out
and you didn't put me in it. Okay.

824
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,620
Well I taught year old virgin, by the
way, when we did pay in that barrel,

825
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:11,670
are well aware of you and they love
you. Didn't put me in. Just so you know.

826
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:14,880
And you take it, you fucking
take this case said, yeah,

827
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:18,570
Bill Burr might be the best out
there right now. So take it. Oh,

828
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,590
he says he's too busy editing
movies. Nope. He gets it.

829
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,960
He knows a feral knows. They
know. All right. Listen,
this is about you, my friend.

830
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,450
Let's stop with this. What I want to
talk about is you. So there you go.

831
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,870
That's of me. Well, have you seen,
have you heard about Sherry's berries?

832
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,200
I'll give them a shoutout.
She did.

833
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,980
They're chocolate covered strawberries.
I do it. Yeah, for Christmas. Yeah.

834
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,200
Kind of lost my shit when I was, I was
trying to read because there's copy was,

835
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,890
I couldn't figure out if it
was homoerotic or homophobic.

836
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,450
It just kept going. One, you know, you
should see the size of our berries.

837
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,110
So that was like homoerotic and then
you get to their phone number and it was

838
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:03,240
like call eight, six, six fruit. What?
Fruit? It's like a homophobic, damn.

839
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:07,680
It was just, it was fucking, he reminded
me of that sketch. Remember that?

840
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,870
That Alec Baldwin, that's Schwetz what
it all still, it was literally like,

841
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,460
I thought it was a joke. So, and plus I
was, I was jet lagged or whatever. So, uh,

842
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:19,510
I think I, I'm going to see what that,
when that one comes in, I'll see how many,

843
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:24,310
I think I sold a lot. Yeah. Just by
acting like Sherry, Sherry's berries.

844
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:28,090
So I gave him, I gave him a free
plug back. That's good. So, uh, yeah,

845
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,670
what King Bucket,
I'm going to go into press junket here.

846
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:35,671
What can people look forward to seeing
here with the new anchorman or not?

847
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,940
I don't want to get away in India. Okay.
And here's the deal. You've seen it yet?

848
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,850
No, because I'm trying,
I'm trying to, we can all,

849
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:47,910
I'm trying to coordinate with like
five people where we are the biggest

850
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:52,660
anchorman nerds. That's awesome. And
it's like I want to go with all of them.

851
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,660
I want to go during the
day so there's not a,

852
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,170
I want to be able to hear
every joke and I personally,

853
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:02,770
I want to see it a good three times
before I buy it on laserdisc DVD.

854
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:07,110
And all that. Dude, when we
were doing that, when you saw
us in Atlanta, we had, we,

855
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:11,290
we wants to watch the movie like five
fucking times. It's like our, uh,

856
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,670
what's that? Mr. Smith goes to Washington.
That's like our movie was me. Uh,

857
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,260
Jason La had the duty hugged and Paul
Versey, my buddy, uh, from New York,

858
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:24,640
you got to meet him at great guy and a,
um, a hilarious guy and we would just,

859
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:29,890
we would just pop that thing in.
Um, and it's just a good joke.

860
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,510
Oh, that's not the second
they get, you know,

861
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:35,160
made Frank Sinatra look like a
Hobo Nike. And we ended up in, in,

862
00:49:35,161 --> 00:49:38,950
in our pajamas watching him. So I'm
so fucking excited to see this movie.

863
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:41,830
I'm so happy for you guys that,
that they able,

864
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:44,530
I remember asking for years on my planet
the fuck are they doing another one?

865
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:46,870
You were like, I'm going to be
going, like, this script is written,

866
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,060
the script is written and
what, what, what is it?

867
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,130
Because everybody download stuff now. Like
why, why did it take so long? Oh No. Uh,

868
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,520
for a couple of reasons.
First of all,

869
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:58,020
cause Adam and we'll weren't
keen on doing sequels. Okay,

870
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,910
I hear stand that and then
the movie wasn't a hit.

871
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,020
It only made 85 million domestically is
a modest hit so that there was no demand

872
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:06,700
from the studio.
Like let's get more money.

873
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:11,890
Well it made 85 box office,
which is not huge.

874
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,130
You know, it hits $100 million.
Then you're like, okay,

875
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:18,940
let's make another hundred million
dollars cost to make that one costs 24

876
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,070
million. And then you, they figure
they've spent uh, 20 million of market.

877
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,950
So that's 46 million. All
right, let's, let's, let's,

878
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:28,010
let's bring it to regular people.
Regular people numbers.

879
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,460
If somebody put 240 bucks yeah,

880
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,850
down at the track and then they left
with 850 bucks, they'd be pretty psyched.

881
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,390
Right? They'd be buying drugs for
people. But I would definitely say, hey,

882
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:43,130
let's do this again. I liked the problem
is they put down how much? 240 bucks,

883
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,390
put it at 240 bucks.

884
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,680
Then you made 241 that was more like
it because what you only get half the

885
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:52,520
revenue from the, from the
uh, uh, you also spent,

886
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:56,570
you put $48 down or have sold $44.

887
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,500
That's $24 million to make
the movie. Then grosses. Yes.

888
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,230
Then $20 million to, to
advertise the movie, not,

889
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:06,410
it's $46 million you spent on this movie.

890
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,850
Now the movie makes $85
million at box office.

891
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,290
The student gets half of that. Okay,
so there's still in the, in the red,

892
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,430
he still walked with 200
bucks, right? 200 bucks. Well,

893
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,740
200 and your world is 20 million.
No, no, no that, none of that.

894
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:26,420
They get half of the 85. So
they only made 40, 42 43.

895
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,800
So they're actually is only making 43
million backers. Then you broke even.

896
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,500
That's all they did all with you
have Italia. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

897
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,690
You spent $20 million in
advertising prints and advertising.

898
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:43,730
So the real cost of the movie was $46
million or $44 million. So that wasn't,

899
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:45,110
they didn't get a huge profit.

900
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:48,920
So do you really just have to be a
crook to somehow get over the bar?

901
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,600
We'll know what happens. Is that making
you money? If you, if you make a,

902
00:51:53,601 --> 00:51:57,920
if they make $100 million now
they've made $25 million and a happy,

903
00:51:57,921 --> 00:52:01,600
so they are just looking to make their 25
million. Yeah, it's all a business. Okay.

904
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,960
Nobody cares about if it's good or not.
Did I make money and I blame them?

905
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,240
They're in a business.
So I've always said that.

906
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:12,170
What happened later then was
DVD sales and cable reruns.

907
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:15,950
It became a hugely popular movie
and after about six years ago,

908
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:18,680
it became this thing like wow,
something's going on with this.

909
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:21,560
When you saw the tee shirts and the
quoting everywhere in pop culture,

910
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,770
it went away. Now who got the
money on that? Oh, paramount.

911
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:30,230
So their property also, they
made all the weight. So the guys,

912
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,390
the guys that you're talking
about didn't make any money.

913
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:36,120
You're saying that's paramount. Didn't
initially as part. Okay. Okay. All right.

914
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,800
So then it was clearly there's
something here. Then people were like,

915
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:42,950
anytime I'd go on a press
junket or Steve or will or Paul,

916
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,950
they don't know how you're moving.
What about anchorman two?

917
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,490
It became this cult phenomenon,
which can became a pop culture phenomenon.

918
00:52:50,491 --> 00:52:53,390
I was like, you couldn't ignore,
there's a big thirst for this picture.

919
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,510
And then the studio picked up on it
and then whatever it was two years ago,

920
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,100
they weren't planning on doing it,

921
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:00,200
but then they had something
fall out of their schedule.

922
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:02,930
And so Adam and we'll approach them
again. They said, yeah, let's do it.

923
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:07,190
Then there was a little haggling over
the budget and then, uh, because they,

924
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,270
so did you get to the fore?

925
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:11,810
You ever get on the phone if there's
as possible for way phone call?

926
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:14,700
Was there any like, no, there
was no hesitation. Kitty,

927
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,340
can you fucking believe we're doing this?

928
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:20,190
That only happened when we
all met together in Atlanta
when we were shooting the

929
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,283
first,
uh,

930
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,460
last week of February one start to
interview or this is what I should got to

931
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,590
what? So what, what was that
stuff? We'll have to wait.

932
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:30,720
They've got to fucking enjoyed
bill burr. What, what, what is,

933
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:34,130
so what was that like when you guys,
you got the band back together? No,

934
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:37,230
before that we got together to shoot
that little teaser, a commercial, uh,

935
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:41,040
after we'll had announced it on
cone on county again with the flute.

936
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,820
That was awesome. That was awesome. We
met and did that teaser trailer, right.

937
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:49,170
You know, coming in a year
and a half your too. But that,

938
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:52,440
that was so early. It was, but we did
that so that they couldn't pull the plug.

939
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:52,921
There's like,

940
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:56,070
there's no way they can go back and we're
going to announce that he announced it

941
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:58,500
there. Now we're going to do
this teaser. So here we go.

942
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,860
So that was an offensive move. That
wasn't like the studio going, hey,

943
00:54:01,861 --> 00:54:03,390
go put on your costume. He was like, no,

944
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:05,640
we've got to make sure that they're
going to do, let's put one out. Let's,

945
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:08,640
let's keep goosing this thing. And uh,
but I'm sure pair my paid for that.

946
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:12,690
So they were new, but we'll make the
announcement so there's no going back.

947
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:15,930
So the first day you were in Atlanta and
you're shooting and the first day you

948
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:20,050
go down, it's in a scene involves
shooting off for you and your on.

949
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:24,780
The first day that we got together was
a day where we recorded some stuff in a

950
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,510
um,
looking at a picture here somewhere,

951
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,100
recorded some stuff with the studio
cause there's a song in the movie,

952
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,760
there's a song we recorded for the
movie that didn't make the movie,

953
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,860
which is going to be out on DVD later.

954
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:38,600
I'm such a big fan of actually
downloaded the music already. No,

955
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,430
I downloaded like what was that song
off the first one? Uh, afternoon.

956
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:48,120
Oh yeah, yeah. Brandy.
No. From San Francisco.

957
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,300
What does nameless,
I'll roll enough.

958
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,070
The ships and here's what they had to say.
Ride cab.

959
00:54:56,071 --> 00:54:59,280
I kept my head upon your mystery ship.

960
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,540
We playing that on the bus man.
After we finish clinic a Gig,

961
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:06,300
the next morning we wake up,
we start cranking that.

962
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,970
I don't know why I took six
years off this, this phone.

963
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,660
I had a picture of us the first day
we got together. Recorded. It was,

964
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,810
it was nine years later. It was
amazing. I'm sorry I can't find it,

965
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:19,620
but you know Adam and,
and Judd and a will, Paul,

966
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:23,970
Steve and Christina and myself. And that
was, that was like, wow, here it is again.

967
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,900
That's nice. Finally, when it
was getting at the first time,

968
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:28,411
you guys were actually,

969
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:31,950
we were dressed up in character and you
at the cowboy the day that we shot that

970
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:35,160
little teaser of does that thing where
he doesn't move his arms straight down.

971
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,380
Right. That blew me away when I, when,
when you let me come down that day, uh,

972
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,460
just let people know I was
doing a Gig in Atlanta. Right.

973
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:45,300
And somehow you knew I was there and
you say, hey, you want to come down to,

974
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,510
I knew you were coming to
Atlanta to do, do a show. Right.

975
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,890
And you have to be in town that night
too. That was unreal. We went down there,

976
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,950
the set visit. So we go
to, I'll tell it starts.

977
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:59,250
So we go down to a t to the
anchorman set and, and we're,

978
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:02,040
we're sitting at already
smiling going like,

979
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,480
what the fuck is this going to
be like? We don't, you know,

980
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,830
we were ready to be like
quiet like church mouse.

981
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,470
It's like we'd go down there like,
just don't get in the way.

982
00:56:08,471 --> 00:56:13,050
You don't piss anybody off. Don't step on
any cable. And we go down there and uh,

983
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,550
and the first one we go to meet,

984
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,510
we go up to your trailer and they knock
on the door and you knew it was us in,

985
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:20,850
in and Dave,
you know,

986
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:25,480
you fucking Barstow open the door and
you start going like he's gesturing

987
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:28,960
towards me the whole time. It's me and
Jason Santana. He just goes, the man,

988
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,650
the myth, the shouting across
the parking lot, the legend.

989
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,580
You'd had all these things and you start
walking towards me like you're going to

990
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:40,810
give me this big bear hug. And at the
last second as I reached out to hug you,

991
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:41,500
you make it,
you,

992
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,940
you've cut a hard right and just give
a big bear hug to my buddy. Jason,

993
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:47,650
you left me hugging air.

994
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,030
I had fell for like one of the oldest
comedy tricks in the book. Yeah.

995
00:56:52,031 --> 00:56:54,220
And then you give Jason this big bear hug,

996
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:57,910
like he went to war bearings your face
and his neck and he's laughing his ass

997
00:56:57,911 --> 00:56:58,990
off.
And then that was it.

998
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:02,530
And then we started walking down to the
set and then Paul Rudd comes out of the

999
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:04,030
trailer,
pulls a big fan of yours,

1000
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:07,480
totally dressed as Brian Fantana
the whole fucking get up.

1001
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,180
But he's talking like him. He's
like, oh hey man, what's going on?

1002
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:13,390
And I'm fucking saying hi.
Like I was trying not to be that.

1003
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:16,660
And we went down to the set and that's
what killed me when I went down there was

1004
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:21,460
the scene involved. All you guys, and
I got to see you guys talking before.

1005
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,550
And then the second day
you guys are getting ready.

1006
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,100
All of your body language changed.
And you became those guys. You know,

1007
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,760
like when I say Steve Kerr, I
was like, you know, talking.

1008
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:32,740
And then all of a sudden his
arms just go straight down.

1009
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,920
And we were sitting there like, he's
fucking brick, right? He's being pro now,

1010
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:37,300
you know, and, and, uh,

1011
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:40,600
we'll was signing off doing
something and he did some little,

1012
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:43,280
like that little pound on the desk,
like he had done a good job, you know,

1013
00:57:43,281 --> 00:57:45,040
like little that just the way I just,

1014
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,410
which was unlike any of the
other characters that he's done.

1015
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:52,030
So just as a comedian, just
watching that, that skill level,

1016
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:56,560
uh, uh, as, as an actor was just, it was,
it was fun. And I gotta tell you when we,

1017
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:59,860
when we left, um, oh, and well was great.

1018
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:03,940
He's totally stayed in character
and trashed. Jason. Um,

1019
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,980
I forget what he said.
He just said, Oh yes,

1020
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:08,170
I've heard wonderful things about your
talking to me and you're getting just

1021
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:13,090
points at Jason, but you just a litany of
horrible, just one of those whole thing.

1022
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,270
And so we ended up, I'm
smiling now. We got an,

1023
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:21,190
we got into the cab and went back and we
shot there just like ear to ear fucking

1024
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:26,170
grins. The whole I'm telling you to
do. That was one of the coolest, uh,

1025
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,530
coolest fucking thing that's
ever happened. So I, I'm
so beyond sight that this,

1026
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:32,860
this thing's coming out. So, uh, how, how
many days did it take you to shoot it?

1027
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,640
I think there were 55 days on
this one and there were 45 class.

1028
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:41,470
And that is that relatively
quick for something like
that? A quick normal, normal.

1029
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:43,120
There's normal, uh, it's, you know,

1030
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:47,800
relative to budget you want 60 or
something like that I think is 55. Um,

1031
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,160
the first one was 45 days, which was
a long one for that kind of budget.

1032
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,910
It was all here in town. Um, so yeah.

1033
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,310
Oh you shot that first one here?
Well yeah.

1034
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,550
Is here and there like one or two
days in San Pedro and then uh,

1035
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,440
or Piedro depending where you're from.

1036
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,470
And then I think they just did some
exteriors in San Diego cause all the San

1037
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,300
Diego thinks it was shot
there. Right, right, right.

1038
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:11,170
But it wasn't exactly exterior's
only was the Jack Black scene,

1039
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,670
but it pumps the dial. Nope.
When was that? That he was
here somewhere. Some bridge,

1040
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,760
some bridge in La.
All right,

1041
00:59:19,761 --> 00:59:22,100
well what else do you well,
how long have you been doing here?

1042
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:24,980
I've got to make sure I don't want to
keep them too long. 60 minutes. All right,

1043
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:27,270
look at me. Feel in an
hour. Perfect. We can,

1044
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:31,020
I know what I'm going to
do the standup tour in, in,

1045
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:33,160
in January, February, March. Uh,

1046
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:36,170
go to David kenner.com and
you can check all the dates.

1047
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,890
I think it starts in Boston. E.

1048
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,110

follow the links and all that stuff,

1050
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,580
but I think I started in Boston and you
get the ones hunters going out to the

1051
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:55,070
Wiltern. I can't remember where it,
okay, cool. So smaller theaters.

1052
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:58,250
I call my boss and fans out there. Come
on man. You got to curse those things.

1053
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,310
I'll, I'll hit you up. Definitely.
There you go. I'll hit you up.

1054
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,960
And that full on Keckler thing. Is that
a, uh, is that your own Youtube Channel?

1055
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:09,530
My Youtube Channel, but I just
signed a deal to do a thing with NBC.

1056
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,300
So I'm gonna do a variety show.
So those characters,

1057
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:14,030
those are those characters will
make their way onto that stage.

1058
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:18,530
I do those characters on stage to uh,
and Bill Burr, we were talking earlier,

1059
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,570
has some stuff perculating
some deals someone should make.

1060
01:00:21,571 --> 01:00:23,510
I don't know this about you.
It's about, you know, care.

1061
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:24,500
I want to talk a little Burr,

1062
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:28,530
so I've got a TV show sound that's coming
out that's definitely different than

1063
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:32,510
fucking guys movie. Cheap thrills.
She throws up. Yeah, it's a,

1064
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:36,050
it's a sinister of thriller with dark
comedic undertones. I didn't think it was,

1065
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,840
I didn't know. It's funny, we shot
that in 12 days in Los Angeles.

1066
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:43,280
I think I made like $25 a day to shoot
this thing turned into a masterpiece.

1067
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:45,590
It's wonderful little film.
It's dark.

1068
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:48,680
And I watched it twice with
festival audiences and I
couldn't believe their last,

1069
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:51,230
I had no idea there were last
in this movie. And I thought,

1070
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,430
now how do you describe this thing? I
thought it was, is this thriller? Right?

1071
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,190
But now it's got, it's one of the darkest
comedies you'll ever see. Awesome.

1072
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:01,760
So where can people see? Well,
it's going to be out in March. Uh,

1073
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:05,500
and it was called cheap thrills. Cheap
thrills. Yeah. So I'm excited about that.

1074
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,800
And your back catalog,

1075
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:12,190
what she have favorite movie thing that
you did that I did that you did that

1076
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:15,800
didn't get the attention you felt it
did just to steer some people suddenly

1077
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:19,040
extract. I got to play this character
and extract, which is a Mike Judge Film.

1078
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:23,810
This, this nebbish neighbor
that just tortures, uh,

1079
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:28,580
Jason, um, pavement Bateman.
Thank you. I kept thinking,

1080
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:33,020
right man, Jason Bateman and
it was so much fun. I could
do that for 10 years. Oh,

1081
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:37,010
cool. Yeah. Just a neighbor, this neighbor
that and nudge and you're like, oh God.

1082
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,280
And it is that,
is that up on Netflix or anything?

1083
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:40,460
I'm sure it will all be up there.

1084
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:44,600
And there's a thing that happens to
him badly in the end of the audience

1085
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,220
applauds. Oh, the guy,

1086
