00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,730

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,340

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,470
2015 happy birthday to America.

Happy Birthday,

7
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:34,060
Uncle Sam,

8
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:37,840
me happy birthday

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,943
to you.

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,700
Go Fuck Yourself. All right.
It's, it's just, it's,

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,650
it's the fucking birthday of this country.
And you know what that means, right?

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,170
You get out there and your true,

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,870
you get yourself a bag old barker,

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,300
undo your fucking top button and most of
your zipper let that belly but it walk

15
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:05,040
around.
I'll tell you what,

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,870
4th of July in Los Angeles I will tell
you is like no other place seriously.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,290
Like they, they, it's an
absolute fucking free for all.

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,820
You can shoot off essentially
whatever the fuck you want,

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,260
wherever you want,
regardless of safety. And uh,

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,550
we are now in the fourth year evidently
of the drought and I knew that we were

21
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:29,780
having water issues. I didn't realize
that it was the fourth year because a,

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,490
either I wasn't paying attention or raw,

23
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:34,020
they're finally starting to report on it.

24
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:38,370
So it is dry as can be,
you know.

25
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:39,940
Okay.

26
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,460
Dry is a fucking white guys torso.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,180
Um, anyways, so I am predicting,

28
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:53,020
once again, last year was the first time,
you know, I go up, I go up on the roof,

29
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,140
I go up on the roof and I
watched the fireworks. You know,

30
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,800
I fucking put a little lawn chair down.
This is the end of the day, right?

31
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:03,280
And I just sit up there and I smoke
a cigar and I have my fucking,

32
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:06,100
my Miller high life plural.
Exactly.

33
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,240
I have a hell of a time getting
back down because there's, you know,

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,040
the only way to get up on the roof
is by a ladder. Right. So, um,

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,120
but I just sit up there and I just, I
just watch all of them going off. And uh,

36
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:22,720
I think it was last year. The year
before was the first time I saw it.

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,670
I saw some something,

38
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:29,650
basically fireworks show Worthy
Litton Lid off by just some jackass.

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,280
On a street that has a bunch of
palm trees and apartment buildings.

40
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:37,450
And I saw it explode and it started to
go out and then it started to go up again

41
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:38,320
and we were all standing up.

42
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,780
They're going to set on fire
is that fucking place on fire?

43
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:44,200
Fortunately was right around the block
from the fire station and I gotta Tell Ya,

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,660
I gotta hand it to the a l
La f d the fire department,

45
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,470
that fucking thing caught on fire there.
There uh,

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,240
sirens came on within the
minute and they were over there.

47
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:01,000
The whole thing was done within like
swear to God, two or three minutes,

48
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:05,010
which was incredible. And I couldn't
tell from where I was at if it was a, a,

49
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:08,890
a tree or what don't. I just sound
like the awful reporter on site. No,

50
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:13,090
I don't know if that's a tree,
if it's an apartment or a Parthenon,

51
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:17,480
but whatever it is, it is definitely
on fire. Back to you, Chad.

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,210
Thank you. Wilamena she's a
new addition. Transgender,

53
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,530
transgender ginger from Massachusetts.
Will Amena Bird. Wilamena wa.

54
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,110
We just want to say how much we
support what you are doing. Um,

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,030
anyways, uh, so I got him, oh,
did I get into with somebody?

56
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:42,290
I think I had some good shows this week.
There was no fucking problems. You know,

57
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,930
it was just said to that couple last
week that got offended when I got mad.

58
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,600
And I use that word that I should have
said, well what if I said this word,

59
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:49,940
which was a different bad word for
another group of people. You know,

60
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:52,280
it's funny you wouldn't of got
offended and you'd be standing here,

61
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:56,510
slapped me on my back saying what a
funny edgy show it was. Oh, Billy,

62
00:03:56,511 --> 00:04:00,200
you still not over it now I'm not.
I'm not.

63
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,300
So anyways,

64
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,650
I'm going to do a little bit of
grilling this weekend and uh,

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,370
got some family over here seeing all the
pressure right. You take out your grill,

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,300
you gotta make sure you fucking,
you're doing it right. Not like Versie.

67
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,290
He'll just let anybody
jump on his fucking grill.

68
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,650
Maybe that's the genius of [inaudible].
I don't know,

69
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,760
but I'm going simple this year.

70
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,140
I was going to do the whole fucking pork
shoulder and all that and I just been

71
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:26,420
so fucking busy. I'm like, you
know what, at the end of the day,

72
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,020
how drunk people are going to be.

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Did they really need anything more
than fucking burgers and hot dogs?

74
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,550
I remember one year for the Rose Bowl,
j law had smoked a pork shoulder,

75
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,050
which evidently was delicious,

76
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:41,810
but by the time he took it
out I was so shit faced.

77
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:44,960
I had already started my cigar,
like the meal had already happened.

78
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,580
So then he gave it to me and I was sitting
in a fucking lawn chair with a beer

79
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,121
in one hand,

80
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:53,600
a cigar in the other and I was trying
to figure out how to set down one or the

81
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:58,270
other so I could pick at it. It was an
absolute shit show. So I don't know what,

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,960
why go through that effort?
I didn't what the fuck I'm talking about.

83
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:07,740
So anyways, I'm happy 4th of July
to everybody and I hope you have a,

84
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,130
even if you're around the world
and it doesn't mean shit to you,

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,721
you know what I mean?
Like,

86
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:15,350
I had never heard of Cinco de
Mayo until I came out here to la.

87
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:20,180
And I actually asked the classic White
Guy Question, what day is Cinco de Mayo?

88
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,040
For those of you who are like me,

89
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,420
that basically means in
Spanish it means 5th of May.

90
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,800
It's like the 4th of July and say what
does the 4th of July? That's what,

91
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:32,780
that's what I was, I was that
person. Well actually no,

92
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,880
because I didn't say the
whole thing in Spanish.

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,250
So that'd be a 4th of July, right, bill?

94
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,870
We get it. We get it. So anyways, um,

95
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,280
being a lover of all things old,
uh,

96
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,750
one of the frustrations of that is
every day, you know, something happens.

97
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,930
I have my old truck,
68 f 100 and I have my old house,

98
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,810
which was made in the 19 fucking twenties.
And uh,

99
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,260
if it's not one thing, it's a fuck
another. And some days it's both.

100
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,130
Like today I started my day, I had to go
do some, um, look at some of the writing.

101
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,500
Some of the drawings for F
is for family by the way,

102
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:16,240
which is coming out in December. We
got three episodes, three episodes in.

103
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:21,130
It's a serialized, um, series,
meaning basically each,

104
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,970
you know, they don't stand alone like the
Simpsons. So this is going to be like,

105
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:27,820
uh, it's going to be like
watching true detective,

106
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,020
except it's a cartoon and it's not as
gritty. I don't know how to describe it.

107
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,350
I think it's going to be fucking funny.
So I went down there today to go look at,

108
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,140
so I got my truck and um,

109
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,180
yeah,

110
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,470
and I don't know what
happened this morning.

111
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,780
I come down and stay at me
because I left it on a hill.

112
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,410
And you gearheads know this. I
had my tarp in the, on the, uh,

113
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,170
passenger's side floor and I go to take
out the top. I need to wash it anyways,

114
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,920
so I didn't have it on my truck. As I get
my truck wash and I throw the top one,

115
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:59,770
then it gets dirty. So
long fucking story. So, um,

116
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,830
I go to pick it up and it's covered
in like not covered, but it's,

117
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,800
there's a bunch of antifreeze leaked out
from underneath the, from the dashboard,

118
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,920
uh, area. Now I know I have,

119
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,350
the way the heating system works,

120
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:20,350
I have a heater coil right behind my
glove box that I had to replace it.

121
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:23,420
I don't know if, I don't know why
any that'd be antifreeze in there.

122
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,290
I have no fucking idea.

123
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,340
I don't really understand the coolest
system belong beyond what it does for the,

124
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,340
the engine block. But anyways,
there it was, it was all of that.

125
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,280
And I hadn't watered up when a
time I realized it was on the tarp.

126
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:36,710
I already headed against
my shirt and my pants.

127
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,040
I had a light pair of gray pants on and
I was just like, yeah, you know what?

128
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:40,491
Fuck it.

129
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:45,491
So I toss that thing aside and I go to
work and I'm joking with people laugh and

130
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:48,280
I go, I've got a brand new fucking
engine in there. Like, how,

131
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:51,500
how could I have a fucking problem?
You know why?

132
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:54,350
Because the fucking things almost
50 years old. That's why bill,

133
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:57,140
you get out of bed every morning,
no matter how good a night's sleep,

134
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:01,160
you got some fucked up on you while
you're driving. You're driving you bill.

135
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,640
That's what you're doing. So
then I come home, all right,

136
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,010
picked up one of my family
members down the airport,

137
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,620
fucking when I've got a burger and a beer,

138
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,800
they make the best burgers out
here in La, I have to say. And uh,

139
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,580
I backed into the driveway and I get out
of the truck cause I got to close the

140
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:19,850
gate and I grabbed the handle and the
fucking handle comes off on the gates. So,

141
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,690
you know, I've, uh, I don't
what, what, what, why,

142
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:29,660
why buy thinks, why do you buy shit? So
then it just fucking breaks down. But, um,

143
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,720
I didn't want to get into it.
So anyway,

144
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,040
so we got all these
fucking people over here,

145
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,320
so it's going to be
really stressful. And, uh,

146
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,710
we got to figure out what the fuck we're
going to put everybody and all of this

147
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:41,230
bullshit.
And um,

148
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,810
okay.

149
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,330
I don't know. My, me and my wife kind
of pining kind of me getting into it,

150
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:49,260
you know what I mean? She bought one of
these fucking pull out fucking sofas.

151
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,540
I remember a long time ago, Todd, Barry,

152
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:56,230
you stupid this perfect joke about the
pullout bed self a cause they gonna stick

153
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:59,050
it in my office. Right. And of course
there's no fucking room for there.

154
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,440
There's no room for it. So now, uh, you
know, it was just like, you know what?

155
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,410
Fuck it. I'll get rid of my desk.
I don't need an office. Anyways.

156
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,530
Whenever I do the podcast, I do it in the
bedroom anyways, laying down on the bed.

157
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,330
I don't need an office. You know,
you got an office, you know,

158
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,320
I'll just fucking use yours.
I mine.

159
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,730
So whatever it Todd Barry,

160
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:21,850
you said this great joke about the fucking
pullout couch where he was just going

161
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:26,530
like, uh, you know, you know, he's
like a pullout couch. He goes,

162
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:31,531
it's an uncomfortable couch that pulls
out to an even more uncomfortable bed.

163
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm butchering it. But I used to
always laugh because it was perfect.

164
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:37,810
I was living in New York City at the time.

165
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,360
We all had small apartments and you know,

166
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:43,840
you'd hook up with somebody or go over
some chicks house and Hook over a house

167
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,770
or fucking apartment and you'd be at one
of those fucking things and you'd be on,

168
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:51,280
you know, you'd be a healthy snack,
a healthy scratch, you'd be fuck,

169
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,200
you wouldn't be playing the next
game is basically what I'm saying.

170
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:56,710
So we're getting one of
those and I haven't slept on
one of those fucking things

171
00:09:56,711 --> 00:10:01,540
since I was 30. I slept on a futon until
I was 36. Not Proud of it, but I did,

172
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,060
I made the sacrifices so I could scream
comments on my own podcast someday.

173
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,550
Right. So I haven't slept
in one of those in a while.

174
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:14,260
So maybe the technology has gotten
a little better. Um, I dunno.

175
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,300
I have no idea. But, um,
anyways, I not feeling it.

176
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,350
I had nothing to fucking talk about today.
I'm just excited.

177
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:21,340
I got the whole fucking weekend.

178
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:25,870
So last week I started to talk about
the Bruins and what dawn Sweeney did and

179
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:28,810
why they let everybody go. And how I
didn't understand it. And as usual,

180
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,540
they're saying that everybody
wanted like a 50 year contract,

181
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,180
like Douggie Hamilton wanting to get paid,

182
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,180
like the best defenseman in the
league is what they were saying.

183
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:42,130
And then evidently Lou Cheech wanted
like a fucking eight year contract and

184
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:45,250
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. I don't know whether to believe it.

185
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,850
I don't know who shot. I don't know who's
not. And I don't know what to believe.

186
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,130
What this fucking thing.
Oh,

187
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:55,120
I know is I'm just sitting here
thinking we got rid of Tyler's Sagan,

188
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,980
Johnny Boychuk,
Douggie Hamilton in Milan,

189
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:04,540
Lou Cheech all in the last three, four
years, three, four seasons I should say.

190
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,960
So, um, I don't know.

191
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:11,710
I guess we just got some goon from Philly.
I don't know how that helps us.

192
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,010
I don't know how that helps us. I don't
know what the fuck we're doing. I,

193
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:17,740
I'm not a big fan of draft picks.

194
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm a big fan of people
that have proven themselves.

195
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,400
If you think he couldn't
pay one of those guys,

196
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,790
I would have kept blue Cheech and I go,

197
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,320
fuck all you guys sit in and say
that he's not scoring as much.

198
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,230
Nobody's scored as much.
Last year we had a brutal fucking seasons.

199
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,930
Now all of a sudden Milan Lou
teaches that one isn't a fucking guy.

200
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:38,070
He can build a team around. Sorry.
This is like a delayed reaction.

201
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,530
Think I was just in shock. So, um,

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,630
I just feel like next year when I go,
you know, get the center ice package.

203
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:46,800
When I go to watch the Bruins,

204
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,440
I want to feel like I'm watching the
blue jackets or something that I never

205
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:54,410
fucking watch. No disrespect to all you
hockey fans there in Columbus, Ohio.

206
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,560
Hey, y'all wish you fans. You guys getting
a little nervous about a hard bother.

207
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:04,070
Is it John Harbaugh captain? Come
back, bring it fucking Michigan Beck.

208
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:07,360
He's starting to hear those horns playing.
Listen to it.

209
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,700
Listen to it this weekend.
When you're out there with the fireworks,

210
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:12,100
right and you're fucking
Osu championship tee shirt,

211
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,200
you're not going to tell me
that way in the distance.

212
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,370
If the wind's blowing just right, you
know, you're not going to start here

213
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,080
during you guys gonna flip
out. Yay. He won shit. Yeah.

214
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:28,850
You want shit and fucking are Caribbean
Maribela time you won a championship.

215
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,700
Why would people in Ohio
have a southern accent bill?

216
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:36,410
I Dunno cause it's
offensive. Um, I'm hoping.

217
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,490
Here's the John Harbaugh bringing
the, uh, is it John Harbaugh?

218
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,210
I can't remember anything anymore.
Uh, the fucking wolverines back.

219
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:47,090
I hope he does because I would love
to see that become a rivalry again.

220
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,710
You know what I mean? It's like, you know,

221
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,490
Brian's contains as much as
I should and the Canadians,

222
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,220
it's no fun when the Canadian stink.

223
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,270
You want to beat them when
they're good or at least you know,

224
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,260
their version of good now,
which as well, you know,

225
00:12:57,261 --> 00:13:00,320
we want a couple rounds of the playoffs,
poor bastards,

226
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,150
poor French best. It's, um, I'm actually
going to be up there later on this month.

227
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm doing a Gig in Ottawa and
then September I'm doing Toronto.

228
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:12,710
So that's the extent of my Canadian shit
that I'm going to be doing this year.

229
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,300
And, um, for those of you who
want to complain, ah, relax.

230
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,850
All right,
the way global warming is going,

231
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,170
your country will be a fun place to
tour within eight months, you know,

232
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:29,000
so who knows? Maybe I'll be up
there. Maybe I will be maybe a, well,

233
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,140
so, uh, anyways,

234
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,450
let me do a little bit of advertising
here and see if I can get this fucking

235
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,820
thing back on the rails.

243
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,200
And the last quick read here is
zip, zip recruiter. Are you hiring?

244
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:09,530
But not sure where to find the
best candidates. Will, are Ya?

245
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,950
Okay.

246
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,060
As a business owner,

247
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,800

only as good as the people you hire.

248
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,120
Geez, Bill, what insight? You
mean if I hire a bunch of morons,

249
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,920
my company's still won't be good.

250
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,030
I can also tell you that posting your
job in one place isn't enough to find

251
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:30,060
quality candidates, but when
you're, you're short staffed,

252
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,050
there's no time to deal with the dozens
of different jobs sites until now.

255
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,670

I can do it, but why would I do it?

256
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:48,870
I don't have any employees. If I were to
want employees, this is what I would do.

257
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,860
Just post once and within 24 hours.

I literally,

265
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,220
the way I'm reading this is
like the way walking does align.

266
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,690
Like could anybody here a period in
any punctuation in any of that? Uh,

267
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,090
go to ziprecruiter.com/bar.

268
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,760
That's ziprecruiter.com/burr again,

269
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:34,610
ziprecruiter.com/burr

270
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,940
oh you know,
this whole podcast,

271
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,390
I've been sitting here trying to wonder
what the fuck it was that I needed to

272
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,750
talk about, which is probably why the
first 10 minutes was so goddamn bad.

273
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:49,310
My apologies. How can I do that on
the, on the birthday of this nation,

274
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,130
you know, so, um,

275
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,520
the native Americans have like
a 4th of July type of thing.

276
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:59,270
They must have had their holidays, right?
Did we take those away from them to,

277
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,640
you know, anyways, fucking
horrible. Let's plow ahead here.

278
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,230
I need to apologize,

279
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:10,910
specifically heartfelt apologies from
the lovely Nia to the person last week

280
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:15,911
that wrote the quite the hypothetical
about p diddy and the Kettlebell and 50

281
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
million bucks. It just
seems so fucking random. Um,

282
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:22,600
I think we were out of the country when
that whole thing happened or I don't

283
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,040
know what we were doing,
but we missed.

284
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:28,370
For those of you who also live under a
rock or maybe just have better shit to do

285
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:29,300
with your life.
Uh,

286
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,320
P diddy was arrested on East UCLAs campus
Monday for getting into a fight with a

287
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:40,130
Bruins assistant coach early Monday
afternoon and later charged with three

288
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:42,290
counts of assault with a deadly weapon.

289
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,120
One count of making terrorist's
threats and one count of battery making

290
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:51,070
terrorist's threats. What
does that fucking Marty all
family, you know, it's shit.

291
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:53,960
You yell when you're mad.
Terrorist's threats.

292
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,660
The fuck constitutes is
terrorist threat at this point.

293
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,890
I have an a bottled water
and your carry on. Um, yes.

294
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,690
You read that correctly and yes,

295
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,570
that p diddy and then of
course the snarky comment,

296
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:13,480
he'll always be puff daddy
to me. Oh, Sam Cooper. Um,

297
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,810
did he son Justin Combs is a red shirt.
Junior defensive back for the Bruins.

298
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:21,230
He's that fucking old.
I remember living in Manhattan when he,

299
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,940
when he was a kid and did, he had that
fucking a restaurant called Justin's.

300
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,020
He was a little kid and he used to do
standup down there and p diddy would come

301
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:33,860
in there and he would heckle the
fucking comics. It was a brutal gig. Um,

302
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,880
he's played in seven games
combined over the past two seasons.

303
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,910
This is his kid registering
for tackles according to a,

304
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,460
um, these people here, one of us,

305
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,490
you see Las assistant coaches was
at Justin on the field and did,

306
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:55,340
he later confronted the coach
and grabbed him as a result.

307
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,340
Diddy 45 was arrested for assault and
remains in custody at the campus jail.

308
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:02,030
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

309
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,730
Who would have thought that Sean
Combs was a helicopter parent?

310
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,570
Shouldn't you be if like flipping
out at like his pop Warner game?

311
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:11,090
It's like he's a man now.
I don't know.

312
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:15,440
Maybe it's hard fucking watching your
kid getting screamed at. I have no idea.

313
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:19,910
Ucla later confirmed the report
and said that, uh, Sean Combs,

314
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,150
let's just use his real name, was charged
with assault with a deadly weapon.

315
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,110
With the weapon being a kettle bell,
uh,

316
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,140
a piece of weightlifting equipment for
all you fucking lazy bastards out there.

317
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,120
Um, here's Uclas full statement. Shortly
after 12:30 PM today, Sean Combs,

318
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,710
Aka p diddy was the rest of that,

319
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,560
a Costa athletic training camp.
We, we've already running,

320
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,730
we already know this shit.
He said,

321
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:46,940
I'm thankful that our staff showed the
level of professionalism that they did in

322
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,280
handling the situation.
Well. How difficult was it?

323
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,190
It's a bunch of football people. Here's
a picture of what, what are you doing?

324
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:55,961
You know,

325
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:58,870
at some point you just gotta give into
the fact that your kid's not going to

326
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,730
make the pros sit there
attack. Then, uh, uh,

327
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,140
a fucking assistant coach get your Goddamn
head in the game and all of a sudden,

328
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,540
do you think he did one of those
little ditty dances? You know, it was,

329
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,374
he came over.

330
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,530
You remember that thing he did when he
bent over at the waist and kind of just

331
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:19,490
walked up with his shoulders
going up and down the p, the APP,

332
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,710
the Di,
the Di,

333
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,720
the why the fucking datey hold up.
Remember that?

334
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,930
And that guy from a meet the parents,
Ben Kingsley Bent, uh, Ben Fucking,

335
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,110
uh, Ben. A sizzle,

336
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:39,940
which Ben Shenanigans.
Ben Stiller.

337
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,880
Ben Stiller was in that fucker.
All right.

338
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,300
He did the whole beginning thing fade
Leptin and like he was his neighbor and

339
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:49,480
then Sean Combs did his, his,
what he thinks is hilarious,

340
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:53,440
that dead pan look at the camera and
turns his head to the side and you could

341
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:56,590
just hear all the white people laughing
like it was the funniest thing ever.

342
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,750
Oh ha ha ha. Instead of
going like, listen, Shawn,

343
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,830
Mr. Combs, I, I want
to tell you that sucks.

344
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,920
But you had just gotten into that
incident where you're saying the gun was

345
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:13,790
shines. Is that his name?
Remember that guy who went to
jail? That's back. When did,

346
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,920
he was still banging a, what's her face
there? The chick from the Jennifer Lopez,

347
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,620
right before she was with Ben Affleck
before she was with the fucking backup

348
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,540
dancer before she got with the fucking,

349
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,850
that fucking guy that looks
like Latino Anthony [inaudible].

350
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,370
What the fuck was that guy's name? What
did he sing? He sang one of the east,

351
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,970
sang all those fucking,
oh Jesus.

352
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:47,040
What the fuck was that guy's name?
Piazza Dora.

353
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,400
Ah, fuck. It's something junior,
isn't it? Freddie Prinze Jr. Okay,

354
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,990
I don't fuck. Well, what are you going
to do? What are you going to do that?

355
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,190
You know what?
It's unfortunate.

356
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,690
Okay.

357
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,320
Parents, I'm not a parent, so I can
say this with confidence. You know,

358
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:02,940
I can say this without prejudice.

359
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,510
Sometimes you kids just can't play
it the next level. Yeah. Well,

360
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:08,370
you just gotta you,

361
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,260
you gotta deal with it and they're
going to get yelled at at the collegiate

362
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,590
level because you think that assistant
coach wants to be the assistant coach for

363
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:17,610
the rest of his life. He doesn't.
He wants to be the head coach.

364
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,500
Then he wants to get to the pros.
That's what he wants to do.

365
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,470
And sometimes your kids getting
in the way, that dream, you know,

366
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,160
and they, they got it. They
got to yell at him. So, uh,

367
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,080
I know I'm going to go out on a limb
having not seen any of the footage to say

368
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:36,450
that. Obviously there was a
complete fucking overreaction,

369
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,970
but I will say that no terrorist threat
was fucking made under the definition of

370
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:42,630
the law. I'm sure it was a
terrible terrorist threat. Look,

371
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:44,550
I'll kill your whole family or something.
You know,

372
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,230
I'll blow this fucking place
up like people you sit.

373
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,270
That's just an expression
for now is growing up.

374
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:54,350
Burn this fat burning the run
down. Next thing you know, rights.

375
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,200
Fucking people step off for buying the
bushes and you put it on a most wanted

376
00:21:58,201 --> 00:22:01,930
list. Hey, here's a bet
I'd be willing to make.

377
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,350
I'm not making it, but I'm willing
to make it with one person.

378
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,340
I'll bet anybody out there $1,000 that
at no point during this next presidential

379
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:13,240
election,

380
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,240
at no point will anybody who has a serious
chance at becoming the next president

381
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:23,380
of the United States at all.

382
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:26,380
Will they bring up all fucking
it and he taught Monsanto there.

383
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,000
Nobody's going to bring that shit up.

384
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Is they're sitting there charging p
diddy with with making terrorist threats.

385
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:35,704
Is that what it is?

386
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,910
Meanwhile these guys are fucking up
the whole food supply for their own

387
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,970
countrymen. It's the
biggest like act of treason,

388
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,730
terrorism, whatever you want to
fucking call it. Do you know?

389
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,470
They just pass the fucking law.

390
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:50,780
Okay.

391
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,591
The house votes.

392
00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:55,820
This is how underpaid politicians are
and rich people get him into office

393
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:57,440
corporations and all this shit.

394
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:03,010
How's votes to repeal meat labeling law
under threat of retaliation from Canada

395
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,124
and Mexico,

396
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,180
we basically passed a law that was going
to say that we don't have to say where

397
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:11,440
the meat comes from.
You haven't,

398
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:14,140
so you basically have no idea
what the fuck you're eating.

399
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,320
Under threat of trade relations
from Canada and Mexico,

400
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:22,000
the House has voted to repeal a law
requiring country of origin labels on

401
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,580
packages of beef,
pork and poultry.

402
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:26,910
Okay.

403
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:31,170
Wait, Canada and Mexico are arguing. Oh
wait, wait a minute. Wait, Whoa, whoa.

404
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,490
So Canada and Mexico also have fucked
up food so they don't want that either.

405
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:36,770
Okay,

406
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,340
so this is the end.
This is the end of the fucking world.

407
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,180
The World Trade Organization rejected
at US appeal last month ruling that the

408
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:47,430
labels that say were animals were born,
raised in slaughter,

409
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:51,300
are discriminatory against the
two u s border countries. Oh yeah.

410
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:55,450
Don't bring in your fucking genetically
altered food and fuck with ours yet.

411
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:57,150
Cons.
Uh,

412
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,570
both have said they planned to talk
to the World Trade Organization for

413
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:04,590
permission to impose billions of
dollars in tariffs on American goods.

414
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,250
Well, joke's on you buddy. We
don't make anything here anymore.

415
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,900
I don't know that we export anything
other than fucked up food. Right.

416
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,560
I don't know. But anyways, I
guarantee you that, um, you know,

417
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,620
if I every once in a while, if I read a
story before he started talking about it,

418
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,983
um,

419
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,260
okay.

420
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,590
I, I guarantee you nobody's
going to bring that up.

421
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,910
I doubt anybody's going to bring up that
Nestle doesn't think that a water is a

422
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:33,530
human right and that corporations are
in the process of trying to privatize

423
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:34,364
water.

424
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,520
Yeah.

425
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,353
So,
you know,

426
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,510
I don't know if it rains and you stick
your tongue out your own money. It's just,

427
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,530
it's going down. It's why I was
talking about it. I did that, that, um,

428
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,650
needed too many stars.
I was joking around where I,

429
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,650
the president should have fuck you money.
He should make 400 grand a year.

430
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,120
If that guy could feel good about where
he's going to be at the end of his,

431
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,470
you know, if for eight years
you made 400 grand every year.

432
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,930
Okay. Do you think you'd be set
for life walking out in your 50s?

433
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,540
You know,
there's no fucking way.

434
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,740
And that they go around and they give
those speeches after they've, their PR,

435
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,090
their president to these
fucking corporations that
got him in and they get $1

436
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,370
million a night and that's that
stem washing their bribe money.

437
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:20,340
And that's how they, they, they
take care of them. I don't know.

438
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,500
I know I'm going down the fucking Reva.
Notice that guys,

439
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:25,590
I'm slowly going back down the
rabbit hole again. Just cause I know,

440
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,530
I know another fucking election
is coming up. Uh, they will,

441
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:30,300
they won't talk about any of
that shit. So when he was, well,

442
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,660
what can I talk about that's a
little happier than that? Um, Oh,

443
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:38,580
last night I'm getting ready for
another goddamn comedy jam. And uh,

444
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,770
I, um, I played for like two hours.
I got fucking blisters on my fingers.

445
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:47,670
I don't know if it's cause I'm just
hadn't played in a minute because I was

446
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,040
focusing on the helicopter shit.

447
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,240
But it was the most God damn
fun I've had in so long.

448
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,820
Two hours in this rehearsal space.

449
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,870
We went through all the songs that
we had done on the previous ones. Uh,

450
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,980
all these fucking 80 songs.
Dr Feelgood,

451
00:26:01,981 --> 00:26:06,360
Paradise City custard Pie.
What else are we doing now?

452
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:10,440
And so now we're working on new one. Uh,
I know I never tell you what the song is,

453
00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:15,120
so, um, I'm, I'm getting geared
up to do that again and uh, oh,

454
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,090
I can't tell you that this is nothing
more fun than playing fucking drums if you

455
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:20,010
don't have a good time playing drums.
So you were an asshole. I mean,

456
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:24,220
I am an asshole. I don't
know. Well wait a second,

457
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,670
you don't have take.

458
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,170
The problem with this podcast was I had
one beer before I did it about an hour

459
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,160
ago, and that's enough for guy, a guy
of my age, a man of a certain age.

460
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,220
If you have one beer in the
afternoon, you're done. You're done.

461
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:42,390
You got to take a fucking nap. Let's
end on this everybody. Mercedes AMG.

462
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,570
That's like the Shelby division. No, no.

463
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:49,860
I don't mean to insult Mercedes by
comparing them to an American car.

464
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,870
And now how insulting that is.
You know,

465
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,110
I met some German girl and I was
talking about, uh, I was on the road,

466
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:58,500
this German woman. I was going like, Oh
man, do you guys get great cars? Like BMW?

467
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,340
She goes, Audi and I go Mercedes. And
then she just rolled her eyes. She goes,

468
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:05,620
it's a cab. Like it's a taxi
because when you go over there,

469
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,850
like that's what all their taxis are.
So they don't even fucking respect them.

470
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,830
I'm saying, AMG, we'll build
something fast as a given, uh, that's,

471
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:15,660
it's specialty.
But in this instance,

472
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:19,170
a suitably vague teaser video
has piqued our interest.

473
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:23,130
Evidently they're making some sort of v
eight they don't know what the fuck it

474
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:27,180
is. I'll have the link for this. You
guys want to hear what it sounds like.

475
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,980
This is their little teaser here.

476
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,670
Okay,

477
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,950
AMG. Something fast as coming. Come on.

478
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,313
Come on.

479
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,000
Show me the fucking car.
You know what?

480
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,380
I'm not showing you that because that was
just a waste of 19 seconds of my life,

481
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:49,930
you know? Fuck you. I'm glad
you lost both wars. Your cons,

482
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,200
I think something fast as common.
You supposed to your AMG, right?

483
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,610
You know what? This is a complete
cluster. Fuck. I apologize to check in.

484
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:03,100
You walk in on you the way I did
this week. Did I even ask you?

485
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:04,420
I mean I'm supposed to
be checking in on you.

486
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:08,650
I didn't ask you about anything like
how was your work week? You know,

487
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,380
are they making your work the Friday?

488
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,420
Are they making you work the third your
boss makes you do now don't blame you

489
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:20,080
fucking boss and like whoever's the shot
collar. You've got to figure out who,

490
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,730
who's the fucking evil cunt that won't
give you the half day on the third.

491
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,960
Right.

492
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,220
Cause you know businesses psych that
the 4th of July is on Saturday and how

493
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,700
great. We don't have to give him
a fucking day off. Fuck them.

494
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,410
Make them come in Friday.

495
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:40,150
Tell him to stay till five 30 find
out who the shot caller is and a,

496
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:44,590
I don't know. You gotta you gotta do
something fucking stupid. You know,

497
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,280
maybe you'd take whatever condiment you
were going to put on your hot dog that

498
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:50,110
day and you stick it
under his door handles.

499
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,220
That's such a chick Conti fucking
thing to do. But it is hilarious.

500
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,170
Now.
Whatever you do,

501
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:00,080
don't make a youtube video of it and then
send it to me and then you're going to

502
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,300
get caught.
Just don't do that.

503
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:03,610
But I'm just saying it's
gotta be something you can.

504
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,133
Okay.

505
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,290
Is it considered an act of terrorism
now to do the old gag where you put the

506
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:12,580
bucket of water over somebody's
door? You know, why did that go away?

507
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,690
I think it was considered
hack after awhile,

508
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,330
but it's still is one of the funniest
fucking things ever to see somebody

509
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:23,500
standing there and not in swim trunks
dressed ready to go to work and have a

510
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:28,060
bucket of water go over their head.
Right. It's an act of terrorism.

511
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:33,480
Do you support Isis? Um, oh Jesus.
Bill. Oh yeah, that's this, you know,

512
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:38,140
it's this podcast. This was, I should have
renamed this podcast. Who, oh, JJ, gosh,

513
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,270
maybe I don't have enough to
talk about. You know, it is.

514
00:29:40,271 --> 00:29:44,140
I got off the fucking finally,
um,

515
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,930
I got off the road and uh,
I haven't had to do shit.

516
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,690
I think I did one show this
week. Is that all I did? I Dunno.

517
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,370
I'm gearing up for the Montreal
Comedy Festival and uh,

518
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,310
I'm doing some God forsaken Gig in Ottawa,

519
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,790
which is either going to be amazing or
it's going to be an absolute shit show.

520
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,110
I think it's some sort of
blues festival or something.

521
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,270
I'm just picturing a bunch of bikers.
You know,

522
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,840
the only thing worse than a bunch of
bikers is a bunch of Canadian bikers,

523
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:14,440
you know, cause at least the ones down
here, they're frightening. You know,

524
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,680
up there that probably all find out.
Jesus. Why, why would I do that?

525
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:21,040
Why would I say that before I go up there
and then you have to prove how fucking

526
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,100
tough they are. You know, that's
got to be weird, right? Joanie?

527
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,380
No fucking biker gang. It's like, am I
seriously going to do this with my life?

528
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,670
What are you doing? Hey, I haven't seen
him since high school. What do you do?

529
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,330
I'm going to count. What do
you do? I'm in a biker gang.

530
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,990
Yeah. Making my money. Yes. Selling
drugs and a prostituting women,

531
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,080
you know, you know the office
area. It just wasn't for me.

532
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,950
I tried the cubicle thing and uh,
I dunno.

533
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,320
Then I just started getting tattoos.
It started with the, you know,

534
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,250
the classic early 90 ones,
you know,

535
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,670
I got a tramp stamp and Barb wire
around my fucking arm and then I just

536
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,100
continued. Okay. Next
thing you know, I dunno.

537
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,230
Oxy came out right. I was sick a crank
anyways. Right? Oxy came out and then,

538
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:14,450
and then here we go.
By the way,

539
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:19,000
did anybody see what Eddie van Halen
said this week? Eddie van Halen.

540
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:23,060
I swear to God, man, that guy
is like, he's becoming the good,

541
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,640
do you guys ever see that,
that documentary,

542
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:29,050
but beware of Mr. Baker and this is
whole thing on ginger Baker who a,

543
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:31,900
I'm obviously a big fan of,
um,

544
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,030
I mean the guy just comes off as one of
the most psychotic fucking human beings

545
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:39,820
you wouldn't ever want to be around.
And I hate to say it,

546
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:42,940
that was just watching Eddie.
I'm so fucking old. I don't
want, it was a young guy,

547
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,980
25 year old kid just redefining the
guitar and just to watch him turning into

548
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:49,420
this grumpy old man.

549
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,680
I guess there's some sort of horse shit
going on between him and the Bass player,

550
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,840
Michael Anthony.
I know he's not in the band anymore.

551
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:59,260
I don't know what happened this week.
But Eddie basically said like,

552
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,080
you know what,
if van Halen fans don't shut the fuck up,

553
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,100
I'll bring back Gary Sharon
as the lead vocalist.

554
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,120
That'll give him something to bitch about
and it's just like Jesus Christ. Dude,

555
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,740
you had to shit on Gary and fucking
do anything. How'd you drag him?

556
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,570
Is that his name? I don't
know. Like fuck his name is.

557
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,640
It's just really stat enough.

558
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,420
So like Eddie just go play the
guitar and shut the fuck up man.

559
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:26,110
I don't understand what, what's this
guy's problem is? Let me see something.

560
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,420
Let me, let me get the exact goddamn
quote here. Then I swear to God,

561
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:30,370
I'll get out of your way. What do
you care? Even though this will,

562
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,520
this one kind of sucked this week.
He got admit to short fucking weak.

563
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,290
If you have a boss with a, uh, who
has a heart, you know what I mean?

564
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,110
They let off for the Friday.
Who's getting it?

565
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:43,350
We don't make anything here anyways.
What are you taking a day off from?

566
00:32:43,351 --> 00:32:46,460
Answering phones,
you know,

567
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,780
calling up China and tell him to have the,

568
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:53,180
the crying people in the background who
build the shit for no money to shut the

569
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:57,710
fuck up while you listen to
some spreadsheet numbers. Sorry,

570
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,170
I have no, I'm just, I'm totally, I'm
just back into this shit. All right.

571
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:06,560
Michael Anthony, Eddie
van Halen. Here we go.

572
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,460
Why do we got something fast? It's coming.
Can you believe that? Fucking that,

573
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:11,294
that was like clickbait.

574
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay.

575
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,320
And when you see this car,

576
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,860
it's going to change your whole
attitude on what cars could be.

577
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,370
Um,
where was it?

578
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,330
Yeah.

579
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,250
No, Jesus Christ. There's
so much fucking drama.

580
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,320
So this is when you look up Eddie
van Halen. Michael Anthony. This is,

581
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,400
this is the front page.

582
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,610
This is how much fucking chick yelling
and screaming is going on in this band.

583
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,090
Michael Anthony says it's really sad.
He hasn't spoken to.

584
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,630
I don't want the rest of this is Gary
Sherman reflects on his three year stint

585
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:42,470
and Van Halen.

586
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,920
David Lee Roth vents about van Halen
[inaudible] future a Sammy Hagar defends

587
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:51,290
Michael Anthony.
Um,

588
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,740
Sammy Hagar predicts Michael
Anthony will rejoin van Halen.

589
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,110
Uh, Sammy Hagar defends Michael
Anthony. Fuck you, Eddie.

590
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,050
Michael. Anthony. I never quit. Van Halen.

591
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,820
Ladies. Ladies, can we just get back
to running with the devil there?

592
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:15,530
Can we just do that? Um, I got
the greatest reality show ever.

593
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:18,830
You take fucking Eddie
van Halen and axl rose.

594
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,000
All right.

595
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,110
But then you'd have Steven Adler play
the Donald Trump role as who gets fired

596
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:29,830
from the fucking band, you know,
or whatever. It gets annoying.

597
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,960
Maybe I didn't have a great idea.
Maybe I had it.

598
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,120
I just thought of the people and I
thought it was great. Speaking of which,

599
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:37,340
you see Donald Trump got fired
from his own fucking show.

600
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,160
I actually think that he's getting
paid by the Illuminati is a distraction

601
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,240
because I absolutely fucking love this
guy in this election and I don't give a

602
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:51,270
fuck what he says. At least he's saying
something different as opposed to right.

603
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,470
Yeah. Yesterday I said to Kate yet,
right? There's cadre great again. Right?

604
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,211
I just liked it.

605
00:34:56,211 --> 00:35:01,211
He just sounds like some fucking
drunk in a bar with his simple stupid

606
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:03,440
solutions.

607
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,010
Okay.

608
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,000
Hey, uh, Trump, what about the hole
in the ozone where I get a ladder?

609
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,080
Yeah,

610
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,570
we'll draw this country. Everybody's
afraid to get a ladder. She's like,

611
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,820
what are you talking about?
You know,

612
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:21,920
they can't get ladders because of the
Koreans and there are a bunch of rapists.

613
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:28,070
He is literally sounds like he's like
dead guy at closing time where everybody's

614
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:32,990
going like, oh Jesus, is he gonna Puke?
Let's get this guy a fucking cab. Um,

615
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,520
somebody please explain to me how that
guy's worth $9 billion. I just, I,

616
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:38,440
for the of me,
I don't buy it.

617
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,370
I really don't show he
his running his Yap,

618
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,031
which is funny.

619
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:49,050
He's lost his TV show and I think his
clothing line at Macy's and what's the

620
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:51,660
funniest fucking thing ever
is to watch the network.

621
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,190
They'll issue statements like,

622
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:58,191
we don't stand by some of the hateful
things that he said about Mexico Mexicans.

623
00:35:58,711 --> 00:35:59,610
And it's like,
fuck you.

624
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:03,840
You don't stand by losing money and
people are bitching to you and they're

625
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:06,960
threatening to your fucking advertise as
quit acting like he'd give a fuck about,

626
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,190
about anybody right now. Jesus.
Jesus. I was so fucking negative.

627
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,780
Maybe somebody at the network does
care. Um, all right, so that's it.

628
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,830
I already sang happy birthday to America.
They Canada. When's, when's your uh, oh,

629
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,500
I should have done it on Cinco de Mayo.

630
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:23,960
Okay.

631
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,290
Right.
Happy Birthday to Mexico.

632
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:31,310
Happy Birthday to Mexico.

633
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:36,620
Bueno birthday day, man. He called. Whoa.

634
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,900
I don't know any you'll tango Pero.
Wow.

635
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,980
You don't think, oh, Pero Greece,
Splunk. I don't fucking know. I don't,

636
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:51,600
I don't fucking know. What do
you want from me? Both de uh,

637
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,160
I swear to God got at one beer, one beer
and I'm not drunk, but I can't think.

638
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,330
All right, there you go.
There's your podcast. Just yeah,
get it out. Yeah, we got a,

639
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:03,290
we got some greatest hits coming up here.
Uh,

640
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,990
people please have a happy
and safe holiday. All right.

641
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,160
Booze and fireworks.

642
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,510
Don't work but booze and you're friends
with fireworks definitely works.

643
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,100
So find a safe place for your drunk ass
to watch and blow their fingers off or

644
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:21,520
light their backyard on fire. All right.
If you're half drunk friends over,

645
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:22,900
do not have fireworks.

646
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,140
If you're going to your friend's
house and they are drunk and they have

647
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:29,950
fireworks, let them do what
they want. It's their house.

648
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,030
Just make sure you have enough juice
in your phone to be able to videotape

649
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:38,260
what's happening, what happens, and
please send it to me here at the, uh,

650
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:42,710
the man podcast and, um, and that is
it. All right, go. Fuck, I haven't,

651
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,960
God bless you.
I'll talk to you.

652
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,973
A lot of shipments,

653
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,900
gas mileage thing I brought up last week,

654
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,980
how I was watching the good bye girl
and she was standing at the corner of

655
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:31,710
characters, was standing in
front of a fucking Subaru and uh,

656
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:36,711
it got 39 miles per gallon and here it
is 36 later and my car only gets fucking

657
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,560
a hybrid,
only gets 41 miles per gallon.

658
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,400
So this brilliant guy writes in and he
goes and he starts talking about leaded

659
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:52,840
gas and all this fucking
how cars today are heavier.

660
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,560
This fucking Moron thought cars today
were heavier than cars back in the day.

661
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,390
You know,
like the 1959 Cadillac,

662
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,100
I'm sure that that car was lighter
than your average Toyota Camry.

663
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,260
So anyways, this, somebody sent me,
let me, let me, you read this guy's,

664
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:18,830
this guy's response here. One
of the many that I got. Um,

665
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,680
on the gas mileage thing, it always blows
my mind what people fucking respond to.

666
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,570
So this guy ends up writing me a,
he goes, there are two reasons.

667
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,760
Wait a minute,
it's loading.

668
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,490
Okay,

669
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,470
loading.
I don't know.

670
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:38,220
He gave me all these fucking reasons
and I basically responded with so basic,

671
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:41,460
you're telling me, he basically said
that it had nothing to do with money.

672
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:46,320
It had to do with the weight of the cars
and somehow the mixture of the gasoline

673
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:47,550
that we use nowadays.

674
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:52,551
That's why they just can't figure out a
fucking way to get more than like better

675
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:54,510
than what's the highest you've seen?

676
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,590
Like 40 45 this guy tried to say,
well,

677
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:03,000
actually there are things
that can a hundred miles to
gallon their scooters. Ah,

678
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,190
what it more rod?
He goes,

679
00:40:05,191 --> 00:40:09,690
there's two reason why old cars have
such highly high published gas mileage.

680
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:14,370
For one, the EPA tests simply
used to provide higher numbers.

681
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,630
Sir, they've been doing
that right up until the last
couple of years ago. In fact,

682
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,610
the year before I bought my Prius,

683
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,640
they were legally able to claim that it
got like 55th I actually almost 60 miles

684
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:31,041
per gallon before they cracked down
on the hybrid and made him say,

685
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:36,050
actually 40 ones.
I'm aware of the EPA test.

686
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,850
I'm aware that they do it
when there's no headwind.

687
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm aware that most of the test is when
they're fucking going 25 miles an hour

688
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,090
and they only drive the car 55 miles
an hour for about fucking 30 seconds.

689
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,170
I realize that the numbers are skewed.
Okay.

690
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,150
He said it's been revised several times
over the decade. Yeah. So my Prius,

691
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,830
your Prius would get like 70
miles per gallon on the old
test. No, it wasn't, sir.

692
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,190
No, it wouldn't. It would get more
like 60 that's what it did. Look.

693
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:09,960
So let's just say that it would
get 70 who gives a shit? He goes,

694
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,070
what? Where am I? The second
reason is safety features.

695
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:18,080
Check out the weight of your vehicles.
Cars have gotten heavier. No, they have.

696
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,120
My Prius is not heavier than a
fucking Subaru and the 1970s it isn't.

697
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:26,850
Okay,

698
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,290
dude, I'm old enough to remember when cars
actually had metal on their dashboard.

699
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,040
They're all plastics hunks shit now.

700
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,640
Okay.

701
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,800
He goes, cars, if even 15 years ago,

702
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,700
feature death traps when compared
to the modern cars. No, they didn't.

703
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:45,150
They've had to crumple free zones.
There's those little crumpled freak.

704
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:47,970
They've had those crumple zones for years,
sir.

705
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:52,971
In 19 fucking 88 I was coming home from
a Christmas party drunk off my ass,

706
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,100
sitting in the fucking passenger
seat of a Pontiac Grand Prix.

707
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,590
We pulled up to a red light.

708
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:06,030
There was a fucking jeep CJ seven
the old school ones sitting there.

709
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,380
All right, we saw it, I
saw it, the driver's side,

710
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,400
but the alcohol didn't quite
see it and we just sorta went.

711
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,990
We were slowing down,

712
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:21,870
but we didn't come to a complete stop
and just completely rear ended this guy.

713
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,100
All right? There wasn't a
scratch on the fucking jeep.

714
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,910
This goddamn Karch folded
up like a fucking accordion.

715
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,990
The engine dropped down
underneath us and I, I got,

716
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:36,560
I didn't even get a booboo. I
just Sorta, you know, I didn't,

717
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:38,460
I didn't have a seatbelt on or nothing.

718
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,590
The car was designed to take
80% of the fucking impact.

719
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,430
All right, you're sitting in your cubicle.
Just toss in these fucking numbers out.

720
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,310
All right.
So basically my response is,

721
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,640
I'm saying it has nothing to do
with money in the oil companies.

722
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,110
So basically what you're telling me
is that nowadays I can have a video

723
00:42:58,111 --> 00:43:00,030
conference with somebody in Brazil.

724
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,740
Why my entire music collection is in my
pocket on a phone that is also a camera

725
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,180
and a video recorder.

726
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,810
I can upload the content onto the
Internet and potentially have it viewed by

727
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:11,340
every person in the fucking world.

728
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,550
But we can't make a car that does
any better than 40 miles per gallon.

729
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:18,150
So fortunately, you know, everything
else has fucking progressed

730
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,940
except for gas mileage.
Dude, I'm telling you,

731
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:25,840
they have the technology to
get like 500 miles per gallon.

732
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,390
They're just not going to fucking put
it out because that's how powerful the

733
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:34,720
Goddamn oil companies are there.
Right up there with the banks.

734
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,150
You've got the banks and then
you've got the oil company.

735
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:40,900
The banks control the money
supply and then the oil companies,

736
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,520
they control energy.

737
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,850
Okay,

738
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,540
okay. You control energy. You can,
you control the fucking population.

739
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,030
Do you know that? They're
actually out here. There's people,

740
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,420
they're selling kits out here to have
your own fucking windmill so you can get

741
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:57,230
yourself off the grid. So then they
immediately pass the fucking law,

742
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,430
General Electric,

743
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,510
that General Electric had to come around
and make sure that everything was safe.

744
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,450
They had to get their
fucking noses back in there.

745
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,410
So cause they can't have people
disappearing off the fucking grid.

746
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,620
You can't have people getting free
energy other than the cost of the fucking

747
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:17,180
wind mill.
You can't have them sitting there.

748
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:22,040
And every time the God damn wind blows it,
it recharges a generator.

749
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,000
And now I don't have to work as much.
I don't have to work as much.

750
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,260
I don't have to go into debt.

751
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,070
You're getting yourself off of the fucking
treadmill and they can't have that.

752
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,700
All right.
God Damn it.

753
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:35,910
I wish I was more intelligent so I could
explain this better. But you know what?

754
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,260
This is a great documentary.
I'm actually going to email this guy back.

755
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,020
It's called the gas
whole full documentary,

756
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,530
and there's the date and
they have everything from,

757
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,560
they have everything from the,
the,

758
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:54,300
the urban myth of the
watered powered carburetor,

759
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,390
which this guy who I brought
to me completely dismissed.

760
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,410
He completely dismissed any sort
of, uh, that, that, that, that,

761
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:04,770
that exists because he sits in a cubicle
and I sit in the fucking bedroom.

762
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,240
All right? And he tries to
just say, that's just another
media hoax. All, you know,

763
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:13,350
they said, do we beat Eisenhower?
A fucking like dumb shit like that.

764
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,210
Okay. This. So this documentary,

765
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:20,100
I have everything from like
the urban myths that the,

766
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,750
that these a water powered cars existed.
Um,

767
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:28,530
all the way up to actual, uh, retired, um,

768
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,660
scientists who worked for Shell.

769
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,320
Okay?

770
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,360
Who, you just have to watch this
documentary. They were shown,

771
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:40,890
there was a book out that claimed that
they could get a 149 miles per gallon in

772
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:44,160
the 1950s on like a Packard or desoto.

773
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,920
And by the 70s,

774
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,390
this scientist who worked for Shell
said they had gotten it up to a thousand

775
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,640
miles per gallon.
All right.

776
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,120
I don't know why people think that it's,
it's

777
00:45:59,210 --> 00:45:59,720
okay.

778
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,470
Absolutely impossible to improve the
gas mileage. Some people feel that,

779
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:08,270
I don't know why people feel like we can't
come up with anything better than the

780
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:11,800
gas combustion engine.
It's complete fucking book.

781
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,300
It's the same level of bullshit as that.

782
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:18,380
There's an actual difference between
a Democrat and a Republican watch this

783
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:20,210
documentary,
the gas hole.

784
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,200
We're going to have the link up
on the Monday morning podcast.

785
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:29,090
Just watch this shit and I don't know
what to tell you. Some of it looks like,

786
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,280
okay. Did they have this
old guy going, you know,

787
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:35,210
and this guy showed up and he had, it
was a contraption made auto, you know,

788
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:40,250
it was powered on water and then he
claimed that Shell bought the patent,

789
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:44,570
gave him $1 million, and then he
could never fucking, you know,

790
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:46,430
make another one now.
That's the kind of Shit,

791
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:50,990
some old guy saying that he saw it on
a salt flat in the 1950s I'm not going

792
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:54,440
with that. All right. I'm not
that much of a fucking whack job.

793
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,580
But when a guy who worked used to work
for Shell is coming out saying that type

794
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:02,810
of stuff, it's just, it gets to the
point like, are all of these people nuts?

795
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,330
Okay.

796
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,630
You know what I mean?
There's no fucking way.

797
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:11,530
I don't give a shit whether there's led
and gas, whether there's not letting gas,

798
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,270
how much the car fucking ways or any of
that bullshit. There's no fucking way.

799
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:17,930
Yeah.

800
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,180
That in, in, in almost 40 years,

801
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:22,580
you can't do better than
two more miles per gallon.

802
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,330
I absolutely fucking refused
to believe it. I rap.

803
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:29,710
I fucking refuse to believe it.
I think it's complete horseshit.

804
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:33,310
It's just another way to s to
keep control of the herd. Now,

805
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:36,610
if you want to argue that you need to
keep control the herd or there's going to

806
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:39,400
be absolute chaos,
so we have to keep cars down like that.

807
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,930
I will listen to that argument.

808
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,310
But if you're going to come at me
and tell me that in 2000 fucking 11

809
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,460
okay, when I'm reading shit
that in the medical field,

810
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,020
they can now grow a fucking a new
colon for somebody outside of the body.

811
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:58,551
I read this,

812
00:47:58,551 --> 00:48:02,990
this thing on that ted.com this woman had
a completely ulcerated large intestine,

813
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,080
so they took some sort of tissue,
CARF culture,

814
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:09,080
whatever the fuck that means
out of her of diseased colon.

815
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,960
Use that to then grow another one
outside of her body where they would done

816
00:48:14,961 --> 00:48:18,200
growing it. They took the old
one out and put the new one in,

817
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,320
like she went down to midas muffler
and it totally fucking worked okay.

818
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,830
Up until like five years ago,
you were looking at a colostomy bag.

819
00:48:27,831 --> 00:48:31,250
You would have a bag of shit
right under her fucking right,

820
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:35,510
tinny for the rest of her God damn life.
Her social life would have been over.

821
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:40,190
Okay.
If they can do that,

822
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,140
you're telling me you're still going to
tell me they can't do anything rather

823
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:47,900
than about 40 fucking 45 miles a gallon.

824
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:52,160
You're really going to sit there and
believe that in your Goddamn cubicle that

825
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:56,510
they just can't fucking,
just can't fucking figure it out.

826
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,160
The only way I can get like a hundred
miles a gallon is if I ride on a fucking

827
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:05,710
scooter. You sir, believe in Santa Claus.

828
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,980
I remember one time I had this
old piece of shit truck, right,

829
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:14,540
that I drove for like 10 years because
I knew I wanted to be a comedian and I

830
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:18,530
didn't want to go into debt.
So when the engine finally died,

831
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:21,890
I threw a new engine in there and the
guy told me he needed to rebuild the

832
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:22,940
carburetor.
I'm like,

833
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:26,570
you don't need to rebuild the carburetor
so you know what this cunt did.

834
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:31,040
He fucking adjusted the carburetors.
So I would just get shitty gas mileage

835
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,670
hoping I would be an absolute
fucking moron and then
drive back and I'll be like,

836
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:40,810
well, I guess you're right. I'm just,
I'm just chowing through gas here.

837
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,810
That's what this mother fucker did

838
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:46,940
at his little garage.

839
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:52,510
This little piece of shit did that because
it wasn't enough that he fucking made

840
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:57,500
1600 fucking bucks off me.
He wanted to make like fucking 1900 bucks.

841
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,610
So he did that just as a
fucking individual and you're
going to try and tell me

842
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:05,300
that a corporation that basically
controls the world fucking energy.

843
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,770
He's not going to buy up patents
by people that that are, that are,

844
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,800
that are are making or coming up with
the carburetors and stuff like carb.

845
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:18,550
But by coming up with,

846
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:23,200
with with alternate ways of
powering a car more efficiently,

847
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:26,200
they're not going to buy that up. Do
they have that whole Stanley mayor thing?

848
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,230
And that's not a conspiracy theory either.
We actually,

849
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:35,730
we actually played the news
clip on the opiate Anthony show.

850
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:38,880
Stanley mayor,
great news for individuals,

851
00:50:38,881 --> 00:50:42,720
but bad news for oil companies claims
he's come up with an engine that can run

852
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:47,010
on any type of water,
fresh water, salt water,

853
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:49,920
rainwater doesn't make a difference
and he claims he can drive across the

854
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:53,480
country on 28 gallons of water.
Um,

855
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:57,930
this is of such interest. The Pentagon is
sending a lieutenant colonel out there.

856
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,980
That was the actual news clip
from the opiate Anthony show.

857
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:03,780
It was an actual news clip.

858
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,100
It's not some bullshit I read
on a fucking website. Okay.

859
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:11,490
Now what happened after that?
Nobody knows.

860
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:16,491
But basically within 10 years Stanley
was dead in his car disappeared and his

861
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:20,310
brother right now is trying to get the
car back and nobody knows where the fuck

862
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:24,390
it is. All right. Um, I,

863
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:29,410
I truly believe that the quickest death
sentence you could possibly have is to

864
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:34,701
go on the news and claim that you've come
out with an alternate source of energy

865
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,130
that's going to put a corporation
out of business that is making,

866
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:42,000
that is projected to make
$350 billion next year.

867
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:46,860
How much do you think your life is worth?
And if you have $350 billion,

868
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:51,930
how easy is it do you think to get
somebody to solve this problem?

869
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,030
Now, if you're new to my
podcast last week, I was saying,

870
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,340
how come miles per gallon on gas
on cars, sorry, as it's been,

871
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,580
it's basically been
the same since the 70s.

872
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,840
So people were trying to suggest to me
that cars weighed more back in the 70s.

873
00:52:48,841 --> 00:52:52,710
And I said, get the fuck Outta here.
Those God damn led back in the day.

874
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,100
They had metal bumpers and full size
spares. Get the fuck Outta here.

875
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,200
I remember when we had,
uh,

876
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:02,940
we had like a 72 or 73 Buick
regal to door and it took two.

877
00:53:02,941 --> 00:53:04,320
Me and one of my brothers,

878
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,890
all of our might to open that fucking
car doors like opened up God damn like a

879
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:13,710
bank vault.
But two things I forgot to do.

880
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:18,540
One actually look up the stats and to
realize that I was like fucking six years

881
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:20,070
old when I was trying to open it.

882
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,040
You know you ever think that
shit when you think it doesn't,

883
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,700
it doesn't really snow as much as it
used to, which it probably doesn't.

884
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:28,650
But as far as like the storm spent by you,

885
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:31,920
like dude back in the day
was up to my waist. Yeah.

886
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:37,260
And you were about three feet
tall. That's why. That's why,

887
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,490
that's why it seems so
fucking deep because you could
barely look over a coffee

888
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:45,960
table. Um, anyway, so I'll
give you guys that one.

889
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,000
I'll give you guys that one.
Okay.

890
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:53,570
And I would actually love to be wrong on
this one, but I just don't think I am.

891
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:59,260
Even though I was wrong that that cars
weighed more in the 70 when people show

892
00:53:59,391 --> 00:54:03,410
me a bunch of stats, cause God knows
I'm not going to look at them all right.

893
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:05,750
And people,
by the way,

894
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,320
who actually said that I really
sounded like a moron last week. I May,

895
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:14,321
I invite you to listen to the first four
years of this podcast and just see the

896
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:18,410
reoccurring theme that that is. Okay.
I don't read it makes me sleepy.

897
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,960
I've stated that before. I don't fucking
read. All right? I go with my gut.

898
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,480
Okay. I'll tell you this right now.
I don't know how to fill a tooth,

899
00:54:29,481 --> 00:54:31,980
but I can go in and look at
a dentist and real and I can,

900
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,510
I can fucking judge that guy.
Whether or not he's gonna he's,

901
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:39,680
he's telling me the truth.
Does that make any sense?

902
00:54:39,681 --> 00:54:42,710
Of course it doesn't go fuck yourself.
I've got a God damn hour to fill here.

903
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,080
This is what,
this is a problem I have,

904
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:49,190
I have with people who are defending
the oil companies here is basically when

905
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:51,590
you go back to the 70s okay?
And you prove to me the cars.

906
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:55,280
Did they weigh more now? Okay,
so you're right on that one.

907
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,030
Yeah.

908
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:02,030
But your logic though is still based in
that the oil companies were telling the

909
00:55:02,851 --> 00:55:07,851
truth in 1976 that whatever 35 miles per
gallon was the best that we could do.

910
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:13,890
So you use that as a jump off point to
then prove your point now that that's why

911
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:16,770
cars get the gas mileage that that,
that,

912
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,860
that they get today is basically,

913
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,190
I have to make the leap with you that
oil companies are telling the truth,

914
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:29,720
that there's $350 billion industry.
Okay.

915
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:30,554
That that has

916
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,310
on numerous occasions openly got
in the way of any sort of progress.

917
00:55:37,311 --> 00:55:39,860
I remember here out in California,
I think it was the late nineties

918
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:42,620
it might've been 20 years ago.

919
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:46,310
I can't remember what it was before I
moved out here the first time or right

920
00:55:46,311 --> 00:55:47,240
after I left.

921
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,040
The air quality out here
was so fucking horrific.

922
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,000
It's like I know a lot of people
still think it's real smoggy out here.

923
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:58,280
It definitely gets smog,
but it usually just in the summertime,

924
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,840
and it's definitely hazy out here,
but Hays is not fucking smog.

925
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,730
Smog is Brown.

926
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:09,800
You go hiking and you feel a burning
in your fucking chest back in the day,

927
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:14,430
in the late nineties. Okay. You could
see this shit. So anyway, so they, they,

928
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:15,800
they put this,
uh,

929
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:19,400
they put it to the vote for a people to
the people who actually would vote on

930
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:24,401
this shit and they pass this
bill that said by the year 2000,

931
00:56:26,611 --> 00:56:28,740
whatever,
whatever,

932
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:33,510
25% or 30% of cars had to
run on something other than,

933
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,140
you know, the gas oil could get
basically the gas combustion engine.

934
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:42,141
They basically paved the way for the
big three to then basically start making

935
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,540
electric cars the fucking thing past.

936
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,020
Okay.

937
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:52,020
An oil companies got together with their
lobbyists and they went and they just

938
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:55,300
totally dismantled the whole thing
and the whole thing fucking went away.

939
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:56,650
Okay.

940
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,790
Okay. Which for all you people out
there who are gonna explain capitalism,

941
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,890
capitalism to me, I get it. That
is their prerogative to do that.

942
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:10,020
Why wouldn't they get in the way of that?
So let me ask you this.

943
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:13,710
You're telling me that they would get
in the way of that but they wouldn't get

944
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,150
in the way of any sort of progress.
Just with the gas combustion engine,

945
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:20,550
they wouldn't get in a way of
any of that type of progress.

946
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,270
They seem to not get in the
way of anything else. Safety,

947
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:27,060
they don't give a shit about. They won't
get in the way of that type of stuff.

948
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,870
Burning it cleaner. They don't give
a fuck about but miles per gallon,

949
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:35,460
which is their bottom line like do
you guys honestly think like today,

950
00:57:35,461 --> 00:57:39,990
like what your car gets like that's
honestly the best that science can do that

951
00:57:39,991 --> 00:57:43,380
is we are right up against the fucking
wall. Is that what you're telling me?

952
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,080
You know, considering if they
just even increased it by five,

953
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:51,900
10 miles a gallon per every new car,

954
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,440
that they would immediately lose
hundreds of millions of dollars.

955
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,490
Why would they do it? Why would they
do? Why would they allow that to happen?

956
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:05,020
Why wouldn't they get in the way of that?
That's all I'm asking here.

957
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,450
And you know something for all
you fucking assholes out there.

958
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:12,040
Who called me this? Whack job conspiracy
theories. These are my conspiracies.

959
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:18,110
Bankers are fucking evil.
Well,

960
00:58:18,111 --> 00:58:22,620
companies lie to you and insurance
companies are pieces of shit.

961
00:58:22,621 --> 00:58:23,850
That's basically my three.

962
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,210
And then they have enough money
to basically buy elections.
That's basically yet,

963
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,830
okay. Those really aren't
groundbreaking conspiracies are they?

964
00:58:34,831 --> 00:58:37,350
I'm not saying that some guy
living in the fucking moon.

965
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:42,960
I'm not saying I saw a fucking flying
saucer come out of the God damn emotion.

966
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,770
It fucking take a piss on somebody
sunbae then and then, you know,

967
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:52,220
I saw Ronald Reagan waving out the
side of it and then it took off.

968
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:56,330
I'm not saying that shit, I
just, I don't buy it. Okay.

969
00:58:56,331 --> 00:59:01,010
And I actually got emails from
people. Um, they sent me these,

970
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,480
these, these links, they
sent me this link of this,

971
00:59:05,481 --> 00:59:06,650
this fucking kid,

972
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:12,250
14 year old kid with one of his classmates
built this futuristic looking Jetsons

973
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,270
car and they got close to 2000
miles per gallon. I'll, I'll,

974
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:18,350
I'll send you the link to this.

975
00:59:18,351 --> 00:59:21,080
You can go on the [inaudible]
podcast and look at this thing. Mm,

976
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,510
the MM podcast.com

977
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,480
look at the picture of this thing.
Okay. And once you'd done saying, well,

978
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:28,810
it's not a practical car,
it's not as heavy as the other ones.

979
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:31,570
It would never meet the safety
standards and Yada, Yada, Yada,

980
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:35,890
all that fucking shit.
Do you honestly think that airbags,

981
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,600
navigation systems,

982
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,290
crumple zones and all that?

983
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,980
You're honestly going to tell me that
that basically knocks off 1900 miles per

984
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:47,884
gallon.

985
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,970
Are you really going to fucking sit
there and tell me that you honestly think

986
00:59:51,971 --> 00:59:54,670
that they're not?
Why wouldn't they get in the way of it?

987
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,910
They have the money to get in the way
in the way of it. And not only that,

988
00:59:57,911 --> 01:00:01,600
they're not even part of this
country in a way. They're borderless.

989
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:07,730
They're, they're worldwide.
I don't, I don't know.

990
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,830
So I decided, I, I respectfully
apologize for not fucking, uh,

991
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,040
looking up the weight of the car.
I was 100% wrong in that,

992
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:20,180
but I still do not think that I'm
wrong or I'm fucking paranoid.

993
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,500
I had one guy, this guy is fucking
hilarious. This guy was just ripping me,

994
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,930
just saying, this is classic old
man. It's like, dude, I'm 43.

995
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:32,930
Jesus Christ, this guy's going old
man. Like I'm afraid of the world.

996
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,060
I'm afraid of the fucking world I have.

997
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:41,270
I at least can sit here and tell you that
I don't believe in all that religious

998
01:00:43,221 --> 01:00:47,290
horse shit.
What if I was a scared old man?

999
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:50,140
What'd I be going to church every God
damn week when I be doing that stuff?

1000
01:00:50,141 --> 01:00:55,090
Believing in the immaculate conception.
I think you go on the ground people.

1001
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:56,860
I, you know what that's, that's my theory.

1002
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:00,820
I think when you died you go in the ground
and then you become a fossil fuel for

1003
01:01:00,821 --> 01:01:04,840
more people to fucking fight
in, in, in, in a lie about the,

1004
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:06,360
the do you know,
you know,

1005
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,950
and my actually my Prius and I've
actually thought about doing this.

1006
01:01:08,951 --> 01:01:12,690
There's people granted it
fucks over your warrant, your,

1007
01:01:12,691 --> 01:01:16,110
your warranty on your car.
They can actually get a
hundred miles per gallon bay.

1008
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:19,210
And basically what they do is they just,
uh,

1009
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,470
they just fill the ass end with
a bunch of batteries, you know?

1010
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,180
Okay.

1011
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,370
Which I'm sure those are
great for the environment.

1012
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,130
Oh, you know what it is people, I think
you know what? It comes down to the most.

1013
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:38,350
Why is my fucking throat so dry?
Hang on a second.

1014
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,730
Okay.

1015
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,980
I think it comes down to the
amount of what we do. We're fucked.

1016
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,670
But I just think that there's certain
entities that just have too much fucking

1017
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:47,504
power.

1018
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:52,990
I think when you start making $350
billion a year and you're nationwide,

1019
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:56,810
at some point some sort of government
should have some sort of power over you.

1020
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:01,860
And I don't really think
that are ours does. I don't,

1021
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,590
I don't think that they have any fucking
pile. Well, what are they going to do?

1022
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,490
They got us by the balls the
second you start giving them shit,

1023
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:12,840
they put their hand on the, on the
nozzle, the spicket good. Keep talking.

1024
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:15,270
We're goodness. We'll shut
this fucking thing off. Huh?

1025
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:17,490
Do you want to pay
$9,000 for a cantaloupe?

1026
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:23,330
Shut your face for 25 gallon. Go
Fuck Yourself. Next question. Yes.

1027
01:02:23,331 --> 01:02:27,260
This is our Marnie. MMM.
[inaudible] alright,

1028
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:31,430
plowing ahead here. I really want
you guys to look at this. Okay?

1029
01:02:31,431 --> 01:02:35,330
You guys who actually fucking do research.
Um,

1030
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,390
like here's one guy
tells me the 1987 Honda,

1031
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:41,960
CRX got 57 miles on the highway.

1032
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:44,030
Wait was 1800 pounds.

1033
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:49,120
The 2011 CRX miles per gallon is 41 on
the highway and it weighs 2,600 pounds.

1034
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:57,380
So I, I see, I see. They're
fucking argument. So right
there it's like, all right,

1035
01:02:57,381 --> 01:02:59,510
well the car was fucking 800 more pounds,

1036
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:02,360
which is a lot when the first
one only wait 1800 you almost,

1037
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:06,110
you're talking about, was
that 40% boys? 40% more?

1038
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,740
Is it getting 40% less
on the gas? No, it isn't.

1039
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:12,440
So that's actually a fucking improvement.
I will give you that.

1040
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:17,270
But the jump off point, I'm not
buying it. I'm not buying that.

1041
01:03:17,271 --> 01:03:21,680
We can only get 15 to 25 miles
a gallon in 1975 I don't buy it.

1042
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:25,100
I bet they easily could've got 200 at
that point. They're not going to do it,

1043
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,670
dude. You talking about the
blue bloods at that point?

1044
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,670
You're talking about that level
of fucking power. All right.

1045
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:35,240
My apologies to everybody out there
who actually has some sort of science

1046
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:39,080
background. Evidently people told
me that that Stan Stanley Mayer,

1047
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,730
the water power car is
junk science and it's,

1048
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:46,370
it's absolutely ridiculous as some would
even suggest that they could do that.

1049
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:51,050
Uh, so I lost on that one. So
this, so you'd, so you guys,

1050
01:03:51,051 --> 01:03:55,010
you guys want two thirds of the
argument here with me. All right.

1051
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,080
So now that you've backed
me into the corner,

1052
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:02,260
I want you to explain to me
why oil companies wouldn't
stand in the way of that

1053
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:07,421
technology and w and two fold and why
you believe that what they tell you that

1054
01:04:08,691 --> 01:04:10,670
cars get is the best that we can do.

1055
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:15,110
Why you believe that we can't
get 60 miles per gallon?

1056
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,510
Well,
you know,

1057
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:22,510
there's air airbag and other things
and satellite flying around us.
