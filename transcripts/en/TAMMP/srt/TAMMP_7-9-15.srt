1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,060
Okay.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,390
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,713
yeah,

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,160
just checking in on your hair on a
Thursday afternoon, just before Friday.

5
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:16,910
Monday morning podcast.
What's going on? How are Ya?

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,450
Don't I sound chipper today?
You know why?

7
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,490
Cause I go to the gym every day.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,460
It's just become a pop me life.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,453
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,590
Well you go to that gym every day.
You can't.

11
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,600
We really mean it.
Um,

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,810
actually I've just been eating
right and a oh Billy Bush face,

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,590
you know, read it booze bag. I haven't
drank in four days and I feel great.

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,140
You know why? Because it's the
morning when you don't drink.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,710
You feel great in the
morning when you don't drink,

16
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:56,730
you feel horrific at night.
You can hear the fucking clock ticking.

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,990
And me just trying to fall asleep.
I almost picked up a book last night.

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,350
Anything to get me to fall
asleep and I'll tell you nothing.

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,440
Nothing makes me fall asleep.
Like reading a book.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,120
I don't know how these fucking nerds do
it big and just sit there all God damn

21
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,490
day reading a book.
He's fucking idiots.

22
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:24,410
So jump on a God damn a unicycle and
they're still reading the book. Now,

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,320
unicycle a on an elliptical.
There you go. One of those,

24
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,540
one of those things where your
legs are moving but you're not.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,950
Okay.

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,150
Well, technically you are, but you're
not going anywhere. It's a metaphor.

27
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,250
Um,
life is like an elliptical machine.

28
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,370
It goes round and round. But do
you ever get anywhere? You know,

29
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,320
next thing you know there's some fucking
nerd with glasses blowing you and

30
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:50,240
you're like, you know what? I
liked this life of being a poet.

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,440
I needs an itchy sweater and let his
beard grow out and I think I got something

32
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:58,850
going on here. Um, yeah, so I
haven't drank in like four days.

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,740
I am. I'm on the wagon. All
right. I've got the Montreal
comedy festival coming up.

34
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:05,570
That's going to be a tough one.
I'm not going to lie to you.

35
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:06,590
That is going to be a tough one.

36
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,210
Being up there with all my buddies telling
a little knock knock who's there over

37
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:15,530
there and a, not drinking afterwards,
but I can get through it, you know? Um,

38
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,090
I had one cigar this week only
because I had one leftover from, um,

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,730
from my July 4th cookout that I had.
And it was so,

40
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,380
there was so fucking amazing. I
had to, uh, I had to smoke it.

41
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:31,830
I couldn't fucking throw it out.
It's,

42
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,310
I don't even know how to say the name
of this fucking thing. Let's see.

43
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,120
Okay.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,260
It looks like Hotman or h up man,
I can't tell.

45
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,900
Does it looks like there's a little dot
there. My eyes are going here. Havana,

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,270
Cuba. Um, this fucking cigar
was one of those cigars.

47
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,950
As I was lighting it, I was lighting
the thing and did the first couple of,

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,130
you know, to get it going.
And I went, oh my God.

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,390
I was by myself sitting on my
front porch and I said out loud,

50
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,710
oh my God,
to nobody.

51
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,520
You had already tasted like the
middle of the cigar on a great cigar.

52
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,450
And that was me just lighting
it. And um, I sat out there,

53
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,740
no booze actually, like
something sweet, you know,

54
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,750
with my cigar.

55
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:20,210
I'm not one of those guys and wants
to have a smokey whiskey with it.

56
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,850
It's like redundant. You're already got
smoke in your mouth and you got dad.

57
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,970
And sometimes I don't mind it,
but I like something sweet with my cigar,

58
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:30,290
which is why I usually hang out with Joe
to Rosa when I smoke. Hey, thank you.

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,030
Thank you. Thank you. There you go.
That right there. That was a singer.

60
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:36,771
Well,

61
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:41,390
my old buddy Joe Rosa Joe's
got a little sugar in his tank.

62
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,460
He can't help it.
Um,

63
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,360
anyways. Um, so anyways, uh,

64
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,110
I been working out and I already
knocked off a couple of pounds.

65
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,530
First day I had to weigh in, you
know, the big before picture,

66
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,050
I went up there like a fucking hairless
seal and albino seal. Just, I didn't even,

67
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,730
I couldn't even move
my legs at that point.

68
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:06,710
Just I just fucking went up on a scale,
you know,

69
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,800
and a one 86.6,

70
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,920
which wasn't bad because I
was pushing one 90. And uh,

71
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:16,310
I got on the scale this morning. I was
a buck 84.6. I dropped a couple pounds.

72
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,030
The first week is always easy because
your body is so used to you just be enough

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,270
such a cunt,
you know,

74
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,040
drinking whiskey while ordering cake
and all of a sudden if you just have one

75
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,060
bowl of oatmeal,

76
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,020
it's such a shock to your system that
you'll actually drop a couple pounds.

77
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,890
Unfortunately after a week
they like a bodies just like,

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,350
oh so this is the new gang,
this is the new game.

79
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,370
Because you're thinking like well shit,

80
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:43,640
I'm going to drop two pounds
every four days. I'll be,

81
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:48,530
I'll be in shape by August 1st and then
what happens to another six days goes by

82
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:51,740
and your lost like half a pound,
you know?

83
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,480
And that's when you got to man up and not
become depressed and bury your face in

84
00:04:56,481 --> 00:04:58,600
a bag of Cheetos.
So many ways.

85
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,560
So I'm just bringing all of
this shit up to you guys.

86
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,420
So you guys will be checking in on me
the way I check in on you. You know?

87
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:06,990
Yeah.

88
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,700
Cause if I get off it,
you know,

89
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:11,490
I'm going to get off it cause I won't
talk about it in more than you'd be like,

90
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:13,170
Hey, you'd have fat
face. What's the matter?

91
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,370
Joe Matters at scale going in
the wrong direction there. Um,

92
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,040
I actually did a spot at the
comedy store the other night.

93
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,990
I had a great time and I came home,

94
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:25,410
I hadn't looked at my Twitter
account a couple of days. Um,

95
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,800
and I went on there and somebody said
that they were there and they could tell I

96
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:32,910
was drinking. They said I was a
fat fuck. I'm not gonna lie to you.

97
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,060
It really hurt. And I said
it to Nia. She goes, oh,

98
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:38,880
that's me and why would they do that?
I got, you don't have to do me a favor.

99
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,720
Do me a favor.
Came from a place of love.

100
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:45,460
And even if it came from a place of hate,

101
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,900
it probably just has to do with the
fact that they don't like their dad some

102
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,360
shit or they get beaten in gym class.
I don't know what it is.

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,490
Or maybe I said something that
they don't like. Um, so anyways,

104
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,190
speaking of stand up, that was
fucking brutal. What happened?

105
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,720
Amy Schumer watching them go after her
about a joke two years and she told the

106
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:08,870
joke two fucking years ago.
How'd he tell a joke?

107
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,580
And it takes somebody two years
to get fucking offended by it.

108
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,823
You know what I mean?

109
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,210
I don't, I don't fucking understand
that. Two weeks for two fucking years.

110
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,590
It's not a fee. Why all of a
sudden is it? Oh, that's right.

111
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,010
That's right.
She has a giant movie coming out.

112
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,220
This is a critical part of her career
going from a comedian TV star to now movie

113
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:39,060
star. Like that movie's gonna. You can
see some, some of you just know like,

114
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:39,721
I don't want to jinx it,

115
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,820
but that in that movie looks like
it's going to be a smash. Right?

116
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,920
So these fucking cops, they know
that that day you go, there you go,

117
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:50,580
you got something to lose and then they
go in and they bullied you as just the

118
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:52,380
fucking worse,
you know?

119
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:53,760
Okay.

120
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,310
As just a fucking worst.
And then you get,

121
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:58,580
you got to apologize for something
you fucking said to. And then, yeah,

122
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:02,780
there's this dead shirk off in
the Washington Post is like,

123
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:06,050
and I know it's a joke, but like that
doesn't, it doesn't matter. It's like,

124
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,500
yeah it does.
It completely fucking matters.

125
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,230
It told the totally fucking matters.

126
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:19,230
Like there's no difference between
actually meaning it and joking around like

127
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,050
what world do you fucking live?

128
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:26,051
And I'm just beside myself with that
thought process and this does this

129
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:30,200
fictional power that they
think comedians have.

130
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,850
Like as if somebody walks in
to a comedy show, not racist.

131
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,810
And then they sit down and then
they hear a joke and then the like,

132
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:41,810
oh wait a minute,
now I'm racist.

133
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,150
You know, or our, or vice versa.

134
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,510
They walk in racist and then you say
something and then you have the ability to

135
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:53,490
change their fucking minds to
not be racist. If comedians
really had that power,

136
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:55,290
what we did would be fucking illegal.

137
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:56,770
Okay.

138
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,870
Because the government wouldn't
stand for it. They wouldn't have,

139
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,310
you couldn't fucking have that kind of
power can imagine if you just walked on

140
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,900
stage. And just said, Shit. And then
people just went out and did it and they,

141
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,950
and they completely changed for the
rest of their life. That's it. Hey,

142
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:10,180
you guys got to start eating right.

143
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,880
Do still do some sit ups and get yourself
a six pack and everybody in the crowd

144
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:16,120
just okay.
And gets up and does it.

145
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,950
Okay?

146
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,671
It's ridiculous.

147
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:21,670
People are going out to a comedy
club to just blow off some steam,

148
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,850
have a good time, have a couple
of drinks and laugh. All right?

149
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,770
And if you don't like a joke,
you don't like a joke,

150
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:30,160
but the comic doesn't owe you a
fucking apology. You know what I mean?

151
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,780
You just didn't like that joke.
And it is a joke despite how you took it.

152
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,340
So go fuck yourself and comedians.
Stop apologizing. Please.

153
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,480
For the love of fucking God.

154
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:44,110
Stop fucking apologizing because all
you're doing is you're just building up

155
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:48,700
these, these paper tigers. Um,
this is unreal. This is like,

156
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,940
it's like, it's like, I thought we
already went through all this Lenny Bruce,

157
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:56,020
George Carlin getting arrested. Shit
are we hadn't back towards it. Is

158
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,870
that what's going to
happen? I don't know. Um,

159
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,750
anyways, I'm thinking about the shit
that I say on this fucking podcast. Huh?

160
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,010
How come nobody ever gets offended
by this shit? You know why?

161
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:08,110
Cause I don't have a movie

162
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,983
coming out.

163
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,030
That is the genius. That is the
genius of being under the radar.

164
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,650
You're not going to get any traction
getting offended by me. You got to wait.

165
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:22,680
I got that F for fair. I'm predicting
right now thatF is for family.

166
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:23,940
When that shit comes out,

167
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,590
somebody is going to be like in a
podcast in 2010 but only if it's a hit.

168
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,660
It's a hit show. Um, fucking ridiculous.

169
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,240
It doesn't matter if it's a joke or not.

170
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,570
It doesn't matter if you were serious
or not. Oh, okay. Is that, how,

171
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:42,240
is that how the world works? A lot of
these people that complain about that,

172
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:46,200
especially the racial jokes, I,
they just reek of people that like,

173
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:50,250
you really just only hang out
with people in your culdesac

174
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,000
because anybody who has like,
like a wide variety of friends,

175
00:09:56,001 --> 00:10:00,500
this shit that we say to each other about
each other's races and nationalities

176
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,240
and it's fucking hilarious.

177
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,130
Like you totally joke a joke
around about food stereotypes,

178
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,580
all of that shit all the
fucking time these people do.

179
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,240
They just have like a list of
fucking words like gauge wire, Doral.

180
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:17,180
Good Dave lives. I'll bet. All right.
They'll shut the fuck up. We get it. Okay.

181
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,690
All right, cool. So anyways, I um,

182
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,250
I had a fucking, I had to go to
the doctor this week, right? Um,

183
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,950
he has been getting on me. I
got in in my, my leg, I got a,

184
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,010
I get this varicose vein on my calf.
It's not bugging me or anything,

185
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:37,730
but it's starting to look a little gnarly,
you know what I mean? And she goes,

186
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:39,410
why don't you have somebody to
go down and take a look at it?

187
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,570
It's like I might have somebody cut
out my fucking leg. And she goes, no,

188
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:44,450
they just inject something
in there. Fucking, you know,

189
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,320
the vein collapses and you're good. So
I go, ah, fuck it. I'll go down there.

190
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,340
So I call up these
people to one 800 number.

191
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:55,580
They got like 12 different fucking
locations around the country. I'm like,

192
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,410
it already doesn't seem reputable to me.
So I called them up and they're like,

193
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:04,010
yeah, you know, blood. And they go, what's
your name? Where do you live? And I go,

194
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,770
why do you need to know where I live?
I don't want you to know where I live.

195
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,220
I'm going down there. Well, we need to
know for the billing of insurance. I go,

196
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,180
I have shitty insurance. I don't
have good insurance. All right,

197
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,910
I know I'm going to give you my
insurance card. You're going to say,

198
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,220
we don't take that and then I'm
going to have to pay for it.

199
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,630
So I'm just going to pay cash.
Why do you need to know where I live?

200
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,640
And she goes, because that's how we,
that's part of our policy. And I go, why?

201
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,100
She goes, I just told you
why I go, no you didn't.

202
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:32,570
You just said it's part of your policy.

203
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,740
I want to know why that's part of
your policy. She just kept going.

204
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,540
I just told you why I go,
no you didn't.

205
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,190
So finally she gets her fucking
supervisor and now we need,

206
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:46,730
we need an address. So you know what
I did? I just gave him a fake address,

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,490
which is what I'm doing from now on.
Just give him a fake address.

208
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,070
Okay.

209
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,610
I gave it to him and then go down there.

210
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,950
I show up at the doctor's
office and they never said, hey,

211
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:59,640
your address didn't check out.
They didn't. So now it's great too.

212
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:02,490
I got that misinformation out there
about where I might, where I live,

213
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,770
but when they go to sell it
to some other corporation.

214
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,330
So I walk in there and you know,

215
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,440
uh, there's two, two ladies on the phone,

216
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,620
uh, one young. And what about in her
thirties? The young ones got like jeans,

217
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:23,670
like ripped jeans on and
stuff like that. And, um,

218
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,850
you know,
I walk up,

219
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:30,630
so I walk up and there's two fucking
clipboards to sign in and they're both on

220
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:34,530
the phone. So I just signed it on the one
in front of the ripped jeans go, right?

221
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,620
So I go and I sit down and
she gets off the phone,

222
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:41,400
she looks at me and then she goes with
their index finger, like, come here.

223
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,500
You know what I mean? And I
stand up and then I'm like, wait,

224
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,580
did she use summons me over like a fucking
toddler? And I walk up and she goes,

225
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,650
do you have an appointment?
And I'm like, yeah. She goes,
what's your name? I'm like,

226
00:12:55,651 --> 00:13:00,300
William Barr. She goes, Oh, you must
be at the other office. And she,

227
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,750
and she points to the lady next to me.
She goes, we're two separate offices.

228
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,280
And I go, all right. So
then I talked to the,

229
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,870
the 35 year old chick and meanwhile this,
this,

230
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,030
the young girl gets on the
phone, she picks up, she's like,

231
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:18,030
where the hell are you
guys? God, I'm starving.

232
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,310
Are you going there right now?

233
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,060
I'm going to kick your ass like
this isn't like a medical office.

234
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,250
So they tell me to fill out the whole
form. I start filling out the form,

235
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:32,820
then they go, we need to see your driver's
license. I go for what? They go, well,

236
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,650
we need to make a copy of it. I go, no,

237
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:39,390
you're not making a copy of my driver's
license. You can look at it. Here it is.

238
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,740
Here's my face. But you're not, you're not
taking, you're not making a copy of it.

239
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,930
And just, she goes, well that's
what we do. I go, what do you,

240
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:48,600
and what do you do with the copy? And
she goes, it stays here in the office.

241
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:49,980
I said, yeah, I'm not doing that.

242
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,280
Okay.

243
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,100
And I go, why do you need a copy? I
don't understand why. So she goes,

244
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,620
let me check with my manager and she can,
you know,

245
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,070
and then she comes back and said, yeah,
we need a copy of your driver's license.

246
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,030
You never needed this shit beforehand.
By the way, all these fucking, uh,

247
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,360
slowly moving us towards
micro chips are everywhere.

248
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:11,170
I go in and see your papers please. And
everybody's got to know fucking, you know,

249
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,360
like give you my driver's license,

250
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,720
my fucking driver's license number
on it and shit, go fuck yourself.

251
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,350
Yeah.

252
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,240
Fucking a steer in a strip mall.

253
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,530
I'm not giving you a fucking copy of my
driver's license. So anyway, she says,

254
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,240
yeah, I just talked to my boss. He says,

255
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,960
we need a copy of your driver's license.

256
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,480
So I go, why? And then the, the
little fucking half a cutie pie,

257
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:38,270
they're fucking chimes in.
She goes,

258
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:41,540
cause it Blahblahblahblahblah and I just
look at her and go, you don't work here.

259
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,160
She put her head down and mumbled
something. It just fucking made my day.

260
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,980
There's nothing than one is six thinks
she's a 10 she was such a fucking dope.

261
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,860
I'm not going to lie to you.
She was cute,

262
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,610
but she thought she was the
fucking shit and she wasn't.

263
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,860
There's just the way she was talking
on the phone, how she was like,

264
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:08,220
so over the fucking job.
It's like you're a fucking dope.

265
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,840
You're a fucking dope. I don't know who
you know that gave you this fucking job,

266
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,310
but I've been in for six minutes and
you suck at it. You fucking suck at it.

267
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:21,120
So anyways, so I got all, I'd say you
need a cop. My driver's license. I go,

268
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,230
I find to go give me the clipboard.
So I,

269
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,630
I take the clipboard with
all the information I wrote
down and I just fucking

270
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:29,280
folded it up and I just walked out.

271
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,870
I should've said no dirty looks cause
I know that fucking little Twat was

272
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:38,230
probably given me a dirty look.
But that's the fucking, you know,

273
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,061
sitting here having this,

274
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:44,930
this fucking dope Curson into the God
damn telephone and then I'm going to be,

275
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,510
I'm comfortable with you
injecting something into my body.

276
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:50,210
Can't the fuck outta here it,
the whole thing just felt shady.

277
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,220
You know when I first got there,

278
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,040
there was this fucking guy
from like Transylvania came,

279
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,820
he came out with just like a tee
shirt on and I'm looking like,

280
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:03,410
is this fucking guy? Is this the doctor
that this guy just fix the radiator?

281
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,970
Then I found out he was a fucking
patient. And, uh, I dunno,

282
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,070
just still his whole vibe.

283
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,360
It looked like they were back
there doing experiments on them.

284
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,100
I just didn't like it. And you know, it
was, it was next, it was in this one.

285
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,960
I was fucking strip malls where it's like,
hey varicose veins,

286
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,330
you want your taxes done.
You know,

287
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:24,740
and then some Asian thing
that makes noodles, it's like,

288
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:28,130
I'm gonna have something medical procedure
here. I'm not doing this shit. So, uh,

289
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,770
my, you know what my gut was screaming at
me the second I walked in there, but, um,

290
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,770
I dunno.
I Dunno.

291
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:40,690
I fucking was laughing the whole
way out to my truck that go,

292
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,180
Eh, it's because of blah, blah, blah.
I'm like, Hey, you don't work here.

293
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,740
She had to put her head down and then
she mumbled something trying to pull

294
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:51,520
victory out of that fucking
devastating defeat. Who's kidding? Who,

295
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:54,540
it wasn't devastating to her.
He's probably wind development.

296
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,440
Somebody bought her a new iPhone,
you know,

297
00:16:56,441 --> 00:17:00,670
cause they think that they're going
to fuck her, you know. Anyways,

298
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
I was actually telling a buddy
of mine that he was going, man,

299
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:04,300
I hope my daughter doesn't
end up like that. And I said,

300
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:06,010
now you already would have sought,
she's three years old.

301
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:08,500
You can tell if a kid's going to be a
dope or not by the time they're three,

302
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,330
you know,
I'm not saying you can't,

303
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:11,660
you can't tell if they're
going to be on drugs.

304
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,210
So make a bad choice in that teens.

305
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:18,190
But you can tell whether or not you
actually got somebody who got the a brain.

306
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,850
You know, and I'm not talking fucking
Einstein, I'm just saying like, you know,

307
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,910
they're on point, they're talking
to you, they're locked in,

308
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,380
you're giving them information,
they're processing it, you know,

309
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,360
and then he got to be brave.
Those almost smart people,

310
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,920
they're the funniest people because they
on some way they kind of know that dumb,

311
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,770
you know, cause straight up dumb
people don't know that dumb.

312
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,420
They just always think that
they're getting fucked,

313
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,370
which is why they have that
dumb look on their face.

314
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,680
That's why their jaws always hanging open
and their brows kind of furrowed cause

315
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:53,100
they can't figure out what
the fuck happened. You know?

316
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,080
But somebody gets to be brain.

317
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,710
They actually know that they're kind
of dumb and you see them catching

318
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,750
themselves and they'd look
around the table like, wow,

319
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:02,010
did anybody just catch that?

320
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,240
And there's an intelligence in that and
that's why I grade them as a B right at

321
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,190
right now you guys should
be sitting there going pill.

322
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,540
We obviously know that you actually are
so fucking arrogant that you think that

323
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,230
you got the a brain,
which right there immediately knock,

324
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:15,540
shoot down to at least a B.

325
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,450
Because anybody who's truly
intelligent doesn't think they are.

326
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,000
They think they're a fucking moron. I
was got lost in all of that. Anyways,

327
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,470
speaking of being a fucking moron,

328
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,430
did you see what Jason Pierre Paul did?
And God knows,

329
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:33,520
I know even with nine fingers, this
guy could still throw me over my house,

330
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:36,250
but what? What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?

331
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,030
What will you lighten off
that blew off your finger?

332
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,190
I don't understand people that like
it's the 4th of July. I get it.

333
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:50,540
A couple of bottle rockets have
a Roman candle fight, you know,

334
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:55,220
put on some goggles. I get it a little
grab ass with some fireworks who gives us,

335
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,510
but these people who like fucking
go to like military grade shit.

336
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,020
You know what I mean?

337
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,390
What the fuck did you light off

338
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,350
that you made the decision that you
know what, just amputate my finger.

339
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,580
I got to get back out on the field now.
My God,

340
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,470
that's a bad finger to fucking lose to.

341
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,850
That's second in command to the thumb.

342
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,450
Like the thumbs, the headliner,
the index finger, right.

343
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,160
That's the feature act.

344
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,070
Okay.

345
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:33,060
I'd say the Middle Finger is the host
and then your ring finger and you're a

346
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,990
pinky or doing guest spots.
Right. They're not getting paid.

347
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,770
They're doing guest spots. Right. Um,

348
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,390
anyways, so he blew off.
There's no feature act anymore.

349
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,970
So now he basically has like a,

350
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,280
like a lobster claw in our lobster
cloud would be if they were all fucking

351
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,050
together.
I don't know man.

352
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,130
But all I know is he had three options
with the finger and one of them was

353
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:03,510
amputated. And uh, I mean,
hey, I like playing football.

354
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,540
I liked when I was a kid, but you
know, I like playing drums too,

355
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,960
but I would never hit, I'd be like, you
know what, why don't we wait a minute?

356
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,900
So this fucking thing on,
you know,

357
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:16,380
see how it goes before I just
said, you know what? Fuck it.

358
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,660
Yeah,

359
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,160
no, it's gotta be funny as his custom
gloves they have to make during the winter

360
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,540
time, those four fingered once he's got
like a Bart Simpson and now you know,

361
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,330
cause animation, they always
had those things. I don't know.

362
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:31,430
Why am I joking about
something so horrific? I just,

363
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:34,400
you know what it is just because he
just made the decision to say fuck it.

364
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,840
Just cut the fucking thing off the,

365
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:38,600
granted it has like most people
when it comes to this story,

366
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:42,440
I have absolutely no information
other than, you know,

367
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,400
somebody texted me and said Jpp
had his index finger amputated.

368
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,083
Um,

369
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,540
okay.

370
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,373
I Dunno.

371
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,470
All I know is that every NFL contract
from here on out now has that word.

372
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,450
It's somewhere in there.
If they didn't already,

373
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,900
I know you're not allowed
to ride a motorcycle.

374
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,850
I don't think fly a private fly yourself
to get a pilot's license or something.

375
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:10,150
You're not allowed to do any of that shit.
Probably you have to Larry Bird.

376
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,010
If it taller than six,
six,

377
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:16,330
you're not allowed to blacktop
your parents fucking driveway. Um,

378
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,850
I dunno. What the fuck. You know
what's funny about the giants?

379
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:26,440
They can beat the fucking patriots,
but Jesus Christ, they give,

380
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:31,060
they can't get to a fucking off season
without just somebody doing something.

381
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:34,270
Right. I was just talking to [inaudible]
about that. He goes, Jesus Christ,

382
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:37,180
you know, the fucking shooting
themselves in the legs.

383
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:41,110
Fucking cut in their face off.
But I'll tell you when it cops,

384
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:44,440
they beat them patriots.
Eh, uh, you know what?

385
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,260
I don't give a shit because we want our
fourth and I'll take four out of six.

386
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:50,440
I'll take two losses to the giants
for four or six. And speaking of that,

387
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,800
speaking of giants fans,

388
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,930
I'm doing Rappaport's.

389
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,990
I am Rappaport's podcast tomorrow and I'm
expecting that's sad sack New York fan

390
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:07,510
to come strong with the giants shit talk,
which should be great. It's like, yeah,

391
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:11,920
but then we want another one, Michael,
that we want another one. We've won four.

392
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,170
Okay.

393
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,710
Since 2000 since February of
2002 we've won four super bowls.

394
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,290
We have won the most super bowls
out of any team in the NFL.

395
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,030
So I will take those to crushing
losses to the giants to win four.

396
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,160
I will make that trade
any day of the week.

397
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:32,390
And then to add three world series Stanley
Cup and an NBA championship doing all

398
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,100
Anna for soccer championship to evidently,

399
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,700
what do we the Boston fucking tea parties.
I don't know what the hell we are.

400
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,940
The liberty.
Oh that's a fucking WNB 18 I have no idea.

401
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,073
Right.

402
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,440
Okay.

403
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,290
We, we one in five different sports. Ah.

404
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,160
I mean I'm gonna hit him with the
same shit. She'd be like, Michael,

405
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,570
you have 10 teams in New York City.

406
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:57,190
You guys cannot find in any combination
attended when all four in 10 years.

407
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:00,550
You just have not been able to do it ever.
It's fucking pathetic.

408
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:05,500
How many teams do you need to
stay in step with title town,

409
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,910
Boston, Massachusetts.
Um, that right there,

410
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,500
that's a one sided.
That's a one sided. Uh,

411
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,390
okay.

412
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,990
Idea of what the fuck that they're going
to then I'm going to be talking about

413
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,850
on his podcast.
I'm also been playing a bunch of drums.

414
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,620
I'm getting ready for a,

415
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:27,590
I'm doing the Goddamn comedy jam
up the Montreal Comedy Festival.

416
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:32,330
I'm going to be doing it three nights
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Um,

417
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,380
I think the 20th,

418
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:37,880
21st and 23rd I'll be doing it.

419
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:42,380
And so I've been playing a lot of drums
and uh, just having a fucking great time.

420
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,640
Just a great time. I could basically,
man, I have my summer, you know,

421
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,270
after all the traveling I
did crisscross in the land.

422
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,290
I got like the summer off from what I'm
trying to do is not fill up every day

423
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:59,240
with activities. Uh, cause
that's what I ended up doing.

424
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,720
And then it ends up being
unbelievably stressful. I
mean, I don't have it off off.

425
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,920
I get a fucking punch up.

426
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,770
All these episodes of F is for family
and I got to tell you to do it.

427
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:07,604
It's coming together.

428
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,680
It's coming together and I've been
watching a lot of animation, Lotta Gotcha.

429
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,780
Bob's burgers. Um, what else did I watch?

430
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,890
Those chickens that smoke weed.
Um,

431
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,600
and I'm not even listening to the jokes.
I'm looking at the movements because,

432
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:26,850
you know,

433
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,110
they always give you the lowest fucking
budget ever when it comes to animation.

434
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:35,030
So I'm trying to fucking, uh, see
how with the limited movement,

435
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,810
like on Archer, if you look at it, they
really don't move that much, but you know,

436
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:43,370
they just have the eyebrows going up,
coming down. I squinting, you know,

437
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:48,350
and an occasional fucking hand
movement. Um, so I'll be doing that,

438
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,910
but still that will feel like a vacation
as opposed to fucking flying all around.

439
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,350
Oh, by the way, did you guys
check out rolling stone this, uh,

440
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:59,990
this week or whatever?
Um,

441
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,440
Kim Kardashians tits and Kim
Kardashians are on the cover and a,

442
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,000
they got an article in there about
this guy who all he does is fly around.

443
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,190
That's all he does. He has
not had a home. I don't know.

444
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,001
I don't even get it.

445
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:19,001
He's been in the air since August in the
air or at an airport waiting to connect

446
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,910
since April of last year.
You know,

447
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:26,030
he'll still spend the night at like a
five star hotel and then go right back to

448
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:27,950
the airport. And, uh,

449
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:32,360
he's sitting there saying how like
he learned how to work the system.

450
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,970
There's all these ins and outs
and all that type of stuff.

451
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:37,790
It's a really fascinating story because
immediately I'm like going like, dude,

452
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,480
who's getting fucked in this deal?
You're not really living a life.

453
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,170
But he turned it into a business where
everybody gets advice from him now and

454
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:49,820
now he's allegedly a millionaire.
So I think that sacrifice,
he was able to do it,

455
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:54,020
but it's a really, um, really interesting.

456
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,180
I just don't understand it.
Like this fucking guy,

457
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,360
like he set the record crossing the
Pacific Ocean like six times in like,

458
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:07,040
I don't know how many days that can't
be healthy, cannot be fucking healthy.

459
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:12,560
But you know, he flies like, you know
those double decker, uh, air buses,

460
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,611
they have this,

461
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:16,430
this thing where you get your own
apartment on one of them and one of the

462
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:18,860
Singapore Airlines was the first one that,
that had it.

463
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,120
And the ticket is $15,000 and
this dude has so many miles.

464
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:28,010
He gets it by himself and he's sitting
there acting like he's winning.

465
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:29,000
But it's just like,
dude,

466
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,670
but you just lit even
that's cool in the air.

467
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,850
But if you had that as an apartment,
you'd be like, this fucking sucks.

468
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:38,960
I can't even breathe in here.

469
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,900
Not to mention there's a camera
on me at all fucking times,

470
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,170
making sure I don't one out of
fucks something in this bed. Right?

471
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,330
If you had that on the ground,
you'd be like, this is fucked up.

472
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,920
You have it in the air.
You think this is the shit.

473
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:52,560
But if all you're doing is living
in the air, like I don't know,

474
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,950
but in the end if he was a millionaire
and he enjoyed it, I don't know,

475
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,700
check out the article.
It's really a really fucking interesting.

476
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,790
So we're winding down here on the podcast.
Uh,

477
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,300
I need you guys to help
me out if you could.

478
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,260
I'm looking for a car and a Craiglist
seems to be the best way to do it.

479
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,050
Um, I've pretty much
checked all of California.

480
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm looking for a 65 or 66 Ford galaxy
in Wimbledon white and all I'm looking

481
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:29,760
for, uh, is that it has a straight body,

482
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,680
not all rusted out,
none of that shit.

483
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,980
The body's straight and
the interior is solid,

484
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,100
doesn't even have to be meant as long
as it's solid. It looks like, you know,

485
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:43,101
most everything is there and then either
no engine or a non original engine,

486
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:46,980
cause I just can't get myself to take
the original numbers matching engine out

487
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:51,750
of a car. I just can't fucking do
it. Um, that's what I'm looking for.

488
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,140
I thought you could do a
nationwide search on, um,

489
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,460
on craigslist, but you can't,
you got to go state by state.

490
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:04,020
So if you live in a state,
check it out. Um, you know,
if he got time, if you don't,

491
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:07,890
I understand. But that's what I'm
looking for and just tweet at me.

492
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:10,840
Send me the links if you find one.
Um,

493
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,370
cause that's what I'm looking for.
I've got my truck back in, you know,

494
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:16,290
like I said, they, they
rebuilt the whole engine,

495
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,210
painted the thing that Ford blue and
it's running like a top and the power

496
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:25,590
steering just came in and then waiting
on the air conditioning and the slap that

497
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:29,220
fucking thing on. And uh,
that's gonna be my daily driver.

498
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,470
I've been driving it all over the place.
I absolutely fucking love that truck.

499
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:39,450
And uh, and only want to do is just
get a 65 Ford galaxy and you know,

500
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,711
Redo that thing.

501
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:45,540
What I want to do is I want to have the
underneath be 2015 and then up top in

502
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:49,950
1965 and just be able to drive that
thing across country if I wanted to.

503
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,630
Um, cause I only got three gears in my
truck. I mean I could've switched it out,

504
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,260
made it an automatic or even
just had a five speed put in,

505
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,110
but I just feel like shifted
on the columns to fucking cool.

506
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:04,320
So when I get on the highway I just
drive it like a granny and when the first

507
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:07,260
lane going like 50 miles an hour
build, no one gives a fuck. Well I do,

508
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,240
I give a fuck. So anyways, um,

509
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,010
I'm still waiting for the advertising
to come in here. Huh? What am I up to?

510
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:16,920
29 minutes. That's it. That's
my little fucking half hour.

511
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,750
My little 30 minutes here with the
Oh, he is the reeds. They came in.

512
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,370
It came in.

513
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:27,270
What do we got you one is a physio funnies
part of the podcast where I fucking

514
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:31,890
read out loud. All right.
Blue Apron. It's okay.

515
00:29:31,891 --> 00:29:33,210
You can admit it.
Everybody.

516
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,290
The last thing anyone wants to do after
work is waiting in line at the grocery

517
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:41,190
store,
Schlep home and cook a complicated meal.

518
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,950
Uh, and expensive, unhealthy
takeout is hardly better.

519
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,010
That's where the new
service blue apron comes in.

520
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,170
Blue Apron delivers farm fresh ingredients
and step by step recipes to your home,

521
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:55,910
allowing you to create healthy,

522
00:29:55,911 --> 00:30:00,130
handcrafted meals at home without
going to the grocery store. Uh,

523
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,250
for less than $10 per meal.
Blue Apron sends you fresh ingredients,

524
00:30:04,251 --> 00:30:08,270
perfectly proportioned, making, cooking
healthy meals, really easy and fun.

525
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,930
No trips to the grocery store and
no waste from unused ingredients.

526
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,110
Plus you're learning to cook with special
ingredients that are normally hard to

527
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:18,050
find. Blue Apron is the perf
is perfect for date night,

528
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,720
not if she hears this copy,

529
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:26,450
you spend $8 on me and you already
got her home. Guys, this is the shit.

530
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,040
Don't tell the ladies a blue
apron is perfect for a day.

531
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:34,520
Cooking with friends and they even
offer a family plans with kid friendly

532
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:38,690
ingredients so the whole family can eat
well and have fun preparing the meals

533
00:30:38,691 --> 00:30:43,430
together. Each balance meal is 500 to 700
calories. Jesus Christ, I could use this,

534
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,620
um, per serving and so tasty. You'd
never know. That's a red flag.

535
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,510
How is it 500 to 700 calories and
it's so tasty. How is it so tasty?

536
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,830
You're loading it up with sugar and salt.
I'm cooking takes half an hour.

537
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,300
Shipping is flexible and free and
the menus are always news. News, new.

538
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,790
They won't send the same meal twice.
What the,

539
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,030
they must in the same meal twice.
So if I do a 30 days in a fucking row,

540
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,730
what am I eating at that point?
And um,

541
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,540
they work around your schedule and dietary
preferences and blue aprons experts

542
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,120
source only the best seasonal ingredients
for incredible meals like chicken with

543
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:26,170
lemon sugar, snap peas,
men and Chai potatoes.

544
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:31,060
I hate saying the names of food. Potatoes
with Spring onion, hash in Indian,

545
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:36,061
curried Zucchini with lentil salad
and Cherry town Chutney Chutney.

546
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,260
I don't know what it is.
What am I here?

547
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:40,840
The waitress or the waiter start
saying the specials. It's like,

548
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:42,610
will you stop fucking saying that shit?

549
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,720
We'd heavy Asian infused. Just
don't get me some chicken. Uh,

550
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,950
you'll cook incredible meals and be blown
away by the quality and freshness of

551
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,250
Blue Apron. It's a better
way to cook. Check it out.

552
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,510
Check out this week's menu and get your
first two meals for free. Oh my God.

553
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,410
You're like a broad here.

554
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:02,950
You're getting a couple of free meals and
you don't have to do anything by going

555
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:07,690
to blue apron.com/bar my treat. It's
not my treat. It's their treat. Really.

556
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:09,790
The first two meals are on blue apron.

557
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:13,660
When you go to blue
apron.com/burr waiting,

558
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:17,970
there's no obligations.
Oh my God. Hey guys,

559
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:20,820
you want to feel like a woman dating.
Why did you for a couple of days,

560
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,680
couple of meals. Here you go. Um,
except nothing tries to fuck you.

561
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,650
So that's the rub. So on a lot of
ways, don't they deserve a free meal?

562
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,300
I think that was progressive. Alright,
draft draftkings everybody. Uh,

563

578
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:24,050
last year we won $1 million

579
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,120

I have no idea.

616
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:55,220
I remember back in the day when I did
the OPN Anthony show on XM satellite

617
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,173
radio,

618
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,030
they used to have a bunch of truckers
that listens. All right? So anyways,

619
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,400
that is the podcast.

blow your fingers off, you know,

622
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,860
and uh, whatever the fuck else I said.
All right. That's it in. And they,

623
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:17,251
here's a,

624
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:20,580
here's some throwback shit from back in
the day on the Monday morning podcast.

625
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:23,720
As always, thank you for listening and
you have a wonderful weekend. You come.

626
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,473
Okay,

627
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,413
good.

628
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,703
Okay.

629
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,840
Yeah.
Recently

630
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,260
I had to return some items at the mall.
Uh,

631
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,670
was the day after Christmas and I
was with a girl, I was dating, uh,

632
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,620
with the girl that I was dating.
She wants to return some shoes.

633
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,190
So we went to the journey
store with his shoes were,

634
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:06,630
but uh, when she got to the
counter to return the shoes,

635
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:10,770
the girl behind the counter asked
her for her name, address, email,

636
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:14,040
and phone number.
Oh my God.

637
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,800
The amount of fucking people who
actually give out that information.

638
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,510
My girlfriend just gave the information
over. As soon as the girl asked for it,

639
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,340
we were leaving the store.

640
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,460
I remark that I thought it was bullshit
that she had to give away personal

641
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:31,290
information to return a pair of shoes.
She said, uh, it was not a big deal,

642
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,630
but I didn't like it.
All right.

643
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,340
Why the fuck would you give somebody
all that information and just in case

644
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:41,760
you're new to my podcast,
just say you can say no.

645
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,513
Okay.

646
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,320
Can I, you know, I, I go out to buy shit
all time. Could I have your phone number?

647
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,303
No.

648
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,973
Okay.

649
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,380
I don't even say,
I don't even try and make it nice.

650
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:53,720
I just say no and then they go, oh, okay.

651
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,720
Yeah.

652
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,900
Know why do you feel like you got
to give them their information?

653
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,900
You're trying to buy something.
I'm sorry I can't,

654
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:04,350
I can't show you this unless I get your
information. Well, they go fuck yourself.

655
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,490
I'll buy it somewhere else. I
don't even need it. Anyways.

656
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,210
So anyways, he goes, next
we go to American Eagle.

657
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,530
You guys hit all the hot spot,
Huh? Then we went to Cinnabon.

658
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,030
Next we went to American Eagle where I
had to return his shirt. That was a gift.

659
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,570
It was a long line for returns.
Why did you return the shirt?

660
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,850
Did it not fit or was it ugly as hell or
was it both? As I was waiting in line,

661
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:33,390
one of the employees comes up to me
with a clipboard with the little form to

662
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:37,400
fill up. Now is anybody else kind of
getting the prison camp vibe here?

663
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:38,923
You know,

664
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,670
they're standing in line to get processed
and there's a guy coming up on the,

665
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,730
is your name please?
Your phone number? Um,

666
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,470
I stopped the employee.
Uh,

667
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,560
I stopped the employee and asked her
why she needed this information and she

668
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:58,490
says that it was to verify my purchase.
How fucking dumb our people.

669
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,870
You're gonna verify my purchase. Well,
here's the sales slips there, sweetheart.

670
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,580
This verifies it.

671
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,210
Yeah,

672
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,630
that's it. I don't know what to tell
you. Why don't you and your clipboard?

673
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,780
Why don't you hold that clipboard between
your little fucking beef curtains and

674
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:16,920
take a fucking walk down the street? How
about that as sweetheart, it's there.

675
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,760
This their reasons. You use that type
of language. Go Fuck Yourself. Huh?

676
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:26,560
How about I fucking grab that ponytail and
just, no, let's, let's, let's let, let,

677
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:29,230
let's keep it clean this week,
shall we? People anyways, she,

678
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,480
he goes before I could protest further,

679
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,420
she said that I could
just put my name on it.

680
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,640
Oh,
on the clipboard.

681
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,380
Okay.

682
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,890
When she walked away, I pulled
out the gift receipt has
said to my girlfriend, oh,

683
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:46,800
here it is. Yeah. This is what
verifies my purchase. Exactly.

684
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,050
The clipboard employee wasn't as
far as way as I thought she was in.

685
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:55,020
Heard me say,
did I read that wrong?

686
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:57,510
Get heard me say it's heard me say this,

687
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,070
and she began to explain further why
I needed to give over the information.

688
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,450
This is the part of the email I hate.
He goes, I apologized and told her.

689
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:10,590
I realized it wasn't her and that it was
just her company's policy that she was

690
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,770
enforcing. She walked
away again. I felt bad.

691
00:40:13,771 --> 00:40:15,930
So the next time I saw
her I apologized and said,

692
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:18,450
I realized that she was just
doing her job, but she ignored me.

693
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,900
She was probably pissed because it was
the day after Christmas and I was causing

694
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:26,370
your grief, but you could at least
accept my apology. You Bitch. Um,

695
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,420
I love how you go from being
totally liberal and seeing
somebody fucking side of

696
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:34,230
it too, being yeah, man
up you can't. Um, anyway,

697
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:37,590
I got up to the counter and there
wasn't any further problems.

698
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:41,040
The guy at the register just took my
name and didn't ask me for anything.

699
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:44,280
I felt as though I had a small
victory against the big corporations.

700
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,270
Then this week I had to go back to the
store to return a hat. My girlfriend, God,

701
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,920
did you guys not make Christmas
lists or all your relatives blind?

702
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:56,010
The seems to be a lot of,
uh, returning of gifts.

703
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,110
Okay.

704
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,260
This is hilarious. You are returning a
hat that your girlfriend got you dude.

705
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:05,610
How horrific was that hat? Can you
please send me a picture of it before I,

706
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:09,710
if you took one before you returned
it. Picture one of those, uh,

707
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,860
plaid Charlie Chaplin Hat. Um,
I had the receipt, but again,

708
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:17,400
the girl at the register asked me
for my address and phone number.

709
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,210
I said I didn't want to
give that information to her
immediately panic sets in

710
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:23,820
and her face and she says that I have to,

711
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,350
I said that I didn't have to the day
after Christmas and I wasn't going to now,

712
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,213
good for you.

713
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,130
She calls over a coworker and they both
get defensive and hold to the idea that

714
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:37,940
I have to give over my information
in order to return a stupid hat.

715
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,200
Even though I had my receipt,
I asked why and they let me slide.

716
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,470
Why the let me slide on this before
and they maintained that I had,

717
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,050
I had to give them my name,
address and phone number.

718
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,530
Okay.

719
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,200
So what did I do in the face
of corporate opposition?

720
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:57,340
I caved and I gave it to him.
You fucking pussy.

721
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,890
Okay,

722
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,860
dude. The second you saw
the panic on their face,

723
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:08,590
you knew that they were going
to lose. All right. He goes,

724
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:12,490
I just don't get it, Bill. Why is a
receipt not enough? Nowadays it is enough.

725
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,960
They say they need our
personal information to verify
purchase then not, dude,

726
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,610
they're not. All right. All of that shit.

727
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:25,340
All those little save you know you
want to get when our discount store,

728
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:30,070
they're creating a file on you.
They figure out what you want to buy,

729
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:31,450
what they can market towards you,

730
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:35,320
and then they take that information and
they sell it to other fucking companies.

731
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:38,260
Even though they say they're not going to.
They sell your information.

732
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,920
Your information gets up on the Internet
and that's why there's all these creepy

733
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:46,060
websites out there right now that have
all this fucking information about you,

734
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:50,230
about, you know how many siblings you
have, your brothers and sisters names.

735
00:42:50,231 --> 00:42:53,230
They all use that information to
fucking, it's, I'm telling you

736
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,930
this,
don't give him your information.

737
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,490
You don't have to give him your
information and people out there

738
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,270
who just have this fucking attitude
towards these corporations just sitting

739
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:11,150
there going like, wait,
what are they going to be?

740
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:12,890
As long as you're not doing
anything wrong. I mean,

741
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,470
what do I care if they know where I live?

742
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,710
What do I keep this fucking morons?

743
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,290
I don't even,

744
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,770
I have explained this shit till I'm blue
in the face and then I always get these

745
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:29,650
emails from these people. Um,
he just, I don't have the,

746
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,510
I don't know. I can't, if I said
something the other day, you know,

747
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:33,860
I was sitting there listening.
I was sitting there,

748
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,250
I was listening to a sports radio, you
know, cause I'm a deep thinker, right?

749
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,310
And uh,
this,

750
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:45,311
this new guy got on sports radio out
here in Los Angeles and you know,

751
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:51,400
he does what most people do when they
have nothing to say, which is they,

752
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,940
they just start,
they just go over the top arrogant.

753
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,420
You know what I mean? Like he was
talking about how he wanted to get some,

754
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:03,290
some sort of sports culture
personality on the show,

755
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,560
but he doubted he could get them as
a guest because the guest hated him.

756
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,530
And he goes, you know, cause I
disagreed with them on some he, yeah,

757
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,800
he was talking to a coach and he
was actually disagreeing with the,

758
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,060
with the fucking coach.
He's disagreeing with the guy and he goes,

759
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:18,940
you know what the problem is,
you know, he goes, look, I'm,

760
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,720
I'm just like such a good debater.

761
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:24,720
I actually ended up like convincing
myself of my own opinion. Yeah.

762
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:26,180
She said that over the airwaves.

763
00:44:26,181 --> 00:44:31,181
And I just sort of muttered to myself
that the confidence of morons is

764
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:34,350
staggering.
You know what I mean?

765
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,840
Morons think they know everything. That's,
that's what makes them fucking morons.

766
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,320
And like the emails I get with
people who don't question the shit,

767
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,130
um, which is, I dunno,
like last week when I,

768
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,840
when I went off on my
little fucking rant there,

769
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:56,550
just some of the fucking emails I get,
it's like people are sending me Shit.

770
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:58,320
That kinda is backing up what I'm saying.

771
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,650
And then telling me that it sounded
like I have tin foil on my fucking head,

772
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,660
which obviously I am out of my
fucking mind on some level, but, um,

773
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,330
I'm not out of my mind when I don't
trust corporations and I don't trust them

774
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,960
when they say we're not going to
do anything with this information.

775
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:16,410
The other day I was in cvs and I go to
buy something and the lady asked me,

776
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:21,330
did I have a safe card? And I said, no.
She said, do you want one? And I said,

777
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:24,570
no. And she goes, well,
that's okay. I'll just,

778
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:28,680
and she swiped the fucking thing
anyways. And I was like, lady,

779
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:31,920
what did I just say to you?
Let's see if I use my credit card,

780
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:37,070
they'd have my name and then to match
up to that fucking number and what the

781
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:38,070
hell I just bought.

782
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,360
And just a little bit more information
about me and my question to all you

783
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:47,100
people who have this faith
in these corporations,

784
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,530
why does that person do that?

785
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,590
Why are they so hell bent on trying to
make that corporation less money in that

786
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:56,664
moment?

787
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:57,830
Okay.

788
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,090
They give me this card.

789
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,770
You know like everybody has those cards
so you're not saving any fucking money.

790
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,080
It's just, it's a big fucking shell
game to make it seem, oh look,

791
00:46:09,081 --> 00:46:09,980
he's saving money.

792
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:13,700
What they're really doing did they look
at this hand over here is you're giving

793
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:18,701
them all your personal fucking information
that they can then use to to very

794
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:24,761
least sell to other corporations to
increase junk mail and it also to a limit

795
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,620
you're fucking level of privacy.

796
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,740
The fact that they can put all that
shit up in the Goddamn Internet.

797
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,270
People have been sending me these random
websites where they have like your name

798
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:40,220
and your address, where you fucking live
and all this type of shit. It's like,

799
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,440
how do you think that they
get all that information?

800
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,480
Okay.

801
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,720
Do you think there's somebody sitting
there with the phone book and just typing

802
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,590
all of this shit in? I don't
know. I have fuck it though.

803
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:53,560
Okay.

804
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,060
If some of us were, kills me. If
some fucking random creepy guy,

805
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,950
you know, you standing there waiting
for the subway came up to you,

806
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,540
asked you what's your name,
your phone number and your address was,

807
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:08,650
would you give it to them?

808
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:10,930
Yeah.

809
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:11,763
No,

810
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,120
but for some reason you're inside of
a fucking store and there's socks and

811
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:20,170
sweaters and somebody has a name
tag. Now all of a sudden you, you,

812
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:24,580
you give him total fucking trust.
You're writing your mind. So sir,

813
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:29,090
don't cave in. All right. All you get,

814
00:47:29,091 --> 00:47:34,020
you just say that's unacceptable.
That's unacceptable.

815
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,070
I want to speak to the manager what
they're doing. It's not legal yet.

816
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,570
It's not legal yet,

817
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:45,571
but I can guarantee you there's somebody
lobbying for it that in Washington

818
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,430
there's some sort of fucking
high powered lobbying group.

819
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:51,850
I swear to God is probably
lobbying that from here on out.

820
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,660
We need to have a law that if
you're going to return a hat,

821
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,550
you have to give us your name,
your address,

822
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:02,551
and your social security number just so
there's not another nine 11 could guaran

823
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:05,530
fucking tee it. So
yeah, you don't have to.

824
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,280
Yeah.

825
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,570
That's actually one of the highlights of
my day. What I do now is when they say,

826
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:14,360
do you have our little savings
save card? And I say, no, I don't.

827
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:19,430
Would you like one? No, I don't. I then
say, and please don't swipe another one.

828
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,413
You know,

829
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,520
and then I try to pay with cash. I
love cash. Cash is fucking anonymous.

830
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,390
All you guys out there who was sitting
there watching these commercials where

831
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:33,270
they make it look like credit
cards is so fucking easy.

832
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:34,950
Okay,

833
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,690
you're, you're idiots.
Get give, give, give,

834
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:40,450
buying into exactly what
they want you to buy into,

835
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:45,040
which is a cashless society so they
can keep track of where you are at all

836
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:49,870
fucking times and every last fucking
dime that you make so they can get their

837
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:51,700
greedy little fucking hands on it.

838
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,740
You're out of your mind and you're giving
up an unbelievable amount of fucking

839
00:48:56,741 --> 00:49:01,390
privacy by creating a paper trail.
Everywhere you go,

840
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,370
everywhere you go, what you're
doing, where you're at, you know,

841
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,710
and the Sea of morons who we're
going to sit there and go, Whoa,

842
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:11,920
have you doing anything wrong?

843
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:17,130
I mean, I guess maybe,
maybe I'm a paranoid cycle.

844
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,620
You look at all these fucking idiots
who do reality TV's and [inaudible] and

845
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:24,160
they let cameras come into their house
and they don't seem to care about it.

846
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:28,390
Maybe, uh, maybe the average Jacquez
doesn't give a shit, but sir,

847
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,920
for the love of God,

848
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,593
you know,

849
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,720
in the end he says,
I'm not crying conspiracy.

850
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,220
It's very plain to see what they're doing.
It's not malicious or evil. Yes it is.

851
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,640
It is malicious and it is
evil and it is a conspiracy.

852
00:49:43,641 --> 00:49:46,880
They're conspiring to get
everybody's information,

853
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,800
find out what they buy,

854
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,370
and they're lying to you
saying that they're not going
to share the information.

855
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,290
It's everything that you're saying. It's
not. It is. All right, and that's it.

856
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:59,450
That's two weeks in a row. I'm
on the soapbox. See people,

857
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,820
don't you like it better
when I talk about sports?

858
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,363
Wow.

859
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,360
The last thing I'll read you guys.
This guy sent me something about a,

860
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:26,420
you know I was talking about when you're
going to go buy things and people ask

861
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:28,100
for your phone and all

862
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,420
this fucking information and it fucking
creeps me out. Every time they do that,

863
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:35,420
I just think that they should play in
the beginning of that iron main song,

864
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:36,254
the prisoner.

865
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,480
You remember that from the eighties
do you remember how that thing went?

866
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,333
You remember this?

867
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,980
The new number two.
What was number one?

868
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,600
You are number six most cycle laugh ever.

869
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,093
Yeah.

870
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,530
Can you imagine if your fucking dad would
laugh at you like that back in the day?

871
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,520
Be like, son, how many beers did you have
tonight? You just like, I just had to,

872
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,870
all right, and he just fucking
Dallas and the light stock demand.

873
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,370
It's going to be over. So anyways, this
fucking guy. Does that make any sense,

874
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:27,650
by the way? I don't know. I'm fucking
sitting in with one microphone.

875
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:31,760
No headphones in a fucking hotel
room. This is what you get. All right.

876
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,460
So this guy said,
Bill,

877
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:37,430
can you believe how much
fucking information people
are willing to give away for

878
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,340
no to strangers for no reason.
He goes,

879
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:43,790
I got my hair cut the other day and the
first thing they say to me before, hello,

880
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:48,200
or what can I do for you is the first
thing out of the gate is what's your phone

881
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:52,700
number? So I say, why do you
need my phone number? She says,

882
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,980
so we know who you are when you come in.

883
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,100
Which is bullshit because they
don't know you when you come in.

884
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:01,430
They still have to ask what
your God damn number is.

885
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,080
C got to love someone who actually fucking
uses their brain. So anyway, she goes,

886
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,120
he says,
I don't want to give you my number.

887
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:12,140
So then she scoffs in his face and says,

888
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:17,300
we don't send the information
out to anyone. It's just
to keep track of you here.

889
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:21,950
That's it. Um, and then
she says, uh, then okay,

890
00:52:21,951 --> 00:52:24,380
then the guy says, the guy written,
wrote this really badly here.

891
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,560
So then I guess he responds to,
that doesn't make me feel any better.

892
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,690
You don't need my phone
number to cut my hair.

893
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,990
Then this slag does this fine,

894
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:37,520
whatever that sounded exactly like your
exaggerated impression of a dumb broad.

895
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,230
Then she goes, how about your
address too? This is fucking,

896
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,430
you know what all these corporations are
sharing this information to figure out

897
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:50,690
exactly what you buy when you buy it,
what you liked the best.

898
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,340
So they can just fucking, I
don't know what, you know,

899
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,160
Jack, the prices of the
shit up. So anyways, um, she
goes, how about your address?

900
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,240
And the guy goes, what are you going to
do? Drop the hair, cut off at my house.

901
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,530
Just cut my fucking,
uh,

902
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,080
now there's three people in line behind
me in this worthless tub of come.

903
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,700
Jesus leans around me and says, and says
to I guess to the people behind them,

904
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:20,990
sorry, this takes longer. When they,
then he writes, they, you know,

905
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,160
don't give any information.
And then he sarcastically, oh,

906
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,670
I see. I'm the one compliment a
complicating this transaction.

907
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,540
And it's not even her fault, it's her.
I'll, oh, and it's not even her fault.

908
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:34,890
It's their corporate creep bosses.

909
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,700
And all the fucking sheep that
let people do whatever they want.

910
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,280
Okay.

911
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,780
Sorry. This is so long. Well,

912
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,510
he should apologize to my listeners
because they had to listen to me read it.

913
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,940
Yeah, man, don't give those
people your fucking phone numbers.

914
00:53:45,941 --> 00:53:50,170
Don't give him your address.
I do that. Kim, can we get
your phone number? I had. No,

915
00:53:50,171 --> 00:53:54,100
you can't. We're not going to do anything
with it. I, that's fine. That's fine.

916
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,780
I know you're not going
to do anything with it.

917
00:53:55,781 --> 00:53:56,950
I don't want you to have my phone number.

918
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,250
What are you gonna call me up and
see how my fucking hair cuts going?

919
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,520
Is it still short and you
think you need an adjustment?

920
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:07,960
Did I tell you that story?
But when I went into cvs and that guy who,

921
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:12,070
look what the peewee Herman Haircut, there
was two, two foreigners in front of me.

922
00:54:12,071 --> 00:54:13,490
They barely spoke English and they,

923
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,110
he asked if they wanted one of those
savings saved cards and they said no.

924
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,110
And he goes, that's all right. I'll
just scan one anyways. And he scans it.

925
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,810
So I walk up and I'm ready for this guy.
He goes,

926
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:26,260
do you have our little savings save card?
And I say, no I don't. And he goes, well,

927
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:28,420
I'll just scan it anyways and I got no,
I don't want you to do.

928
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:32,470
And then he scanned it and I said, I said,
excuse me, what did I just say to you?

929
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,040
I just said, I don't want that.
And you scanned it anyways.

930
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:38,860
Why did you just do that? And he goes,
it's all right. I'll let it scan it.

931
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:40,630
I'll let us scan it. And I
go, what? What do you get?

932
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:43,570
Like half a cent for every
person that you get, you know?

933
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,150
Yeah,

934
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,900
that, that, that you get on the fucking
list there. And he goes, no I don't.

935
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,780
And it's like, really? Is that why
he can't make eye contact with me?

936
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:55,860
You fucking piece of shit. He probably
didn't even unscathed the God damn thing.

937
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,720
You know, I don't understand. People
will help out corporations. I just don't,

938
00:55:00,721 --> 00:55:04,950
have they done anything to demonstrate
that they give a flying fuck about you or

939
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:07,620
the drinking water in your town?
Don't help those cons.

940
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,350
I mean you can if you want
to, but that's, I would just,

941
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:14,850
I think it would be a better world if
these fucking pricks did know every God

942
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:15,780
damn thing about you.

943
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,600
Do you know pretty soon you're going
to walk in there and they're going to

944
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:19,930
fucking ask me if you can put,
uh,

945
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:24,150
did they can just bug you like gene
Hackman in the conversation. Right.

946
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,210
All right dude, I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. You know what,

947
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,570
I'm going to go down and listen to this
lady singer songs so I don't have to

948
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:33,060
think there's a nice
little crowd down there.

949
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,820
Has got to be at least
26 people down there,

950
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:39,780
which I think in downtown San
Jose actually constitutes a mob.

951
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,530
Maybe somebody will get tased and shot
in the abdomen. I don't know what.

952
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,100
All right, that's the podcast
for this week. Thank you
guys so much for listening.

953
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:51,300
I am in currently revamping my website
and I hope that everything's going to be

954
00:55:51,301 --> 00:55:54,570
up to speed. I recently went over, uh,

955
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,910
10,000 people on my mailing list, so
I'm really excited about that. And, uh,

956
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:02,160
if you want to know what's going on,
you know, especially like if you see,

957
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:02,994
you know,

958
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,380
when I switched over to a Lipson with
the podcast and all that fucking shit,

959
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,590
if you were out of the loop,
it's cause you weren't on my mailing list.

960
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,320
I'm not sure. You know how funny
is this? How funny is this?

961
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,290
How fucking hypocritical of mine?
I just said,

962
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:18,240
don't give your phone
number out to these cons.

963
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:21,540
And now here I am asking for
your web address. I really just,

964
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,020
why do people listen to this and an idiot.
All right,

965
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:24,950
I'll talk to you next week.

966
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:45,933
Yeah,

967
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,393
yeah.

968
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:05,680
Okay.
