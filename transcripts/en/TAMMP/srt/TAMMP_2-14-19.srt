Hey, what's going on is bill burn?

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,670
de [inaudible],

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,960
why don't want to you brave
strong warriors pick up the check.

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,770
You fuck in tight wads.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,330
You know I was watching TV the other day
because I'm not a big reader, you know,

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,320
unless it's got a lot of pictures
and they sound out the words for me.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,830
And there was this woman on TV,
right?

13
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,840
One of these daytime
talk shows assump shit.

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,700
She was just like Happy
Valentine's Day week. I sell,

15
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:01,760
I think we should celebrate the week.
It's a week of love.

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,690
It's just like how much free
shit are you trying to get?

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,620
It stopped back then. Like you're
celebrating love. You're not,

18
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:12,710
you celebrate and you yes.
Selfish.

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,430
Why is she a whore bill? Cause she's
on television. What? Too much makeup.

20
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,470
All right, let me, Jesus
Christ, why aren't you just
out there walking the block?

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,230
Um,
Oh man,

22
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:31,300
I'm in a grumpy ass fucking mood
cause I want to go to bed B to the

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,330
motherfucking Ed.
I want to go to bed bitches.

24
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,440
I don't know why I'm talking like a
fucking old white housewife right now who

25
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:42,250
watched a hip hop video,
but I am mother fuckers.

26
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,410
Um, I uh, yeah,

27
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:49,630
I want to go to bed, but I got to
go out and got to go run my hour.

28
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,050
I got to go run it because
I'm doing the special soon.

29
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,420
I've got to hit the comedy gym and all
I want to do is try out my new fucking

30
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:02,840
ideas. Right? That's what I want to
do. But I can't, I got to fucking dude.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I gotta I gotta be, I gotta be like,
you know, middle of 10th about it.

32
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,761
I know it's weird.

33
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,970
What I have to do is do my new
ideas and then start with a joke.

34
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:14,870
I'm going to fucking maybe start with
and then run the fucking shit and then in

35
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:17,540
the end I'm not going to do it.
I just need to be on stage talking.

36
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,650
That's all I need to do. Okay. I don't
know how these fucking people do it,

37
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:25,550
where they write the whole thing out, have
the whole thing memorized or whatever.

38
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,183
Um,

39
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,743
okay.

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,300
I don't know if it's, I'm lazy or
maybe that's not how my brain works.

41
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,750
I have no fucking idea. All I know is I'm
running it tonight and then that's it.

42
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:35,541
Then I'm coming home,

43
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,040
I'm going to bed and then a buck and
waking up the next day. I got it.

44
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,120
Table read for F is for
family episode four.

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,680
Fucking season has been great so far.

46
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:51,180
We get some new writers
and they're crushing it.

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,720
And um, I dunno, we're almost next week.

48
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:56,820
Next week we'll do four
or five maybe right there.

49
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,520
Then we'll be halfway through the
season already. And now you're thinking,

50
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,500
well shit, Bill, what's it
going to come out in June? Oh,

51
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:06,760
I mean just halfway through. Just the
first initial writing of it. Well,

52
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,950
how does it work, Bill? How would you
like to know how it works in case?

53
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,980
So you write the fucking thing, right?
And as you're writing the episodes,

54
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,590
they come back with something
that's known as an animatic.

55
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,030
An animatic is basically, it's just
basically black and white sketched.

56
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,910
And they're like, well, this is how
we're going to draw what you wrote.

57
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,020
Does this look good? And Mobility, like
we like this, don't have that chair there.

58
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,070
Have him stand up, have a move his arm
like this up and down when he says,

59
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:34,270
what the fuck is going on in here? Right.
You do that and then it comes back,

60
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:38,740
it's a little more drawn, a little more
color, you know, that's how it goes.

61
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Just like that. But we're on the fourth
season so they know what we like,

62
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,400
we know what they like, so it moves
like last season moves along quickly.

63
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:49,720
So I'm hoping, uh, we'd
get this fucker done, um,

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,720
as soon as possible. So, uh, anyways, um,

65
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,240
then I'm going to take my lady
out for fucking Valentine's Day.

66
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,080
That's what I'm going to do.

67
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,740
And I'm going to try to be a nice guy
and try not got to get into a fight.

68
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,510
Try not to have any appeared yet.

69
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,533
MMM.

70
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,470
Yeah. I, you know what, I'm,

71
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I'm doing so much shit right now
that I want to fucking go off on,

72
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:18,650
but I can't go off on it because
other people's lives will be affected.

73
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,240
You know what? Are you talking about?
Some top secret shit, Bill? No, I'm not.

74
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:25,370
I'm just talking about, you know, I dunno.

75
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,150
Just bullshit in my fucking life.
Like, uh, you would never know it,

76
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:35,140
but I am not in a good mood right now.
All right.

77
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,380
I'm not in a good fucking mood,
but I gotta do this.

78
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:42,610
I have responsibility to you.
Okay.

79
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,240
I answered the call 12 years
ago to start podcasting.

80
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,543
Okay.

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,350
The same way somebody answers the call
to defend the freedom of this country.

82
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,770
All right? Now, God damn it.

83
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,790
If white women in this country can
somehow enjoy white privilege and then yet

84
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,140
also make themselves
victims than God dammit,

85
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,230
I can put myself on the same
level as someone who's fighting,

86
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,370
you know, what are they saying?
They're doing it. They're
fighting for our freedom.

87
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:18,780
That's right.
Fighting for our freedom,

88
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,513
right?

89
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,360
As a podcast warrior,
living my truth,

90
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,890
I think I'm slowly going
insane. Um, anyways,

91
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,350
I don't have any advertising here.
I don't know what's going on.

92
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:39,390
So fucking podcast has been
going off the rails lately.

93
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm not going to lie to you
and you don't want to think.

94
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,500
A lot of the biggest fucking problem is,

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,720
you know what the biggest
fucking problem is right now,

96
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,300
aside from the fact that I have no guest.

97
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,460
And then sitting here by myself,
you're listening to one of one of,

98
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:57,510
I'm like a [inaudible]
right now. Right? Uh,

99
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,250
the biggest fucking problem my life
right now is I'm sober. You know,

100
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,070
I don't know how the puck
of people do this shit.

101
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,460
I'm trying to think back to
my life before ever drank

102
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,660
because I had a hell of
a run. I went in, I went,

103
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,740
I didn't start drinking until
I was like 17, you know,

104
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,270
I had a couple sips of beer here or there,

105
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:19,200
but basically I spent the first
16 years of my life sober.

106
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,580
I don't know how I did it, but
I think back, I didn't have any,

107
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,120
there was no pressure now to
get up and do my paper route.

108
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,400
That was the biggest thing.
Occasionally it had to go collecting,

109
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,000
maybe it rained out in some of the
papers. Got Wet. Maybe there was that.

110
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,540
Maybe had a book report.
I mean those were the pressure days.

111
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,220
I wonder if kids over in Europe,

112
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:42,800
you know when they got a big book
report the next fucking day, you know,

113
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,850
after they give the book report,

114
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:49,690
do they drink like a fucking
couple of shots just to unwind,

115
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,131
you know,

116
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:53,680
cause there's just so much
more progressive over there
and they can allow their

117
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:56,290
kids to booze. I don't fucking
know. I don't know how it works.

118
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:00,460
I don't pretend to know. Um, but anyways,

119
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,820
I'm committed to this shit though.
I'm not drinking this year.

120
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,520
Okay.

121
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,560
Now I know those animals and Aa,

122
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,930
they tried to say you gotta go day to
day. All right? But they were different.

123
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,340
They were different group of people.

124
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,720
Okay.

125
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,260
All right.
If you ever think you an alcoholic,

126
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,010
go to an AA meeting and just listen
to the fucking stories and you know,

127
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,150
come out the other side and tell me
your as fucked up as those people.

128
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,670
I, I double dare you to
fucking do it. You know,

129
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,110
you're just come out of there
and be like, oh, you know,

130
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:35,810
I'm a fucking binge drinker. That's
what I am. You know what I mean?

131
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:39,560
Once I start losing teeth, you
know what? I kind of dial it back.

132
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,010
I'm not standing outside the fucking
liquor store waiting for it to open.

133
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,140
Yeah.

134
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,860
Fucking and mouthwash.
Yeah.

135
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,110
We go to an AA meeting.
You want to feel good about yourself?

136
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,730
You go to a fuck at AA meeting.

137
00:07:55,731 --> 00:08:00,640
Just look at those fucking animals
just sitting there. God Damn.

138
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:05,620
Cigarette ashes. Fucking all
over the EDA. Yellow fingers.

139
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,060
Just shoven donuts down there.
Fucking pie holes done.

140
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:14,650
Unbelievable. Yeah. It's funny. I haven't
been in a, I went to two AA meetings.

141
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,510
What was it? One? Yeah,
to like 30 years ago.

142
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:20,990
Okay.

143
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,820
Well only cause the court told me I had
to um, it's a whole other fucking story.

144
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,970
Eli's got a tiller.
The stags dad get out gallery tag,

145
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:33,890
but I gave it a your fucking legs. His
back. All right, I'll go to these things.

146
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,260
And that was every fucking story.

147
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,510
They would say the most fucked
up shit ever jaw on the ground.

148
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:44,510
Like you gotta be fucking kidding me.
How did you live through that?

149
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,540
And then right after that, and they'd
be like, and then the craziest thing is,

150
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,910
you know I want to do
is have another drink.

151
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,340
Oh, Jesus Christ. I love
making fun of alcoholics.

152
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,960
I really do. Alcoholics, feminists.

153
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,590
Who else?
The Obamas.

154
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,300
I was fucking people.
Jesus Christ.

155
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,380
I don't know what fucking deal with
the devil did they sign that they just

156
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:22,490
fucking get off Scott fucking free out
there with all that corporate money

157
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,410
hanging out of their fucking pockets.

158
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,420
Everybody out here is looking at him
like they're fucking, I dunno what.

159
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,723
MMM.

160
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,740
Anyways, I, why do I talk politics?
I don't pay attention to it.

161
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,460
Every time I start to look at it, it,
it just fucking, uh, I don't know.

162
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,210
It either bores me to tears or
scares the shit out of me. You know?

163
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,980
It's either like somebody filibustering

164
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,750
on the fucking floor or it's like,
I dunno, you just watched them,

165
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,890
you know,
building up a new candidate.

166
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:00,250
And so much of it has nothing
to do with their message.

167
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,350
It has to do with way the way they look.

168
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,703
Uh,

169
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,340
you know,
it goes back to Clinton.

170
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:12,341
He played the saxophone on fucking our
Cineo this watershed fucking moments in

171
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:19,000
politics that changes it
forever. You know, like, uh,

172
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,560
as far as the age of television,

173
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,060
you had Nixon sweating sitting
there like a fucking catcher.

174
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,900
You know what John F. Kennedy was all
tanned up with this fucking legs crossed.

175
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:29,171
You know,

176
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:33,550
like he was hanging out at a fucking
country club and people who listen to the

177
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:37,970
debate said Nixon won. And people who
watched it said, Kennedy won. You know,

178
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,300
Nixon with his sweaty upper lip.

179
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,523
MMM.

180
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah. That was it. That was a moment.

181
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,630
Michael Dukakis sticking his head out
of that fucking tank. That was a moment.

182
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,110
Bill Clinton playing the saxophone
and then I would say,

183
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,360
uh,
Donald Trump,

184
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,010
this last one where he didn't really
debate as much as he just sort of trash he

185
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,940
just sorted was doing a roast.

186
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,563
MMM.

187
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,310
That's what I want to see just as a
standup comic is how are People gonna

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,150
fucking debate.
That guy,

189
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,393
you know,

190
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,680
takes me back to like, when Patrice was
alive, we just couldn't beat the guy.

191
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,790
So you'd literally walked down to the
comedy cellar and I would have like

192
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,280
fucking four insults.

193
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,380
I would just be thinking about his face
was something I saw him do on stage and

194
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:41,020
I would have like four
fucking insults ready to go,

195
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,123
you know,

196
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,340
just so I could get to the table and
sit down and order some fucking food.

197
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,060
I feel like Trump,
you got to do the same thing.

198
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,000
Like

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,820
Hillary should have just abandoned,
you know,

200
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,370
whatever fucking horse shit
she was going to say. Right.

201
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:02,720
And just fucking attack
this to pay, you know, and,

202
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,840
and just this stupid look on his face and
should have just sat there and imitate

203
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:08,680
it. She should just fucking,
uh, I believe that the, the,

204
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,160
the youngsters call it clowned him.
He should,

205
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:15,360
he should've just trashed them back.
Um,

206
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,510
I dunno, that was such a fascinating
fucking thing to see happen.

207
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,220
There was all these fucking rules and he
just came in there like a God damn bull

208
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:30,760
in a China shop and traipsed
right through all of it.

209
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,120
And those people all had no answer.

210
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,990
All those years I watched those debates
in these fucking guys running the

211
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,560
debates,

212
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,560
acting like they had this fucking control
that if you fucking broke these rules,

213
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,820
that something was gonna
happen, that there was some
sort of repercussion for it.

214
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,210
So no one ever did for the most part.
You know,

215
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:53,830
they talk a little bit over their time.

216
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,360
Trump completely fucking ignored
all of them. And when he did,

217
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:02,380
they had nothing.
Absolutely fucking nothing.

218
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,420
So I dunno, what does he like? He said,

219
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,700
only two years in little over two years.

220
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,380
Okay.

221
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,920
So you've got this year, you got next
year and then the show starts again.

222
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,500
What do you guys think?
Let's fucking handicap this

223
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,400
like a football.
It's the beginning of the season.

224
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:26,130
Who Do you think's gonna win the super
like how I wanna know how you guys,

225
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:27,630
even if you were into Donald Trump,
cause the guy,

226
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:30,960
he's a fascinating fucking
problem in a debate

227
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,440
cause it's like this guy is just like,

228
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,450
his style is so fucking not what there
you all of these fucking politicians,

229
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:46,630
unless they hosted a reality show,
maybe that's his strength.

230
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,590
He didn't take the bait in classes so he
doesn't know that you just fucking goes

231
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:53,010
in, you know? I Dunno.

232
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,790
I found it as a standup comedian.
Fascinating.

233
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,230
Okay.

234
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,580
Mikey was this heckler that
you just couldn't get. I
can't shut them. Like I just,

235
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:03,960
when I looked at all
those other candidates,

236
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:07,740
they would like these comedians
and they were facing this Hackler.

237
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,720
Yeah,

238
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,340
that was just funny oven then the comic
on stage or just wouldn't shut up and

239
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:18,090
there was no security.
They couldn't shut them the fuck up.

240
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,470
Okay.

241
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,240
The only other time I
saw something like that,

242
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:26,650
I saw bill O'Reilly when he went on the
view and he just said whatever the fuck

243
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,630
he wanted and he made them so mad.

244
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:33,631
Two of them got up and left and he was
literally two fucking hosts away from

245
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:40,390
hosting the I O'Reilly factor
on the fucking view, you know?

246
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,290
But Babs was fucking old school.
Okay.

247
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,840
And she called the ladies back in.
She's like, what are we doing here?

248
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,470
Sit the fuck back down.
You know,

249
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,840
it's just a man in a shirt
saying things relax. Okay.

250
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,850
And they all fucking relaxed and
then that was it. Um, anyways,

251
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,280
I love when they walked out too.

252
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:05,510
Like that meant something like I'm getting
up and walking out like all of show

253
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:10,160
business was going to, was
going to stop. You know,

254
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,623
I dunno.

255
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,500
I don't know what the fuck's
been going on with me lately,

256
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,640
but this is maybe my thought,

257
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:18,970
like if I've learned anything in my 50
years on this planet is nobody gives a

258
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:19,804
shit.

259
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:22,740
Yeah.

260
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,520
Occasionally when somebody
gives a shit, they, they, it's,

261
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:30,570
it's so fucking rare that they actually
will do like a piece about it on the

262
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:33,450
news.
Like we found somebody that gives a shit.

263
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,900
We found somebody who
doing the right thing,

264
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,320
this is what they do and
they're doing it the right way.

265
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,950
Why is my voice cracking?
You know,

266
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,810
where they make a
documentary about somebody.

267
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,340
There's so few people doing

268
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,950
good things. I feel that they actually,
that's why they created the documentary.

269
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,260
So it came about, it's like, why don't
we just make a movie about this person?

270
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,940
Well,
now that there's such a good person,

271
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:06,920
like it's not going to come
off as a believable movie.

272
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:11,150
You literally have to fucking film this
guy or this woman doing this nice shit.

273
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:12,200
So anybody believes it,

274
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,963
right?

275
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,410
Ah, am I dreaming this podcast right
now? Is this podcast actually happening?

276
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,273
I have no idea.

277
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,800
I watched a little bit of the Bruins
and a little bit of the Celtics.

278
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,260
I've decided that, uh, at some point

279
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,920
I do have to put my foot down a little
bit and take a little bit of control of

280
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:34,970
the TV. You know, my daughter's
just so adorable. It's hard for me

281
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,090
to a, you know, say no, but
I know I have to write. So,

282
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,003
you know,

283
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,650
last night the Bruins were playing
the Black Hawks, so it's just like,

284
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:50,590
I just want to watch one period of hockey.

285
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:53,890
I'll watch third period of hockey,
you know,

286
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,100
so I got to put the TV on and
I really try not to, you know,

287
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,690
do the screen time thing
with my kid. Uh, I, I,

288
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,360
I believe in that whole
thing that having them,

289
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,360
especially with smartphones and all
that shit, it's just, it's fucking,

290
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,360
I don't think it's good for him initially.
Uh,

291
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,720
and I'm basing that on shit. I've
overheard other people say, um,

292
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,530
not to mention last weekend when the TV
wasn't on and I didn't have my phone and

293
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:24,970
I just took out a deck of cards and I
just had a great fucking time, I was like,

294
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:28,450
Oh yeah, remember that? Looking at
another person and connecting with them.

295
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,903
MMM.

296
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,160
Anyways, I, uh, the fuck
is my point here. Oh yeah.

297
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:43,170
So I got to put on the hockey game
and the second the TV goes on,

298
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:47,280
she starts yelling out her shows,
you know,

299
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,110
made me mouse Minnie. Right.
I'm like, no, no many miles.

300
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:56,790
She went to bed many miles, went
to bed, then she does this crying.

301
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,010
Yeah.

302
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,400
You know, just forcing it out. And I'm
like, we're going to watch hockey. Yeah.

303
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,170
Be thinks she sees now that sports, she
goes, football, football. I'm like, no,

304
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:11,280
hockey, hockey. So Chico was
upset for a little bit, but then,

305
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,280
then she was cool. And then, uh,

306
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,230
tonight I put on the Celtics and
then she pointed the TB. She's like,

307
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:23,550
hockey, hockey. I'm like, no
basketball. So then she, you know,

308
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,580
said basketball,
we watch sat a little bit,

309
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:28,320
but then she wanted to do the alphabet.

310
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,060
So I put it on mute and I was doing the
alphabet with her and then she was kind

311
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,670
of looking at the TV. So I said,
fuck it. And I shut it off.

312
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,290
And it just did the whole,
you know, a apple B bad.

313
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,460
See cupcake d,
dinosaur raw.

314
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,110
I forget what he is, you know, and I
go through the whole fucking thing. Um,

315
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,940
anyways.
Um,

316
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,750
so now I'm sitting here.
It's Wednesday night.

317
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,410
I'm doing this fucking podcast
cause tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

318
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,730
And uh,
I have to somehow stay awake.

319
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,640
It fucking go out and go do my
spot tonight. Roma God damn hour.

320
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,550
All I gotta do is just get behind the
wheel of the car and that'll wake me up.

321
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,770
I'll stick my head out the window like
fucking ace Ventura pet detective.

322
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,210
I'm run down to this little
fucking hole in the wall.

323
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:28,900
I'm gonna run my fucking set and then
that'll be it. I'll be good. But with,

324
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,610
the thing is,
is I've been getting up,

325
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:35,290
I've been going to the fucking gym again
in the morning. All right. And I slowly,

326
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,430
I'm to the point where my shoulder is
strong enough where I'm almost to the

327
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:46,681
point I could do a dip after this rotator
cuff fucking nightmare is finally I,

328
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,740
I, I did, I did it so fucking wrong.

329
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,200
I kept babying my shoulder still.
I had that frozen shoulders shit.

330
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:59,800
Right now I've had to go all the way
back and I just keep having setbacks.

331
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:03,100
But what I finally learned is when I go
on the road and I can't go to the gym

332
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,690
when I come back,

333
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,310
okay,

334
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,600
I can't pick up where I left, left off
and I can't even just go five pounds down.

335
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:13,550
I have to go 15 pounds down or
this thing flares up against.

336
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:18,030
So I finally figured that out. So now
I'm to the point where I take the dip,

337
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,700
the dip bar, he can adjust
it all the way down. So on.

338
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:26,200
Basically my feet are on the floor and
I'm just sort of bending my legs doing

339
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:29,320
the dipping motion. So now I've got it
to the point where I'm just sort of,

340
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:32,860
you know when Michael Jackson would come
up on his toes, I'm kind of like that.

341
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,970
So I'm supporting most
of the weight of my legs,

342
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:39,700
but more and more the upper
body is going to support it.

343
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:43,270
I got to tell you the day
I fucking do a dip then.

344
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,360
I know I'm getting close and
I've been doing, I disguise,

345
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,950
sent me an about some shoulder exercises
and I've been doing this thing where I

346
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:55,270
just sort of hang from the chin up bar,
you know, with my feet on the ground.

347
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,980
But every day I do a little more of
the upper body holding the weight,

348
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,090
you know,
incrementally ever so fucking slowly.

349
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,310
And then I think eventually,
um,

350
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,140
the person I'm working with is
telling me because of my body weight,

351
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:16,141
I need to basically be able to do the
lat pull down machine like 120 pounds,

352
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,830
three reps of 15. And when I do that,
then I can attempt to do a pull up without

353
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,930
fucking up my rotator cuff and starting
all over again. It's been a long,

354
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:30,610
slow fucking road
for an old bastard like myself.

355
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,500
Um,
but anyways,

356
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:37,210
I am very excited about slash
apprehensive about doing this.

357
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,840
Uh, this special coming
up. I just, I fucking,

358
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,900
this is the part that I hate is having
to be disciplined because like tonight I

359
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:47,501
would just go down,

360
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:51,670
I've just fucking go off and I have to
go down and actually work and I'm a lazy

361
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:55,600
fucker so I don't, I don't like working
and being a big God damn baby about it.

362
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,760
But I'm going to go down,
I'm going to fucking get it done.

363
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,290
And then next week everybody, uh, is
the Patrice O'neil comedy benefits.

364
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:07,030
So I'm going to be in New York City
doing that benefit. The next night.

365
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,060
Wednesday I'm actually going to be
doing nine o'clock show at Caroline's on

366
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:16,930
Broadway. I've not headlined there and
probably a decade. And that is the,

367
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,650
the first place that headline
to me in New York City,

368
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:25,360
they used to have to pull the curtain
and I would draw like 30 or 40 fucking

369
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,730
people, anybody that could
drag off of Times Square.

370
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,243
MMM.

371
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,400
And that's when me,
Patrice Norton,

372
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,233
mmm.

373
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,140
Everyone from my graduating class was
just starting to like close out a show on

374
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:46,380
a unlike a Tuesday night or whatever. Man,

375
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:47,220
it's a really cool thing.

376
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:51,750
So it kind of takes me back to
all of all of those times. So, um,

377
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,320
uh, and then I think I'm in New
York for the rest of the week,

378
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:59,880
so I'll be bouncing around doing spots
all around the city, just stay in shap.

379
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,900
And then I go out from New York,

380
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm going straight over to Great Britain,

381
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,870
and then I just bang out
about five or six shows there.

382
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,120
And then I do,
uh,

383
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,380
I do two nights at Royal Albert
Hall on the fourth and the fifth,

384
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,970
and I knock this fucker out.
And after that,

385
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,650
oh,

386
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:27,270
all this fucking crazy political talk
and all this negative shit that I've been

387
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,130
doing right now,
it's just because I'm under the pressure.

388
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,690
Don't even fucking listen to me.
Okay.

389
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:34,830
The world is not as bad as I'm fucking
saying it is. I just, you know,

390
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:39,360
I just got to get on the other side
of this fucking thing. And once I do,

391
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,210
then I'm good finish.
Right.

392
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:48,211
And the rest to f is for family and then
the rest of my year is just opened up.

393
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:51,890
And then it's my favorite
favorite fucking time,

394
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,580
right after a special,
you have no fucking act.

395
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,930
And I get to go on stage
and just fucking bomb.

396
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,080
It's my favorite thing in the
fucking world. And then also be like,

397
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,940
I don't have to put out another special
for a couple of years. This is beautiful.

398
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,710
Oh, gives a shit. If I'm doing a
fucking Ronald Reagan impression.

399
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,370
Oh, I did the ice house the other
night. I had a fucking last night.

400
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,120
Ran The hour out there.
What are the fuck I did. Um,

401
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,430
had a great time out there.

402
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:31,670
Okay.

403
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,720
You know,
worked with Bart.

404
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:37,510
Nick fucking Joe to Rosa J K to braid it.
Can't pray them.

405
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,810
Um,
trying out some new shit.

406
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,050
I always have to try out the new shit.
I can't just like do my fucking act.

407
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:49,250
I swear to God. Then I feel like
I'm doing my God damn taxes. Um,

408
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,340
so anyways, so you know what, let's
look up some fucking headline, right?

409
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,310
And quit listening to me talking about me.

410
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,430
I got to start having more
guests on this fucking show.

411
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:01,610
I think I've exhausted everything. I can
fucking talk about about myself here.

412
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,140
All right, here we go. Oh, look at
that. I'm looking at UK openers.

413
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,780
This is, uh, Ian So-and-so.

414
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,890
This is a fucking something, something,
something. All right, Google,

415
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,260
Google news. All right, let's see
what's going on here. Oh, by the way,

416
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,480
you know something? I just
saw the original, you know,

417
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,380
the original intellectual fucking
children's book, chicken little,

418
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,930
you know that stupid God damn.
Uh,

419
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,650
the fuck is it that, that God damn chicken
nae acorn falls on his head. He says,

420
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:43,040
the sky's falling. He runs around
and gets everybody off. You know,

421
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,280
got all in a fucking panic
original chicken little story.

422
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,200
Okay.

423
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,460
And I got to type in Fox.
Okay.

424
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:59,320
The original chicken little
was a story called Henny penny.

425
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,870
All right? Now chicken little, I don't
even know how that fucking story ended,

426
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:10,730
but it didn't end up with anybody fucking
dying. But in Henny penny chicken,

427
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:15,530
little has an acorn falls on
his fucking head and, and uh,

428
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,860
whatever. Yeah, Henny penny. Any
penny had a fucking blah, blah, blah.

429
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,490
And then he runs into ducky Faqih
and he said, yeah, the sky's falling.

430
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:26,510
And then Ducky funky in Henny penny went
up to and went to fucking Loosey Goosey.

431
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,290
And then they, the sky's
falling. And then Lucy Goosey,

432
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,990
fucky Douggie and Henny penny.
That's how they do it, right?

433
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,280
It's every fucking bird
you could possibly,

434
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:40,940
God damn eat freaking out that
the fucking sky has fallen.

435
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,530
And then they run into a fox,

436
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,580
the Fox like, hey man, what do you
guys all freaking out about it?

437
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:55,570
Any Penny Ducky Faqih and, uh,
the, the fucking Loosey Goosey.

438
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:59,770
I'll go other. The Sky's falling. Jesus
Christ. And he goes, Oh, you know what?

439
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:02,920
I live in a cave. Come on over
here and we'll fucking be safe.

440
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:09,090
And then the story just ends with the
Fox in his little fucking Fox cubs,

441
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,760
whatever you call them,
with big smiles on their faces,

442
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,050
cause they fucking hate him.
That's how it ended.

443
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,480
That was the original. And, uh,

444
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,260
people were saying that
it was too, um, you know,

445
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,880
to fucking dark or whatever the
fuck it was. But, uh, you know,

446
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:35,210
so I have a theory about those old
original or some of the old stories like,

447
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,100
or Disney shit like Bambi and why
the parents die and all that shit.

448
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,740
You know why that is?
Why it was so fucking dark back then.

449
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:46,140
Cause people fucking died.
People were hungry.

450
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:49,560
He had to go out and kill an animal. You
didn't just go down to fucking, you know,

451
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,250
Goddamn Ralph's and get a chicken breasts.
You had to kill that fucking thing.

452
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,300
Watch it, flap it's wings for the
last time. Take out the end trails,

453
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:01,980
be covered in blood and all of that shit.
It was a fucking gory mess.

454
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,270
People got tuberculosis,
they got fucking, uh,

455
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:10,830
they got a polio. All kinds of
horrible shit happened back then.

456
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,210
They had gross on their goddamn faces.
It was fucking difficult.

457
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:18,420
So that was probably a cute story.

458
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,500
Do you know, cause they knew so much about
wildlife back then, like, yeah, you know,

459
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:27,010
the Fox, the Fox is fucking
smart man. You know,

460
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,340
I have no idea.
I don't know.

461
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,400
I just find that fascinating that you
know nowadays if you'd do that. Oh my God,

462
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:38,200
that's gonna fucking, there'll
be a tragedy. Oh, look at
those converse all stars.

463
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,710
Please have at my size. They got,
they brought the old doctor Jay back.

464
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:47,560
Please have my size. How does the
Internet? No, all right. There it is.

465
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,350
Oh, there's an ad. Let me see. Then they
got my size. They never have my size.

466
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:57,530
It's always fucking sold out
of.

467
00:28:57,531 --> 00:29:02,531
So why did they wait so long to bring
the old fucking doctor Jay Leather

468
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,580
Converse all star back. It's such a clean
look and fucking sneaker. All right.

469
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:11,840
All sizes. What do you
got? What do you got?

470
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,320
They got my size.

471
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,930
All right, I'll fucking buy
it. I'm going to click on buy.

472
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,690
Here's how it work. Make a
bid. Make an author. Hey,
here's how it worked. Fuck you.

473
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,150
Sneakers. How about
that? You costs the fuck.

474
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,060
Was that all about you want this
sneaker? We have your size. All right,

475
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:39,180
I'll buy it. All right. Here's
how it works. What do you
mean this is how it works.

476
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,870
All right, let's get back to the
fucking news here or get to the news.

477
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,880
I haven't got to Google maps is using
giant virtual arrows to stop people from

478
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:53,890
getting lost. Jesus fucking how much
was can they help you with this thing?

479
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,630
Oh is my new pet peeve.
You know,

480
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,900
you and you scroll past the fucking
video they want you to watch and then it

481
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:04,320
just goes down with you stalking you.

482
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,690
Um, anyways, here we go.

483
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:12,040
Google maps wants to make it easier for
people to find their way to busy urban

484
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:17,041
spaces and it thinks large cartoon arrows
can help is when you're walking down

485
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:19,660
the street related article.

486
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:24,640
How Alexa knows the difference between
a breaking window in a wine glass.

487
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,050
Oh Jesus.
Should I just embrace this shit?

488
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,890
So I just bring this robot bitch into
my fucking house now, Tommy a bench.

489
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,700
Uh, all right. On Monday,

490
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:41,701
Google Max begin maps began letting
some users test a new augmented reality

491
00:30:41,861 --> 00:30:46,690
feature and it's mobile app that shows
graphics such as highlighted Arrows and

492
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:51,691
street names floating in midair over
a live view from their camera on their

493
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,920
smartphone screens.

494
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,400
It's meant to help them navigate city
streets that Jesus Christ could there be a

495
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:02,470
more boring fucking article.

496
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:06,160
What kills me is that there's an entire
generation of kids that get excited by

497
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:06,994
this.

498
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,653
MMM.

499
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,173
Alright.

500
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,550
Deck of cards with my face on it.

501
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,230
Okay. This is more
exciting to me. All right.

502
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:23,620
Custom photo cards. Oh, he
can actually do this shit

503
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,120
and fucking take a picture.
My God damn nuts.

504
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,530
Um,
of course it's a mother hugging her child.

505
00:31:34,531 --> 00:31:37,650
Who the fuck's gonna put that
on a deck of cards. This cards,

506
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,760
these things are dirty. They're
filthy. People lose money. All right.

507
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:43,320
They lose relationships with these things.

508
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:46,980
Let's let the luckiest deck of cards
you ever going to design. Wait a minute,

509
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:48,720
wait a minute. Let me,
let me look this up here.

510
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,810
Uh,

511
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:56,660
Bose picture deck of cards is
what kills me is fucking stupid.

512
00:31:57,871 --> 00:32:00,850
Is this, is this is going to
actually hit something right in.

513
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,370
Someone's going to have already done this.

514
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,140
Yeah.

515
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,300
All right. Here we go. Images.

516
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,443
Yeah,

517
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,020
just here for the booze.
So we got that on their fucking cards,

518
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,280
unlike a chocoholic but for booze.
So give me,

519
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:20,920
it all comes back to booze.
Just here for the booze.

520
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,673
Yeah.

521
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,610
Let's, let's, I think that's
something else I like to do.

522
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:30,611
I like to just Google search asshole
things are al Ko holics just week.

523
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,650
All my God, somebody said,
are they selfish apps?

524
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:41,120
A fuckin lutely are alcoholic.
Selfish. Here we go. Let's,

525
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:42,320
let's read this trashy,

526
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,650
a deeper look at wa into why
alcoholics are so selfish.

527
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,940
It's a disease man.
Um,

528
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,391
all right.

529
00:32:57,391 --> 00:33:00,960
Many people seem to think that addicts
and alcoholics are quite selfish,

530
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,380
especially when they're using, oh,
did they? Do they fucking get me here?

531
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:05,850
That they're not going
to say they're selfish?

532
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,770
Chances are if you had a loved
one who was in an active,

533
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,680
active addiction,
we've,

534
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:17,070
we'd like to invite all active
addicts to board next, please.

535
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,190
Then you've experienced the selfishness
of an addict firsthand. MMM,

536
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,680
no, I'm talking about just
like even when they're dry.

537
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,400
Yeah.

538
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,990
We'll, we'll all recovering
alcoholics become less
selfish, unfortunately. No. Oh,

539
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:33,860
I love this site.

540
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,340
Not all recovering alcoholics will be
willing to address their selfishness.

541
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,100
In reality,
there will be some super selfish people,

542
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,100
including narcissists that we'll
continue to being self. Well, I mean,

543
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:46,370
they could say that about anybody,
right? I'm just being a dick.

544
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,440
Are Alcoholics
weak?

545
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,940
This is actually fun searches to just
search shit that's alcoholics are not

546
00:33:56,941 --> 00:34:01,060
powerless. Human weakness
behind alcoholism. Uh,

547
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,860
it's not a good one.
Let's,

548
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,320
let's one last search here
and then I gotta wrap this up.

549
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:11,550
Are Most fem and this fem,

550
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,830
I can't even spell it.
Feminists dumb.

551
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,570
It's not feminist to pour bleach
on man spreaders. It's just stupid.

552
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,040
Whoa. Jesus. Were they doing that?

553
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,090
Why anti-feminism is a logical,

554
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,430
evil and incredibly unsexy.
Well, I want to be sexy.

555
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,760
I thought being a feminist meant I
couldn't wear lipstick or crave men with

556
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:41,100
small behinds. I thought that, oh my God.

557
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:44,840
Can you imagine actually clicking on
that? Why the fuck would I read that? Uh,

558
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,870
why did,
why what teen did to her teacher?

559
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,930
What team did when her teacher said
not to be a feminist, to people?

560
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:59,400
Just make these stories up.
The results of this may surprise you.

561
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,900
All right? It's not feminist to pour
bleach on man's spiders is just stupid.

562
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,020
Okay.

563
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,310
I had no idea that that bothered
women's so much to just sit there.

564
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:18,140
It's like we got dick and balls. We
have stuff hanging off of us. You know,

565
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:22,970
you've got to make some room
there. Um, it's an all tucked away,

566
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:25,970
all nice and fucking tidy.
Like your shit. I'm all right.

567
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:30,950
Feminist and does not deserve to be
undermined by idiotic acts that set men

568
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:34,220
against women. Oh my God.
God bless this woman now.

569
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:36,680
He is a nice rational fucking
person he could talk to.

570
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,080
This is my new video manifesto dedicated
to the problem of man's spreading,

571
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,420
the disgusting act that is being fought
with around the world and it is hushed

572
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,720
up in us.

573
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,790
Yeah.

574
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:55,790
Men demonstrating their alpha manhood
in the subway with women and children

575
00:35:56,071 --> 00:36:00,450
around it has nothing to do with that,
which is sitting there.

576
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,460
You built the whole backstory.
Like you're sitting there,

577
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,800
look at my dick and balls.

578
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,530
I will take up as much space
as I want with my privates.

579
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,050
Um, if you quickly show
what kind of macho you are,

580
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,120
we will publicly cool you off.

581
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,150
This video manifesto was created in
the assistant with friends who share my

582
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:30,870
position. I guess this is, I
guess it's a video of a woman.

583
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,700
Okay.

584
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,760
Pouring bleach on guys.
All right. Anyways,

585
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:38,230
did you hear the one about the Russian
student who was so fed up with man

586
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:42,510
spreading that she took to the subways
of Saint Petersburg to sprayed the

587
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:46,280
alluded bleach on men's
crutches? Hilarious. Right?

588
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,590
I got to admit,
that's fucking funny.

589
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,250
And this woman says wrong.
Look,

590
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,360
I hate man spreading as much as
the next unreasonable feminists.

591
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,820
It's antisocial.
It's rude.

592
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:03,821
It's displays an arrogant disregard
for this people sitting around you.

593
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,240
It's behavior that women
just wouldn't get away with.

594
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,270
What are they talking about?
You use the fucking men's room.

595
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,420
Okay.

596
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,310
The line is too long in the
ladies from you use the mat.

597
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,900
You have no respect for our
personal space. These fucking women,

598
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,790
they're out of their fucking minds.

599
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm not saying they don't
have some legitimate bitches,

600
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:27,100
but the way they're acting like
they're not doing anything wrong.

601
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:30,670
It's just fucking, anyway, so let's,
let's, let's read a little more.

602
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,580
Okay.

603
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,420
And to be clear,

604
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:38,100
I don't mean that I'm advocating for men
sitting with their legs clamp together,

605
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,840
lady. I don't give a fuck what you're,
what you're acting like you're, you're,

606
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,683
you're

607
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,330
okay.

608
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,170
You,
you're like,

609
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,910
you've got some sort of legal legislation
here that just got passed and then I

610
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:54,990
have to adhere to this anyways.
I don't eat, I don't either,

611
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:57,120
unless I'm wearing a short skirt.

612
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:02,220
Nor am I insisting that men should cross
their legs at all times. Oh, thank you.

613
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,710
Thank you for that.
And that existing,

614
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,430
that the existence of their penis
is no barrier to doing this.

615
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,260
Some may say crossing the,
some men say crossing the legs is fine.

616
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:16,740
Some men say it isn't not
having a penis myself,

617
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:21,060
I don't feel the position to be the
final arbitrator on this pressing matter.

618
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,810
Uh, this is not a, this is one of
the, this is just like, you know,

619
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,290
global warming.
Who gives a fuck about that?

620
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,380
Corporations dictating our foreign policy.

621
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:39,381
Who gives a about this men trying
to sit comfortably on the subway.

622
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,230
Um, anyways, I think
that's the end of the pot.

623
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:47,830
Just this was a very weird podcast,
but you know what it did?

624
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:51,450
It got me to within two hours
of when I have to go on,

625
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,310
I got to late in that spot tonight.
[inaudible] I'm an old man.

626
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,710
Oh Buddy.
Oh don't dope.

627
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:01,711
Mandy's Biondi sitting in the fucking
rain to do toto me undies me undies.

now. I'm parked. I'm doing this safely.

633
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,860
Mandy's, ask yourself one
fucking important question.

634
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,770
Is your underwear making you
happy at this very moment?

635
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,240
What a question to ask on Valentine's
Day or were you not thinking about your

636
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,980
underwear?
What'd you like to be wearing?

637
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:39,430
Underwear that is so soft that you feel
like you're making love to an actual

638
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:43,910
cloud all day long. Ah, Jeez.

Organic chicken and heritage breed pork,
not bread.

679
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,150
Heritage breed pork,
so tasty.

680
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:14,900
The incredible quality and put your
box meets starts with the commitment to

681
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:19,901
raising animals humanely and
free of antibiotics and hormones.

682
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,230
Listening to the feminist manifesto
before they're slaughtered,

683
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,700
Cook with p the peace of mind knowing you

you do that? A little bit
of mashed potatoes, right?

A little bit of fucking

You're listening

705
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:49,300
to this absolute fucking bullshit

706
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,720
of a podcast. Um, I'm actually
having, um, oh, I haven't,

707
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,740
I have a big guest coming on
for the Monday morning podcast.

708
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:06,610
Uh, I got Jason Reitman who I was lucky
enough to work with on the front runner.

709
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,800
And, um, that movie is coming on
to all the streaming services.

710
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:15,400
I believe maybe today it came on or,
or sometime soon.

711
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:17,470
So Jason was nice enough to agree.
I asked them,

712
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,750
come on the podcast so he could
come on and promote that movie. Um,

713
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,610
it's one of my favorite things that
I've done. So we're going to talk that,

714
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:26,890
we're going to talk movies,
he's going to be,

715
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:30,460
I think directing the next ghostbuster
movie and all that type of stuff.

716
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:32,100
So that's

717
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,820
what I'm going to have for you on
Monday. And, um, other than that,

718
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:38,580
we've got a little bit
of music here and uh,

719
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:42,060
after that we'll have another half
hour of a throwback Thursday afternoon,

720
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:45,480
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcasts. God bless all of you,

721
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:50,070
especially all the strong brave
women who listened to this. Um,

722
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,660
without you, the world would
be nothing. Okay. And I'm

723
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,540
closing my legs as I fucking
hit stop on my recorder.

724
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,200
Six
days.

725
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,580
You know, I was bitching about Valentine's
Day. You know, I always tease you about,

726
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,830
you know, how we go out to
celebrate our relationship. Yeah.

727
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,060
Except I pay by the way. How, how much
fun was it going out on the [inaudible]?

728
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,320
It was really nice. It was great.
Yeah. Doing that from now on. Right.

729
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,800
It was still going to be our nice, quiet,
romantic. Yup. There was none of the hype.

730
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,330
We went to a really nice place. Not
going to lie. It wasn't actually cheap,

731
00:45:57,331 --> 00:46:00,480
but I can't imagine what that would've
caught. We would've been standing outside.

732
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,800
Oh yeah.
You know,

733
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,980
you and your little glitter dress
looking at the other girls in there.

734
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:08,490
Glitter dress is going to you like
my glitter tries as much as her,

735
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,890
I should have gotten mine in poofy
shoe shoe colors. Um, so anyways,

736
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,650
so I've been bitching about the
ladies on this thing, right?

737
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:19,920
Like what do you guys do?
And they're talking about
this stake in a blow job day.

738
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,660
Yes, yes, yes, yes,

739
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,520
yes. All right. I like it.

740
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,520
I'll tell you when you were in heaven,
when not only can they not, can't say it.

741
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:33,840
Yeah.
When they're,

742
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,500
when they're proficient in both of those
categories because there's a lot of

743
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,970
people out there, they're
going to say, all right,

744
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:42,690
steak in a blow job day and one of
them is it going to be up to snuff?

745
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,910
And there is,

746
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:50,310
there is a prevailing attitude amongst
women that they are just automatically

747
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:55,311
good in bed because they're there and
there's the prevailing attitude that men

748
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,390
don't know what's going on. We
don't know what's going on. Well,

749
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,110
we already think it is. We're just
happy to be here. It's a privilege,

750
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,590
which is why this lady could says
the Valentine's Day, this is,

751
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:06,360
this is from a lady. She said, hey bill,

752
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,170
I heard what you were saying about women
and Valentine's Day and how we don't

753
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:14,490
buy our men gifts and we expect
the whole day to be about us. Well,

754
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:18,150
here's what I did from my
husband. Uh, by the way,

755
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,150
I'm honestly not trying to sell
you anything. He goes, I, she goes,

756
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:25,920
I bought him the liberator
Wedge Ramp Combo set. Uh,

757
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:26,970
what's that?
You might ask,

758
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:28,950
I actually know about this
from the opiate Anthony show.

759
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,290
They refer to it as a bedroom,
as bedroom, adventure gear.

760
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:37,480
It's a set of cushions designed to help
you achieve more positions during sex as

761
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:41,230
well as deeper penetration. So
no, we didn't go out to dinner.

762
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:45,070
No stupid cards were exchanged. We
simply stayed home and fucked all night.

763
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,330
So you can choke on that.
You douche. I love your bill.

764
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:51,970
Go Fuck Yourself. I like this girl. Yeah,

765
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:55,660
but you know what's funny about that
as she's patting yourself on the back,

766
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,250
she bought something for herself.
It's for both of them. No, it isn't.

767
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,550
What do you mean it isn't she
going to do with it without him?

768
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:08,350
I don't need deeper penetration.
That's for you. That is wealthy again,

769
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,230
that's, that's the difference.
What is the difference? She know.

770
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:16,120
I'm not saying that led guys don't
satisfy their women properly, that they,

771
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:18,370
that their dick isn't big enough.
I'm not talking about that.

772
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:20,440
I'm talking about how she's
patting herself on the back.

773
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,660
Like she went out and bought this guy,
the NFL package for next season.

774
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,870
Like she actually went out
and bought something for him.

775
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:32,440
She didn't at the very least
she bought something for them.

776
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,030
But the real thing about that,

777
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,410
that's for the woman so he can hit it at
that angle that you like so he can hit

778
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:42,520
your spot so he can get in there
deeper. Guys, you don't appreciate that.

779
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,120
I'm not saying I don't appreciate it
and I'm not saying it's not a great

780
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:46,571
invention,

781
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:50,200
but what I'm saying is she's acting
as though like this was some sort of a

782
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:54,610
sacrifice that she basically bought him
something that would get her better Dick

783
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,430
and she's patting herself on the
back for it. It's fucking ridiculous.

784
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,750
I think it's clever.

785
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,520
It is clever because she's acting as
though she did something but she didn't

786
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:06,160
see this is it.

787
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,050
This is the thing about that is the
genius of women is you guys act like sex

788
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:12,520
doesn't feel good for you too.

789
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,810
You Act like you guys allowing
us to have sex with you,

790
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,370
like you don't want it and like this is
like you like waxing a floor and it's

791
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:24,100
just a big fucking pain in the ass.
You know,

792
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:27,850
she got some in that and that is like
celebrate story of their relationship as

793
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:30,790
opposed to like the typical dinner.
It's like it's about our intimacy.

794
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:34,240
It's about our connection. So why don't
we get something that will enhance that?

795
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,230
Yeah,
but this is the thing.

796
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,380
I got to go out and buy you like
some necklace or some let me go.

797
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,130
How do I get to wear it?
I got to take you out to dinner.

798
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,560
Celebrate and I pay for
the whole fucking thing.

799
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:47,050
It's all about the guy going out,
spending money on you,

800
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,670
getting you shit that you want,

801
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,960
and it's the precious for the
guy to show his love to you. Oh,

802
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:55,570
I know a white guy who can
dunk a basketball. All right,

803
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:58,480
let's stop talking about the exceptions.
I'm talking about the fucking rule here.

804
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:02,920
All right? Okay. You know what
I'm saying? Yes I do. Okay.

805
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:07,330
Alright. Right there we
go. This tapping out.

806
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,240
Fucking tapping out. Why?
Why? Why Do Women Act like
sex doesn't feel good to them?

807
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:16,480
Why do you, why do you, why do you guys,
can you please talk into the microphone?

808
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:18,400
I'm not like that, so I don't
know. I couldn't tell you.

809
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:22,840
You don't have any insight. I can't keep
this going. All right, let's keep going.

810
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:25,930
I don't really know. Women that are
like, Oh God, it's such a chore.

811
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,630
Like maybe in next 10 years when I was
making men will be complaining about that.

812
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:33,960
I Dunno, but, well, when I was making
fun of Valentine's Day this weekend,

813
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:38,430
some girl in the crowd was going
like, you know what? I said,

814
00:50:38,431 --> 00:50:42,270
well what did you do for it? And she
goes, she, he got to hit this and

815
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,520
yeah.
Yeah.

816
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,760
What can I just show up and be like,
hey, you get to suck this lady.

817
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,450
Never. This is you. Yeah. Never.
You never get to do that, right?

818
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,150
No, but I don't want it. Is the
planning about this, what it is,

819
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:04,760
if guys could ever stop being such
fucking sluts and giving it a well,

820
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:09,060
that's why women women don't respect Dick
is because it's so easy for him to get

821
00:51:09,061 --> 00:51:10,910
it. If you'd stop giving it away, if,

822
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,950
if every guy would just start
the day and fucking rub one out,

823
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:18,060
right world would be a lot more peaceful
at least until two in the afternoon.

824
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,710
By then your balls fill up again.
You start getting competitive wise,

825
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:26,190
his cubicle bigger than mine. Um, I
don't even know what I'm saying here.

826
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,360
It's just, it's, you know what it is?

827
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:29,550
It's just one of those things
that balances it out, right?

828
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,810
I could choke slam you on the floor
and you could cut off the sex and that

829
00:51:33,811 --> 00:51:38,100
balances out,
but it's illegal for me to hit you.

830
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,860
But for some reason it's not
illegal for you to cut off the sex.

831
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,610
And that right there people is
what's known as the tipping point.

832
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,110
And that's how you lose.

833
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,090
Yep.
Hi

834
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,933
Barry.

835
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,590
Hey,
what's going on?

836
00:52:13,591 --> 00:52:17,670
It is gopher and it is the Monday
morning podcasts for Monday,

837
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,620
February 14th,

838
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:27,260
2011 happy Valentine's Day. You Bunch, uh,

839
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:32,010
FEGS the fuck is wrong with you,
Huh?

840
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:33,241
Oh,

841
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:38,241

and fucking candy at cvs that isn't

842
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:43,410
love. Ah, you bunch of fucking sheep.

843
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:48,060
What are you doing?
The fuck is wrong with you.

844
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,420
Somebody ought to know where it tells
you this is the day you got to go.

845
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:56,250
Tell that fucking pain in the ass that
you love her. What she doing for you?

846
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:01,440
Ah, she paying for dinner tonight?
Did she have to go make reservations?

847
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:04,650
What the fuck is she going
to do other than get ready?

848
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,660
I got news for you. She's not
doing a fucking thing. All right,

849
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:12,600
so why don't you save yourself some money?
Pick a fight with their today.

850
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,720
All right, anything she
says. So you'd just be like,

851
00:53:16,721 --> 00:53:19,990
that's what this is what I'm talking
about. And then just storm out,

852
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,210
you know,
and just let her leave 40 messages.

853
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,890
You're not picking up and it's
scaring me. Okay? Just let's,

854
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,430
let's work it out and
just wait till tomorrow.

855
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,980
Just wait till tomorrow. It's plenty
of reservations at fucking candy.

856
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:41,700
75% off.
Come on people.

857
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:46,920
Come on fellas. You're better than this.
You're better than this. Don't get,

858
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,950
don't get sucked into this
stupid ass fucking holiday.

859
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,460
I know what you're thinking. Well,
what are you going to do? Work to fuck?

860
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:54,840
I'll tell you what the fuck I'm doing.

861
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:59,790
I sat down at a nice mature conversation
with my Horman and I said, listen,

862
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,040
this is fucking stupid.
All right.

863
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:06,720
There's every restaurant's
going to be packed. You know,

864
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,910
would you care for the heavily sheer
golf for $900 he went out and my,

865
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,820
can I just grab your fucking waiter face
and just shove it in something, right.

866
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,340
Gadget, whatever. You
know what I'm saying?

867
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,280
I actually worked it out with
my girl this year, said, listen,

868
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:22,410
I'll take you out on the 15th all right,

869
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,360
I'll take you to a nice fine restaurant
where there'll be plenty of goddamn

870
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,740
tables.
You know,

871
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:34,380
there won't be some sad fucking
immigrant with flowers coming by with an

872
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:39,060
accordion every five seconds, you
know, she's taking the night off.

873
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,470
We could sit there and actually enjoy
the Goddamn meal for Ra, you know,

874
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:49,250
only 30% markup as opposed to 200%
what I'm trying to save people is,

875
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,540
uh, if you want to find out if
you're with someone who's cool, Leah,

876
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:58,550
just see if they'll celebrate Valentine's
Day on like the 16th or the 15th,

877
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,603
you know,

878
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:05,130
it's like Vegas go there right after
the new years when new year when

879
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:07,530
everybody's fucking broke.
That's when you go,

880
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:12,390
you get a hotel room for like seven
bucks. Oh yeah. I'm telling you,

881
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:16,950
go on fucking orbits. You
think I'm lying to you? Um,

882
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:22,050
whatever. What do you,
what do you get it? I just,

883
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,050
I hate this holiday. All
right. I'm not a fan of love.

884
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,800
So this holiday annoys the
shit out of me and you know,

885
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,840
fans of my podcast should realize too. I
flip out like this on flag day. I don't,

886
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:37,230
I don't care if you have a flag. I don't
know. I don't have a problem with it.

887
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:37,501
You know why?

888
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,680
Cause there's no fucking social
pressure for me to go out and get one.

889
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,590
What kind of flagged it he gets
you. Oh, you only got you that one.

890
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,830
You know what that one means.

891
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,690
Why don't you fucking shove it
up your twat and dry it out.

892
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,930
Why don't you do that?
Oh, cheese is bill Jesus.

893
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,760
You're going to get that dirty, this
e early. Yes, I am. Listen people,

894
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:03,750

903
00:56:41,061 --> 00:56:45,070

Overrated. Underrated.

904
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,890
Just helped me out a little bit. Could
you guys, could you do that for me?

905

look at you,
look at you with your large iced coffee.

908
00:56:59,631 --> 00:57:02,450
Just sitting there waiting for
the world to fucking help you out.

909
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,090
Isn't it time you fucking hell.

910

Let me out. Please send all emails to
bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com.

911
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:12,660
But the God damn subject
in, in, in the title,

912
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,120
the subject and the subject line,
I put the title,

913
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:18,600
that's what the fuck I'm trying to
say here. And a the, and by the way,

914
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:23,130
I keep saying the official website of
the Monday morning podcast and I think I

915
00:57:23,131 --> 00:57:24,300
always forget to say the,

916
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,480
it's www.themmpodcast.com if you'd like
to follow along in your cubicle at work

917
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:37,170
on a plane, whatever the
fuck you want to do. So I'm,

918
00:57:37,171 --> 00:57:39,120
I'm actually doing this Sunday night,
once again,

919
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:42,120
I'm going to put it up nice
and early. So, uh, all my, uh,

920
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:47,150
my 17 fans in Great Britain and my
two fans in the Scandinavian area,

921
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,410
we'll actually get it on Monday morning.

922
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,390
So I don't have to listen to
people fucking bitching at me. Um,

923
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:56,790
I just went to a,

924
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:01,700
a Grammy's party. Can you
believe that? Happy me.

925
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:06,650
Went to a Grammy's party.
I lasted an hour and 20 minutes and um,

926
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:12,110
I watched the first little number
there, uh, where they had the, the,

927
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:15,500
the five whaling whores,
you know,

928
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,940
just screech like a bunch of God
damn alley cats. Like how did,

929
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,490
how did that become singing?
It's like they,

930
00:58:23,491 --> 00:58:28,040
they are amazing singers. All
right. The uh, the black chick,

931
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:31,580
it used to be the fat chick is now
the skinny chick. She's out there,

932
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:36,440
Waylon shaking her fucking we've around
Christina Aguilera with their fucking

933
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:40,880
booze face, right in her little
fucking special Horry Mike stand.

934
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,870
She's wailing away.
Then they had was at that Kathy Griffin.

935
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:49,800
Look and check all of them.
The old Whitney Houston looking broad.

936
00:58:49,801 --> 00:58:54,801
They dragged out all just hitting every
note that they could possibly hit every

937
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:59,970
12 fucking seconds. They sounded
like a bunch of fucking alley cats.

938
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:01,783
Whoa.

939
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,780
Oh,

940
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,560
shut up. Oh, Alia

941
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:12,510
the fuck is wrong with you.
Sing the God damn song.

942
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,213
You know,

943
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,080
you're fucking hold on to it
and then you surprise people.

944
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:20,070
Then you one unleash shit.

945
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,100
Just get up there fucking screaming like
someone standing on your foot that's

946
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:29,060
not fucking singing
all five of them.

947
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,370
Somebody can just needed to sit them
down. Oh, and then they're dead.

948
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:38,180
Fucking emaciated one comes
out, uh, Lady Gaga, right?

949
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:44,120
You know what? I can't stand.
I hate paint by numbers. Shock.

950
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,660
I can't fucking stand it.
And uh, but it's, it's a,

951
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,190
it's a very smart career choice.
She went,

952
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:56,470
she was on the red carpet and
she fucking was in, uh, uh,

953
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:02,270
what the fuck was she in? What is a proper
medical to an ovary? What the fuck was,

954
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:06,110
she was in a womb.
Her womb is so polluted.

955
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:10,010
She was in a fucking womb, right? I mean,

956
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:15,070
that is like fucking
page one of stupid ass,

957
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:20,710
like a stupid college student film from
like 1963 that was like shocking when

958
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:26,720
Jim Morrison first started shaving.
All right.

959
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,170
Jesus Christ,
you show up in the fucking thing.

960
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:33,260
More cues to be in that's
supposed to be artistic.

961
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,880
And everybody's supposed to be,
you know,

962
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,780
and I'm a tell you fucking right now
she's going to be around for 40 fucking

963
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:43,520
years because people who do
that shit, it's, I dunno,

964
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,580
I dunno
what's what she gonna do next year.

965
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:50,210
She's going to show up next year and like
an old shoe and then come out dressed

966
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:53,060
in like a sock, mini skirt, you know,

967
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:55,820
commenting on the shoeless
people in the fucking world.

968
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,910
And then she goes out and she
sings basically a Madonna Song.

969
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:03,920
I was at the party and
everyone was singing Madonna
song over it and it and it,

970
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:08,450
and it meshed perfectly with it.
Express yourself.

971
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:12,440
Sounded like what she was singing and
then she had all these fucking people

972
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,060
dancing around her.
Right.

973
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:19,540
And then they have like
that expressionless like a
post apocalyptic makeup on,

974
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:24,320
you know, that they owe hs was fucking
horrific. And at that point, you know,

975
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:28,460
at this point I'm in the kitchen and
I'm eating a fucking slice of cheesecake

976
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:32,270
just for what? What am I
eating it for? You know,

977
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:33,951
why am I eating?

978
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:38,630
I'm just doing that so I
can avoid that other shit.

979
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,050
It was horrific.
And I had a real brutal day.

980
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:47,330
I got a flat tire on my Prius.
Uh,

981
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,760
fuck. It was just for, you know,
it's one of those deals where the,

982
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:54,530
the front left tire was low.
All right.

983
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:00,320
And I see that it's low. So I go to a gas
station, I go, I'm like, well that's odd.

984
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:04,680
So I put air in the tire. This, this
whole fucking thing was my fault, right?

985
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,200
So I put air in the tire and then I just
kind of keep an eye on it and it's went

986
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:12,200
down a little bit, but not as
much as it had in back of my head.

987
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,680
My brain's going like, dude, what do,
what are you fucking idiot? Take it,

988
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,110
take it over to somebody and check.
You probably got a slow leak.

989
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,240
Maybe they can patch it, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. And I fucking blow it off.

990
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,780
Start driving 70 miles an hour. Just
completely ignoring the fucking thing.

991
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:28,410
You know, in the back of my head the
entire time I've owned the car, I'm like,

992
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,330
you know bill, you know, okay,

993
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,800
you know this thing has one of those
piece of Shit Jacks that you have to

994
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:37,140
assemble and then it has
that little hand crank.

995
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:41,820
Like I'm trying to start like a fucking
model t in the early 19 hundreds.

996
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:42,654
Right.

997
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,800
I knew that and I knew it was going to
have some half ass fucking that l shape

998
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:50,730
lug nut thing that you can get
like half a pound of torque on.

999
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:54,790
And there's no way to get the lug nuts
off cause they fucking put them on with

1000
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:59,790
death think and they don't, they, they
don't stop after it's tight and they go,

1001
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:06,360
oh they fucking, there's no way
to get that thing that you need.

1002
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,460
I knew what I needed.
I needed up.

1003
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:13,020
You need a big piece of pipe that
you fit over that piece of shit,

1004
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,210
right angle fucking lug nut thing.
And then he can,

1005
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:21,570
you can take them off and I didn't have
it. So whatever. So I went to go do,

1006
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,230
uh,
I went to go do the long shot podcasts,

1007
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:27,630
right?

1008
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:32,630
I was doing that fucking thing
and I'm driving out and um,

1009
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,990
I, I just hear this noise and my car
wasn't moving smoothly and I was like,

1010
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:40,740
do I have the emergency brake on? What
the fuck's going on? Then I go, Oh God,

1011
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:45,960
oh Jeez. And I pull over and their
am riding on the fucking rim.

1012
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:47,421
So I'm like,
now I,

1013
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:52,170
and I drive a Prius so I'm already on
for spare tires to begin with. Okay.

1014
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:56,490
God knows what the fucking temporary
spare is going to look like. Um,

1015
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,620
turns out, it looks like,
you know, when you used,

1016
01:03:58,621 --> 01:04:03,540
when you suck on a fucking a
lifesaver, a lifesaver, you know,

1017
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:05,460
and you know when you get to that point,
right when you have it,

1018
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:09,390
just try to keep sucking on it without
breaking it and you get to that point

1019
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:10,630
right before it breaks.
That's,

1020
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,580
that's what my temporary spare looks like
and the rim is painted bright yellow.

1021
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,280
Okay.

1022
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:20,660
Uh, I have a picture of it, which
will be up on the m M podcast.com. Um,

1023
01:04:20,661 --> 01:04:24,890
so anyways, anyway, she, uh,
I pull into a gas station,

1024
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,620
which back in the day 12
guys would attack my car.

1025
01:04:27,621 --> 01:04:30,200
And what had the fucking thing
changed before I even stopped.

1026
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:31,670
But now you show up,

1027
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:36,170
there's no garage at a gas station anymore
because that entire area is to sell

1028
01:04:36,171 --> 01:04:40,850
fucking a whole hose and snowballs
and gum.

1029
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:45,560
So I walk in, I say, yeah, listen, I got
a flat, can you, can you call a tow truck?

1030
01:04:45,561 --> 01:04:49,880
He goes, well, I mean I can basically
do what you do. I just call information.

1031
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:55,980
Sounds like I get it. I understand this
wasn't your dream in life, wasn't okay,

1032
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,130
I'll go fuck myself. So I go
back out to the hotel, a hotel,

1033
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:03,410
I go out to the fucking, uh,
the God damn parking lot, right?

1034
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,420
And immediately, you know, homeless
people start approaching me like, like,

1035
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:11,680
I mean a Zombie movie,
you know, you can't,

1036
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:14,750
you don't notice if you just
go to get gas at a gas station,

1037
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,230
you don't realize all the Weirdos.

1038
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:20,200
But when you're fucking sitting there and
you have a flat and there's nowhere to

1039
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:22,600
go, they just didn't come out of
fucking nowhere. And I'm like,

1040
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:26,530
why are they all these fucking homeless
people at a God damn gas station?

1041
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:31,110
I don't, I don't fucking understand it.
They don't have cars if fucking homeless.

1042
01:05:31,111 --> 01:05:34,710
Right? Why are they are,
are they at the gas station?

1043
01:05:34,711 --> 01:05:37,500
And it turns out I finally figured it out,
especially in La,

1044
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:41,310
which is everybody drives.
There's no one to panhandle to.

1045
01:05:41,311 --> 01:05:44,780
You need to get them when they're
getting out of their fucking cars.

1046
01:05:44,781 --> 01:05:48,090
So they hang up the god damn gas stations.
These people keep showing up,

1047
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:54,520
you know? Hey Meg, can you give me a
dollar? No, I can't go fuck yourself.

1048
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:58,390
All right. Because you
look like a drunk, sir.

1049
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:02,020
You don't look like a guy who lost
his job and he's down on his luck.

1050
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:06,970
You look like a fucking drunk.
All right. Fucking loser.

1051
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:11,200
Get outta here. Get a job. You're a bum.
You understand me? You're not homeless.

1052
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,740
You're a fucking bum. That was
my attitude. And anyways, so, uh,

1053
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,960
call up, you know, I
call up the tow truck,

1054
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,450
did that Shit,
you know?

1055
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:24,980
Okay.

1056
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,780
Then you call them back 20 odd,
20 minutes later they,

1057
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:31,970
Fred that 20 minutes up at
that bap bap APP, right?

1058
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:36,260
Fucking Deco's on 10 minutes was like
an hour and a half. And I was not,

1059
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,660
I want to 15 minutes and I was
just sitting there going like,

1060
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:45,420
what did I called at like three
and four, 10 past four. I was like,

1061
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:50,010
if this fucking Douche doesn't
get here by four 15, all right,

1062
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,290
I'm calling a friend,

1063
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:55,100
I'm going over to a hardware store and
I'm buying a piece of fucking pipe and

1064
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,690
I'm going to, I'm going to figure out
my jack and I'm gonna do this myself.

1065
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:02,760
But fortunately, this fucking guy finally
shows up with his giant Goddamn truck,

1066
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:05,220
which he leaves running,
which is fantastic, right?

1067
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,600
So we can just sit there breathing in
the fumes and uh, you know, whatever.

1068
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:14,050
He fucking change the
type, the god damn tire and

1069
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:19,270
this temporary spare is so God damn small.
Um,

1070
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:25,350
I just drove home with it and I parked
the car and I'm like, that's it. I'm done.

1071
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,340
I'm dry. I'm driving this car home and
then I'm driving it over to the dealership

1072
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:33,930
tomorrow. That is it. That is how
small this fucking tire is. Like the,

1073
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:38,700
what the fuck light was on,
on my dashboard with a temporary spare.

1074
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:43,260
So, uh, I don't know. That's my
fucking, that was my God damn day.

1075
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,940
That's what happened to me today.

1076
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:48,630
People don't really take
me 15 minutes to tell you.

1077
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:51,990
I've got to fucking flat on my car.
Are you really still listening to this?

1078
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:55,710
Are you, were you upset with
me? Um, somebody sent me
this article, actually the,

1079
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:59,070
the, uh, the person who
runs the m m podcast.com,

1080
01:07:59,071 --> 01:08:03,480
the official podcast page of the Monday
morning podcast, uh, sent me this,

1081
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,590
this article here.
Um,

1082
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:12,620
it's called the day of the lout l
o u t from the Los Angeles Times,

1083
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,480
and it's written,
um,

1084
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,850
bias actually by some guy,
believe it or not.

1085
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,150
And it says unsophisticated,
lazy,

1086
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:28,151
misogynistic males may be the primary
model for today's young American men.

1087
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,960
Uh,
and I'm sitting there going,

1088
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,940
where the fuck is this guy seeing this?

1089
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:38,840
Because all I see is a bunch of
pussy whipped fags, you know.

1090
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:40,910
All right.
Since the way he says,

1091
01:08:40,911 --> 01:08:45,470
if you've seen a beer commercial the last
two years and how can you avoid them?

1092
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:49,160
Well, you could read,
you could Tivo shows.

1093
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,200
See Right off the bat,
this guy's a do.

1094
01:08:52,201 --> 01:08:55,430
She's trashing men and now he has
problems with beer commercials.

1095
01:08:55,700 --> 01:09:00,620
How could you avoid them? I mean really.
Um, he says, you know, the tight,

1096
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:03,680
he's,
he's a 20 or 30 something,

1097
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:08,710
sort of a slacker with a beautiful and
adoring girlfriend who just can't seem to

1098
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:12,890
prize attention away from his suds.
She expresses ardor.

1099
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:17,630
He looks ardently at his mug or can
of beer. I don't know what art means.

1100
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:21,200
I don't even know if I'm pronouncing that
correctly. She wants to talk romance.

1101
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,710
He wants to talk anything.
But she gets exasperated.

1102
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:29,540
He snuggles obviously with his
beer and she departs in a huff.

1103
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:35,290
Most Martin takes on manhood say that
guys will do anything to bed a woman.

1104
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,350
But this is a new kind of man.
And He seems to be everywhere these days,

1105
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,250
not just on beer commercials,
but in movies, on TV,

1106
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:48,170
on hundreds of morning radio shows and
in bestselling books to the point where

1107
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:51,560
he's generating a culture
of new masculinity.

1108
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:57,230
He may even be the primary model
for young manhood in America today.

1109
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:58,761
All right?

1110
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:03,761
This guy has clearly decided to just
completely ignore how much women are

1111
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:12,281
fucking pandered to and how you can make
a guy look like an absolute retard in

1112
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:16,700
any commercial. They always
make the, for the most part,

1113
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:20,510
so many commercials make the guide
look like the moron. You know,

1114
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,190
I'm not saying 100%, but can't they have
a couple ones where the guy is a dick?

1115
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:30,600
I'm not saying in, in every, in
every commercial, every TV show,

1116
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:34,320
the guy's got to be cool and he should
act like he doesn't give a shit about his

1117
01:10:34,321 --> 01:10:35,370
wife.
But I mean,

1118
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:37,270
yeah,

1119
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,270
I dunno if I should legally
be saying this, but, uh,

1120
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,740
there there's three things that recently

1121
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:50,350
had, fuck, can I put this, uh,

1122
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,820
show ideas, pilots that are
being made out here in Hollywood.

1123
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,600
You want to hear him? Fuck it. Who
gives a shit? Okay. One of them was a,

1124
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:06,220
the idea was for a guy who's the audition
was to play a guy who actually speaks

1125
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,864
his mind,

1126
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:14,220
but the reason why he speaks his mind is
because he got hit on the head and had

1127
01:11:14,221 --> 01:11:18,720
a fucking aneurysm and he almost died.
So then they're thinking,

1128
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:22,590
is this some weird side effect that
a man is actually speaking as mine?

1129
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:23,071
I swear to God,

1130
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:26,880
this is the TV show that they're going
to put millions of dollars behind and a,

1131
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:30,620
and this is how he speaks his mind
in the pilot. He actually, uh,

1132
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,650
I, I might get in trouble if
I see what the material is.

1133
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:38,610
He makes a comment about how
big the girls asses, you know,

1134
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,980
but of course he likes it. He
likes it. Her ass is big. So it's,

1135
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,620
it's self serving to
women, you know? Yeah.

1136
01:11:46,621 --> 01:11:49,710
It's basically say, yeah, it's
great that now that we're married,

1137
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:52,260
you've become a dumpy fat.
Fuck sweetheart.

1138
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:57,840
I'm speaking my mind.
Totally pandering to the broads.

1139
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:02,970
Then there's another show
that's in development. I
guess I can talk about this.

1140
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:06,270
It's in fucking development. It's not
a God damn secret. This isn't, this is,

1141
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:10,300
I swear to God, this is the
premise of the show. Uh,

1142
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:13,680
two guys realize that
it's a woman's world.

1143
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:19,100
So they decide to dress as women to get
jobs at a pharmacy and through dressing

1144
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:23,250
like women, they become
better men. I swear to God.

1145
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,410
All right. And this is, I got
all of these auditions in a week.

1146
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:35,250
I said no to all of these. All right?
Because I would, I would become a,

1147
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:39,270
I would become an alcoholic. I don't
give a, I don't need, I don't need that.

1148
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,460
All right. I'm already a fuck up.
I can, there's no fucking way.

1149
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:46,461
And then the last one was a guy
who is in the shadow of his spouse,

1150
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:49,470
uh,
his,

1151
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:54,471
his famous spouse and get subset because
he's always teased that he's the wife

1152
01:12:56,461 --> 01:12:57,570
in the relationship.

1153
01:12:57,571 --> 01:13:01,950
And the guy's first name is
Gail could go either way,

1154
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,030
like gale sayers.

1155
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,873
Uh,

1156
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:09,450
yeah. So I don't know what the
fuck this is bitching about.

1157
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,170
And there's plenty of those.

1158
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:13,200
There's all those beer commercials
where the women are going like, yeah,

1159
01:13:13,201 --> 01:13:16,830
well I'll tell you what's a good beer
when you take your skirt off your half a

1160
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:18,180
fucking pussy,
right?

1161
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:22,380
All those ones and the guys wearing the
tight jeans and looking like Douche bags

1162
01:13:22,381 --> 01:13:24,510
and having sunglasses on.

1163
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:29,070
So this guy just chose to look at
this very small. This is like a guy,

1164
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,240
this Guy Neil.

1165
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,340
I bet he got the shit kicked out of him
in high school by guys like this. I mean,

1166
01:13:34,341 --> 01:13:35,940
what kind of a guy really gets annoyed?

1167
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:37,430
Okay.

1168
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:40,970
Buy Beer commercials.
Really? Are they really dumb?

1169
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,560
Do they really fucking appeal to
the lowest common denominator?

1170
01:13:45,561 --> 01:13:49,610
Of course they do. You fucking moron.
You want some art? Go rent a good movie.

1171
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,870
Well I think, oh, what is he like,

1172
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:56,980
like reminiscing back in the day
when they had good beer commercials,

1173
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:59,110
quality beer, commercial, sweat.

1174
01:13:59,111 --> 01:14:01,300
When they had those fucking
lizards talking to each other.

1175
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:03,493
I Dunno

1176
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,430
Neal Gabler go fuck yourself.
You guys,

1177
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,960
we wouldn't be trying to get laid this
week so that way you had to write that.

1178
01:14:09,961 --> 01:14:13,690
Louts. Um, so anyways,
did that go anywhere?

1179
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:18,240
Has This podcast gone anywhere to
22 fucking minutes in Jesus? Oh,

1180
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:22,210
fucking Jesus. Um, what's actually,
let's, let's read some things here.

1181
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:27,280
Yeah. Bill, that, that'll make it better
if you actually start to read, you know,

1182
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,780
it was funny. It was, I
sat there, it was at that,

1183
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,800
that God damn my Grammy Party and I was
trashing lady Gaga knowing in the back

1184
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,550
of my head it was annoying
the shit out of my girlfriend.

1185
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:42,370
She absolutely hates my
behavior when I go to parties.

1186
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,390
She can't stand it. She thinks I'm anti
social and she thinks, when I say things,

1187
01:14:46,391 --> 01:14:47,820
I just say douchey things.

1188
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:50,383
MMM.

1189
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,510
I Dunno what it is. She, someone
who kind of goes, I don't,

1190
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,910
I can't say she goes along, I don't know
what the fuck it is, but like, yeah.

1191
01:14:58,890 --> 01:14:59,723
MMM.

1192
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,830
She's not happy with me right now.
She doesn't like that.

1193
01:15:03,831 --> 01:15:07,790
I made fun of Lady Gaga who was
evidently singing express yourself.

1194
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:10,563
I Dunno.

1195
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:14,440
What the fuck was I supposed to
do? I walked in there. I just,

1196
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,250
I immediately didn't feel comfortable.
I just, I dunno. All right,

1197
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,510
let's plow ahead here.
Um, how about some advice?

1198
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:25,060
I haven't done one of these in a while
when I give something my bed. Oh,

1199
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:28,870
here's a guy bitching about a two
drink minimums at comedy clubs.

1200
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:33,310
Says a bilge. Jimmy Norton
is my favorite comic. Um,

1201
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:37,450
he's getting ready to go on right
now at the Melrose Improv. Yeah,

1202
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:42,130
Jim Norton played the Improv right here
in Melrose, right here in Los Angeles,

1203
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:46,570
um, Saturday night. So his
favorite comedian is Jimmy Norton.

1204
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:50,530
And uh, he says, I guess he's writing
this as the show's about ready to happen.

1205
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:54,280
He says he's ready to go on right now
at the Melrose improv Saturday night.

1206
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:57,610
Guess who's not there?
Not just me,

1207
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:02,230
but probably 50 other assholes that love
him and we could, would kill to see him.

1208
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:07,870
I know it's not Jimmy's fault. Uh,
it's not any of the performer's fault,

1209
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,790
but are any of these cock sucking
club owners aware that the economy,

1210
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:16,420
that the economy is in the
fucking toilet right now? No Sir.

1211
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:21,421
I'm sure they have no idea considering
when the economy goes into the toilet,

1212
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:26,470
one of the first things people
cut out his entertainment. Yeah,

1213
01:16:26,471 --> 01:16:31,471
I'm sure they're completely
immune to the economy economy.

1214
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,160
Sorry,
my voice is cracking.

1215
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:38,380
He said I've skipped most of the handful
of live type events I've wanted to see

1216
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:43,120
for the last six months or so because
of this exorbitantly priced shit.

1217
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:46,420
How can these clubs
justify selling the place,

1218
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,480
selling the place out with $25 tickets
to see the guy then charge their two

1219
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:55,030
drink minimum with their $8 beers,

1220
01:16:55,031 --> 01:16:58,570
$6 bottle waters and $10 mixed strengths.

1221
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,550
So when all is said and done,

1222
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,760
you've spent like $40 or more to see a
comic who can afford that kind of shit.

1223
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,640
I don't know sir.
With a paper route,

1224
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:16,280
you could really complaining that
it costs 40 fucking dollars. Sir.

1225
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,440
This is how it works.
Do you know how you have expenses in life?

1226
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:26,210
Club owners also have expenses.
They have to pay the comedian.

1227
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,153
All right.

1228
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,130
Okay.

1229
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:33,840
They have to pay taxes.
They have to pay to get a liquor license.

1230
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:38,250
They have to pay all of that shit and
then they have to pay their mortgages and

1231
01:17:38,251 --> 01:17:39,420
all of that type of stuff.

1232
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:44,630
And the reason why they have a two drink
minimum is because tight fucks would go

1233
01:17:45,631 --> 01:17:50,310
there and just order waters and they
wouldn't make any money and they would go

1234
01:17:50,311 --> 01:17:52,170
out of business.
All right,

1235
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:57,170
now I'm not mocking you because you can't
afford $40 I guess I kind of made of

1236
01:17:57,171 --> 01:17:58,440
it, but what the fuck, sir?

1237
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:04,440
$40 how much does it cost to go to a
football game? Cost 20 bucks to park.

1238
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:10,180
All right to go down and see the great
Jimmy Norton for $4 $40 you're going to

1239
01:18:10,501 --> 01:18:14,160
fucking complain about that because
you got to buy a couple of $10 Shirley

1240
01:18:14,161 --> 01:18:16,820
temples, you know, you know
what your problem is, Sarah?

1241
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,330
I don't think you have
your priorities straight.

1242
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,840
You don't look around your apartment,
you know?

1243
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,290
Okay.

1244
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:25,960
What do you got? You had to get a George
Foreman grill. How much did that cost?

1245
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,450
You know, does it really work? You know,
cooks chicken and fucking eight minutes,

1246
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,470
you know, how does that
taste? Was that worth it?

1247
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:41,660
You ever see fucking George Foreman's
house? She's got a key. So fucking rich.

1248
01:18:41,661 --> 01:18:45,510
He named all his kids the same goddamn
name. That's how fucking Richie is.

1249
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:50,570
Like he doesn't even give a fuck that
that he'd do something like that. Sorry.

1250
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:53,840
You're way out of line complaining about
that. Okay. You know what you sound like,

1251
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:57,770
you sound like all these kids today who
go on Youtube and they get upset when a

1252
01:18:57,771 --> 01:19:02,771
video gets taken down these fuck
goddamn copyright conch looks like.

1253
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:07,130
They don't seem to understand
that things cost money.

1254
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,410
So you have to charge for them.

1255
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:14,650
And when you put up hundreds of thousands
of dollars to produce a film or saw a

1256
01:19:15,201 --> 01:19:19,910
music or an album that if people just take
it and they put it on fucking youtube,

1257
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:25,460
you don't get your money back.
You know? So there you go. Sir.

1258
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:28,880
Believer in a, not a comedy
club, it costs money.

1259
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:35,420
So run a comedy club and not to mention
sometimes they give comedians guarantees

1260
01:19:37,381 --> 01:19:42,381
like no matter if five people show up a
500 we still have to pay you this amount

1261
01:19:42,841 --> 01:19:47,580
of money. And then when five people
show up, they lose their goddamn shirts.

1262
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:52,350
It's not like they're making tons of
fucking money every God damn weekend.

1263
01:19:52,351 --> 01:19:56,220
There's a lot of shit that goes into
it. And uh, like I said, you know,

1264
01:19:56,221 --> 01:19:59,310
people are tight fucks and if
you didn't make them buy drinks,

1265
01:19:59,311 --> 01:20:00,420
they would just sit there.

1266
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:04,050
They would booze in the parking lot and
then they would just fucking sit there

1267
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:05,820
and the club would go out of business.

1268
01:20:05,821 --> 01:20:10,680
So I think 40 to see a one of the
top comp comics in the country,

1269
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:14,250
I think that's pretty God damn
reasonable, eh. Uh, you know,

1270
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:16,770
I don't want to tell you how much
it costs to go to a fucking movie.

1271
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:23,710
At least half that is John Travolta
standing there live dancing for you.

1272
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:29,210
He isn't, I don't know.
Might be in a dick here.

1273
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:32,780
Where did I lose the funny
on this podcast is it's pre,

1274
01:20:32,781 --> 01:20:35,720
cause I already did an hour long
podcast for somebody else today.

1275
01:20:35,721 --> 01:20:40,320
I think I'm all podcast it
out. All right, let's get to,

1276
01:20:40,321 --> 01:20:43,320
is it racist, racist? Um,

1277
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:46,620
this is the new of the new fucking thing
here that everybody seems to like. Uh,

1278
01:20:46,621 --> 01:20:50,640
is it racist? Um, Bill, although
I thought, uh, also, uh,

1279
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:54,690
thought I'd share a little game that I
used to play. I like this one right here.

1280
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,270
This is a great game. You know,
I play that older Asian game.

1281
01:20:57,271 --> 01:21:01,920
Anytime anybody cuts me off in traffic,
uh, somebody says a turnoff. I,

1282
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:06,120
this is a game I like to play.
I turn on the TV and without looking,

1283
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:08,940
I try to guess the race
of the person talking.

1284
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:14,280
I call it the Tony Gwynn game.
Now,

1285
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:16,140
for those of you who aren't sports fans,

1286
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,560
Tony Gwynn is African American and he
sounds like a def jam comic imitating a

1287
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:26,560
White Guy.
If you closed your eyes,

1288
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,900
you wouldn't even think that you
were listening to a white guy.

1289
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:31,960
You would think you were listening
to a black guy imitating a white guy.

1290
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:37,410
He, he, he talks like
he basically like, yeah,

1291
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:41,300
I was talking to Ted Williams the other
day and he's really big on headache. Dad.

1292
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:43,680
Uh, I'm, I'm not, I can't even
do it. I'm not even doing it.

1293
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:45,810
Well not even doing it justice.

1294
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:47,270
Okay.

1295
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:51,670
And I asked him how to hit the
Ed side out curve ball. Um,

1296
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:56,340
the Tony Gwynn game. Yeah. Cause he is the
wildcard. Do you guys think it's racist?

1297
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:59,010
Like I remember back in the
day when the Oj trial when uh,

1298
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:03,560
someone said they heard some yelling and
it sounded like a black guy and people

1299
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:07,740
tried to say that that was racist and
it's like that is not fucking racist.

1300
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:13,480
You know what I mean? If
you heard somebody on the
other side of a fence going,

1301
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:18,400
ah, that's a petty smart. Right.
Would you be like, that's,

1302
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:20,620
I think that that guy could be Italian.

1303
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:26,700
Sorry for my Hacky fucking Asian
offensive, uh, accent there.

1304
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:29,790
But you know what I mean?
Like if you were to listen to me,

1305
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:32,700
not only would you know I was
a guest that I was a white guy,

1306
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,220
you would guess that I was
from the east coast one. Yeah.

1307
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:40,960
Just cause you can guess
who to fuck somebody is,

1308
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:46,260
doesn't mean it's racist. That's like so
much. Somebody who send me an email said,

1309
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,270
bill, he goes, you're, you're older.

1310
01:22:48,271 --> 01:22:51,330
Asian game is racist as shit.

1311
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:55,740
I'm sorry that that was the
person's entire fucking email.

1312
01:22:57,790 --> 01:22:59,260
It's like would call,
can you,

1313
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:03,430
can you elaborate a little
bit so you can enlighten me?

1314
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,350
Your game is racist

1315
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:08,570
as shit. Oh, well, you know,
thanks for clearing that up.

1316
01:23:08,571 --> 01:23:13,010
I don't know what you're apologizing
for. I hate when people say, I hate that.

1317
01:23:13,011 --> 01:23:17,690
That's like that fucking, uh, you
know, you know, I listened to your act.

1318
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:22,520
I didn't like it. You know,
I'm sorry I, but I didn't like,

1319
01:23:22,521 --> 01:23:25,010
why are you apologizing? I
hate like that whole, like,

1320
01:23:25,011 --> 01:23:27,920
you're assuming that you
fucking hurt my feelings.

1321
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:32,600
I don't give a fuck if you think
my game is racist or not. I know.

1322
01:23:32,601 --> 01:23:33,770
What is it?
I don't,

1323
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:38,420
I don't have any bad feelings
towards old people or Asians.

1324
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:43,580
I'm just addressing the fact that most
of the time out here when somebody does

1325
01:23:43,581 --> 01:23:46,430
something fucked up,
you know?

1326
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:52,520
Is it racist to say white people
can't dance because we can't.

1327
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:57,050
There are examples.
John Travolta.

1328
01:23:57,051 --> 01:24:01,310
I believe I already brought up that man
can dance, but it's not racist if some,

1329
01:24:01,311 --> 01:24:04,190
if somebody black told me said,
you know what?

1330
01:24:04,191 --> 01:24:08,810
White people cannot fucking dance.
You guys don't have any fucking rhythm.

1331
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,190
I when I sit there and that's not racist,
I'm sorry,

1332
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:17,500
but it isn't. Um, you know,

1333
01:24:17,501 --> 01:24:18,460
that's something I actually,

1334
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:22,080
that hasn't been brought up in this
whole is it or is it racist, racist, um,

1335
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,700
topic that I'm doing here is,
uh,

1336
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,760
I think that before you fly off the
fucking handle and get offended,

1337
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:35,560
you have to at least, you know, not
all the time, but 10% of the time,

1338
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:40,690
don't you feel that you kind
of have to own up to the fact

1339
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:42,563
that,

1340
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,050
ah,
how do I put this?

1341
01:24:45,051 --> 01:24:48,650
It's like when Arabs got upset
after nine 11 when they were,

1342
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:53,120
they were getting searched for no fucking
reason other than the fact that they

1343
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:57,330
were Arab. And that's definitely offensive
is definitely fucking annoying. And,

1344
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,280
and all of that type of shit.
But on some level,

1345
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:06,800
don't you feel you have a responsibility
to address the 18 Arabs that fucked it

1346
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,960
up for you.
You know,

1347
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:14,940
it's like that white people
can't fucking dance. All right?

1348
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,420
Are they can't jump or whatever.
I made,

1349
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,450
what am I supposed to do?

1350
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:24,150
You know how offended he is at some point
you've got your kind of gotta like I

1351
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:28,070
is one for you. Let me read, let me read
this shit here. Um, not raise my computer,

1352
01:25:28,071 --> 01:25:30,200
goes out a bill.
I can't really use names,

1353
01:25:30,201 --> 01:25:35,201
but I have a friend who was a Lineman
for a division one football school.

1354
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:39,240
He has a friend who plays in the
NFL as a wide receiver. He, the,

1355
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,570
the wide receiver is also white.
Um,

1356
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,860
my friend the Lyman told me that the wide
receiver told him that he's tried out

1357
01:25:45,861 --> 01:25:47,420
for four NFL teams.

1358
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:52,690
Two of the four told him his chances of
making the team were not good because he

1359
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:57,080
was white. I've had a few arguments
with people. Uh, is it racist?

1360
01:25:57,110 --> 01:26:02,110
Should the NFL should at the NFL teams
even mentioned the fact that he has less

1361
01:26:02,661 --> 01:26:04,370
of a, because he's white. Well,

1362
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:07,550
no they shouldn't because eventually
someone's going to sue over that.

1363
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:12,790
But that comes to that point I was making
were you also got to understand where

1364
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:18,920
the stereotype came from, all those
slow fucking white guys, you know,

1365
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:20,951
I mean,

1366
01:26:20,951 --> 01:26:24,610
one of the reasons why I think Dan Marino
never won a Superbowl was because of

1367
01:26:24,611 --> 01:26:26,410
fucking the Blackledge brothers.

1368
01:26:26,411 --> 01:26:31,120
He had two white corn evacs you can't
win a fucking Superbowl with two of them.

1369
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:34,750
Maybe one.
But I don't think he could win.

1370
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:40,220
He could win with too. Right. Am
I nuts? I remember, uh, the, the,

1371
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:44,080
the comic strip in a, in a New
York City. I went down there,

1372
01:26:44,081 --> 01:26:45,940
I auditioned in 1990.

1373
01:26:45,941 --> 01:26:50,941
I went and asked to audition and the guy
running the club told me I already have

1374
01:26:52,181 --> 01:26:57,181
enough white guys and I knew a lot of
comedians who got upset like that going

1375
01:26:57,281 --> 01:26:59,290
through. That's fucked up.
He would never say our,

1376
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:02,800
I already have enough black guys
and soak. Well, first of all,

1377
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:06,190
there's only like an eight black guys
working here. So he wouldn't say that.

1378
01:27:06,191 --> 01:27:07,030
And uh,

1379
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:13,120
I understood what he meant.
I knew what he meant.

1380
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:18,270
He meant you better have a fucking point
of view because I have enough fucking

1381
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:22,900
suburban white guys that can go on
and for 20 minutes be like, you know,

1382
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:28,130
soup with Bill Clinton, you
know, and table. I mean,

1383
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:30,620
which I knew I put it on once,
you know,

1384
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,920
crime is and stuff is all in the papers.

1385
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:39,630
Like he had enough people doing,
I totally understood what he was saying.

1386
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,190
He just kind of cut through the fat.

1387
01:27:41,191 --> 01:27:44,910
I got enough fucking white comics go
in there and do something different.

1388
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:47,160
All right. I have no use
for you. I understood that.

1389
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:50,850
And the only people who fucking complain,
we're lame ass white comedians.

1390
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,280
So what am I saying here? Am I justify?
I didn't want him fucking saying,

1391
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:00,030
I feel like I'm justifying it here. I'm
not, I'm not justifying it, but I also,

1392
01:28:00,031 --> 01:28:03,300
I'm just saying you got to tone down the
sensitivity here a little bit. You know?

1393
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:09,180
Right.
Older Asian is not racist as shit.

1394
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,510
There's an element of fucking truth to
it and there's no hatred in my heart when

1395
01:28:12,511 --> 01:28:14,400
I do it.
I just do it for the laugh.

1396
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:17,940
I don't drive around
screaming about Asian,

1397
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:20,550
an old people saying we need to
get him out of the fucking country.

1398
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,810
I've had it up to here with their goddamn
driving. They're ruining this country.

1399
01:28:24,811 --> 01:28:28,200
They need these old people need to go
back to what from where they came from.

1400
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:31,370
Um, isn't another one. Uh, so anyways,

1401
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:35,970
build tonight I was watching a TV show
and I saw a commercial for the Crisp for

1402
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:38,190
Chris Rock's Broadway show a,

1403
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:42,000
they never said the show's name and
simply referred to it as the title,

1404
01:28:42,001 --> 01:28:44,790
you can't say.
And on the screen,

1405
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:49,791
the second word of the title was black
was blackened out and it read the blank

1406
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:53,670
with the hat. I immediately
thought the n word with the hat.

1407
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:56,310
I was also interested in seeing the show.

1408
01:28:56,311 --> 01:28:59,400
So I promptly googled it with no results.

1409
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:04,290
I then went to Chris Rock's only to
find the title to the show was the

1410
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,730
motherfucker with the hat.

1411
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:10,700
I proceeded to laugh and then thought of
you and your bid. Is it racist? Racist.

1412
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,310
So, uh, was that racist bill?

1413
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:14,300
Okay.

1414
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,730
I was on the edge,
but generally thought it was funny.

1415
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:19,640
We'd love to hear your thoughts
and your girlfriends too. Well,

1416
01:29:19,641 --> 01:29:20,630
a knee is not here right now.

1417
01:29:20,631 --> 01:29:25,250
She's mad because of my behavior
at the grammys at the Grammy Party.

1418
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:30,030
Uh, do I think it's racist? No, that's
what I would've guessed. You know, such,

1419
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,590
it's such a big deal is made
out of that word. The title.

1420
01:29:33,591 --> 01:29:37,250
You can't say Chris
always does edgy stuff.

1421
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:39,320
That's what I would have gone with.

1422
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:40,950
Okay.

1423
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:41,783
You know,

1424
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,910
I'm surprised you can't say the
motherfucker with the hat at this point.

1425
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:48,420
I watched 60 minutes tonight
and Andy Rooney said, God damn.

1426
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,110
And they didn't bleep it out.
So do I think it's racist? No,

1427
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:54,510
I think I don't.

1428
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:59,890
A lot of people would think it
was just because you thought the,

1429
01:29:59,891 --> 01:30:04,100
the n word fit in there.
But I, I maintain this.

1430
01:30:04,101 --> 01:30:07,860
Maybe I'm fucking wrong. You
guys can email me, but I,

1431
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:11,710
I really think it comes what's
in your heart when you, when you,

1432
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:15,670
when you're thinking that, I mean,
you were just thinking all the word.

1433
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:19,210
You can't say the title, you can't
say it's always saying, you know,

1434
01:30:19,211 --> 01:30:23,230
the n word white people can't
say. You can't say that. You know?

1435
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:27,390
So I, I, no, I don't think that
that's racist and I have the, and I,

1436
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:29,280
and I would have laughed
too when I've read that.

1437
01:30:29,281 --> 01:30:33,160
That was actually the motherfucker with
the hat. So, no, no, I don't. All right,

1438
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:36,880
here we go. Uh, Hey Ben,
here's another one. Hey Bill.

1439
01:30:36,881 --> 01:30:41,280
Huge fan of up. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Uh,

1440
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:46,490
anyways, I have, I have, uh, uh,
is, is it racist question at my job,

1441
01:30:46,491 --> 01:30:51,200
I work with the guy who's not
really Mexican, but his father is

1442
01:30:57,140 --> 01:31:01,220
what, what, so what does that
mean? Because he's not 100%
Mexican because he's had,

1443
01:31:01,221 --> 01:31:02,630
that would make him half Mexican.

1444
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:04,230
Okay.

1445
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:05,940
You know,
what are you saying?

1446
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:10,070
He's like a light beer in the Mexican
version of that. Um, so anyways, he's,

1447
01:31:10,071 --> 01:31:14,490
he's not really Mexican, but his
father is, uh, he's from Arizona,

1448
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,530
but he looks the type,
I don't get any of that.

1449
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,580
So he's half Mexican, but he looks
full on Mexican is that's what,

1450
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,200
is that what you're saying? I don't
think this one's going to end good.

1451
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:28,290
I'm going to go on out on a limb
here. Uh, were okay friends,

1452
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:32,490
but he can be a huge dick sometimes that
occasionally I say something that could

1453
01:31:32,491 --> 01:31:37,020
be considered racist,
like shut up. Beaner uh,

1454
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:40,650
but this one time he was working really
hard and I just walked by and said,

1455
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:43,140
you people always,

1456
01:31:43,570 --> 01:31:48,570
you people always working hard for little
wage and he was being a huge Dick that

1457
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:53,520
day. Um, before I said that and
he just laughed and we moved on.

1458
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:58,380
My question is, is it racist to say
those type of things if the guys,

1459
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:03,400
if the guy's being a complete
jack off and deep down you feel,

1460
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:10,340
you feel like it shows them
they're being a dick. Ah, yes.

1461
01:32:10,341 --> 01:32:11,720
I do think that's racist.

1462
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,500
I think if you just said Shit like that
as the joke and you guys were friends

1463
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:20,900
and you were fucking around, it isn't,
but because of the way you're using it,

1464
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,000
like when he's being a Dick,
you feel like it,

1465
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:29,330
it shows them that they're being a dick
by saying something racist to him. Yeah.

1466
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,910
You're kind of taking it out of the,
uh,

1467
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:35,270
the joke in arena and I'm going to teach
this guy a lesson and put him in his

1468
01:32:35,271 --> 01:32:38,440
place. So, uh, and plus also your,

1469
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:41,900
your fucking kind of naive statements
of he's not really Mexican,

1470
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:46,430
but his father is, but
he looks the part. Yeah.

1471
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:52,340
Yeah. I'd say I'd be in a, you know, in a
bar with you and probably, I don't know,

1472
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:57,190
about 20 minutes. Then you'd say something
that I would be like, you know? Yeah.

1473
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,230
I could get, what did you say? Could you
say that? Could you repeat that? You know,

1474
01:33:00,231 --> 01:33:03,440
trying to, with the jukebox
noise in the background. Yeah.

1475
01:33:03,441 --> 01:33:07,550
But you ever had that in a fucking bar,
you just hanging out.

1476
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,700
It happens to me all the time on the
fucking road. Back when I was boozing,

1477
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:13,090
I'd be out there and I would just be a,

1478
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:17,360
I'll tell you one of the weirdest ones
I ever had. I did this bit on, uh,

1479
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:18,510
okay.

1480
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:23,340
Uh, Jamie Foxx laugh a
Palooza thing. Um, Jamie Fox,

1481
01:33:23,341 --> 01:33:27,780
by the way, who plays my shit all
the time on his channel, on uh,

1482
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,210
on Sirius Xm, the foxhole. I've had more
goddamn people come up to me saying,

1483
01:33:33,211 --> 01:33:36,840
I heard you on the Fox hole. I thought you
were funny. That's why I came up to my,

1484
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:41,730
uh, out to your show. So thank you to
everyone over there. Um, but anyways,

1485
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:46,760
so I did this bit and it was a story
that happened to me when I was at,

1486
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:50,820
when I was in Nashville,
Tennessee. I was, uh,

1487
01:33:50,821 --> 01:33:53,730
I was drinking in the bar by myself.
God,

1488
01:33:53,731 --> 01:33:58,350
that sounds like such a great fucking
idea. 120 days. Then people, oh,

1489
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,390
does that sound like a good idea?
Drinking by myself.

1490
01:34:00,391 --> 01:34:03,680
I got damn bar at a couple of fucking,
um,

1491
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,550
I'm in Nashville, Tennessee
and Tarell Owens, this is like,

1492
01:34:10,551 --> 01:34:13,370
I don't know how many fucking years ago,
but he was doing what he always does.

1493
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:18,230
Starts off good with the team, then it
becomes a total fucking cunt. So I said,

1494
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,600
I said, something's effective.
Can you believe this fucking guy?

1495
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,990
How much goddamn money do you need to
make before you're not a dick? Like,

1496
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:25,490
what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

1497
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:27,890
And uh,

1498
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:31,500
Oh God, it's been so long since
I remember this I the guy,

1499
01:34:31,501 --> 01:34:35,330
I'll tell you what the fucking problem
is because the guy's a fucking end.

1500
01:34:35,331 --> 01:34:36,840
He just dropped the n word

1501
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:39,023
and

1502
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,880
out of fucking note.
And I immediately was just like,

1503
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,360
okay.

1504
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:47,270
I immediately though, how
was it? I immediately looked
around, I was like, Oh fuck,

1505
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:52,190
I'm going to get fucking some black dude
is going to punch this guy in the face

1506
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:55,520
through my head, cause I'm standing next
to him like, I'm going to get fucking,

1507
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,000
they're gonna think I'm with this
guy. So that, that was, that's right.

1508
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:01,190
This has been a long time since I
told the joke. That was the joke.

1509
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:05,990
So the joke was basically he dropped
the fucking inward. Uh, that's right.

1510
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:09,200
He didn't say what the Aa, he said what
the R and he didn't pull up on the yard.

1511
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:11,510
He fucking stuck the landing.
That's how the joke went.

1512
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:16,820
And I felt like I just wished it was
somewhere I could just act like they show

1513
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:20,180
was some something that I could have done
in that moment to immediately say like,

1514
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:24,860
I didn't know this fucking guy. You know,
I had no idea everything was normal.

1515
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:28,220
We would talking football and out of
nowhere he starts with this clan rally

1516
01:35:28,221 --> 01:35:31,160
bullshit. So, uh,

1517
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:32,800
okay.

1518
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,220
And I remember too,
like

1519
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:40,090
I didn't roll with what he said and I
forget what I said, but he clearly knew

1520
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:41,300
okay

1521
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:46,300
that I was annoyed by him and then he
tried to fix it real quick and try to say

1522
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:52,670
like, I'm not saying they're all
like that. There are some good ones.

1523
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:54,710
And then it was fuck,
it was like a fucking sick home.

1524
01:35:54,711 --> 01:35:58,430
And then five seconds later, some
black dude comes walking in, right.

1525
01:35:58,431 --> 01:36:00,080
And then he's like,
oh, hey, how you doing?

1526
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:03,950
He's trying to be over friendly to the
guy in some way to make up for the fact

1527
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:05,450
that he dropped the n word to me.

1528
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:07,170
Yeah.

1529
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:08,970
And the,
and the whole fucking thing was phony.

1530
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:13,710
And then I felt like he was dragging me
into it and I wanted to say to the guy

1531
01:36:13,711 --> 01:36:14,461
at that point like,
hey,

1532
01:36:14,461 --> 01:36:17,070
why don't you tell that guy some of the
shit you were just saying to me five

1533
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:19,440
seconds ago, you know,
all that classic shit.

1534
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:21,930
When you think of all the funny stuff
you should've said the moment, you know,

1535
01:36:21,931 --> 01:36:26,280
20 minutes fucking later. Um,
so anyway, so I basically,

1536
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:29,130
I turned that into a bit and I did
it on the laugh, a Palooza thing.

1537
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:32,370
So like three years later,

1538
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:36,960
I'm in North Carolina
working in this club.

1539
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:38,490
And uh,

1540
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:43,470
afterwards I'm standing there and I'm
talking to this dude who is like the most

1541
01:36:43,471 --> 01:36:47,640
stereotypical redneck guy ever.
You know,

1542
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:50,490
just talking lock the edge,
but they or be like if,

1543
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:55,080
if like if someone from the north did
that accent on TV would be considered like

1544
01:36:55,081 --> 01:36:59,280
offensive. That's all. Like how fucking
hardcore this guy was. You know, you know,

1545
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:04,281
I was on my tractor the other day and I
was listening to one of my pigs got out

1546
01:37:05,741 --> 01:37:09,750
it, how's labs are you
stop? I'm barely catch him.

1547
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,180
I mean like telling me stories like that.
Right.

1548
01:37:12,690 --> 01:37:14,940
But then he starts
talking about my comedy.

1549
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:16,450
Okay.

1550
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:19,240
And he was really breaking it
down and just talking about

1551
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,940
like in a really intelligent
way was breaking the thing down.

1552
01:37:22,941 --> 01:37:26,150
I was sticking in my head like this is
why I love doing the road because you

1553
01:37:26,151 --> 01:37:29,480
meet all these fucking people,
you have all these preconceived notions.

1554
01:37:29,481 --> 01:37:30,740
I'm a fucking looking at this guy.

1555
01:37:30,741 --> 01:37:35,480
Like this guy's a God damn hillbilly and
here he is breaking down comedy and my

1556
01:37:35,481 --> 01:37:36,710
act in particular

1557
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:42,910
like borderline on the level that
a comedian could. So I was like on,

1558
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:46,350
this is why I love doing the road. This
is why, this is what makes you worldly.

1559
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:51,060
This is how you know it makes you, you,
you stop thinking ignorant shit, you know,

1560
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,490
which is hilarious. All the
ignorance, should I say on my pocket,

1561
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,900
whatever makes you less ignorant.

1562
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,890
So right as I'm having that feel
good moment thinking about this dude,

1563
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:03,990
I forget what the fuck, what the fuck
happened. But then out of nowhere he,

1564
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:07,290
he said he was telling a story.
Oh.

1565
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:11,700
And he actually alluded to the tea
actually brought up the joke that I,

1566
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:15,270
the story that I told about being in
Nashville and then the guy dropping the n

1567
01:38:15,271 --> 01:38:19,140
word and he knew why it was funny
and he broke that whole joke down.

1568
01:38:19,141 --> 01:38:22,350
He had this really redneck Yat accent
and I was like, look at that. See you.

1569
01:38:22,351 --> 01:38:25,110
They're not all fucking racist right then.

1570
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:28,710
I don't know where he starts telling some
fucking story, trying to make me laugh.

1571
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:33,810
And He, and then his punchline,
he'd gotten himself into
some sort of predicament.

1572
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:38,700
And then his punchline was, I was more
nervous than an end war than Mike Tice.

1573
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:43,310
No, I was more nervous than
an n word in a, in a, uh,

1574
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:45,300
in a spelling bee or something.

1575
01:38:45,301 --> 01:38:49,110
He dropped the fucking
inward and I remember going

1576
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:51,160
okay.

1577
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,570
And I just said out loud to myself
with the fucking music was so loud.

1578
01:38:54,571 --> 01:38:57,660
I was just, I was just like,
and then that happened.

1579
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:02,190
So I said to the guy, I got, dude,

1580
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:07,220
you just broke down that fucking joke
where I talked about somebody doing that

1581
01:39:09,161 --> 01:39:14,030
and then five minutes later you do it.
And he says,

1582
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:15,420
Hell Yeah,
I love that joke.

1583
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:19,850
Like he still didn't get it and I th
three times I fucking went in trying to

1584
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,990
explain to him what the fuck just at,
why would you do that?

1585
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:29,480
And uh, just never fucking dawned
on him. And then I, I just,

1586
01:39:29,481 --> 01:39:30,260
uh,

1587
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:35,260
he was talking to me and I just walked
off like mid sentence as he [inaudible]

1588
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:39,640
fabric fear and I just
fucking walked away. Uh, uh,

1589
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:41,510
uh,
what else?

1590
01:39:41,511 --> 01:39:45,380
Then I went to the other side of the
bar and I remember there was these four

1591
01:39:45,381 --> 01:39:48,740
chicks were dancing on the bar
doing the coyote ugly thing.

1592
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:53,660
And one of them was a fat chick who was
not sexy but was dancing in a very sexy

1593
01:39:53,661 --> 01:39:57,290
way. And I remember being annoyed
at her. I was really fucking annoyed

1594
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:02,650
that she had the confidence to do
that. I was like, why? You're horrific.

1595
01:40:02,651 --> 01:40:05,020
You should be off the bar doing sit ups.

1596
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:08,050
You should feel shame and you don't.

1597
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:10,030
Yeah.

1598
01:40:10,030 --> 01:40:13,040
And I dunno. Normally that would
have made me laugh I guess,

1599
01:40:13,041 --> 01:40:14,510
but maybe cause what the fuck happened?
Dove,

1600
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,630
I just remember being really annoyed.
Uh,

1601
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:22,850
I don't fucking know. Do you know I
went on, I had such a fucked up week.

1602
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:25,880
I don't even know what that fat chick
just reminded me of something I went to.

1603
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:29,720
I went on a couple's date
to a cheesecake factory. Um,

1604
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:34,980
and in defense they said, look, we
don't have to go there, but you know,

1605
01:40:34,981 --> 01:40:36,120
they got kids and shit.

1606
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:39,090
They just picks something quick and
you people know how I feel about the

1607
01:40:39,091 --> 01:40:41,400
cheesecake factory. But I was like,
you know, I don't give a fuck.

1608
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,130
It's better than Apple Bee's.
I'll go over there. It's,

1609
01:40:44,131 --> 01:40:46,090
you know the talking
about going in an hour.

1610
01:40:46,091 --> 01:40:48,690
So I go over there and I just want to
tell you guys something just in case,

1611
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:53,840
just in case you don't know the
cheese cake factory fucking sucks.

1612
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:57,920
All right? It's, that is horrible food.

1613
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,670
Horrific,
horrible fucking food.

1614
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:06,710
And the reason why I'm saying this is
because every time I fucking walked by one

1615
01:41:06,711 --> 01:41:09,350
of them,
it is jam packed with people.

1616
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,840
Line out the fucking door.

1617
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:16,990
Everybody holding those little vibrating
things waiting to get called to go into

1618
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:21,050
to to a fucking table, which is exactly
what happened to us. And I went in there,

1619
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:23,060
I ordered the Colby Beef Burger.

1620
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:28,180
I went as high up on the menu as I could
and I still felt like I fucking ate a

1621
01:41:28,401 --> 01:41:33,401
part of my God damn dresser just sitting
in my fucking stomach like a Goddamn

1622
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:36,950
old boot.
Horrible fucking food.

1623
01:41:36,951 --> 01:41:41,270
Can you people please stop
going to that restaurant?

1624
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:46,070
Sorry. He was telling me tonight
they don't even advertise on TV.

1625
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:50,870
They don't have to people just line.
They just think it's fucking good.

1626
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:54,860
Like Lady Gaga

1627
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:59,630
coming in and that fucking
egg from the morgue show.

1628
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:05,590
You know what's going to kill me is when
people just going to talk about like

1629
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:07,810
how outrageous that was.
You know,

1630
01:42:07,811 --> 01:42:10,030
who thinks like that type
of shit is outrageous.

1631
01:42:10,031 --> 01:42:13,570
People who fan themselves with
their hands when they begin to cry.

1632
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,320
If you ever seen people like that,
when they start getting emotional,

1633
01:42:17,321 --> 01:42:18,490
they fan their face.

1634
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:25,570
What the fuck I'm talking about anymore?
Let's get the youtube videos.

1635
01:42:25,571 --> 01:42:27,820
At this point.
I'm really in a fucking grumpy ass mood.

1636
01:42:27,821 --> 01:42:31,000
I had a bad burger this weekend.
I had a fucking flat tire.

1637
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:32,770
Okay,

1638
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:37,750
got it. God Damn yellow spare goddamn
breath mint for a fucking temporary spare.

1639
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:41,560
This is just a miserable fucking
podcast and I was in a good mood too.

1640
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:47,380
All right, you two videos of
the week. Uh, NFL trick shot,

1641
01:42:47,381 --> 01:42:51,650
white quarterback, uh, check
this. These are all on the Mlm,

1642
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:56,140
podcast.com. By the way, I'm this
fucking kid's amazing. You know,

1643
01:42:56,141 --> 01:42:57,790
I know a lot of them, you know? Okay.

1644
01:42:57,791 --> 01:43:00,640
How many attempts did he make
to make the fucking throw?

1645
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:05,020
But there's a couple where he does like
to three um, tricks all in one take.

1646
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:10,180
Very impressive. But at the
end of the video, oh, okay.

1647
01:43:10,230 --> 01:43:13,780
Let me fucking hiccups at the end
of the video. Candy Brita Defense.

1648
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:17,330
Here's another one. This kid, uh, just uh,

1649
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:21,000
if you want to see just a
great fucking story teller. Um,

1650
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:22,570
I don't even know if this
is the name of the video,

1651
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:24,820
but this is Baltimore storyteller.

1652
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:28,150
The fuck this guy tells a story about,
uh,

1653
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:31,660
oh his dad sent him to the corner store,

1654
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:32,990
okay.

1655
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:37,070
For some bread and he has to get by
some gang bangers in this fucking guy.

1656
01:43:37,071 --> 01:43:40,050
I watched like three of his videos.
It's just phenomenal.

1657
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,490
Just a phenomenal fucking storyteller.

1658
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:46,250
I love telling stories and I nothing
more like then listen to a great

1659
01:43:46,251 --> 01:43:47,420
storytellers.
This kid's great.

1660
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:52,100
So check that out and check out all those
other videos. A midget wrestler flying.

1661
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:56,010
All right? If you ever wanted
to see a midget in a, uh,

1662
01:43:56,360 --> 01:44:00,920
dressed up like a baby gorilla,
get kicked by a fat bald guy,

1663
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:02,010
I believe the guy's bald.

1664
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:06,170
And then go flying ass over tea
kettle in land on another wrestler.

1665
01:44:06,171 --> 01:44:09,320
This is the video for you
and a funny drum video.

1666
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:13,120
I love this video because the
guy's fucking hilarious. Uh,

1667
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,500
English seems to be his third language.

1668
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:21,170
I put that on the high hat that they
high had that one, the one tote tray.

1669
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:25,850
Okay. And uh, and no one told Trey. Okay,

1670
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:30,410
that's literally, this is how this
guy fucking gives the the drum lesson.

1671
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,770
But then he proceeds to play
this fucking sick drum groove,

1672
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:38,360
which I still can't fucking play.
Um, so the guys like awesome.

1673
01:44:38,361 --> 01:44:43,150
It's just a pharmacist like a
second or third language. Um, oh,

1674
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,620
and if you want to see another
great wrestling, just horrific.

1675
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:50,720
The WCW dungeon of doom, full segment.
I don't know who wrote this shit.

1676
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:56,120
Um, but it is horrific in a
phenomenal fucking way. Uh,

1677
01:44:56,121 --> 01:44:58,790
what else do I got in here?
Oh, here's some advice.

1678
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:03,980
Somebody wants a bill. My girlfriend
looks like a centerfold. Good for you.

1679
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:07,340
She's blind.
She has a beautiful face,

1680
01:45:07,341 --> 01:45:12,260
a tiny waist in giant cans.
I have outdone myself.

1681
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,940
Well, what the fuck, man? Don't you
sell yourself short? Maybe you're,

1682
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:19,640
maybe you're a, you're a
stud. So he says, however,

1683
01:45:19,641 --> 01:45:22,970
having a girlfriend of such
caliber as you might imagine,

1684
01:45:22,971 --> 01:45:27,260
comes with its share of problems.
Ooh, Jesus. Here we go. Like,

1685
01:45:27,261 --> 01:45:30,380
uh, like your good self.
I battle my battle,

1686
01:45:30,381 --> 01:45:34,100
keeping my temper under control at
times and particularly struggle when my

1687
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:36,950
girlfriend and I go out in
public together. In short,

1688
01:45:36,951 --> 01:45:40,130
the amount of male attention
she gets is ridiculous.

1689
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:42,680
And at times it's infuriating.

1690
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:48,230
Have you ever found you found yourself
out with a girl and notice that every man

1691
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:53,231
within a three mile radius from the
sweaty 22 year old walking boner to the

1692
01:45:54,591 --> 01:45:55,101
porky,

1693
01:45:55,101 --> 01:45:59,960
sexually frustrated father of three is
blatantly staring at her tits in her ass.

1694
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:05,360
Um, I've always been of the opinion
that if a girl is obviously with a guy,

1695
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:07,160
whether you know him or not,

1696
01:46:07,161 --> 01:46:12,161
it's a gentleman's code not to have a
staring contest with there with her,

1697
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:15,410
with her a ring piece.
I don't know what that means.

1698
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:18,670
What's that looking at her pussy. I have
no idea. This guys from Australia. Um,

1699
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:22,910
if a girl is alone or with girlfriend,
sure. Objectify the shit out of her.

1700
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:26,960
But I think if a girl is holding hands
with their boyfriend and you make it

1701
01:46:26,961 --> 01:46:31,610
obvious that your helmet is pressing
against the inside of your front Zipper,

1702
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:35,450
then you're a cunt. Um, nothing
serious has happened yet,

1703
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:37,250
but the weather is getting warmer.

1704
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:44,840
The outfits are getting smaller and I'm
concerned I'm going to wind up with,

1705
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:48,740
I'm going to wind up with some perverts
blood and quite possibly come on my

1706
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:52,050
hands all for now. Um, all right.

1707
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:57,210
All right. This is a tricky
situation, sir. You know,

1708
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:01,920
is a very tricky situation.
You know,

1709
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:05,370
there's a price you pay for everything.
All right?

1710
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:10,170
You're the one who has his centerfold
fucking girlfriend with a great ass and

1711
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:14,250
Nice set of fucking tits and
a, you just, you just have to

1712
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:19,820
this, this, this is, this
is how I look at this shit.

1713
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:22,770
As long as you're,

1714
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:27,771
a woman isn't going around trying to
get attention if she's just fucking

1715
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:32,050
standing there and she's so goddamn
stunning that men are looking at her,

1716
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:34,630
but you know, she's not, Ooh,

1717
01:47:34,631 --> 01:47:39,610
I dropped my lipstick and then slowly
bending over at the waist while looking

1718
01:47:39,611 --> 01:47:42,550
over her shoulder. Um,
if she's doing that,

1719
01:47:42,551 --> 01:47:46,990
I can tell you right now a banger
another couple of times and then fucking

1720
01:47:46,991 --> 01:47:51,510
dumper because she's going to be an
absolute fucking nightmare and a,

1721
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:53,110
and you don't need that in your life.
Okay.

1722
01:47:53,111 --> 01:47:57,840
But if she's just a
stunningly gorgeous woman, um,

1723
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:01,720
you, that kind of comes with it. And, uh,

1724
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:05,860
if you lose your fucking temper
and you start acting like a maniac,

1725
01:48:05,861 --> 01:48:08,890
that's a great way to eventually
annoy the shit out of her.

1726
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:13,750
And because she can't help
it. Like I said, if she's
not trying to get attention,

1727
01:48:13,751 --> 01:48:18,060
she can't help it, that
she's gorgeous. And, uh,

1728
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:21,550
if you then,
it's in this weird way,

1729
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:24,280
you're giving her shit for being herself,

1730
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:28,600
which is not fun for anybody and then
you're going to have a problem. So.

1731
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:30,180
Okay.

1732
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:34,680
Um, I don't know how to, if you
know what it's like, it's like a,

1733
01:48:34,681 --> 01:48:38,130
it's like when I whore myself out at
the end of my shows and I sell DVDs.

1734
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:41,700
All right? I don't have to do that,
but I choose to do it and I'm standing.

1735
01:48:41,701 --> 01:48:43,290
It was a choice I fucking made.

1736
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:46,560
And then I stand there and what's
going to happen? I answered this. Yeah.

1737
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:49,350
This is one of these podcast questions.
All right.

1738
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,380
Eventually somebody is going to come up
and they're going to fucking insult me.

1739
01:48:52,381 --> 01:48:55,380
He's telling me they didn't
like my act. Tell me. Uh,

1740
01:48:55,381 --> 01:48:58,830
they didn't think I was as funny as when
they saw me on TV and I can't get mad

1741
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:02,670
because it's my fucking fault for
standing there like an asshole.

1742
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:08,850
Just, you know, I, I put myself on the
dunking store and I got to admit, sir, if,

1743
01:49:08,851 --> 01:49:12,300
if you're, if this, if your girl
is the way that you describe her,

1744
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:16,080
you just have to accept that it's,
it's par for the course and uh,

1745
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:20,130
just give yourself a little halftime
speech before you go up. You know,

1746
01:49:20,131 --> 01:49:24,090
I'm not going to lose my shit. Um, but

1747
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,120
if it is overt,
uh,

1748
01:49:28,121 --> 01:49:33,121
there has to be a way that you can fucking
address it without pissing her off,

1749
01:49:33,461 --> 01:49:37,900
without, you know, you also don't
want to get into a fucking fight. Um,

1750
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,180
I dunno. Just say, hey buddy can, can
you eliminate it to like, you know,

1751
01:49:44,181 --> 01:49:47,470
five second shifts of staring at her tea.
I can't say tits.

1752
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:49,920
Okay.

1753
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:54,350
Uh, I don't know what you do.
Do that. That's a rough one.
That's a rough run. They,

1754
01:49:54,351 --> 01:49:55,840
man,
that takes me back to being

1755
01:49:58,690 --> 01:50:01,300
Jesus Christ. I was like 21
years old. I went on this,

1756
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:05,440
I went out on a date with this girl who
was well out of my fucking league just

1757
01:50:05,441 --> 01:50:07,660
because I didn't have the
confidence to fucking be with her,

1758
01:50:07,661 --> 01:50:08,494
you know what I mean?

1759
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:10,280
MMM.

1760
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:11,971
Beautiful Girl.

1761
01:50:11,971 --> 01:50:14,880
And I went out with her and I noticed he
just kept looking around the restaurant

1762
01:50:14,881 --> 01:50:18,630
to see who was looking at her. And I
remembered it annoyed the shit out of me,

1763
01:50:18,631 --> 01:50:22,170
but I, I, I didn't have any
experience with beautiful women,

1764
01:50:22,171 --> 01:50:27,000
so I just sort of accepted it. And, um,
but I never went out with her again.

1765
01:50:27,001 --> 01:50:31,080
It just, it drove it. I saw, I tapped
out somewhere through the fucking dinner.

1766
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,810
Even back then, I was an angry
son of a bitch. I was like,

1767
01:50:33,811 --> 01:50:34,351
let me get this straight.

1768
01:50:34,351 --> 01:50:37,140
I'm buying you fucking dinner and
you're looking around to see who's Elsa

1769
01:50:37,141 --> 01:50:41,370
staring at your tits.
Um, yeah, you're a cunt.

1770
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:45,660
Good looking cunt. But uh, nonetheless,

1771
01:50:46,410 --> 01:50:49,380
someday those looks are going to be gone
and I'm just going to be left with the

1772
01:50:49,381 --> 01:50:50,214
cunt.

1773
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:55,020
You know who's going to be a psycho cunt
because you're an attention whore and

1774
01:50:55,021 --> 01:50:56,340
when the attention goes away,

1775
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:59,390
you're going to be like some celebrity
who fell off the fucking math.

1776
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:02,820
Fuck this bitch. Fuck this. You know?

1777
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:08,610
And that was the end of that shit that
is podcast is fucking horrific. Jeez,

1778
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,070
I don't even get going,
man. You know what it is.

1779
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:14,670
I had a flat tire today and I
think that that's, that's been,

1780
01:51:14,671 --> 01:51:19,320
that's a good symbol. Uh, this whole
podcast, I've just been riding on the rim

1781
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:26,820
Af. Fuck. I got to start my day tomorrow
down at the God damn dealership.

1782
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:31,980
It was fucking Douche bags. They've got
everything. It's all wrapped up. You know,

1783
01:51:31,981 --> 01:51:33,450
if you do anything to you,
God damn car.

1784
01:51:33,451 --> 01:51:36,560
If I go down to the God damn auto zone
and I get new wiper blades, I think that,

1785
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:41,340
I think that cancels out my warranty.
He's fucking cunts. Um, so anyways,

1786
01:51:41,341 --> 01:51:44,100
this was the lane podcast for this week.
I know it had its moments.

1787
01:51:44,101 --> 01:51:44,934
Who's getting no,

1788
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:49,140
it started off wealth when I was
talking about those whaling horse. Um,

1789
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:53,870
I actually had a nice little
show biz moment. A friend
of mine got me tickets to,

1790
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:56,400
uh,
um,

1791
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:02,320
the roots do this pre grammy jam where
they're just the house band and like

1792
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,810
fucking,
I dunno,

1793
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:08,480
20 or 30 of the most
legendary insane acts ever.

1794
01:52:08,481 --> 01:52:13,100
Just come on stage and start singing songs
with them and doing fucking whatever.

1795
01:52:13,101 --> 01:52:17,900
And somebody got me a ticket,
uh, you know, hanging out,

1796
01:52:17,901 --> 01:52:22,520
you know, somehow I got in there
and uh, it was fucking unbelievable.

1797
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:28,360
I think I came home that
night and I downloaded like
probably about $70 worth of

1798
01:52:28,731 --> 01:52:33,290
music, just the, the level of talent that
was that there. And I'm an old guy now,

1799
01:52:33,291 --> 01:52:36,080
so I don't know who the fuck,
I don't know who the fuck.

1800
01:52:36,081 --> 01:52:39,110
And if Neil was telling me who everybody
was, she was freaking the fuck out.

1801
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:43,680
Oh my God, that's fucking
Mc. So, and I have no,

1802
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:45,020
I don't know who the fuck they are.

1803
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:49,880
You know what I tapped when they
stopped showing videos on MTV?

1804
01:52:49,881 --> 01:52:54,160
I kind of liked that
last wave. Jay Z, m. And.

1805
01:52:54,161 --> 01:52:56,670
M.
Mmm.

1806
01:52:57,950 --> 01:53:00,740
Was there any rock like by
then it was all that emo shit,

1807
01:53:00,741 --> 01:53:04,560
so I couldn't relate to any of that.
Yeah.

1808
01:53:04,710 --> 01:53:09,080
What does that fucking Goddamn
wining song about not giving up?

1809
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:12,290
Woo.

1810
01:53:18,990 --> 01:53:21,120
They actually play that
at sporting events.

1811
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:24,880
It sounds like a man crying.
I don't know.

1812
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:29,180
I know he's saying we will be
victorious, but like just, it just,

1813
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:30,920
it could have been a better line read,

1814
01:53:31,690 --> 01:53:32,523
you know,

1815
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:37,810
all that shit. That's when I tapped
out all that. My Chemical Romance. Uh,

1816
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:41,090
could I have another Kleenex please?
Whatever the fucking name is.

1817
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:44,200
Other bands where I just,
uh,

1818
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:50,590
I don't know. Everybody just
sounded like they were crying.

1819
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:55,300
I couldn't handle it.
You sex is on fire.

1820
01:53:55,301 --> 01:53:59,260
That guy fucking crying through all his
songs. How does that fucking song go?

1821
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:16,370
Rami. The Cure. That's how the
guy in the cure used to sing.

1822
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:20,470
Oh,
always love you.

1823
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:24,643
Um,

1824
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:27,280
yeah, I'm not into that ship. I'm
sorry. Was that, that was that annoying?

1825
01:54:27,281 --> 01:54:29,320
Was that as annoying as it just
sounded in my fucking is what?

1826
01:54:29,321 --> 01:54:32,470
The music is fucking annoying.
So I didn't know who anybody was,

1827
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:34,360
but uh,

1828
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,020
you know, it was amazing.
It was booker t came out.

1829
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:38,860
What didn't even from
booker t and the mgs,

1830
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:43,390
I didn't even know the fucking dude was
still alive and it was such like a Paris

1831
01:54:43,390 --> 01:54:47,590
Hilton. Oh my God, am my God.
That's hot kind of fucking crowd.

1832
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:48,950
Okay.

1833
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:52,670
That, uh, that they had no
fucking idea who the guy was.

1834
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:54,210
Oh,

1835
01:54:54,210 --> 01:54:58,410
my favorite performer of the night
was a chuck Brown, came out and sang,

1836
01:54:58,411 --> 01:55:01,740
busted loose,
and he was the shit.

1837
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:07,200
He came out on a leather and on leather
fucking outfit with the fucking pimp hat.

1838
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:10,650
He sang the shit out of the song
with the roots in the background.

1839
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:11,990
Okay.

1840
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:14,840
And the roots of fucking unbelievable.
And it for guitarists out there,

1841
01:55:14,841 --> 01:55:16,380
everybody knows quest is to shit.

1842
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:18,030
Okay.

1843
01:55:18,030 --> 01:55:22,100
But as underrated,
Kirk Douglas Diff fucking guitarist.

1844
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:23,130
Okay.

1845
01:55:23,130 --> 01:55:25,470
That dude is fucking insane.

1846
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:27,050
Okay.

1847
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:30,230
I'm talking John, the ground
level plant, they just fucking,

1848
01:55:30,231 --> 01:55:32,690
everybody in that band is just,
they're insane.

1849
01:55:33,310 --> 01:55:33,780
Okay.

1850
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:38,400
And a fortunate, we were sitting close
enough that I was just awesome. Like,

1851
01:55:38,401 --> 01:55:40,230
you know me,
I'm like a fucking geek for that shit.

1852
01:55:40,231 --> 01:55:43,830
Like I wish I could be if I didn't do
this. I wish I could be a, so I like,

1853
01:55:43,831 --> 01:55:45,540
I think like anybody,

1854
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:48,570
you can do that stuff as I've trashed
half the people on the grammys,

1855
01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:53,160
you know what I'm saying? But like
musicians, people playing instruments,

1856
01:55:53,161 --> 01:55:55,290
I'm absolutely fucking blown away by him.

1857
01:55:55,530 --> 01:56:00,390
And just being close enough to
watch somebody take a solo and just,

1858
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:03,270
you could just see just
going off the top of,

1859
01:56:03,271 --> 01:56:08,040
they just feeling it and just
doing it and coming out of it.

1860
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:12,000
And then just fucking looking back at
the drummer like, all right, let's,

1861
01:56:12,001 --> 01:56:15,750
let's go back into this next part of it.
And everybody seamlessly goes into it.

1862
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:21,630
You know, anybody's ever
played like a fucking garage
band, you know, and, and just,

1863
01:56:21,631 --> 01:56:24,870
you know, had the courage to make a tape
and you hear how fucking awful you are.

1864
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:29,520
They actually hear live music and they
played for like three fucking hours.

1865
01:56:30,410 --> 01:56:32,430
I ended up leaving.
I was so god damn old.

1866
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:36,150
Like I'm at the age now where if I
stand up too long, my back hurts.

1867
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:41,460
Like my lower fucking back, my feet
hurt. It's, it's fucking, it's terrible.

1868
01:56:41,461 --> 01:56:44,430
I've got to come home and sit
in a Goddamn Tba Epson salt.

1869
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,030
But anyways,
uh,

1870
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:53,130
I downloaded a bunch of Chuck Brown Shit,
a couple other rappers.

1871
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:55,730
I download it. I don't have my
iTunes open right now. I don't even,

1872
01:56:55,731 --> 01:56:59,700
I don't know who the fuck they were.
Uh, but it's kind of funny rappers now,

1873
01:56:59,701 --> 01:57:04,110
they have that odd thing where they,
they're wearing skinny tight jeans,

1874
01:57:04,111 --> 01:57:06,930
which I never thought would
come back into style again yet.

1875
01:57:06,931 --> 01:57:11,760
They're still hanging off their fucking
ass, which drives me up the Goddamn wall.

1876
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:18,060
Fuck. Pull 'em up. Um, anyways,
that's the podcast for this week. Oh,

1877
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:22,590

magnificent theater dates this,

1878
01:57:22,591 --> 01:57:26,550

because I'm God damn big shot.

1879
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:30,270
Let me see if I can open my website here
and let you know where the hell these

1880
01:57:30,271 --> 01:57:33,780
things are. This really isn't even
technically the podcasts anymore.

1881
01:57:33,781 --> 01:57:35,340
This is just the outtakes.
Um,

1882
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:40,370

1887
01:57:57,241 --> 01:58:00,000
And every time I do it, it becomes
a couple more minutes. You know,

1888
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:02,310
one of those bits started
with like four minutes.

1889
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:07,290
I just keep fucking elaborating and,
uh, uh, planning on having a great time.

So, uh, hope all you guys can come out to

1911
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,830
all of them are at the top of the
fucking game. And I'm telling you,

1912
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:42,650
we did three shows when I was
in Atlantic City and you know,

1913
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:46,240
you know it as Comedians, we don't watch
standup. We just don't after a while.

1914
01:59:46,241 --> 01:59:50,620
But I stood on the side wall,
watched all of them. Um,

1915
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:55,660
I just, it just the fucking phenomenal.
So please come out to those shows.

1916
01:59:55,661 --> 02:00:00,250
That's it. That's the podcast for this
week. You guys all have a good week. Uh,

1917
02:00:00,251 --> 02:00:02,260
I don't know what else to tell Ya.
Fuck.

1918
02:00:02,261 --> 02:00:05,740
I forgot to talk about the
Bruins Canadians game to
just see that with all the

1919
02:00:05,741 --> 02:00:10,741
old school fighting in the goal
scoring was like fucking 27 to 26,

1920
02:00:10,781 --> 02:00:13,210
I think was the final score
with all the fighting.

1921
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:16,600
And I want to know Montreal Canadians.
What the fuck happened? He had team,

1922
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:20,470
I'm not giving you shit about losing
a game was only one fucking game.

1923
02:00:20,471 --> 02:00:21,070
But I mean,

1924
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:24,370
you guys always had a tough guy all
the way back to fucking John Cordic,

1925
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:28,870
Chris Nilan, George low, rocky had, that
guy was the toughest guy in the league.

1926
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:32,140
Why did you guys, all
you had was, you know,

1927
02:00:32,141 --> 02:00:35,440
I know the Bruins kicked the
shit out of you guys, but
I'm not an idiot. We, we, we,

1928
02:00:35,441 --> 02:00:40,060
we beat up a bunch of gold scores. I
felt bad for that last guy. Jesus Christ.

1929
02:00:40,061 --> 02:00:44,650
He took like 20 upper cuts to the face
and somehow ended up with two giant paper

1930
02:00:44,651 --> 02:00:47,880
cuts. Um, Google it, man. Maybe I'll,

1931
02:00:47,881 --> 02:00:51,190
I'll have that youtube video also
on the [inaudible] podcast.com. Uh,

1932
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:52,420
but I'm telling you right now,

1933
02:00:52,421 --> 02:00:56,110
if you're a fan of fighting and hockey
watched the game on March 8th when the

1934
02:00:56,111 --> 02:00:59,410
Bruins and the Canadians play again,
because I'm a tell you right now,

1935
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:02,800
the Canadians are not going to sit
back and take that fucking physical ass

1936
02:01:02,801 --> 02:01:05,000
kicking that they took. I, and I cannot,

1937
02:01:05,001 --> 02:01:09,280
I can't wait to see the absolute fucking
animals that they're going to bring up

1938
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:11,380
for that game.
You know,

1939
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:14,590
whatever has a lower

1940
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:19,570
beyond thunder bay is what I'm guessing
what they're going to bring up.

1941
02:01:19,571 --> 02:01:21,850
Just like some old school fucking guy,

1942
02:01:22,690 --> 02:01:26,110
one of those white guys who has
like an afro in a porno mustache.

1943
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:28,450
I'm thinking they're going to bring up
a couple of those guys and it's going to

1944
02:01:28,451 --> 02:01:32,200
be, it's going to be fucking insane. I
hope it is. I hope it doesn't fucking,

1945
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:37,240
not live up to the hype. Um,
all right. That's it. I'm done.

1946
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:40,010
Okay. I've had a long fucking, all right.

1947
02:01:40,011 --> 02:01:45,011
And I apologize to anybody out there
who aspires to be a whaling whore at the

1948
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:49,100
grammys. You know, I'm just, you
know, I'm not saying that those,

1949
02:01:49,130 --> 02:01:53,060
those whaling whores, they're
not horse, but you know,

1950
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:57,030
I, I don't under, I fucking,

1951
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,370
yeah,

1952
02:01:58,370 --> 02:02:01,980
don't understand that kind of singing.
It's, you're not singing, you're wailing.

1953
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:02,870
Okay.

1954
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:03,703
All right.

1955
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:05,423
Okay.

1956
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:06,800
Just seeing the fucking song,

1957
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:09,943
you know,

1958
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:13,780
and then, and then fucking what's her
face? So booze, booze, face there.

1959
02:02:14,860 --> 02:02:17,350
She always gets that her son and a voice.
No.

1960
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:19,583
Ugh.

1961
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:23,470
She's got that pasty bloated booze face.
And then just in case you miss it,

1962
02:02:23,471 --> 02:02:25,990
she puts that red lipstick
and I'm in the middle.

1963
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:27,430
Yeah.

1964
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:31,570
Don't you just want to grab Christina
by both the big jobs, you know?

1965
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:33,180
Okay.

1966
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:36,270
She got a man's haircut. She could
do like the Winston Churchill Story.

1967
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:41,220
I've been, I've actually, this is just,

1968
02:02:41,221 --> 02:02:43,860
this is totally like extra time on doing,

1969
02:02:43,861 --> 02:02:47,190
on the podcast to try and get something
funny in this fucking thing this week.

1970
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:48,780
I noticed the other day.

1971
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:52,643
MMM.

1972
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:53,271
You know,

1973
02:02:53,271 --> 02:02:57,650
to will to people who really look alike
is Richard Simmons and the lead singer

1974
02:02:57,651 --> 02:02:58,640
of the Scorpions.

1975
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:03,110
You notice that they have the
exact same awful fucking hair.

1976
02:03:03,890 --> 02:03:07,850
They're going bald in the exact
same fucking way. You know?

1977
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:12,630
Did I just do an awful fucking eighties
joke? Were they separated at birth?

1978
02:03:12,631 --> 02:03:15,780
Have you ever seen them
together? Oh, Bill.

1979
02:03:15,781 --> 02:03:18,810
Quit by your fucking behind.
All right. This is it.

1980
02:03:18,811 --> 02:03:20,580
How long can you guys
still listen to this shit?

1981
02:03:20,581 --> 02:03:22,320
How long are you gonna sit
there and torture yourself?

1982
02:03:22,321 --> 02:03:25,800
This is like a comedian does not get off
the fucking stage as people look slowly

1983
02:03:25,801 --> 02:03:28,020
walking out of the Goddamn club.
I'm still here.

1984
02:03:28,350 --> 02:03:31,710
How empty or your lives shut it off.
Um,

1985
02:03:31,770 --> 02:03:35,370
oh fuck. You know what? I forgot to play.

1986
02:03:36,690 --> 02:03:38,520
I asked somebody from England to,
to,

1987
02:03:38,580 --> 02:03:42,950
I wanted to hear a cozy
smug cunts in the unit.

1988
02:03:42,990 --> 02:03:45,720
Militia accent. Here it goes. You want
to hear it? Here it is. Here it is.

1989
02:03:45,721 --> 02:03:49,110
This is all the way from my fucking
people over and hang. Hang on.

1990
02:03:49,111 --> 02:03:51,380
What the fuck just happened? I'm
gonna play it again. Here comes,

1991
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:57,020
how does he smile? Cows. He smug.

1992
02:03:57,021 --> 02:04:02,021
Can't every a couple of cows he smug
consists of fucking love that all right.

1993
02:04:03,731 --> 02:04:08,020
There you go. That's the podcast for this
week. I apologize for the meandering.

1994
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,280
Okay.

1995
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:12,760
I apologize. Is from for my excuses.
I went real Peyton manning this week,

1996
02:04:12,761 --> 02:04:16,000
didn't I? We had protection issues.
I had a flat tire, you know,

1997
02:04:16,690 --> 02:04:20,440
that was a real bitch this week. Um,
whatever. I'll make it up next week. Okay?

1998
02:04:20,441 --> 02:04:22,660
They can't all be gems.
All right?

1999
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:23,660
Okay.

2000
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:26,930
Everybody has a bad fucking day,
so don't take it out on me.

2001
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:30,920
I apologize to all the whaling horse
out there. I said that. All right.

2002
02:04:31,970 --> 02:04:34,100
I don't know how to get off stage
this week. All right, that's it.

2003
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:37,070
Have a great day. What could we go?
Fuck yourselves? Don't take any shit.

2004
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:38,010
Talk to you next Monday.

2005
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,310
See you.
