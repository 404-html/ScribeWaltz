1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,800
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,801 --> 00:00:06,280
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast from Monday.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,103
MMM.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,850
What is it? June 18th, 2010. Yeah, I know.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,230
I know. I know. I before
you even fucking start.

6
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:23,210
I know. I know. It's
Tuesday the 19th. I know.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:24,510
Yeah.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,610
Okay. What's the matter? You
don't know what happened?

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,620
Don't you follow me on Twitter?
Um,

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,530
I apologize for being a day late,
sort of, you know, I apologize.

11
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:39,500
That date to go really doesn't give a
shit or just banged your sister. Oh,

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,690
I didn't know. Oh, that
was your sister dude.

13
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:47,340
I didn't see a full like fucking
six months. She changed all right.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,813
MMM,

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,220
no, I was doing, I was doing a
show in Chicago, Chicago and uh,

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,220
you know,
got out late and everything and not,

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,210
I didn't bring any of my shit with me,

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,570
so I was already going to do a
halfassed one. As far as the sound.

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,790
I was just going to record it on
my iPhone man. And, um, and then,

20
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:08,120
I don't know,

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,950
I ended up fucking going out until
like four 30 in the morning and then my

22
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:17,120
flight was at 12th. So you
do the math. Okay. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,260
I partied last, uh, Sunday
night. Like, you know,

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,080
like me and my friends
successfully robbed a casino,

25
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,610
you know, like in the end
of sexy beast, you know,

26
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:35,240
when they robbed it successful
and everybody's laughing
in a fucking, you know,

27
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:38,300
whatever,
some sort of old pub or steakhouse,

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,880
cigars, the whole damn thing. Just,
I was having a great time. I'm going,

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,990
I ain't gonna lie to you.

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,770
I completely forgot that I had to do
the podcast completely. 100% for God.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,233
You know.

32
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,580
Sorry, it's not my fault.
I've been jet setting.

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,750
No, I had a great weekend.
I started off in San Jose.

34
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,860
I'm not trying to make you guys jealous
in San Jose, California right there.

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,120
You guys ought to just shut this whole
podcast off just out of pure envy.

36
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,810
You know, I don't know if you guys
are fans of the price is right,

37
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:20,700
but many times during the
showcase showdown, uh, one of the,

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,240
the will,

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,530
the final gifts to make one of those
housewives soccer moms lose their mind is

40
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:28,710
an all expense paid trip to
San Jose, California. Granted,

41
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:31,200
it is the first showcase.
It's not the second one.

42
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,930
Second one I think is to Fresno.

43
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,573
MMM.

44
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,850
Yeah. Went to San Jose and a,
it's slowly getting better.

45
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,740
Ooh, job. Things are going to get easier.

46
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,060
San Jose slowly turning it around.

47
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,170
Every time I come there
it's a little less scary,

48
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,200
or at least it feels a little less weird,
you know?

49
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:58,600
And then like Saturday is the weirdest
day when you work San Jose because San

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,220
Jose is one of those classic cities where,

51
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,510
um, you know, there's all kinds of
people until the end of the workday.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,510
And the second the workday
ends like around five,

53
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,490
everybody just gets the fuck out of
town and then all of a sudden you can't,

54
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,330
you can't even get a God damn dinner
anywhere. Everything's closed.

55
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,140
Everybody's such close and like going
in those old fucking westerns when some

56
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:24,700
bad ass is coming to town and everybody's
pulling down their curtains closed for

57
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:28,930
business. That's basically what it
feels like. Um, but during the day,

58
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,060
there's people walking
around to beautiful city.

59
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,000
They got a little Choo Choo train that
goes up and down the driveway, you know,

60
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,990
and, um, it's just for people
who've never been to San Jose,

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,890
the people that I feel bad for that is
sitting somewhere in a job that they

62
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:45,740
don't like dreaming of going to San Jose,
California,

63
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:50,741
a little pictures of Sj as j town
or whatever the fuck they call it.

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,620
All around your little office cubicle.
Maybe,

65
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,430
maybe your workstation out in
the warehouse, maybe, maybe,

66
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,340
maybe you drive for a living. You got
those up on the dashboard, you know,

67
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,510
ways pounded down,
um,

68
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,220
Saturdays,

69
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,010
the weirdest day because nobody
comes in even during the day.

70
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:16,210
So you're walking around the city with
skyscrapers and there's literally nobody

71
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,790
there. You feel like you're
in the fucking walking dead.

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,260
It's the only way to describe it.
But, uh, but then at the Improv,

73
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:27,430
the shows were packed out. So I want
to thank everyone who came down. Um,

74
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,230
I worked with Kevin Shea, Kevin
Shay, if you guys haven't seen him,

75
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,190
he's fucking hilarious.

76
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,980
Totally original and hope you
guys realize that by the way.

77
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:39,490
And I don't bring any fucking
cupcakes on the road. You know,

78
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,270
some headliners, you know, they'll
go out and they go out with some,

79
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,050
some fucking weak person in front of
them just so they look even better.

80
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,510
That's not the way I do it.
All right?

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,960
I actually bring out somebody who's funny.
We'd be pat myself on the back now.

82
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,030
You know what it is. I can't
stand, I can't stand watch.

83
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,730
I can't withstand working with somebody.
Sucks. That's what it really is.

84
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,230
It really has nothing to do
with the crowd. All right,

85
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,060
let's get to the truth to this day.
You Go, it does. I can't, you know,

86
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,170
because when they,

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,200
when somebody sucks and having to
listen to that act five times during the

88
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,560
fucking week, um, I can't even tell
you what the hell it does to you.

89
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:21,790
And then they always end up
closing on the same fucking bit.

90
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,910
And I dunno. And the bits awful and it's
killing because they're, I don't know.

91
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,790
I don't know doing something.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

92
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,280
Some sort of standup trick and it
makes me hate them. So what I do is I,

93
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,130
I try to bury myself in the bowels of
the clubs so I don't have to hear a word

94
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,040
of their act.
But no matter how much I do that,

95
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,020
I still have to listen to
the last minute of their,

96
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,380
if their final joke cause I
have to be ready to go on.

97
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,710
So that's the real reason why I
do it. All right, so there you go.

98
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:55,680
So this is the fucking
podcast. It is a day late. Um,

99
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,100
and is always like,
don't

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,420
have enough fucking hours in the day.

101
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:04,100
I should just brought the stupid
God damn mics are on the road.

102
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:08,810
Where the fuck I didn't want to do it
cause it was too heavy fucking pussy. Um,

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,230
anyways, hey, I flew back from
Chicago and I watched that,

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,280
that John Carter from Mars
movie or whatever the hell
it's called, and he says,

105
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:20,420
I'm John Carter from Virginia like 90
times. And it was actually Psi Phi.

106
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,730
And I know recently on
the Joe Rogan experience,

107
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:26,840
I made fun of all those Scifi movies.
You know, if you're stuck on a plane,

108
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,570
it's not a bad movie,
you know,

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,940
you know what kills me is they always
got to do that shit in those fucking,

110
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,720
those Scifi movies where they always
have to throw in those fucking awful

111
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:45,890
invented words when somebody's arguing,
everybody's speaking English, you know,

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,790
speak in the goddamned king's English.
You understand what everybody's saying?

113
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,400
I mean, if you went back 300
years in this fucking country,

114
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,920
you wouldn't know what half the people
were talking about with all day. He,

115
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,860
this and that and fucking go
with and come with. It's like,

116
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,790
it'd be like reading the Bible. I can't
make fucking heads and tails, tails of it.

117
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,650
You know, read the Bible. It's like,

118
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:05,720
am I still supposed to be
going left to right here?

119
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:10,520
Do I go left right to left
cause it does, it makes, um,

120
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,620
they always have those dumb lines. Like
the gods of off guard will not have this.

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,440
They go out of the way
to like invent one word.

122
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,520
What did the name of
Marsupial is going on in here?

123
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,780
They had one of those and I actually
just fucking threw my headphones down.

124
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,990
Then the Douche sit next to me looked
over at me like what the fuck is your

125
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,650
problem?
And

126
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,490
I need you guys to come up with
a name for this phenomenon.

127
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,090
You ever been standing in a uh,

128
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,220
in an airport terminal and there's some
douche talking really loud on his cell

129
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,380
phone. Of course you
have. We all have, right?

130
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,870
Which is big does giant too.
There's a fat black dude from England,

131
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,460
so he sounds like he's in, you know,
lock stock in a smoking barrels,

132
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:57,770
whatever the fuck it's called.
And he's a tub of Shit,

133
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:00,590
which is making me laugh cause everybody
in Europe acts like they're fucking

134
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,780
smart and in shape.
You know,

135
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,580
he looked like the fucking dude on a,
you know, you know what he looked like?

136
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,120
You know that show, the Cleveland
Brown show, you know his son.

137
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,120
It's exactly what he looked like.
He didn't talk like him,

138
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,700
but he had the fucking round glasses,
the whole God damn thing.

139
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:24,080
That's what the fuck he looked like. And
he's talk and he's fucking, he's fees,

140
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:28,220
American fat. He Chicago fat. All right.

141
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,770
But he's European so he still has to wear
those tight fucking jeans. I Dunno why,

142
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:37,820
I dunno what it is about Europe and
fucking suffocate and your balls.

143
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,080
But Europeans just,
their genes cannot be fucking tight.

144
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,510
They just cannot be fucking tight enough.
They have,

145
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:49,511
they have to fucking frame their package
that God damn units look like fucking

146
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:55,511
Han Solo's face when he gets frozen in
that little piece of fucking carbon or

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,480
whatever the fuck it was. Um, anyways,

148
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,700
so he's running his stupid Yap. Yeah.
Mike going over to Mel bone after that,

149
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,220
going to go back over to
fucking who gives a fuck, right.

150
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Just talk and talk and talk and big
stupid Chicago Bear fucking gut.

151
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,200
You know, you know, when you
get the creases on the side,

152
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,100
you could stick mail in there.
He's got those on the side, right?

153
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,190
Offensive Lineman, fat. You know,
he's got great footwork, dope,

154
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:29,940
but look at his fucking belly and he
says, run in his Goddamn Yap. You know,

155
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,520
so I walk away from the guy,

156
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,250
but he's one of these guys who takes
a little stroll when he walked.

157
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:40,120
So he keeps fucking walking over into
my little area, right? So I'm like, Eh,

158
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,050
you know, Bill, come out.
Just fucking, don't be this.

159
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:46,830
Don't be fucking screaming and
yelling. Just fucking relax. And uh,

160
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:49,980
what is the name of this phenomenon?
I start loading the fucking plane.

161
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,660
I get on the plane. He comes at fucking
Douche, right? Still talking. Yeah,

162
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,840
my yeah. Yeah. Good Day mate. Yeah,
yeah. All fucking bullshit. I know.

163
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,900
Good day mates from fucking Australia
before I get shit from fucking people from

164
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,880
England. Y'all sound
the same to me, right?

165
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,540
So he comes walking up the aisle,

166
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:11,460
he still running his fucking Yap and I'm
just going out. Jesus Christ. All right.

167
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:14,100
Only off, listen to this guy
for another five, four, three,

168
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:18,030
until he goes by and the motherfuckers
in my row, what are the arts?

169
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,560
You know, what are the fucking
odds? God Damn 70 fucking rose.

170
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,450
Not only is he in my row,

171
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:28,560
he's sitting right next to me and he
stays on the phone the whole fucking time.

172
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah. Night. Yeah. Now, now teddy bears,

173
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,380
watch intellij. Is this Stan
right? The whole fucking time.

174
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,070
Why he's waving.
I'm not swearing the whole fucking time.

175
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:44,460
Sit next to me running his god Damn
Yap at this fat fucking stomach and the

176
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:48,750
crease in the side. And um, it's the only,

177
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:52,290
this is the only a,
the only props I will give this guys is,

178
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,140
you know, he never seen, never said
hello. We didn't speak the whole flight.

179
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,000
I loved it. I loved that he
was in as self involved is I.

180
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:05,550
Um, and uh, last thing I
wanted to hear, I would,

181
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,610
last thing I wanted to do
was start talking to him
cause he already annoyed the

182
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:09,241
shit out of me.

183
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:12,840
And I know from experience that if I'm
going to talk to somebody from another

184
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:17,400
country, at some point they're
going to shit on the United States.

185
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,510
That's something that they like to do
while calling us the ignorant Americans

186
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:24,660
traveling around the world.
You know, all knees and elbows,

187
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,410
those motherfuckers come
over here and it's just,

188
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,310
you can't talk to him for more than
fucking five minutes before they, they,

189
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,370
they shit on America and I don't
want to fucking understand it.

190
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,460
You know? I would never do that. The only,

191
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:44,220
the only way I would do that is if
I was on stage in another country,

192
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,030
just just for the fucking ridiculousness
of it to start making fun of their

193
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:51,400
fucking country. But if I was sitting on
a plane, I would just be talking to you.

194
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:54,310
You have a beautiful country, blah,
blah, blah. I be a decent fucking guy.

195
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,250
Ah, fuck. Ah, Jesus Christ.

196
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,080
The hell was I just going to [inaudible]
remembered something in the middle of

197
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:08,030
that. The hell was I talking about? Hang
on a second. Let me think about this.

198
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,980
Oh yeah,
I remember what it was.

199
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,240
Did I tell this story like
fucking four months ago, uh,

200
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,570
pulled my big ass truck
into this small spot,

201
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,660
but there was nobody on the other side
of me and I was fine right when I came

202
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:21,811
out,

203
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:25,020
somebody had pulled in and it was really
tight as far as like on either side of

204
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:27,870
my truck. And then I didn't
have a lot of space to back out.

205
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,990
So it was his fucking problem. I keep
trying to back, you know, back out,

206
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,840
come back in, back out, like inch my way.

207
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:35,250
And so this fucking guy
starts helping me out.

208
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,210
I think he was from England and
he's like, uh, you know, next time,

209
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,700
why don't you do the
UNAMERICAN thing in back in

210
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,170
I fucking I.

211
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,960
Okay.

212
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,250
It's like you can't even help me out of
the spot without fucking nitpicking you

213
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:55,970
fucking cunt. You know what? I'll listen
to it from Australia, but England, the,

214
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,850
the amount of shit that is going on in
the world still because of those comments,

215
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,220
the fact that they actually fucking give,

216
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,360
he had the balls to give the United
States shit the very least be like, hey,

217
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:10,060
welcome to the party.
Welcome.

218
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
You guys are slowly catching up to us
historically as the biggest fucking

219
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:17,410
oppressive Douche bags on the planet.
You want to come at me like that?

220
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:18,244
Absolutely.

221
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,580
But if you're gonna fucking come at
me like you didn't do all this other

222
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:26,080
bullshit out there, the fucking caste
system in India and all that fucking crap.

223
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:30,780
The shit that happened in
Rwanda, you know, that's all.

224
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:32,550
I've got. Two examples. I
don't know anything else.

225
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,150
The Falkland Islands at Jesus,
the ignorant Americans strikes again,

226
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,310
but you know what I'm saying?
If I actually read,

227
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,480
I could fucking bury you guys
in this argument. All right.

228
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,890
With your jolly rancher flag,
whatever the fuck you call it. Um,

229
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,763
all right,

230
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,160
thank God I don't have a gig coming
up in England after that little thing,

231
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,620
you know. Oh Jesus. I go, Oh gee,

232
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,410
I've got a ton of shit for my
fucking comments about, um,

233
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,250
about hair metal last week. You know,
dude, I wasn't saying it was all bad,

234
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,570
but come on, this is what
I should say. Okay. Look,

235
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,760
disco music wasn't all bad.

236
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,080
Okay.

237
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,640
Okay. The freak. Come on. You really
think that's a bad fucking song

238
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,200
you do? Oh, really? In what? In
every rose has it's thorn is better.

239
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,960
You want to go back and forth?
Little tit for tat here.

240
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,610
Fucking the frig blows any of those
heavy metal ballads away. All right.

241
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm not saying Van Halen with David
Lee Roth was to shit. All right.

242
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,140
It's kind of like the Red Sox with
Theo Epstein and Tito and all that.

243
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,110
Now that they blew it up,
we're going to be fucked.

244
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,980
Who else? What else was great in the,
there was a lot good fucking shit,

245
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:54,470
but there was, I'm just, you know
what the fuck I'm talking about?

246
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,100
Okay.

247
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,950
Gimme an R,
r o,

248
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:03,951
c.K and what do you got rock
and what are you going to do?

249
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,780
Rock?
You really?

250
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,860
Can you come up with a
disco song worse than that?

251
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,290
That's your challenge for this weekend.
If you can.

252
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,800
I will shut the fuck up about this
cause I'm not saying it was all bad.

253
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,850
I'm not saying I didn't like iron maiden.
I didn't say that. I didn't say that.

254
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:24,390
I didn't like Metallica,
which I actually didn't in the 80s.

255
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,780
I thought that it was too hard.
It was too hard for me. Okay.

256
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,320
I had to stay in my borderline hair metal,

257
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,920
little bit of Glam and uh oh,

258
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:39,090
he's wearing jeans on stage. He's,
he's breeze bringing it back.

259
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,260
Little fucking music box that I was in.
I missed out on a lot of good shit.

260
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,500
All that new wave shit.
Some of that stuff was good.

261
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:49,170
Some of the talking head stuff early on,
that was stuff was all good.

262
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:51,620
I missed out on all of them,
you know.

263
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:53,900
Okay.

264
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,380
I liked their mainstream shit burning
down the house. That's all I listened to.

265
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,840
Um, let me see here. If I can
get, Oh, what the hell is it?

266
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,840
Let me see if I can get any,
any comments of people telling me

267
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,260
all these people giving me
shit for my podcast being late.

268
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,270
Okay.

269
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,000
The fuck dude.
Hurry up with my free entertainment.

270
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,070
Somebody drew a picture of a big Dick.
That's nice.

271
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,430
Okay.

272
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,420
MMM.

273
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,810
Stop jerking off and give us the fucking
podcast for fuck sakes. By the way,

274
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:31,890
happy birthday. See what I do this. This
is my crowd. This is what I facilitate.

275
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,350
Oh, Jesus Christ. I can't find it anymore.

276
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,170
Okay.

277
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,980
Look for all you fucking metal heads
out there, all right. I wasn't saying,

278
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,800
you know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Okay.

279
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,090
You can't tell me that you don't watch
some of those old videos in it and, and,

280
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,990
and they're not fucking, I'm like,
I'm not. You know what? I'm not,

281
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:54,970
I'm not letting you suck me back into this
argument again. All right. I said what?

282
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:57,400
I had to say.
Okay.

283
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,510
There's a lot of motley Crue shit.

284
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:03,360
I did like some of the shit
didn't hold up so much.

285
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,330
Okay.

286
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,640
Do when that theater pain tour,

287
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,880
when they will go fucking coming
onstage looking like they sold Mary Kay

288
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:16,520
cosmetics. I mean, come on, I get it.

289
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:19,910
His fucking drum set when fucking
all the way around. But come on,

290
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,320
you can't tell me that even they
don't look at it. You know what?

291
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,070
Look at the fucking cover
of theater of pain. Okay.

292
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,090
I want you to hold that up and then think
about my argument and then still tell

293
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:36,770
me to go fuck myself. All right. And if
you can pull that off, I will. All right,

294
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:39,650
I will fuck off. All right. So anyways,

295
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,380
you're listening to the Monday
morning podcast. Everybody.

296
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,230
I do one of these every single week.
If you're, if you're new to the, uh,

297
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,070
the podcast is what I do. I shit on
things then people shit back on me.

298
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,860
And then maybe in the end of it
we, uh, we learned something.

299
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,860
We have learned shit on
this podcast. I haven't, we,

300
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,540
okay.

301
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,720
We've learned that debt sitting in a
cubicle is not something that you dreamed

302
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:03,570
up as a child and that you
eventually want to get out of it.

303
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,370
We've learned that I can't be funny
without saying fuck and content.

304
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,930
Every other word you guys. Uh, what else?

305
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:11,950
Yeah,

306
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,790
you know that I'm going to hell or I'm
going into the ground one or the other,

307
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,350
depending on whether
you're religious or not.

308
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,910
And you've also learned that there's
no reason to go to the post office. Oh,

309
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,680
he's slipping in a commercial.

310
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,200
Yeah.

311
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,160
Hey, listen, if you see, if you're
still going to the post office,

312
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:33,330
you're probably still listening to
a theater of pain on cassette tape.

313
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,280
What stamps.com you ask,
are you new to my podcast?

314
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,650
And you haven't heard this
commercial 40,000 times.

315
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,820
This is what stamps.com with stamps.com
is this wonderful websites that

316
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:52,590
eliminates you ever having to go
to the post office again. Okay?

317
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,560
Think about all the things that
happened when you go to the post office,

318
00:18:55,561 --> 00:19:00,480
the homeless guy holding the door.
Like you can't open it yourself. Okay?

319
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,300
And maybe you're a liberal
and you want to give him some,

320
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:04,740
you're going to give him some money,
okay.

321
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,870
But you know damn well you're
not going to touch his hands.

322
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:09,630
So you got to do that little throw.
You've gotta do a little throat.

323
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,240
You know what I do is I always try to
throw it right at their fucking breast

324
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:16,710
plate, right. Their chest and that way
they can kind of do like a basket catch.

325
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,640
That's what I do, you know, because
I've tried to do the drop and thing.

326
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,050
They hand is so callous. It just
fucking, it bounces right off of it.

327
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:27,450
It's like you throw it against the fucking
concrete and it falls in the ground

328
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,540
and then they're crawling around trying
to fucking pick up a quarter and you

329
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,550
feel bad.
You know?

330
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,050
I would say about that time I gave
that homeless guy some change as I was

331
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,080
walking out of standup New York or
the upper west side in New York City,

332
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,650
I gave him some change. And, uh,

333
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,210
as I was walking away, I just
heard, fuck yeah. And I hear it,

334
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,800
hear the sound of my change being
thrown up with a fucking sidewalk.

335
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,510
It was an angry drunk, you know,
when he had his standards, it's like,

336
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:01,560
give me some cash. Oh, go
fuck yourself. And, um,

337
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,310
I remember half the day I get mad
and I think I laughed my ass off.

338
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,700
No,
I think I got mad because I was by myself.

339
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:13,580
So then it just kind of was him against
me so I got upset. But if I've, I've,

340
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,570
I was with somebody else,

341
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:17,770
I would have had the left cause they
would have been laughing at me anyway.

342
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,970
stamps.com everybody,

343
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,040

to send out letters and packages,

344
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,660

time. Okay. And take my advice.

345
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,640
Okay. You stamps.com instead. All right.

346
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:36,140
I send out all my DVDs is way send them
out to the clubs. I got my little scale.

347
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,910
I put on my little mister McPhee feely,
a speedy delivery hat,

348
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,440
cranked the whole damn thing out.
Slap the stamp on it and I'm done.

349
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,110
Never have to go to the post. stamps.com
is quick and easy way to get postage.

350
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,060
How does it work, Bill? I'll tell you,

351
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,910
you can buy and print official
US postage using what?

352
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,920
You already have your
own computer and printer.

353
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,180
They also give you a little digital
scale. My favorite thing, you know,

354
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,640
I feel like a little kindergartener
playing the post office,

355
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,560
except it's real man. Um, they give
you a little digital stale scale.

356
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,020
A stamps.com eliminates guesswork.

357
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,860

for any letter or package 24,

358
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:19,730

And the mailman comes and
picks it all up. You know,

359
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:22,670
unless you live in the city, right? When,

360
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:25,920

that'll be a letter bill,

about your use of stamps.com.

00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:09,930
again. There you go. See what I just did?

372
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,220
It's like you would date and some psycho
chick and I just broke up with her for

373
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:16,260
you. You don't have to
ever deal with her again.

Now you can go find the love of your life.

375
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,130
You'll have time to do things like that.
Maybe get back into [inaudible].

376
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,233
You know,

377
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,750
maybe you could do that because you're
not standing in line at the post office.

378
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,970
There's all kinds of stuff you could do.

379
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:34,470
You could sit around and get fat if you
want it to. You know, I really like,

380
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:38,220
I just like printing stamps
after the post office is closed.

381
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,900
That's what I enjoy. That's
my big thing. I know, I know.

382
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:46,560
It's just a little thing in life.
It's just something that makes me smile.

383
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,630
Um, anyways, what else?

384
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,830
What are we going to,
oh Jesus.

385
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,530
But he can be a day late and you have
nothing to fucking talk about. Okay,

386
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:58,090
here we go.
Here's some more hair metal stuff.

387
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,620
A new rush album and God knows
rush was the king of hair metal.

388
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,590
You know, a lot of rush fans
won't, they won't admit to
that, but they had that, uh,

389
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:12,160
that awful period. Um, were they,

390
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,470
we're just teasing up their hair.

391
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,410
Remember that and had all the eyeliner
and those monsters they brought out on

392
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:21,580
stage was fucking horrible,
dude.

393
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:24,700
They never fucking did,
man. All right, Bill,

394
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,270
you're always saying how Neil Peart is
too mechanical of a drummer for your

395
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:32,360
tastes. I'm always saying he's a bass,
but I just like, I don't hear any,

396
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,070
I don't know. It just, it
doesn't get me. All right.

397
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,130
So anyway, I got a lot of balls.
Make Fun of the guy. You know,

398
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,780
I can play more with one hand than I could

399
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,970
dot four limbs and falling down a of
stairs. Anyways, on the new album,

400
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:51,080
the producer acting like a conductor
during the recordings to help drive live

401
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:55,340
emotion into his playing. Uh, the
drum parts were not as planned.

402
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,080
The album is really good and the Guitar
Solos are amazing. Go Fuck Yourself. Um,

403
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,020
yeah.

404
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,310
Okay.

405
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,670
Okay. I, I'll, I'll give
it a shot. You know,

406
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,560
I'm just not a, I was, I was never into
a, I just never was into that band.

407
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,770
Did I use Tom fires the mean mean
guy damn thing. Pick the bubble.

408
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,780
Pappadeaux MMM.
I didn't know.

409
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,160
I just never gotten into that shit.

410
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,900
Plus every time I would almost get into
this shit, like just something else,

411
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:29,610
they would do that. What would
annoy me. I was watching,

412
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:32,340
I was reading some sports article
one time and they interviewed Getty,

413
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,480
Getty Lee and a,

414
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,380
evidently he's a blue Jay fan and they
were playing the red sox and he sh he

415
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:40,800
made fun of Red Sox fans and I was just,
that was just a further fuck this guy.

416
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,540
Um, I dunno dude. Uh,
I like bottom better.

417
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,680
I like guys like Steve Jordan.
They don't play nearly as much,

418
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:50,660
but a lot of those guys,

419
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:55,500
it's very few of those guys that got of
those giant fucking drum sets that are,

420
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,343
um,

421
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,460
yeah,

422
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,200
that really blow me away. I actually, you
know who I liked his, uh, Simon Phillips,

423
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,330
he sat in with the WHO, um, on
that tour I went to in 1989,

424
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:08,920
you know,

425
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,660
thinking I was seeing the WHO and then
years later fucking pea towns and goes

426
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:16,990
when they had a new tour. Yeah. That, that
last toll mate, that wasn't the WHO, that,

427
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,350
that was the who on ice. And that
always pissed me off. It's like, really,

428
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:23,710
we didn't say that when I was buying
the fucking tickets. You can't,

429
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:28,150
why don't you go do some more research
on child pornography? Oh, Jesus. Bill.

430
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,753
MMM.

431
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,780
But he's fucking was unreal on that.
And uh,

432
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,120
okay.

433
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,730
I Dunno, I just recently just came
across one of his Solos and, uh,

434
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,560
it's not something that if
you're a younger drummer,

435
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,340
you're going to enjoy because you're
going to find the beginnings boring as he

436
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:50,840
builds his way up to it. But it's a, I
don't know, it has a beginning, middle,

437
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:55,340
and an end to the solo, which is I think
really fucking hard to do on drums.

438
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,860
And like I said, a lot of those
guys where they go, who's that?

439
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:01,130
Who's that other guy? Uh,
played with like dream theater.

440
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,350
A lot of guys go nuts about
him and Thomas Lang, like, uh,

441
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,840
those guys are incredible fucking players.
But after awhile I just, it's just,

442
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:13,410
everything's played at like 90
million miles an hour and a,

443
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,790
it gets fucking,
it all starts to sound the same.

444
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,110
That's the thing about speed. After a
while, it all fucking sounds to say,

445
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:25,680
which is the genius of
an Eddie van Halen to me,

446
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,660
because Eddie van Halen could play that
fast yet still could give me the chills

447
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:33,510
because he still had some sort of
feeling and soul underneath it.

448
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:38,040
And by the time the 80s came around,
everybody learned to do is tap on shit.

449
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,070
And then it just became,
who can play at the fastest?

450
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,880
And it was like an auctioneer, a
guitar after a while. And I just,

451
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:45,870
I'd never fucking

452
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,580
the fucking foot fucking 20 minutes

453
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,190
was that at every solo in the fucking
eighties. Every concert you went to,

454
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:58,180
they'd be like, then they
fucking slow it down, it

455
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,640
big, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh,

456
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,720
Eh,
eh.

457
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,290
And then they look at the
crowd that the you like

458
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,050
and he's basically doing the same
lick over and over and over again.

459
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:16,650
He was just speeding it up
and slowing it down. Um,

460
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,780
and I think half the drum
solos with the same thing,

461
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,670
they'd slow it all the way down to just
like, you know, hits on the stair of drum,

462
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,710
Duh Duh, Duh. Yeah.

463
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,980
And then you'd stand up, put your fist
in the air and everyone would go nuts.

464
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,160
And then you would sit down and you
would just slowly speed it up again.

465
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,930
And then somebody would come out skipping
around and fucking kick their foot in

466
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:42,060
the air, and then they'd go
back into the sock. Right.

467
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,170
Oh, and the women dress like whores.
It was such a great fucking time.

468
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,170
It really was. And I got, I, you
know, I really never thought that.

469
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:57,171
I would see girls dress more
skanky than they did back then,

470
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:00,960
you know, with the fucking
ripped up pantyhose fishnet shit.

471
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,930
It was just, it was phenomenal
with the flash dance influenced.

472
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:08,430
So the fucking thing was always
fallen off this shoulder,

473
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:13,050
half a titty hanging out. It
was just, it was phenomenal man.

474
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:18,090
And uh, I dunno, going
out and fucking San Jose,

475
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:21,210
like the St these girls, I swear to
go with the fucking hookers shoes.

476
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,640
It's phenomenal. But, uh,

477
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,820
do we want to think about San Jose
on Friday and Saturday nights?

478
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,820
There is enough police presence there.

479
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:34,230
It's like they're anticipating
a fucking riot. It's unreal.

480
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,250
There's like,
they,

481
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,200
they have everything short of like
the helmets and the shields. Like,

482
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:43,650
I don't know what the fuck happened.
And every time I start thinking like,

483
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:45,420
Oh yeah,
San Jose is not a bad fucking place.

484
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:48,840
You come out there on a Friday or
Saturday night and there's like,

485
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,370
there's like 40 cops on
every block it seems. Um,

486
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,730
not in case something happens.
It's,

487
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:59,160
it's a vibe is more when something
happens and you just feel like the later

488
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:03,720
you're out. He just like,
oh, this is really fucking
stupid. I need to go back in.

489
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:07,770
I need to jump on that little electric
train that only go six blocks and get

490
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:11,010
back to my hotel. Hey, by the way,

491
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:14,460
they had something out there called
June teeth that I never heard of.

492
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,050
Can somebody please explain to me
somebody of African American heritage?

493
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:23,220
What exactly that is? Somebody said
that's when slaves were freed June teeth.

494
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,081
Why is it June?

495
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:28,800
Teenth why isn't it like one specific
day or did they fucking drag it out

496
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,280
between June 13th and June 19th?
You know,

497
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,530
is one last little fuck you like.
All right,

498
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:37,420
we're going to free up
some time in the teeth.

499
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,470
Hey Mr. White man. Fucking uh, June
13th. What do you say? Can I go now?

500
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,860
Uh,
while maybe tomorrow.

501
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,760
Just trying to get another four or five
days out of you. Is that what happened?

502
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,280
I don't fucking know. Um, all alright.
Fantasy beer league. Hey Bill,

503
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:02,281
you're starting a beer league hockey
team and you can pick any NHL or past or

504
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:06,940
present the NHL hockey player wouldn't
necessarily be in the prime of his

505
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:09,730
career, but something
close. Who Do you pick?

506
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,240
I think the inclination is to take someone
like Mario Lemieux but I think that'd

507
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,560
get boring as shit after a while.
Yeah, and you probably fucking get mad.

508
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,670
When I yanked on his Jersey and
threatened to retire, um, he goes,

509
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:23,740
I think I'd go with
someone like Rick Takut.

510
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,430
He can still dominate your league and
you can imagine drinking beers with them

511
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:30,400
afterwards. Exactly. You
answered your own question.

512
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:34,030
This is exactly why I would get,
I get fucking a,

513
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,590
yeah.

514
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,220
Who's that guy? Jesus. I'm so bad with
the names. The second season ends,

515
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:43,150
I can't remember anybody's name.
Who's The fucking guy?

516
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:46,870
He's on the rangers and said that
everybody gets my sloppy seconds.

517
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,940
Somebody like him,
somebody who can play and is funny.

518
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,903
You know,

519
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:59,210
I, I, you know something. What
about Carsello? I was soccer.

520
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:01,620
Cilla could actually play.
That guy can actually play the game,

521
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:04,890
can score goals and he could beat the
shit out of people, which he did. So,

522
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:08,190
you know, he's got great fucking
stories and he looks like he drinks.

523
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,290
I would definitely pick
somebody like that.

524
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,560
The last thing I would do was
get like as Sidney Crosby,

525
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,253
you know,

526
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:20,080
he just doesn't seem like you'd have
a pass the puck and a, you know,

527
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:21,550
when I accidentally tripped him,

528
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:25,000
if I ever got anywhere near him because
God knows I'd be like good trying to get

529
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:28,270
the puck, I would accidentally
trip m and uh, you know,

530
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:30,280
if he didn't get the call
or even he got the call,

531
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:33,100
he just get up and we'd do that shit
where he was shaking his head but not

532
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,430
looking at me with his
fucking a rosy lips.

533
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,780
Yeah.

534
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,910
Yeah. I think I, maybe I
go old school. I, you know,

535
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:45,860
Rick Middleton was always
a favorite of mine.

536
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,360
Nifty Mamie him maybe a Jay Miller,

537
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,250
some old school, tough
guys. Uh, Bob Probert,

538
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:56,930
God rest his soul if he was still around.

539
00:31:56,931 --> 00:32:01,470
I get guys like that and maybe some goons
or something like that. Uh, all right.

540
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,630
I need some advice. Spill going for
it. Going for it. Oh Geez. Here we go.

541
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,220
Going forward. This is some guy in
from the 80 she's going to go forward.

542
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,280
That was one of the worst
fucking expressions ever
in the ADC. Remember that?

543
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:18,610
And it bottomed out in that rocky movie
in rocky three or maybe that started it

544
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:22,900
all when a clubber Lang
gotten his faces like,

545
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,890
oh bless you up. And then
Rocky's like, go for it.

546
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:31,640
And that was supposed to be like this
big moment. Like he's not scared anymore.

547
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,140
Go for it.
Did everybody that part of the 80s,

548
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:40,620
everybody in the early to
mid eight and promoter,

549
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,100
like the early eighties and
all those fucking movies,

550
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:46,670
everybody dress like they were on
their way to an aerobics class.

551
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,490
I, in fact, I think still
just the just alone.

552
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,680
Did he have on leg warmers during
part of his workouts in those movies?

553
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:59,510
I can't remember. Um,
dear bill, dear bill,

554
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,790
um,
since I was 12 years old,

555
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,440
I've been playing blues
music professionally around
the Colorado and a front

556
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:11,210
range area.
What the fuck is the front range area?

557
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,580
Is that Wyoming Bomba data,
but data?

558
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,980
Um, I've made good money. What kind of
gigs did you get in the front range area?

559
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,420
Every year?
I played blues music on Hitler's birthday

560
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,040
for this area in group slash
meth lab in fucking Casper,

561
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:37,610
Wyoming. Um, I've made good money and
lots of friends on the way this year.

562
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:40,790
I even made it to the finals at
the International Blues Challenge.

563
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,670
Needless to say, I've been
blessed so far in life. Yeah,

564
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,670
you must be a fucking beast
if you can do that. He says,

565
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:50,780
not bad for a 16 year old. Go Fuck
Yourself. You know, that's awesome.

566
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:55,070
For a 16 year old, Jesus
Christ, I wasn't doing shit.

567
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,680
They only I was doing was flunking
every class in high school. And, um,

568
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,410
I had my driver's light. I got my
driver's license to second, I turned 16.

569
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,570
This the second I was
eligible and I took it on a,

570
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,180
I actually took my, uh, had the
balls to take it with a stick shift.

571
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,520
It was a 78 Chevette for speed. And they
only reason why I say I had the balls.

572
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:23,860
Every car and my family, we always had
stick shifts. I don't know why. You know,

573
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,230
it was funny. We had, we had
manual transmission, but uh,

574
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,500
there wasn't a sports car to be found.
Uh,

575
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:33,640
anyways,
here's my problem.

576
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,340
Ever since I was eight years
old and saw a reservoir dogs,

577
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,050
I wanted to write and direct movies.

578
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,920
Now this isn't a choice
between my two two passions.

579
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,500
I do plan on doing both
for the rest of my life,

580
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,640
but with the screenplay competition,
I have little hope for.

581
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,600
Um, why do you have a little
hope in a screenplay competition?

582
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:55,970
They have shit like that, don't they? What
are you saying? You're not good, good,

583
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,270
good at it. I don't know, Bill,
why don't you read the rest of it?

584
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:00,790
You'll figure it out.
Um,

585
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:06,070
a screenplay competition I
have little help hope for.
Oh, I see. No, those do exist,

586
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:11,020
dude. I don't know where they are, but
they do exist. I remember Matt Damon,

587
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,580
uh, uh, Ben Affleck had
that project. Greenlight,

588
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,210
they're there. There's always people
doing stuff like that. I can't say always,

589
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:20,620
but there is shit like that.
Anyways,

590
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:23,440
at dad that's recovering from a
car accident. Sorry to hear that.

591
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,500
And a mom working to keep
our family in a home.

592
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,190
I have no idea how to start
making my first feature film.

593
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,410
Now you're probably thinking
you're 16. Um, no I'm not.

594
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,180
I'm thinking you're ahead
of the game this good. Uh,

595
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,980
but I have no money for the
high school like go to anymore.

596
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,170
And being in the blues world for so long,

597
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:47,640
I know that tomorrow I will wake up
and be 43 wondering if I accomplished

598
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:49,740
everything I wanted to.
Uh,

599
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,940
being a 16 year old blue blues musician
who is most likely isn't going to get a

600
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:57,090
high school diploma and wants to
make movies. Jesus Christ. Dude,

601
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,870
first thing I'll tell you is
you gotta you gotta fucking,

602
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,780
you've got to put a little sunshine
in your thoughts. They're uh,

603
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,230
they're a youngster. Uh, uh,

604
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,860
stop listening to that fucking blues
music making you just depressed.

605
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,350
Once you listen to a little hair metal,
it's happy. Um, anyways, I'm pretty lost.

606
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:21,351
It's scary because I'm at the place
where the things you do now affect your

607
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:22,230
future.

608
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:26,460
Any advice on how to keep positive as
I try and become a filmmaker would be

609
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:30,270
greatly appreciated. Thanks. And sorry for
writing so fucking much. Yeah, Dude, you,

610
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,500
uh, first of all, you're acting like
you're 86 and not 16. All right?

611
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,870
You're 16.
You're way ahead of the fucking game.

612
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,463
All right.

613
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,630
When I was 14, I was going to go to
Notre Dame and beat, become a lawyer.

614
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,400
By the time I was 16, I was thinking,
well, maybe I'll learn a trade. All right?

615
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:51,850
That's how quickly I fucking,
you know, went off the rails.

616
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:56,410
Now has a bunch of people in trades. So
what? I'm a moron if I can make the lab.

617
00:36:56,411 --> 00:37:00,770
No, you're a fucking genius because you
can make a lip or whatever the flower,

618
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:05,280
the fuck that went. Um, this is how you
know how you learned to make movies, dude.

619
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,730
You just go ahead and
you fucking make one.

620
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,703
All right?

621
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,020
This is the deal. You don't have
any fucking money. All right?

622
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,650
So you could make enough money

623
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:22,730
like just playing music with a goddamn
bucket in front of you in downtown Denver.

624
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,180
Save up and get an iPhone if
you don't already have one.

625
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,083
All right?

626
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,180
You got an iPhone,

627
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,920
you can fucking shoot some video
then uploaded on and just, you know,

628
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,790
do it for nothing uploaded on the
computer, a friend's computer,

629
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,990
whoever you making the
movie with. Um, you just,

630
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,490
that's the way to learn how to do shit.
That's the advice I'll give you.

631
00:37:46,491 --> 00:37:50,170
Just go out and you do shit and a in and
every time you think a negative thought

632
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,120
that say an,
I can't do this.

633
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:55,750
You have to fucking mentally beat
the shit out of that thought.

634
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,040
And you have to really become conscious
to have as to what your brain is telling

635
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:00,874
you.

636
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,113
You know,

637
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,470
because you seem like you're
in your very early on,

638
00:38:05,471 --> 00:38:07,840
so I don't think it's going
to be that deep of a groove,

639
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:12,460
but your brain is like catastrophizing.

640
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,940
Okay. Everything you're
thinking of doing somehow it,

641
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,720
it ends with you slamming
into a brick wall. All right?

642
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,860
And if you think that way you
become paralyzed and you can't,

643
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,710
you can't step forward but you really,

644
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:30,190
your heart wants to step forward but
you can't cause your brain keeps fucking

645
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:31,570
showing you that brick wall.

646
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:36,100
So what's that going to happen is your
fucking heart is to be waking you up in

647
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:39,560
the middle of the night thinking thoughts
like what the fuck are you doing?

648
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,720
What the fuck are you doing?
And then you, then you know you,

649
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,310
you're going to start drinking and
it's going to be or whatever the fuck

650
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:48,070
something bad. It's not going to be
good because I'm going to be good.

651
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,180
Then it can become miserable.

652
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,420
And then you can see somebody young one
day who isn't in their way and you're

653
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:53,950
actually going to try to discourage them,

654
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,410
which is going to make you
feel like a piece of shit. So,

655
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,043
mmm.

656
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,710
The biggest thing I would work
on it is you just have to really,

657
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,240
you have to be conscious of
when your brain's telling
you you can't do something.

658
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:11,160
You 16 fucking years old, okay? You got
the whole, the whole, your whole world,

659
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,820
the whole fucking life in front
of you. And, uh, you know,

660
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,240
you can start making a movie tomorrow and,
and this is the great thing too.

661
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,210
You have just give yourself the
permission to suck. It's your first one.

662
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:25,350
It's supposed to suck. All right?
I had no idea how to do stand up.

663
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,470
I just signed up for an open mic and I
went on fucking stage and I hung on for

664
00:39:28,471 --> 00:39:31,560
dear life. And you know what? I
sucked and I sucked for a while,

665
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:34,560
but every time I sucked a little bit
less and that's how you got to do it.

666
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,550
And I had all that negative shit
going on in my head. And, um,

667
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,990
I bought those fucking books
on how to think positive,

668
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,580
which was hilarious with my negative
mind is just as I'm reading it, uh,

669
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:53,280
wanting to absorb it, I'm also ripping
it apart saying this is bullshit. But,

670
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:58,000
um, I dunno, I, unless you're
like clinically depressed,

671
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,300
just negative thought is just
a habit you can get out of.

672
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,580
And that's kind of what I found. And you
just have to be conscious of it. And uh,

673
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,180
you know, it's really
just a choice. You know,

674
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:12,250
you just think a negative thought
and you're like, all right,

675
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:15,250
there's a negative thought. Step
back, look at it and be like, Oh,

676
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:16,540
do I want to fucking,
you know,

677
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,290
tie myself to that thing and have it
pulled me all the way down to the ground,

678
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,310
or am I going to say,
you know what,

679
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:25,150
fuck that thought and think something
positive. No, I'm gonna make, I'm gonna,

680
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:29,020
I'm gonna make a movie.
What I would do if I was you is I would,

681
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:34,070
I would just be thinking about guys
like Tarantino or spike Lee or a,

682
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,990
uh, Kevin Smith. Any of these
guys who just were like, fuck it,

683
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:42,510
I'm gonna make a movie.
And they just went out and did it.

684
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,240
And next thing you know that they,
they had a career.

685
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,390
Those guys can do what you can do.
That's just focus on them.

686
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:54,090
Um, yeah, that's what I do. Fuck it.

687
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,350
You know,

688
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:00,190
I'm a balding redhead in his fucking
business who has a nerve to try to go and

689
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,400
audition for movies every week.
What a fuck do I get off doing that?

690
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,820
Who wants to see that on screen?
You know,

691
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,870
but what do I think of people still
want to see at Harris? They don't care.

692
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,120
So fucking,
I'm going to look at Ed Harris.

693
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:17,440
I'm not going to fucking be focusing on
all these washboard middled full head,

694
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,560
a fucking hair run for
president looking fucking jaws.

695
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,040
Like I kill myself.
Jesus Christ.

696
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:28,940
Now I'm starting to depress me.
That's what I would do.

697
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,050
You want to make a movie? You Go
fucking make a movie. That's what you,

698
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:32,781
that's what I would do.

699
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,120
I don't why you feel like you're
not going to finish high school.

700
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,810
You could do that.
You know you can do it.

701
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,090
You know there's gotta be a way that
you can get a high school diploma. What?

702
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:45,980
What if you have to transfer you gotta
fucking transfer to a new school that's

703
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,550
cheaper. So what? You come in, all
of a sudden you're the new guy. Hey,

704
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:52,400
who the fuck is this guy? Right? You
come in like fucking clinics. What?

705
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:55,160
All of a sudden you getting blown by
some chick because she thinks you're

706
00:41:55,161 --> 00:42:00,080
mysterious because you have a different
area code. It can happen just you know,

707
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:01,340
I was going to say by a trench coat,

708
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:04,400
but that's probably not good to do in
Colorado. Was it? Oh, that was a bad one.

709
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:07,640
Sorry. You know what I mean? This,
you got to think positive. All right?

710
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,100
If you keep thinking negative,
that shit's going to happen.

711
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,950
If you think positive and you do the work,
that's the critical part.

712
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,870
You'll be fine. And thus ends my little
self-help afterschool special here. Right.

713
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,710
All right. Don't write to them.
Don't, don't keep taking that shit.

714
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:25,400
I want to hear a few from
you in six months going,
hey, actually made the movie,

715
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,510
it didn't come out that bad. You're
going to learn a bunch of Shit, you know,

716
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,800
believe me and the, and that's the
kind of thing also that never ends.

717
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,710
I'm still learning shit.
Every time I go and tape a special,

718
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,490
there's always something. Ah, fuck.
You know, the first time when I did,

719
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,420
why do I do this?

720
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:46,220
It was the first time I was ever the guy
calling the shots and I forgot to tell

721
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:49,220
them that I needed a clock. I just
assumed that it was going to be there.

722
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,880
And I went out and there was no clock.
There was no way to tell how long.

723
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:56,080
I didn't know what time I went out and,
um,

724
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,010
ended up being a little bit of a
cluster fuck at the end of it. Um,

725
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,650
so then the next time I did a special,
I had a fucking clock, you know,

726
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,840
and uh, you know, I, I just
did another special, I learned
something on that and I,

727
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,250
and I was like, what the fuck? When
am I going to have this thing down?

728
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,930
There's always going to be obstacles. It's
just a, it's just basically how it is.

729
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,560
All right, so there we go. Now how about,

730
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:27,490

762
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,690
Did you guys understand
that by the end of it,

763
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,510
I was doing so well with that
copy to, you know. Um, all right,

764
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:34,620
let's get the last one out of the way.

765
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:38,780
So I can just be like a moron for the
rest of this site. amazon.com everybody.

766
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,840
All right. Do you go there?
Do you buy stuff? Both?

767
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,180
You think it to go in there rather than
going directly to amazon.com once again,

768
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:50,181
go to the podcast page on [inaudible] dot
com and click on the Amazon banner and

769
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:54,870
just, you know, buy whatever the hell you
want. Not Saying you got to buy anything,

770
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:58,740
but if you want to buy something,
if you go through my website to do it,

771
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,580
um, they're gonna kick me back
a little bit of that money.

772
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,960
And 10% of that goes to help,
uh, the wounded warriors project.

773
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,370
So you'll be supporting my podcast and
supporting the troops and it doesn't cost

774
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:13,620
you any extra money on amazon.com.

775
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,210
All it does is wear out your index joint
just a little bit more by having to

776
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:20,070
click two more times.
That's all it does.

777
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,450
So maybe someday when you're 90
and you go to point at some kid,

778
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:28,590
I shed get off my property and your
finger locks, you can blame me.

779
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,500
Okay. But until then,
you'll be, you'll be,

780
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,410
you'll be helping out my
podcasts and more importantly,

781
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:38,530
you'll be supporting the troops. And I
got to tell you, it's awesome. It's all,

782
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:42,600
it's been a great thing. You know,
I've been, I've been able to, uh,

783
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,010
send out a check to the wounded warriors
project, which makes me feel great.

784
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,370
It's just a great cause
and, uh, I've been doing it.

785
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:52,560
It just been rounded up to
the nearest hundred anyways,

786
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:56,560
and I'm actually thinking about, given,
you know, even more than that. Um,

787
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,560
God, Oh, come on. How do you, how do you
beat that project? You know? All right.

788
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:05,370
That's it. All right, let's
move on here. Um, advice.

789
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,160
Don't take shit from
anybody. Question Mark. Bill,

790
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,460
sometimes you and your podcast with go
fuck yourselves and don't take shit from

791
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:15,510
anyone. Well, let me tell you
my story. Back in November,

792
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,170
a cop pulled me over,
roughed me up,

793
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,110
was a huge asshole and wrote up
every rinky dinky ticket he could.

794
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,020
Okay.

795
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,040
Now, okay, now wait a
minute. What happened?

796
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,510
You were just down the street and
this guy just pulled you over.

797
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,200
I need a little bit of the backstory.
Here was this guy, did you know,

798
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:38,020
did he get into a big fight with his
wife and then took it out on you?

799
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,120
Or we did you say something wise
to the guy and he said, all right,

800
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,370
I'm not in the fucking mood anyways,

801
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:47,980
let's see if we could figure it out
here at the end of the altercation.

802
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,570
I shook his hand. Look him straight in
the eyes and gave him that look that says,

803
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:54,310
I will see you in court asshole.

804
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,220
I showed up in court this
Monday to defend myself.

805
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:02,080
My plan was to stand before that asshole
and having him explain his actions to

806
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,290
me in a court of law. Add, dude,

807
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,620
this ain't gonna work out unless she
had a witness. I wanted to ask him.

808
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:09,850
Even then,
that doesn't work out.

809
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,500
I wanted to ask them if twisting my arm
so much that I couldn't use it for a few

810
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,460
days was justified. I want to ask
him why he decided that me five,

811
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,890
six 175 pounds was a threat to him.

812
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:26,130
Six foot to six foot three 250
that he need to hit me from behind.

813
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,490
Um,
don't call me an Asshole,

814
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:34,940
but I'm not 100% buy in this story
because you didn't say what happened

815
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,900
before this.
This guy just did this.

816
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:44,700
Is this guy like the fucking
worst cop ever? I don't know.
Here we go. I wanted to,

817
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,840
I wanted to know why he needed to demean
me while I was handcuffed in the back

818
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:49,830
of the paddy wagon.

819
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:54,720
I then wanted to ask him
how many excessive force
complaints he had against him.

820
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,690
The answer is four. Oh
Shit. So I'm wrong here.

821
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,300
I wanted to ask him
how his marriage ended.

822
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,560
His ex wife has a restraining
order against him for
domestic violence. All right.

823
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:07,290
I tap out. You're right.
You're right. Sorry. Uh,

824
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:11,010
I wanted to ask him what part of
protect and serve did he not understand?

825
00:49:11,011 --> 00:49:14,580
I want it to end the questioning with him
explaining how he got caught on a cell

826
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:16,950
phone camera assaulting a motorist.

827
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,130
You can look up the video on youtube
under Milwaukee Police Lambo driver l a m.

828
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:26,550
B o driver.
Here's what sucks in Milwaukee.

829
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:31,200
If the cop that wrote you the
ticket dis doesn't show up in court,

830
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,160
your case is dismissed and you don't
have to pay anything. We'll guess.

831
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,240
Guess why I told you that the piece
of shit didn't show up in court. Aww,

832
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:42,450
that's awful. I need
advice too. I let this

833
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,410
all be water under the bridge
or do I take this fucker down?

834
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:49,410
I really want justice, but I don't
want to be beaten by other cops.

835
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:52,710
What should I do?
Um,

836
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:59,030
well I think you just a shed some
light Milwaukee police, lambo driver.

837
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,050
All my listeners will probably
look up and watch that. Um,

838
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,400
now this guy sounds like a dangerous guy.

839
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,580
Look, you know, this is,

840
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:15,070
this is what I would do if I was
going to try to take this dude down.

841
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:18,250
What I would do is, you know what
the local news loves doing now.

842
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:23,430
They love showing like youtube videos
and they love talking about Twitter and

843
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:26,890
all that type of stuff because they're
desperately trying to get the kids and

844
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,250
people because they're losing

845
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,870
all this viewership to a, to the
Internet. So the fact that you,

846
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,090
you have this controversial thing,

847
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,610
you have this fucked up law and you
have a youtube video of this guy,

848
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,260
um, that makes, that's like one
of those perfect little pieces,

849
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:50,600
you know, coming up next Milwaukee
police officer or a little out of line,

850
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:55,090
check out the youtube video
that everybody's been talking
about all the Lord at.

851
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,050
Yeah, I mean, you could go that way. Uh,
but yeah, I mean you, you'd taken a a,

852
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:03,800
you're definitely going to
take a fucking risk. Um,

853
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:06,530
you know,
so you can heal.

854
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:10,220
Rodney King died this week and that
brought up that whole video and all that

855
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:13,460
type of shit. And I know, you
know, the guy just pulled over.

856
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,010
That's what you supposed
to do. I know. I mean,

857
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:20,180
they look at who's kitten know Rodney
King was going to get beat down no matter

858
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:23,480
what. I mean, if you've run
from the fucking cops, I
don't give a fuck who you are.

859
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,400
You got to get beat down.
But if you get back up,

860
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:28,820
you charge him a couple of times
absent fucking loopy. But you know,

861
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,690
there's gotta be a way to take a guy
down without giving them 12 fucking skull

862
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:37,430
fractures. You know what I'm
saying? It's a fighter. No,
it was, uh, it's, it's, it's

863
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:39,680
okay.

864
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,470
It's a fucking thankless job and
then it's a really dangerous job. If,

865
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:48,920
if the wrong kind of person gets a,
gets the job,

866
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:53,690
why did my phone just go off? Oh, that's
right. I got to do that ship. So, um,

867
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,130
I don't know. Personally, I can't, I can't
ever watch that Rodney King thing again.

868
00:51:58,131 --> 00:52:00,470
That's like fucking,
it's the most brutal thing ever.

869
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,850
And actually when you watch that, now
you go, thank God they got fucking a,

870
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:06,950
okay.

871
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,520
What do you call those things? Taser.
What did he, what did we clear?

872
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,220
What do you call those things? What do
they call those things? They just, uh,

873
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,390
they Zappia did you guys
ever see that one? Um,

874
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,230
that one where they,
the cop.

875
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:22,860
Okay.

876
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:27,240
What the fuck do you call those
things? He got tased. He got fucking,

877
00:52:27,241 --> 00:52:31,380
is it a taser? Cleo? Why am I so dumb? Ah,

878
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:39,360
fucking love this dog.
You know that Cleo, um,

879
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,980
underrated having a dog. It's the
best fucking thing ever. Anyways,

880
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,610
this I I to get you this youtube video
now that it brought it up, it's uh,

881
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,550
it's basically they're
doing a demonstration of
one of those fucking things.

882
00:52:53,551 --> 00:52:55,670
Whatever the fuck you call them
that I just can't think of.

883
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:59,280
Why do I keep saying it's a taser?
I know it's not a he is it a taser?

884
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:03,390
He got tazed I can't fuck
it. I, my brain is mush.

885
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,480
So anyways, there's one cop
gonna Zap another cop to uh,

886
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,940
demonstrate it to the class and look,
man,

887
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,980
I don't give a fuck how
much of a man you are.

888
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:17,010
You get fucking Zap with electricity.
You're going to make a noise.

889
00:53:17,011 --> 00:53:20,610
Most guys go like fucking go down. Uh, uh,

890
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:25,970
this guy fucking shoots it at the guy
and this sounds like he's like ending an

891
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:28,523
opera.

892
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:32,170
He gets tased.
He's like just fucking drunk.

893
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,280
He does literally something like that

894
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,440
and drops.
And I just love how the cop was shoot.

895
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:44,770
Some tries to act like he
just didn't scream out like
a little fucking girl, man.

896
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:48,200
It's hilarious. But, um, but getting
back to that, yeah, dude, that's,

897
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,940
that's a serious, um,
that's a serious thing.

898
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:56,150
And you and you, you know, if this
guy really is as bad as you're saying,

899
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,000
you know,

900
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,880
the right thing is not to let it go.

901
00:54:00,881 --> 00:54:03,700
The right thing is to try and shed some
light on it and hopefully that they can

902
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:08,530
get this guy off the force because he's
given decent cops a bad name. They go,

903
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:12,940
so, but your, your
worries are definitely a,

904
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,340
you know,
valid.

905
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,770
I mean, considering none of those
cops during the Rodney King,

906
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:25,430
none of them got fucking, they got, they
got off. If you can get off doing that,

907
00:54:25,431 --> 00:54:28,920
I mean, Jesus Christ, you know,

908
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:31,830
that dude who shot that kid on
that platform and in Oakland,

909
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:34,830
that was fucking brutal. He's
like, oh, I thought it was my, uh,

910
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:36,000
thought it was my house keys.

911
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:39,120
I didn't realize it was my gun
and he fucking got away with that.

912
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm not trashing cops, I'm just saying,
not saying they're all fucking bad,

913
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:47,630
but I'm just saying, I mean it's,
it's practically fucking impossible.

914
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,983
MMM.

915
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,630
It literally,
even if you have video,

916
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:57,490
I think you have to have the combination
of having video and then you have to

917
00:54:57,491 --> 00:54:58,324
be,

918
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,580
you have to be a certain level
of a wealth and influence

919
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:09,460
because if you're broke, you know, I don't
think that they're, that, you know, you,

920
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,410
there's no way they're just going to be
like, yeah, go fuck yourself. You're done.

921
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,470
You know? And then when you add racism
into it, I mean, you're pretty much,

922
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,000
it's pretty much game set match, which is
fucking unfortunate. So, um, I don't know.

923
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:23,630
I'm talking about society way
beyond my fucking intellect.

924
00:55:23,631 --> 00:55:28,270
So I'm going to tap out here already
trashed fucking hair metal and I'm would

925
00:55:28,271 --> 00:55:31,670
have fucking angry,
a psycho cops mad at me.

926
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,650
And then other people fucking think, I
dunno. I don't know what the fuck. Okay.

927
00:55:36,651 --> 00:55:40,730
Response to having kids.
My kid is turning me into a queer.

928
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,210
Okay. Hey Bill, I listened to the
latest podcast like I always do.

929
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,380
I heard that you heard you start
to make a crack about having kids,

930
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:56,260
then catch yourself and say,
I hear it.

931
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,050
I hear it's the greatest
thing ever though. Uh,

932
00:55:59,051 --> 00:56:03,880
I'm a total hard ass
attitude attitude wise.

933
00:56:03,881 --> 00:56:08,530
At least I'm not a tough
guy. Bully piece of shit. Um,

934
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,400
all right, so you're, you're a ball
bureau ball breaking wise ass like me.

935
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,600
So anyways, I'll make this short so you
can read something more interesting.

936
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:20,610
I crack jokes, listened to rock
music and watch sports nonstop,

937
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,840
but my newborn son is querying me.

938
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,960
If he gives me one more
cute looker giggle,

939
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,370
it'll probably start a path to a
wardrobe of visors, khaki shorts,

940
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:34,180
braided leather belts,
and penny loafers with no socks.

941
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,480
I bet in a few years I'll probably raise
the pitch of my voice and at the end of

942
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:44,950
every, at the end of every question
I ask him. Um, well that's good.

943
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:49,450
That gives me hope. You sound like
an angry walled off emotional psycho.

944
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,870
And uh, this kid's making
you giggle. Honestly, sir,

945
00:56:53,871 --> 00:56:57,820
when was the last time he giggled?
You know, that's when, you know,

946
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:01,630
you had a fucked up childhood is he
actually legitimately giggle and then it

947
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:05,020
makes you hate yourself and then you
actually, even when you're by yourself,

948
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,850
if you giggled,
you actually get embarrassed.

949
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:10,480
You literally to the point your
face gets a little flush. Uh,

950
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:15,100
like that's how much shame you carry for
actually having any sort of opinion on

951
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:18,010
any sort of emotion that isn't just
straight up. Go Fuck Yourself. Well,

952
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:22,090
let's go ahead, man. I'm
happy for you. Um, I hope,

953
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:25,420
I hope that happens to be
someday. I hope I'm, I'm, I'm a,

954
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,433
you know,

955
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:33,860
I dunno, mature enough at some point
to ever have a kid, a dilemma, a bill.

956
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:35,000
What would you choose

957
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,180
to either have sex with any woman
in the world? Nia wouldn't mind.

958
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:42,770
Okay.

959
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,390
I wouldn't care if she gave a shit.
If I,

960
00:57:44,391 --> 00:57:47,450
my choice of any fucking woman in
the world just to do it one time.

961
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,740
Uh, that wouldn't be worth it. It
wouldn't be worth it to lose Nia. But,

962
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,980
but my Dick would override
that wisdom in the moment.

963
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:02,880
Um, or to have access to the truth
about any government secret in history.

964
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,640
What would you do? All right, well,

965
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:09,830
how would I know any
government secret in history?

966
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:11,240
What would they know that I knew it,

967
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:14,030
and then they'd start tracking me down
and then I'd have to be like fucking

968
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,740
Jason Bourne for the rest of my life.

969
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:21,410
Never getting to sleep more than
five seconds between concussions. Um,

970
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,160
all right. First of all, if I could
have sex with any woman in the world,

971
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,953
who would it be?

972
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:29,950
Okay.

973
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:33,220
Uh,
let's see here.

974
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,430
We got the k you got,
you got your major groups.

975
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:43,060
I think you've got four major groups. You
have famous, you have celebrity women.

976
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,620
Yeah.

977
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,453
MMM.

978
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:51,120
You have, uh, like celebrities,
like movie stars. Then you have,

979
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:55,470
you have a rockstar chicks,

980
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,570
sports checks,

981
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:03,700
and then he got chicks from your past.
You know,

982
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,960
some teacher you always wanted
to bang any woman in the world,

983
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,170
you're going to go back. But she
has to be as hot as she was. Oh,

984
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:14,460
this is a dilemma. Oh, by the way,

985
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:17,190
the other day I was at
a comedy club in that,

986
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:22,070
that a pink was dad was
actually in the crowd and uh,

987
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:26,390
I didn't go up or anybody, she
walked by it just fucking, absolutely

988
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:32,700
like slumped against the wall.
Beautiful. Absolutely fucking gorgeous.

989
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,960
Um, I'm telling you some of the, like,
those fucking like super famous people,

990
00:59:36,961 --> 00:59:41,160
like they don't even look real when
they walk by. They just liked it.

991
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:45,270
That genetics, like, I don't know
what happened, but I'm just like,

992
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:49,500
Jesus fucking Christ, you know? I mean,
I knew she was good looking, right?

993
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:52,140
I've seen the videos, but everybody
looks good and videos, you know,

994
00:59:52,141 --> 00:59:54,120
and then half the time you
seem it fucking real life.

995
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,980
I'll tell you this right now. If you
ever see pink, she does not disappoint.

996
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:04,350
Fucking just write down the checklist.
Absolutely fucking gorgeous.

997
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,950
You know, beautiful fucking dress.
That was sexy, but not slutty.

998
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,000
She had the fucking tattoos, but
not too many of them. Fucking,

999
01:00:12,001 --> 01:00:16,470
just absolutely a fucking gorgeous.
I felt like I was in second grade.

1000
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,930
Um,
you know,

1001
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:21,410
like when a beautiful girl walks by
you like up the bid the day you'd have,

1002
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:25,500
you don't even know what to say. Um,
all right. So let's get back to it.

1003
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:30,350
So if I could
bag any woman in the fucking world.

1004
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:36,680
Well, there's two kinds of women.
There's the woman that you,

1005
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:41,230
you're fucking is absolutely gorgeous
and makes you believe in an afterlife.

1006
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,640
And then there's the other girl you
want to bang just to shut her the fuck

1007
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,493
Guthrie.

1008
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:51,653
You know what I mean?

1009
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:56,490
Like I bet there's a lot of liberals
out there that want to just bang and

1010
01:00:56,491 --> 01:01:00,900
culture, just stick their dick right in
her fucking mouth. You know what I mean?

1011
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,320
But not like a totally malicious way.
Just really put one on her.

1012
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,960
Was She just fucking
losing it and you know,

1013
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:11,820
making noises in bed that she didn't
even know she could make and uh,

1014
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,713
you know,

1015
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:17,340
and make her be able to make those noises
even though she knows that you voted

1016
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,430
for Obama. You know, there's
that kind of fucking right.

1017
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,960
And then there's the other one
where you just want to fucking, uh,

1018
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,240
you know, run down the beach,
hand in hand with some girl,

1019
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:37,490
at least in my world, that's the only,
those are the only two. What would I do?

1020
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:39,860
You know what?
I would choose a,

1021
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,370
I would choose sex with any
woman in the world because, um,

1022
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,350
that government learning
a government secret,

1023
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:51,920
I've actually done that on a
certain level. And it just,

1024
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:54,320
it's like being in show
business is when you're like,

1025
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:56,990
wouldn't it be cool to meet this person?

1026
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,890
And then you meet them and they're
like the biggest fucking asshole ever.

1027
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:06,710
Or they, uh, I don't know. They just
like, they just do something that

1028
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:08,610
okay.

1029
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,070
Just, it just blows your whole
fucking image. It's, it's,

1030
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,120
it's the wizard of Oz thing where you,
you don't want it,

1031
01:02:13,121 --> 01:02:15,360
you don't want to peek around the corner.
You don't want it.

1032
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:19,870
You don't want to peek around the
corner. So what I would do is, uh,

1033
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:21,310
okay.

1034
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:25,630
I would definitely, I would, I would, I
would, I would have sex with some and,

1035
01:02:25,631 --> 01:02:30,080
and you know what, it would
have to be somebody famous. And,

1036
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:34,960
uh,
then out of respect for Nia,

1037
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:37,780
I would have to be a, just to shut
them the fuck up kind of woman.

1038
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,360
Although I would love to run down the
beach, you know, why can't I have that?

1039
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:44,680
Why can't I have happiness?

1040
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,750
Yeah.

1041
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,180
All right, let's, let's
pick one. One of each.

1042
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,153
All right.

1043
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:54,780
Yeah.

1044
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,600
Is there any girl I just
wanted was a shut the fuck up.

1045
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:00,243
Yeah.

1046
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:03,520
I would say back in the day it would have
been Madonna, but like, she would just,

1047
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:07,780
she was like beyond the noise. She
was so fucking annoying. She was like,

1048
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:12,850
I would just want to get out of the room.
You know what I mean?

1049
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:17,150
He always watches that blonde ambition
tour and there's nothing more nauseated

1050
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,340
than watching somebody who's surrounded
by yes men. You know what I mean?

1051
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,610
They're just completely fucking obnoxious.
Everything they say,

1052
01:03:24,611 --> 01:03:27,730
everyone's hanging all over every word
and they just laughing at everything.

1053
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:29,530
Like that's, you know, something.

1054
01:03:29,531 --> 01:03:32,250
That's one thing that I have
learned in this business is, uh,

1055
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:37,420
a major red flag is somebody who has
an entourage. If you have an entourage,

1056
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:41,710
like a, I dunno, I've already, I,

1057
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:45,310
I automatically judge you as like,
all right, this person is, uh,

1058
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,700
is not somebody I'm going to want to
fucking be around because the only way I'm

1059
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:50,470
going to be able to do exist is this.

1060
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:55,150
I assimilate into your entourage and
when you tell the joke that isn't funny,

1061
01:03:55,151 --> 01:03:57,790
I can't be like,
I can't look at you like that joke sucks.

1062
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:01,090
I have to fucking do like
what they're doing, you know,

1063
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,200
laugh my ass off because you're paying
for my hotel room with the fuck Outta

1064
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:07,540
here. Right. That and,

1065
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:10,890
and people who don't hang out with peers,
you don't,

1066
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:12,700
maybe they don't have an entourage,
but everybody,

1067
01:04:12,701 --> 01:04:16,120
they hang out with his fucking like
10 years behind them in this business.

1068
01:04:16,121 --> 01:04:16,781
Then that's another,

1069
01:04:16,781 --> 01:04:20,200
that's another red flag because then
nobody's calling you out on your shit.

1070
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,610
Right. That's, that's how I look at it.
How did I get to that with this shit?

1071
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:29,530
You know what, I'm going to have to
get back to you on this one. You know,

1072
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,730
I'm a fucking 44 year old guy, so I don't
really sit, you know, when I was younger,

1073
01:04:33,731 --> 01:04:38,200
I had my, my, I'll go back in the
day, my list. Okay. When I was a kid,

1074
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,880
uh, the bionic woman, all
three Charlie's angels,

1075
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:48,370
uh, Farah, I wanted to
bang, I had lust for her,

1076
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:49,630
Kate Jackson.

1077
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:53,740
I would marry and Jaclyn Smith get out.

1078
01:04:53,741 --> 01:04:55,840
What's your fault for stand
in between the two of them

1079
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,070
you're going down to?
But you know,

1080
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,960
I didn't need Jaclyn Smith
because I already had the
Brunette with, with fucking,

1081
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:08,130
uh, Kate Jax. Um,

1082
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,940
then who else?
Who else in the 80s?

1083
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:14,860
Okay.

1084
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,660
I like what's her face,
the replacement for Shelley long.

1085
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,580
Uh, who was in the look who's
talking, she came on had that horse,

1086
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:27,000
smokey foresee fucking smokey voice,
whatever the fuck you thought to say.

1087
01:05:27,001 --> 01:05:31,260
It's supposed to sound way
more sexier than that. Uh,
she had nice fucking curves.

1088
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,060
Got a little out of control there
after a while. But uh, you know, um,

1089
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,690
she still has nice hair.
I got to tell you,

1090
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,340
uh,
who else?

1091
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,540
You know what's weird?
Florence Henderson,

1092
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:50,680
when she had the worst mullet haircut
always turned me on more than when she had

1093
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:54,920
that awful fucking, oh, Marsha.

1094
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:58,070
Marsha Brady, when she fucking
had the little short skirts on.

1095
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:00,143
Okay.

1096
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:04,850
Fucking a Janet Jackson when
she was on a different strokes.

1097
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:08,003
Who else?

1098
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,940
Agile as it goes on for fucking ever.
I just can't remember anymore.

1099
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,710
He's never Cindy Lopper
I could tell you that

1100
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:25,250
she didn't seem like some
spazz little fucking boy to me.

1101
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:31,070
Yeah. And then that fucking
haircut that she had was,

1102
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,990
she fucking had like a tic Tac
toe board on the side of her head.

1103
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:35,220
That just really freaked me out.

1104
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,153
MMM.

1105
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,960
Not that I was totally
against that here cook.

1106
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,360
Cause I thought that chicken bow wow.
I thought she was hot.

1107
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,533
MMM.

1108
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:51,850
Ooh, fuck else. Did I like Lita
Ford. Oh my God. That I like her.

1109
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,450
I think I might've somebody back dead.

1110
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,250
I can't fucking remember.

1111
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:00,803
MMM.

1112
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:06,350
Anyways. Is that the podcast? Can
I end on possibly liking Lita Ford?

1113
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,830
All right. If you had to bang any of
the runaways, who would your bank?

1114
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,213
Uh,

1115
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:16,600
I would've said Pat Benatar cause she
was the hardest. But just, you know,

1116
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,240
knowing that she didn't really want
to do it, you know, I be to that,

1117
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,310
that would be awful.

1118
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:27,490
And we can tag team and other chick with
her. I don't fucking know. All right.

1119
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,190
Listen, this is, I got shit to do.
This is the podcast for this week.

1120
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:33,640
I apologize for it being Sadam late.
Um,

1121
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:37,390
keep the emails coming and
I'll keep doing the podcast.

1122
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:41,040
I guarantee you next week's podcast,
I will be doing Sunday nights,

1123
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:43,300
so it's ready for Monday morning,
even on the east coast.
