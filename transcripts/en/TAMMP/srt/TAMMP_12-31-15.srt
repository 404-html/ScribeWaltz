the world as we know it.

7
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:26,400
It's the last day of the year and uh,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,540
What is up bill?
Nothing.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,550
We've just been enjoying the drama of the
morning waiting for Jason Lyon and fly

12
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:49,050
of the world as he knows it
and Jay doesn't feel fine.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,570
Do these text messages
he's been sending me.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,490
Jay Lie had got snowed in and Cleveland
and he was freaking out that he was

15
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:59,050
going to miss the fucking rose bowl.
So you know,

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,430
we fucking did a little thing or whatever.
You've got a flight and he's fine.

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,930
He has a flight and he just eat the
whole time. He's so fucking dramatic.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,130
All right, man. What did he say? Pray for
me. Pray for me. This is unbelievable.

19
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:12,530
They can make a movies.
Oh yeah,

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,120
do they could make a movie
about me trying to get,

21
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:17,880
trying to get back to the rose bowl.
It's like, dude, you have a ticket.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,190
The plane's going to leave.
It connects to Dallas.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,770
Where's the conflict in the
movie? There is no like, oh,

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,200
here's the doll in his head. Uh,
it's the funniest. We Love Jay,

25
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:32,460
but he's the best did.
But this guy is constantly falling.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,930
These fucking things. Like some
of the shit he says, he goes,

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,780
he could text me this morning. He goes,
looks like I'm going to be all good.

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,540
Flight is on time. Audit
Dallas. It's like, yeah,

29
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:46,720
why wouldn't it be once you
get out of Cleveland airspace,
you headed south? Yeah.

30
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,590
It's like, was he waiting for the
taxi to break down? Like there's no,

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,830
I have no idea. So he goes,
he goes, I love it. He goes,

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,420
flight is on time out of debt. Looks like
I'm going to be okay. So I write, okay,

33
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,620
great. And then he goes, and then I
go out, you know what's, you know,

34
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,160
I got the regular charcoal in the natural
stuff for the stuff we're going to

35
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:08,790
smoke. What we did with the whole rose
bowl. Yeah. Tailgate checklist here,

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,360
you know, sound good. And he goes, yes,
sounds good. And then he goes, great,

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,040
may have jinxed myself.

38
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:18,240
They just send out that announced that
maintenance is on the plane and they will

39
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:22,500
update us in 15 minutes was
supposed to board 10 minutes ago.

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,160
This is fucking insane. It's
like, hey, it's going to be,

41
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:30,720
it's the yen Bellville world as he knows
it. And I just wrote back, I the funny,

42
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:34,640
I wrote back, you'll be fine and
yield then and we got to sig,

43
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,450
you'll be fine. Uh, my God
dude. And then he goes,

44
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,910
a lot of Hawkeye fans on
this flight translation,

45
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,210
a lot of fucking ugly to people
like that. And I said, yeah,

46
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,870
the big ten's a little rough, you
know? And he goes, yeah, we make,

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,670
we make Lyman and full backs and then
it goes boarding. Now thank Christ.

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,140
I mean, I've never, I've never
seen it in like it. Jay's is like,

49
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:03,000
if the other shoe could drop, nope.
He's almost willing it to drop.

50
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,320
I swear to God to play crashes.
I'm blaming him. It's not
going to be pilot error.

51
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,560
It's him in the back. Just gone like,
God, God, turbulence. Here we go.

52
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:15,050
It's the end of the
world. Yeah, I, we got it.

53
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,610
We got to fucking tease amount of it. He's
never going to, that's who he is, dude.

54
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,760
He's got to see this. We all got
our things. That's his. I know.

55
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,550
I get all worked up about fucking
star wars do. We were drinking.

56
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,170
We're drinking cognac last night and I
was flipping out about star wars once

57
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:32,950
again. Oh Dude. You Changed Moods.
It was, I'd never, you went from,

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,880
you would've thought somebody told you,
you know horrible. Oh yeah. You just,

59
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,370
you were like, compared to what I
would try, it drives me fucking nuts.

60
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:45,360
You just nine is better than any of
those fucking things. No, I know a dude.

61
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,730
But then after that you just looked at
your drink for a second and we're shaking

62
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:51,930
your head. And I was like, I think
he's, he really mad. I don't know.

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,690
I just know exists. This
fucking drives me nuts. Like

64
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,460
just say you enjoy the movie. Don't be
like, oh wait, it's fucking bullshit.

65
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,570
It isn't. It isn't that. I don't know
why it bugs me. It just bothers me. What?

66
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,150
I just have to be like,
what? Jesus Christ.

67
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,980
If you think that's the
greatest movie ever,

68
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,690
what do you do when you see raging bull?

69
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,960
I honestly questioned if you got into it
with somebody in the past about it and

70
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:16,480
it's still with like in you,
like to,

71
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:20,770
something happened like the way you got
mad. I was like the business, it's like,

72
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,500
is there something I'm missing?
You know, you know what it was?

73
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,240
Cause I had tequila before the Cognac.

74
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,320
It was just all that hard stuff
was that Tequila was unreal. Yeah.

75
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,670
Oh I thought that was a good
one. Oh, that was unbelievable.

76
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,580
But would be an angel's today cause we've
got two shows tonight at the Orpheum

77
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,800
and your eggs. Oh my God. And your
eggs. Oh yeah. You know what, Paula?

78
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:43,720
Like medium. Paulie likes the eggs over
medium, numb over medium. That's the,

79
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,310
you have to care. It's an art.
You got it. You got to care.

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,650
They make over medium over easy. It just
fucking flippity ago over over hard.

81
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:55,600
You just burn it up all the medium.
You can't and you gotta pay attention.

82
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,190
You nailed it over medium as you cut the
middle of the yoke and it doesn't even

83
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:04,270
go all over the place. It just slowly
oozes out. It's still soft. You nailed it.

84
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,930
You know the and, and the waffles. Dude,

85
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,900
I gotta tell you I haven't had
a bad meal out here. Oh yeah.

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,430
Been cooking up a storm for first.

87
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:16,630
He and his lovely wife here every morning
having a great time. Scrambled eggs.

88
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,410
Fucking ah, walk. I'm on the flight and
fluffy with the cheese in there. He can't.

89
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,850
Yeah, no, it's great. As a cook I am Blah.
Hits 10 times better, you know? Yeah.

90
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,020
I'm mad out of the special. It's
probably got a break. I've, I had,

91
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,863
I don't know what's going to happen.

92
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,510
We got to get him on here at
tease him about that. We Love Jay.

93
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,850
We just fucking around. But
until you, these text messages,

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,120
I swear to God to pray for me would think
is pray for me is so ridiculously over

95
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:48,100
the top. I looked the guy in the movie,
the sniper didn't have dialogue like this.

96
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,100
He's just trying to make a
connecting flight and you know what?

97
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,900
I want to look up Dallas right now and
I'm going to see what the fucking way,

98
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,750
if had to guess, what is the weather
judging by those texts, you know,

99
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,670
they had to have been like
a tornado warning, right?

100
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,470
I bet you the weather there is
like 48 degrees of 55 degrees.

101
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,810
Okay. Clear skies. I mean, I don't
know if I'll ever take off. You know,

102
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:16,710
it's 51 degrees. I almost
nailed it. Precipitation,

103
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:21,180
0% humidity. Humidity's 0%
winds, 10 miles an hour. Nothing.

104
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,350
Dude, you could barely fly a kite
and I'll get a weather drone.

105
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,880
Wouldn't have turbulent Jesus Christ.
Check.

106
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,580
Uh, uh, sorry if I got a little
heated last night. I don't
know. When I, when I get,

107
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,060
when I drink the fucking hard
stuff sometimes it brings out,

108
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,340
it brings out the uglier side of me.
It was so funny man.

109
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,450
Like Stacy and I were just like,
I did he get like,

110
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:51,170
it was really funny cause you got, you
went from like, we've just, by the way,

111
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:55,100
that Cognac, Oh yeah, Paul, Yours
also got, and I'm a lunatic. You know,

112
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:59,570
you realize I'm a lunatic.
Yeah, but no, but no, but I
don't think you're a lunatic.

113
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:02,720
I just know I am. Look at Jay
flips out over fucking nothing.

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,170
I flip out over like Jay slips out.
I basically,

115
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,410
but everything I've slipped
out over like dumb shit dude.

116
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:12,560
You Act like your high
school rival loves star Wars.

117
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,850
No, I lost it. My high school,

118
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,010
I had this thing and he was a star
wars guy and you weren't dude.

119
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:24,100
That's how I just want someone
to agree with me. It's like,

120
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:27,910
what am I not seeing that reminded
me, you Chappelle, please believe me.

121
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,130
Nobody just be like, this is the
greatest thing ever. And like, like,

122
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,340
Oh, some Rockwell and moon was
fucking up like that blue, that move.

123
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:40,930
We blew my fucking mind. You
know, I didn't see that. Ah, yeah,

124
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,010
I didn't want you to do that.

125
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:45,820
And they go watch one scene with he walks
and I want you to justify that fucking

126
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,960
50 mile lied. I though I understand
is for kids. I get that. If you're,

127
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:51,630
whatever I do,
I can I let you go.

128
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,560
I lost my mind is the adults
that are still getting like,

129
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,380
I mean this movies that I loved when I
was a kid and I watched them now and I'm

130
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:02,710
just like, oh Jesus. You know, dude,
I actually see what you're saying.

131
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,530
I like star wars because I was a kid
and I saw, I see. It's ridiculous.

132
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,160
The big monkey to Chewbacca Tourette's,
just funding,

133
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,680
you know, but, but,

134
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,600
but then there's a cool side to it too,
like evil and good and the same.

135
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,600
I like the light saber fights, dude.
I just, you know, but as a kid,

136
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,110
I was extensive thing. I was a kid.
Okay, you like light saber fight.

137
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,010
Once you watch enter the
dragon with Bruce Lee,

138
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,420
I mean you want to see some good fighting.

139
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,780
Even remember talking to people with a
flashlight and I'll remember talking to

140
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:35,240
yesterday and they're like,
all go into the hall

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,950
while, wow, that's a
fucking no, remember we were

142
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,920
on the charity must sit.
Yeah,

143
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,810
I tell me the fucking same voiceover guy
or did Jabba the hut in fucking Yoda is

144
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:53,710
not the same guy.

145
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,090
The guy with the hands and say,
I did the cookie monster

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,400
job, or no bother. I think
it's the guy from Amistad.

147
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,720
It's all the same thing.
But here's the thing, dude.

148
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,610
You know when you go into a sneaker
store and you're like, oh my God,

149
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:15,750
those Jordans bring me back. It's the same
thing. And you're like, oh, Jj Abrams.

150
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,060
Well, yeah, he's a good director.
Let's see what he does with it.

151
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:20,310
You got to check it out, dude.
It's two hours of your life.

152
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,580
That's how I look at it. It's two
hours of your life. Now, to your point,

153
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,680
being dressed online as
Chewbacca, that's crazy. You know,

154
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,510
be having gowns and like,
you know,

155
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,550
women dressed in the princess lay of
bikini with the hair done. That's, so,

156
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,170
that's a little much, I would
never do that. I just say a man,

157
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,810
like give it a chance as it was. He did
a really good job. That's all. I'm not,

158
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,090
I'm not saying it's not a good movie,
but I'm just saying,

159
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,080
it just blows my mind that this is not,

160
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,970
you can have a two mile long line
for that fucking movie. Well,

161
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:51,410
how many long a mile should it
be? Full, full moon district nine.

162
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,620
It wasn't taught Moonraker or just
actually good of science fiction.

163
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,220
Yeah. I just think I love
that too. I don't mind.

164
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,000
I come to the future when,
you know,

165
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,030
there's no water and all that type of
shit and we fucking destroyed ourselves.

166
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,880
And you know, I'm not in design B's. I
don't like that to meet. This was good.

167
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,450
Brings was, that was the shit for me.
If this was good, that was the shit.

168
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:20,070
I love that movie. I liked that movie.
Uh, uh, I'm gonna said Riddick Bowe thing.

169
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:24,870
Rhames ving Rhames did, uh, you know,
the one with the monster couldn't see me.

170
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,380
He had to move the same way he did. Do
you remember that? No. Fucking rent those.

171
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:31,830
He had the diesel vin diesel.
Sorry,

172
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,320
I didn't see [inaudible].

173
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,660
That's why I thought the guy
they act of thing was rig bull.

174
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,060
Redick Redick and then I went to Bang
Bang. Yes. See how my brain works?

175
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,090
Riddick boats. But your name's in the
words while Paul do what you gotta do.

176
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,010
Jewish sourced up Annapolis to do,

177
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:51,980
I looked at with chef Gordon was
going number 24, number 24, the light.

178
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,750
No, we were all, we were all over each
other also to heavy heavy vodkas in,

179
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,520
you know, we were hammered in the
first period. Am I don't know,

180
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,450
it's kind of a reoccurring,
a story of a,

181
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:07,770
speaking of which Paul you're saying
in the, uh, the beginning of 2016.

182
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,310
Yeah. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
You're going to put it over. Yeah.

183
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:16,530
And my wife and I talked
about it. I called you up. I
said it. I'm doing it 100%.

184
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,630
Starting after this trip.
This is my last hurrah.

185
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,810
I got three days people and then I'm
going to go, I want to go six months,

186
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:25,530
but I'm definitely going 90
days clean, dry, no booze.

187
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,960
I'm cutting out the carbs,
going,

188
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,470
going to the track and a run and
I'm going to drop. Uh, you know,

189
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,420
the funny thing about me is my
doctor always said, he goes, dude,

190
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,560
you're the same way. It always, he goes,

191
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,100
you just got to lose a little bit of his
stomach. And he goes, I do do exercise.

192
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:38,370
I'm like,

193
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,540
I've been 15 pounds overweight for fucking
10 years and I'm getting a 15 pounds

194
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:46,620
done. Done. What about sticks? So Gosh,

195
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,950
it's going to be a, it's
going to have to be, uh,

196
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,880
it's going to have to be a serious
occasion is going to have to be a serious

197
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:59,320
occasion. Okay. It's going to have
to be a holiday. I'm dropping back.

198
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,910
I mean, maybe one a month.
That's what I'm going to do.

199
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,030
It's going to be a special occasion.
Well, actually, when they say when you,

200
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:09,040
you want to really make a change, you
should just try to do one thing at a time.

201
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,410
So I think just not boozing alone,

202
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,940
you'll probably take off half the fucking
weight. Right. Not boozing alone and,

203
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:17,770
and just not smoking a
stick. You, Joe Zimmerman,

204
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,120
you don't always a funny comic dude.

205
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,850
Funny comment from I think that DC
area is that they're really funny.

206
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:24,790
And we were doing the road together and
they'd go, hey Joe, did you smoke cigars?

207
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,500
And he just looked at me and he just goes,

208
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,610
only when I celebrate and the way he
said it though, do it. It was just like,

209
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,320
it made me realize, what am I doing?
Oh No, it's stupid. It's, yeah,

210
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,960
it's ridiculous to knock it off. You
know, way better than me though. Yeah.

211
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,940
I'm kind of overwhelmed to be
honest with you. It's like I can't,

212
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:44,410
I just can't do it anymore.
I just can't,

213
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:48,910
like I can't fucking just wake up
with that taste in my mouth again.

214
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,580
I can't do like,
I got rid of my human doors and all that.

215
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:54,520
I don't even have cigars in the
house anymore. And it's just like,

216
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:58,180
if somebody calls me up, I got
a buddy of mine that, you know,

217
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,420
like once every six weeks, like, you
know, hey man, yeah, you want to go ahead?

218
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,900
And I said, all right, I'll go, I'll
go do that. But like, uh, you know,

219
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,720
I know you dropped off with them when
you used to call me and we'd talk about

220
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:12,220
certain brands and sticks and you stopped.
Like you used to be like, oh dude,

221
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:14,670
I went to the thing, I
got this, you know, I'll,

222
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,470
I'll send you a picture of the
label and you stopped that.

223
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,750
I noticed that you stopped. I had to knock
it off, but like I still, I still like,

224
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,880
I like the cigar, but, um, I don't, um,

225
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,330
yeah, it just, it just kind of Chi
just, I had too many and I just,

226
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:35,410
somewhere on that last bus trip we
did right before the New York shows,

227
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,910
um, I just had it, I think when we
were in that great one in Milwaukee,

228
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,990
but we were just like,
just the doors were all closed.

229
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:45,550
There was 20 people smoke now
that that was brutal. Yeah.

230
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:48,460
The next day I was just
like, oh my God dude. Like I,

231
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,860
I feel like that when like
that smoke one of them,

232
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,430
the marrow in my bones here that I,

233
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,570
and I could tell when Steven
[inaudible] was with us,

234
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,300
he wanted to be with us and hang out,
but he couldn't,

235
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,370
he when he was sitting there,
I knew he was just like,

236
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,540
it was way too much people in there
smoking. Oh yeah. And it made it brutal.

237
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,990
There was like 10 guys and then like for
women showed up and they were smoking.

238
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:10,570
It was smoking. We were one
little room. It was awesome.

239
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,680
But I would say it was too, it
was too much. Yeah. Yeah, I do.

240
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:17,410
But I gotta tell you to do California
will be a problem for me cause you could

241
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:20,980
just go out here and just in the sunshine
and just smoke a stick and ball every

242
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,590
day. Yesterday I go, I'm gonna
smoke half of this with a coffee.

243
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,410
I don't need a clip at the end of it. Once
I start going but not do it, I'm, yeah,

244
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,650
I'm going, I'm going clean.
I said to my wife too, I go,

245
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:33,860
you don't think you're going
to do it? And she goes, no,

246
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:35,710
I actually know you're going to this time.
I'm definitely doing it.

247
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,590
I'm definitely doing it too.
I don't think you're gonna make it.

248
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,540
I of course you don't know. I'm just using
reverse psychology. I'm going to make,

249
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,850
I'm going to do, I feel one of those
guys, you know one of those guys.

250
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:50,650
You need to be like, dude. People
said people said I couldn't do it.

251
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,520
Yeah. Wait, you don't understand. When
I put my mind, just stuff that we do,

252
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:59,450
the funniest shit talker ever. I'm a
time when we were on the fucking road,

253
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,750
you know [inaudible] he's
on the fucking elliptical.

254
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,930
Does like 40 minutes now and I did over
an hour and I crushed it. That one.

255
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,970
I don't want your to do over an hour
bill. I did an hour. I had a time,

256
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:12,260
then I did an hour. Now the next time
I ask you why I did it, 15 minutes.

257
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,330
That was what it was
on, whatever, whatever.

258
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,750
I did an hour because I made sure
I did six. What Paul goes, he goes,

259
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,890
looks at me and he goes,

260
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:23,360
no one goes harder than me at the gym
and I'm dying laughing like you didn't

261
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,250
lift one. Wait, you
didn't. When he pulled up,

262
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,080
he got on that like some chick who just
had a baby and you try to lose your baby

263
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:32,360
bump that you are on a fucking
elliptical for an hour.

264
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,480
I was on the elliptical for an
hour. I went hard for now, but yeah,

265
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,930
I did nothing else. Like no
pull ups. No, no. Yeah, no.

266
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,850
Doing the butterfly through the fucking
pool, like some of these maniacs to duty.

267
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,150
The thing is you see who the fuck are you?
So people who go hard at the gym,

268
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:50,330
you'll look at it and they look
like statues. They go hard. Yeah.

269
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,100
We just show up and try to,
we try to maintain, yeah,

270
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,450
would. I've been going to my gym recently
to do an hour done. It's hilarious.

271
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,310
Getting back to uh, you know, going
to the gym and stuff like this month,

272
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:06,020
I want to make sure I went on a lot just
cause I knew it was going to eat like a

273
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:10,220
fucking animal. And uh, there was like,
you know the, you know the workout couple,

274
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,770
you know? Oh yeah. So like the fucking
dude is just jacked and she is fucking,

275
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:16,400
she's like,

276
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,630
like she's probably lifting 60% of what
the fuck he's lifting and that she had

277
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,840
these giant fake tits and she
had this look on her face.

278
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:24,800
Like she didn't want to be there.

279
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,940
She was one of the scariest people
have ever seen in my life. Shit. Hair.

280
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:29,720
I'll pull back Chin like
this scowl on her face.

281
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,890
And she had like these fucking
world war two like pinup girl,

282
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:35,150
like the member was bullet tits.

283
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,790
They used to have back then because of
the way they used to shape the bras.

284
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,740
She's walking around in this sports bra.
Like I swear to God,

285
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:45,080
if this woman wanted to, uh, just
pick me up and body slammed me,

286
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:49,130
she could dress in Latino. And they also
do that. They like that couple that like,

287
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:52,800
you know, uh, and she probably had an ass
like me. They got their notice noticing.

288
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,650
No, but they were like, they were all that
workout, do that workout shit. I don't,

289
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:04,930
I don't get it like these
fucking, these fucking uh, uh,

290
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,540
Mr Mom sweatpants that I have,
which are fucking,

291
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,100
I can't throw them off because
they just won't wear out.

292
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,260
I have had these things for like 12 years.

293
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,180
I don't get these people just
constantly buying the latest like yeah,

294
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:19,610
they'll buy the latest
Jim Shit. Jim Shit. Yeah.

295
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:22,730
So like the latest Cim shit now as you
have the socks that looked like they have

296
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:27,020
the bones going up the Achilles
and then they got oh yeah, again,

297
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,740
like to like the vertebrae,
whatever.

298
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,130
And then they got the things like goes
up on a status that's a Jim status thing.

299
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,450
That's like, listen, I'm a regular and
you just show up. Like this is my home.

300
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,840
You fucking dope.
I never understood how that Nice Jim Shit.

301
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,470
It's like you're going to go there and
sweat your balls off. Like I go in,

302
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,660
I trust like a bomb day. Live forward,
dude, I've talked to those guys.

303
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:51,410
They're like, Jim is part of the gym
and they go their dress nice. Yeah,

304
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,720
it was a part of, it's just, you know,

305
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,600
it's like the same way I show
up on the golf course, right.

306
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:58,220
It's come walking out there wearing
either sneakers at Timberlands,

307
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:01,160
whatever I have on you. Actually
Dude, I remember. Do you actually,

308
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:05,830
if you don't give a fuck and you
never will, I could tell, but duty,

309
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,810
I will use a putter and a Sandra,
you were hitting some good gifts.

310
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,890
Guy gave a fuck. Yeah, you don't
care. I the dumbest thing and I,

311
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:18,250
and I just don't like dude fucking having
to sit there and watch somebody line

312
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:22,180
it up for fucking what seems like
20 minutes. It's just like, dude,

313
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,800
you know you're going to slice
it and then they'd stand out.

314
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,290
That I wanted to do a bit about that.

315
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:30,640
Just imitating somebody fucking standing
over the ball when he went all of that

316
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:34,330
shit and doing the thing with the head
and fucking relax. Now who does it?

317
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,950
Why does a thing with his
head, my brother's got this
other thing that he does.

318
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,970
I was going to combine everybody's
little tick and then they lend,

319
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,680
they fucking hit it and it goes into
the woods and then they had the nerve to

320
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:48,450
stand there. Like they don't understand
what just happened. It's like, dude,

321
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,570
did you forget the last 12 holes?
She been doing it the whole fucking day.

322
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,380
You don't have any money on it. Well,
you just go up and hit the fucking thing.

323
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,410
This pizza behind. That's another
thing. Can't stand about God.

324
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,280
Fucking stress of the people behind me.
I'm just like,

325
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:06,100
I'm ruining these people's
Day, dude. The lion,

326
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,330
the lion head nod thing, he does
it. He's almost eight golf for the,

327
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,890
you know, he's a very good guy. He's a
good golfer. A Golfer too, but like, uh,

328
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,810
he's bit, Jane's changed
about seven, eight trucks.

329
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:22,170
Better Golfer than I am because
he's out here. I can't mean he's,

330
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:25,340
he plays a lot more than I do. I mean, I
don't know if I'll ever play again. I bet

331
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,721
you loved,

332
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:32,520
you loved how I didn't like when he was
doing the gimmes all when we do a bit.

333
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:33,510
Yeah,
cause I was like,

334
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:37,350
well that's another thing too is the
amount of cheating that goes on where

335
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,840
people hit the ball.
I'm going to hit another one.

336
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,740
I mean you're going to count that
one. Not the worse. It's a gimme dude.

337
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:48,660
I count every fortnight. What did I,
what I shoot on knife like 120 no,

338
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:49,860
no, no, no. You, you were,

339
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:54,450
you and Barnick or in like you shot 70
salary shall I guess 58 or 60 [inaudible]

340
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,620
and Barnet shy like high fifties and
you shout like low sixties or whatever.

341
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:02,250
I counted every of every single
stroke and I didn't take one.

342
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:06,360
Gimme that's such a
pussy fucking yeah it is.

343
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,230
[inaudible] was little. I had to
yell. He was so far away from the cup.

344
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,470
Yeah. And bought, you're
going to take out a five iron.

345
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,710
That's part of me wanted to like
hurry up. So he was like, no,

346
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:22,560
just pick it up and you know me
did. I was like, Nah, you can't. Oh,

347
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,720
that was my favorite game within the game.

348
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:27,780
Watching the two of you guys competing.
Yeah.

349
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,510
Cause you guys are both good golf Stewart.
And then what's his face? Dot. John?

350
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:34,270
The bus driver was 36.
Yeah, he had a 30, 36 to

351
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,740
36 do that. Oh my God, that is on pace
to do 70 was he was, he was, yeah. He's,

352
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:45,240
he was a good golfer. John. See
what? This is a man. That's funny.

353
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,890
All right. I'm just making sure there's
isn't something from the venue. So Paula,

354
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:55,840
what are you busting out tonight for new
year's w Alpha wise. Oh, you know me.

355
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,610
You on fresh classic kicks.
I'm not doing the Jordan zone.

356
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,320
Doing the Rod Lavers I took,
I took [inaudible] to a
friend of ours recommended.

357
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:09,580
I said, all right, I got a big time
east coast sneakerhead coming out here.

358
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,710
Where should I take him? And boy,
did he nail it? Uh, he said he,

359
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:17,080
the one was that fight club dude.
It was a motherload.

360
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,020
Like it was like a system overload
my head. Like what you were,

361
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:24,640
you were with the dog next door. And
I walked in and I saw Jordan, threes,

362
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:28,240
Jordan, fours, fives. The Senate threes
is what you want. And I couldn't,

363
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,120
I couldn't tell. How about my wife? How
about my wife? Dude, this is my wife.

364
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,810
Stacy's out here with me and she's
having an absolute great too.

365
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,730
The funny thing about her
is she never turns it off.

366
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,690
So we're walking on Melrose in the
sunshine, getting ready to eat lunch,

367
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,050
going into stores, everything she
loves and her brain couldn't handle it.

368
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:47,560
She's like, I don't have anything to do.
What the fuck she has kids and Becky's.

369
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,010
Yeah, yeah. You know, she's got that like
you ain't shit. You know, she can't relax.

370
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:54,700
I can relax, Bill. You know that
I can relax. You know what I mean?

371
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,970
I could put my feet up. She can't
said when we were walking around,

372
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,910
she was just like, this is an angle you
haven't fun. And she's like, I might,

373
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,660
I don't know if you know what to do, how
Larry, you know what to do, so you're,

374
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,690
you're inside. And she just goes,
look, they got the Jordan threes, Paul.

375
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,531
They got them.
She goes,

376
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:12,130
I've been looking for him and I look
underneath and it says 800 bucks.

377
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,170
And she goes,
let me just let me just get them for you.

378
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:16,960
Let's just get them and I can't
get, first of all, I was like,

379
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,920
it's marked up insanely. What are they
huge? This still usually get five or six,

380
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,890
you know, but I'll bear a
sneaker. I was like, I can't go.

381
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:27,490
I guess like I like them but I don't like
them to pay to 50 extra on top of the

382
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:30,400
girls present already is. So she's a
close, just do it. And I was like, no.

383
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,550
But then I saw the fourth,
the fours and the fives do it.

384
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,550
I would before you walked in
there, my eyes, if you just saw my,

385
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,800
I can't believe you know
all of Stacy just send,

386
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:43,660
my jaw dropped and I was just like looking
at all of these things the same way.

387
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,820
I can list all like the
super bowl champions,

388
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,130
the way that you know all
the Jordan's sneakers.

389
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:51,220
Like I Yab I'm not as good as
certain people, but I'm, I'm getting,

390
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:53,470
do you know what's weird is I'm turning
into a sneaker head more and more cause

391
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:56,470
you got to wear it. Listen, when you
get older, I told you got to be a man.

392
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:59,950
Needs to things. I was always
taught this. You know what they are?

393
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,370
A man needs a nice watch on his
wrist and an alibi and a nice

394
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,280
and a nice pair of shoes. Whether
it's kicks or shoes, they got up.

395
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,860
I don't know about the kicks things.
I don't remember the kicks.

396
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,100
If I'm just saying the foot game
needs to be on par, you know.

397
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,810
That's what I'm saying. Whatever you
look when somebody looks at your feet,

398
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,170
it's like, oh my God, those are
crazy. You. Whatever sneakers you get.

399
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,270
I either love him or I just,
you either go,

400
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:24,730
those are classics and I love them
while you're like, I hate them. Yeah.

401
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:29,560
Because there's a generation gap between
you and me with sneakers where I came

402
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:33,820
up with as Starsky and Hutch
Adidas dragons, Adidas country,

403
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,260
Nike Cortez,

404
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,530
which I picked up and I loved yesterday
and I was called at these man with the

405
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:41,440
red one, you know the white with
Forrest Gump and that's what kills me.

406
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:45,010
You go Forrest Gump. Well that's what
he ran in. I know, I didn't know that.

407
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,880
So he ruined those sneakers.
Yeah,

408
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,370
because he got a pair of them and that's
when he put them on and he just left

409
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,920
the house to started running
and then you see them get older.

410
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,480
But he kept those on the whole time.

411
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,980
Beard when you really love those
sneakers students. So, so clean.

412
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:00,860
And then what has somewhere around
would Shaq came into the league?

413
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,030
Like the sneakers just got so bizarre.
Like I remember one time he had,

414
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,480
it looked like a bullseye and the circles
just kept getting bigger and bigger

415
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,890
and bigger. The ones who, when he had,

416
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:13,880
when he was on in Orlando
and I was looking at those
things and I remember those

417
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:16,570
younger kids can all look at the shacks
and got the shacks and I was looking at

418
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,440
going at that. It looks lazy. Ugliest.

419
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:22,900
Now the shafts were fucking those Red
Adidas Yoga. I remember one time. Yeah,

420
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,530
but those Adidas I have are just classic.

421
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:28,580
They'll raise red or red with white
stripes and they're clean dude.

422
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,980
But I remember one time we
were on the road somewhere.

423
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,190
I haven't watched blog gray ones.
You've just bought gray ones. Yeah,

424
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:36,260
they're right there. They're all
fucked up. No. Yeah, dude, you are.

425
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:39,530
We were on the road and I was standing
to the right of the stage and I was just

426
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,280
going out there, watch some of your set
and everything like that, and I just,

427
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:46,590
for 45 minutes we're staring at your
Adidas and even list I was even listed.

428
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,870
I was just like, those
are clean. All right.

429
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,460
But those red ones are
one of my favorites.

430
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,430
You can see the ones hanging in there.
Yeah. On the on the bottom right.

431
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,620
That's Adidas country. The white with the
green. Those are those for me. Those are,

432
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,630
that's, yeah, that reminds me of
like 1976 Olympic Games. Yeah,

433
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,720
like like you know, led you
to, that was about 1978 yeah.

434
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:13,070
Due date is country flat and I can't,
that's, that's too, that's too old, dude.

435
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,460
I had to stand, but then you and then
the ones that, hey, six are cool.

436
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,770
Those are basics of cool, but then
the, then the other one's red.

437
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:22,850
Those are Adidas dragons. Smith's.
You've got black Stan Smiths.

438
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,970
You got Dick. I am the old clay got the
old school and they got Nike Cortez.

439
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,850
That's where I can't get,
that's where you lose me.

440
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,740
Like if I look at all your things,
you've got to,

441
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:32,930
you got to Stan Smith's
on top with your crazy.

442
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,270
You got to read the a six I could go with,

443
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,050
you got the Cortez I could go with and
then all of a sudden it gets down to the,

444
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,830
to the Bruce Jenner.
It's like you've said all the shadows.

445
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,550
I looked like a punter in 1974 yeah.
Those look like to punt.

446
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,570
Still a puzzle that doesn't
like old school soccer
shoes. I love wine. But yeah,

447
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,880
that's like you. You got
the leg. Would you have,

448
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:56,750
or like those Jordan's you have right
now that's like say should have the

449
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:00,530
blinking light in the back for a little
kid because it's got the infrared color.

450
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,740
That's what you don't like about,
yeah, somewhere around there.

451
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,440
They made the oh no's.
Yeah, that shit. And when,

452
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:08,810
when the sunglasses starting to having
the neon green or the neon pink,

453
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,040
the all along the side,

454
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,760
that's when the outfielders we're
in the Oakleys that the shiny,

455
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,080
they were big and shiny.
No,

456
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:20,081
just like every due to put Mousse in his
hair and had a chain around gold chain

457
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:23,300
around his United in the late eighties
had the fucking, those, those,

458
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,140
they would like the Tom cruise shaped
sunglasses from risky business and on the

459
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:31,940
side it was either lime. Oh aw,
that's terrible. Yeah. That's when I,

460
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,410
when those colors were in, I never
looked more pasty cause I just could not,

461
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,100
I could not pull them off.
So I had to just stick with my whole life.

462
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,380
I've dressed like Malcolm
young to be honest with you.

463
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,830
Did you ever wear Cavariccis ze couch?

464
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,230
I got with one of my first ever war I had,

465
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,430
I had z cavalry

466
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:57,900
with the Cosby sweater,
driving gloves for whatever reason,

467
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,460
rough on yesterday. Okay. And uh, and
a, a waist linked like leather zip up.

468
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,840
Ah. And I think I had a
hat on too was bad dude,

469
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:08,040
you and Z calves,

470
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,890
because I grew up in an Italian
neighborhood assumption and the kids,

471
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:14,920
they all warm. But like I remember they
were the four g Owen's, there was a,

472
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,770
and they just all had them.
I never wore them.

473
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,160
I never wore as coverage and
it just didn't, it wouldn't
have looked comfy pants.

474
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,070
He had no puffy up top and
then tapered taper down.

475
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,630
But it was the MC hammer pants.

476
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,770
It was basically the dressy and they
were pleated. Oh. Oh, that was so bad.

477
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,260
They were awful.
And they crushed,

478
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,250
it was like one detail that
would make any pair of pants bad.

479
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,570
They took like all five and they
just throw it in one, you know,

480
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,850
it's like that a were the mystery meat,
you know what I mean?

481
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:44,290
We just throw it in upon,
give it to the soldiers. Ah,

482
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,290
I remember one time I put
on pants and Stacy goals.

483
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,250
Those have pleats in it and I've,
yeah, no they're not. And she goes, no,

484
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,710
you can't do it unless you go into
an eighties party. You cannot,

485
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,340
you can't have that on any
fucking level. But, um, uh,

486
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,250
I wasn't gonna say, yeah,
so dude, you, you know,

487
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:03,730
you have no idea what you're in for
tomorrow. They'll go into the desert.

488
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,780
Got me excited. Like, Oh yeah, I
never seen like, you're going out,

489
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:11,160
you're going to butcher shops. You
can be, I made the big square ice.

490
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,390
He'll make you get nuts with the ice.
I was like, this is going to be nuts.

491
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,200
I it in a book. You know what really got
me? I saw a football and a pump. Oh yeah.

492
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,810
Oh yeah, dude, we can be out on the
golf course. Ah, fucking lie had,

493
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:29,340
makes the sickest fucking breakfast
sandwiches DOJ going, you know,

494
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,740
what's the greatest thing is
when we pull up at this point,

495
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,310
we're becoming that tailgate that people
look over going, ah, they make an x,

496
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,640
why we should run eggs.
You guys are the guys at the Rose Bowl.

497
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:40,650
Like you'd becoming all that good.
But there's always the,

498
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,250
I don't think you get your official,
like you're,

499
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:48,030
you're the bad ass tailgates until
you're literally dragging a smoker in and

500
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:52,560
there's a bus. No, when you have like
the satellite dish and you got like a TV,

501
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:56,550
like those girls guys, we hung
within, uh, for the ut game. Yeah.

502
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:58,350
Now giants where the giants play as a guy.

503
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:03,351
He basically painted a school bus giants
and then he's got the tarp over and

504
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:07,170
like that, like the TV's on, like
those guys are staples there.

505
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:11,490
You guys aren't that yet. Are
you on? Okay. Okay. No. But
they, they, uh, those guys,

506
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,900
I went with some guys,
uh,

507
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:17,010
and Cleveland long time ago I went to a
browns game and there was some guys out

508
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:20,940
there that bought a short bus and they
painted it, this, this and this shit.

509
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:24,600
They painted it Cleveland Brown colors.
And then they had this dad,

510
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,690
this crank on the back
and on top of the bus.

511
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:30,420
Like these goalposts would come up and
you'd be in the parking lot and you'd

512
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:35,370
kick field goals. Oh my God. Anyway, damn
it. Oh, I think I saw that on TV. Oh,

513
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,080
is all they might've made it did up.

514
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,540
Fox did a thing on that
guy and they were like,

515
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,620
and people could line
up to kick field goals.

516
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,440
They were doing it at the Cleveland.

517
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:47,410
I don't know if it's the same one because
sometimes people see ideas and they

518
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,530
take, so, okay, but this was a
Cleveland Guy, isn't that awesome?

519
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,370
And then they really played like full
contact beer pong. They went nuts.

520
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,510
And I remember I tackled the guy
from John Lawrence from hilarity.

521
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,730
I tackled him and somebody had just
dumped the hot coals on the knee,

522
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:08,410
went right down on it and he got like
almost borderline second degree burn on

523
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,040
right under his kneecap and
he's putting snow on it.

524
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,800
I felt horrible and he was laughing.
He didn't care. Maybe I'll do that.

525
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,000
What's one of the sickest games ever?

526
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,250
As far as like the weather we showed up
and it was just that fucking Lake Erie

527
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:24,190
snow,
but it was just like,

528
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,730
it was just fucking cold
enough for it to be snow.

529
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,730
So it was wet snow and there was some
guys standing there, this fucking guy,

530
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,850
he had like a high school Letterman
jacket on. He was this skinny dirt bag,

531
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,330
look and fucking, you know the, the Dale
Earnhardt and mustache. Why are we guy,

532
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,380
no hat.
And he had like that fucking straw hair,

533
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,990
full head of hair but straw here do it.
And it was just,

534
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,850
he had like an inch of snow on his fucking
head and somebody finally just pulled

535
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:56,230
out an awful old Cleveland hat and put
it on his head and he just goes, yeah,

536
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,760
thanks. He just sort of shook his head,
do it and I swear to God it was like,

537
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,080
like the amount of snow that
came off of his fucking head.

538
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,630
Like if that guy didn't give him that hat,
I was looking at that,

539
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,010
looking at the guy going,
that guy,

540
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:13,180
if this guy stays out in the elements
for an entire football game where he's at

541
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:17,650
now, he, this guy is going
to die. It's fucking insane.

542
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,810
So this won't be, it'll be a little
cold tomorrow, but we bring like a,

543
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,410
we bring like three cords of woods,
so you know,

544
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:26,470
if it gets a little cold with the whiskey
and the system and I don't get cold

545
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,590
and I haven't got it doesn't get cold.
And with the Whiskey,

546
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,360
I'm going to be drunk kid, dude.
It is not, there's California.

547
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:35,080
How calls are going to beat them off?
Forties fifties it's gonna be a,

548
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,270
it's going to be like 39 degrees,
40 degrees.

549
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:42,060
If it stays not in the twenties
39 40 duties. That's like
47 40 Shelly. Yeah, yeah,

550
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,410
yeah.

551
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,980
You're going to be getting
up and someone's at first
thing going to get as an

552
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:48,580
ice cold beer, which is not what you need
to warm up. I'm telling you man, pardon?

553
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:48,831
No,

554
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:52,690
but as soon as I'm going to be warm as
soon as the goes birthing heater heater,

555
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,880
if you want to hit it. Yeah, it's great.

556
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,220
It's one of my favorite things
is after a shell, after shell,

557
00:31:58,221 --> 00:31:59,380
what would it was me,
you and Barton.

558
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,990
The best thing about touring with
bill is we all have a schedule.

559
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:05,210
We all have a system and we're
like the little brothers, right?

560
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:07,160
So then bill goes up and we always go our,

561
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,400
after our sets he bring bill up after
our sets we're going to go and do it.

562
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,670
So I go into the green room and Barton
extent it goes like he makes it,

563
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,550
he makes us thing with his face
where he gets real happy. He clearly,

564
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,520
he clenches his teeth and he makes a
fist and he smiles with his teeth clinch

565
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:27,000
and the fist shakes and he goes and then,
and then comics when pop

566
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,430
you want to pop. Like he just makes you
feel like anytime you have a drink it's

567
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,200
like he's, he's unbelief he could make,
he could make like doing feel okay

568
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,453
him.

569
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,540
Do you want to borrow for your lateral
and it's great the way presented it.

570
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:52,270
I'll take a pump but um, no dude.
You know what made me laugh?

571
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,610
I thought about this and I hope you
remember this because you made me think

572
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:57,310
about it cause you know I'd be talking
Shit right at a game with you going to do

573
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,100
dude. If they got that field go, think
back at the truck. I'm going to kick.

574
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:02,410
I guarantee you I kicked her in a role.
Like I would be talking shit.

575
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,140
Oh he would go beyond
that. I could, I could hit,

576
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,940
I could hit 48 yard at. You'd
be like, as you're doing it,

577
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:12,760
you don't keep just making up shit as
you call it. The funny thing, he says,

578
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,510
me and you were at Monday
night football in New Orleans,

579
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,720
remember against the
eagles. Oh God. We saw Vic,

580
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,430
we saw Vic and uh, and that was
when Andrew [inaudible] stadium.

581
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,950
And that was when Andy Reed was on
his way out. And I knew when they,

582
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,970
they just couldn't win, even know Vic
was doing okay man, you leave hammered.

583
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,100
And we're like, dude, we got along,
walked in him and we got a, we got along,

584
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,033
walk back.

585
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:41,110
So some guy standing next to us and
he hears us and he offered us a ride.

586
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:44,620
He was a complete stranger. You don't
remember this. And he goes, Oh yeah,

587
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:47,490
that's right. And he goes, he goes, dude,
I'll give you, he goes, you guys want,

588
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,720
if you guys want a ride,
I mean you just looked at each other.

589
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:52,750
Didn't know this guy from
Sam, didn't know. And we were
just like, yeah, all right.

590
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,710
And all of a sudden we got into a yelling
match cause I said I could throw a

591
00:33:56,711 --> 00:34:01,711
college football 50 or so and I said I
could throw a pro football 45 you go,

592
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,980
you know you're not throwing
a provisional. How fuck.
And we start getting,

593
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,840
and the guy left like right.

594
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:13,780
And so it was the way he was just
left. That's right. He walked away,

595
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,790
said yes to a stranger and he listened
to this nonsense and just walked away.

596
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:24,410
He was like, I want no part of these two
and I guarantee you it was more me. No,

597
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,140
I'd probably get real angry over nothing.
I get angry over nothing and do two.

598
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:31,860
I sort of got one major shit happens.
I don't flip out.

599
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,970
Not all your fucking huge app.
Ah, fuck you gonna do all right.

600
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,870
How do we get out of this? But little
shit makes me calm and cool with anything.

601
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,610
Like he could be like, dude, did you
hear about songs? We'll do. He's gonna,

602
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,780
he's gonna fuck it and it'll be an awful
tragedy and you'll be like, can't do it.

603
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,260
That's bad. But you know, he could do this
and heal better it, you're like, well,

604
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,490
Bill's real positive. And then
somebody, it'd be like, dude,

605
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:53,720
just last star wars movie and
you just like, come on. Why

606
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,200
fucking hilarious dude. Eh, it isn't.
It's one of my weaknesses all that.

607
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:04,240
When we got water damage in the house,
I flipped out about that. But uh,

608
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,330
by the way, dude, challenge was
awesome. Generally speaking,
I'll clean, clean house,

609
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,930
clean up the wife because of
the wife. So, um, so anyways,

610
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,560
we get on to sit here and we got to
wrap this thing up here cause uh,

611
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,380
I got the fuck and I gotta make some pies.
Fee Jackass is tomorrow.

612
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,430
That's the fact that you do that
dude is little individual pies.

613
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,920
You can be thrown down
with the fucking ice cream.

614
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:27,750
You're going to be so fucking
hammered at that point.

615
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,930
Then he get a smoke with fucking
cigar. Yeah. Then you got it.

616
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,080
Then you've got to go watch the game.
That's the funny thing about it.

617
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:37,290
It's the funniest thing is
everybody's like, Ahhh, but
Bart, nick, he goes, hey dude,

618
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,800
I gotta be honest man. The
worst part of that. The,

619
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,030
the day has gone into the game
and I'm like, people do lie ahead.

620
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,630
Ly heads saved bargainings ass last year
they were going to throw him out cause

621
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:49,100
he just sat down somehow. I don't
know how, what did he do? Well,

622
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,410
I don't know how you get separate, how
you get separated from Joe Barden. Nikki,

623
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,110
such a big guy. We somehow lost
him. Like he was a toddler.

624
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,620
He's as big as the Lyman.
Right.

625
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,760
And he just went over and he just sat
down and he was drunk and he couldn't

626
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,520
produce his ticket or while I don't
know what was going to just sort of,

627
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,090
and they were all nervous.
Thanks you too.

628
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:08,910
It was like six of them
standing around going like,

629
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:10,990
how are we going to get this mallet?

630
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,640
And he was hammered in public.

631
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,520
He was sitting down. He, we,

632
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,350
like a lot of people are hammered
in public when they're there,

633
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,840
but they're walking to the bathroom,
but they're walking, you see?

634
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,590
But the second you sit down and you
look like you're gonna pass out and it

635
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:28,620
looked like a homeless guy. Oh,
he was in really rough shape.

636
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,450
They thought he was okay. They don't
understand Joe. Yeah. What are you going,

637
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:37,190
I'm arrested. I'm arrested. Arrested.
I've seen a display of Joe Barr.

638
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,900
Nicole, I'll know it'll never be
down. Well, he'd fuck it. We all that.

639
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,540
So they were about ready to kick them
out and that's when law had gave the

640
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:49,670
famous now famous the teddy bear speech.
Uh, he's a teddy bear. He's like, Hey,

641
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:50,920
you're the guy. You guys
want to take it. Right.

642
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,230
It just kept calling him a teddy
bear and they fucking bought it.

643
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:57,870
And he was able to bring
them back into the,

644
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,250
like to the seated area and sat him down.
And uh,

645
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:03,001
and I actually,

646
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:06,210
I remember telling people that story
last year and then other people used it

647
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,090
later on in the week and with
text me going, yeah, my buddy,

648
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:11,730
they were going to throw them out. I
just can't wait. He's a teddy bear teddy,

649
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:16,500
but adds great teddy bear diffuses
the situation. Dad's gray.

650
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,590
Oh No, Jace, Jace saved. But the
thing that people don't know,

651
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:21,300
and if those security people knew,
Bart,

652
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:25,020
nick Barnack was like member inch scar
face when he was just getting shot and he

653
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:28,950
was just gone and his arm was going
back, but he just kept shooting. Dude,

654
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,650
I saw we were in, we were in
Portland and a guy goes, dude,

655
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:35,100
this is the strongest suite in the
country. Like snoop dog gets his weed.

656
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,560
This is the weed, right? And
we're like, hi dude. I took one.

657
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,460
I took one hit of this thing and you
know I'm not a big weed smoke bill.

658
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,330
I was borderline not
okay for like 50 minutes.

659
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,770
Like I took one hit and I
was like, I can't touch that
again. Law had took three.

660
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:53,670
He just had this look,
pray for me.

661
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,180
He should have been praying
for two Barton smoke,

662
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:58,650
half of it with the other people.

663
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,250
He just get kept going around
and he smoked and drank.
I think he's just walking,

664
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,320
just walking sway, dude. And
he held it together. Dude,

665
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,910
animal animal. He doesn't go down too.
He won't go down. Never went down.

666
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,860
He won't go to Joel Amata. Ah, that's
great. Well I got to speak in a,

667
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:20,850
I'd check lamata Rappaport did a
whole a podcast on a raging bull.

668
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:26,130
Oh, did he do, and he showed me the names
of, I don't know if it came out yet,

669
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:28,140
so I'm not going to know.
Spoiler alert here.

670
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,650
He showed me the names of the people that
are going to be on just talking about

671
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:36,070
why they love that movie. Um, if
it's not out yet, look forward.

672
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,980
If it is out, listen to, it's
what I'm going to do to do,

673
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:39,970
you know what I listened to on,

674
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,490
I was driving out to go visit
some family out here and uh,

675
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,880
Nia put on this podcast of,
um,

676
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,710
they interviewed that
guy that just walked off,

677
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,640
walked off the base there or the
little area in, in um, Afghanistan,

678
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,890
the American troop that just,

679
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,780
just walked off and then got captured
by the Taliban and was there for five

680
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:09,670
years. They interviewed the Guy, dude,
it was, I listened to like three of them.

681
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,270
Why even know about that? Yeah.
Cause it's a big thing now.

682
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:16,240
Should they court martial Omer said
they just let them go cause he did it on

683
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:20,110
purpose. He said that because the
leadership was so fucked up over there,

684
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:24,730
he was trying to create a situation where
people above would listen because his

685
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,410
plan was to walk out and then come back
and I don't know what was going up but

686
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,450
like as American guy?
Yeah,

687
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,030
he just left the US base and
started walking towards them. Yeah.

688
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,050
And they captured him yet?
Well he didn't,

689
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,590
he didn't think he was going to
get caught. I I I'm such an idiot.

690
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:44,110
I'm already forgetting so much of it but
all I just remember was at the end of

691
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:48,280
it they're like this guy had
like some sort of fucking,

692
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:53,250
he didn't like where he was in life
and he had like a hero complex. Okay.

693
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,240
And he was trying to,
like,

694
00:39:55,241 --> 00:40:00,241
he was trying to have like a Hollywood
movie moment and he got his dumb ass

695
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:04,720
caught and then all these troops had
to fucking go look for him and put

696
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:08,160
themselves in danger is
they were trying to get the,

697
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,530
the American guy to Pakistan because
they get them into Pakistan because we're

698
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:15,040
not at war with them. We can't just roam
all over the place and look for him. And,

699
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,340
uh, these fucking guys for like three
weeks straight, which is like to do,

700
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:22,930
could not rest. They have fun and have
dealt exactly and the fucking close.

701
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:25,660
We're almost fallen off just from
March and just trying to find this guy.

702
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,820
So some of them were saying
like, dude, I swear to God,

703
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:31,150
if I found the guy would've shot him.
And then the NPR lady's like, well,

704
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:33,640
I don't understand that. It's like,
how do you not understand that?

705
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,280
Oh fuck that guy. I wouldn't
even left the base. I'd be like,

706
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:40,960
fuck out of and scream animal. He left.
Yeah. I'm not calming. Yeah, it. Fuck you.

707
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,540
Yeah. You better find him
before I do. Yeah, Dude.

708
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,300
Fuck that guy because he
doesn't like where he's in life.

709
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:49,210
He puts some fucking risk of every one
of the guys said when I finally made the

710
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:54,160
trade off because we had to trade like
guys who Guantanamo Bay to get the

711
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:58,990
fucking guy back. And uh, they was
saying when the Apaches landed,

712
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:02,560
this one guy was saying he wanted to be
on the helicopter and they will like,

713
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:07,310
why? He goes, because I wanted to stay.
We're going to beat his ass. Fuck it.

714
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,440
I don't understand. Like I don't think
they literally would have shot him,

715
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:12,970
but somebody saying that like,

716
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,490
you had a fuck cause I'm going to fucking
shoot who somebody would have punched

717
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:17,200
him in the face and knocked
him out and be like, dude,

718
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:20,130
you're putting your fucking
absolutely soldiers resolute.

719
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,870
Fucking perhaps a fucking loser.
What, what was his end game?

720
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,840
What did he want to happen?
He wants, it was like,

721
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,120
it wasn't just his guys by the,

722
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,470
it was like an entire fucking platoon
of people just walking around.

723
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,220
That's her day and af fucking Dan is
Stan for a month trying to find this

724
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:39,830
fucking guy.
And they're all sitting there going like,

725
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,500
like one of the guys who saves
trying to keep the morale up,

726
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,380
make a jokes and shit,
and he goes into the,

727
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:46,910
in the end he goes to the back of your
head, you know, it's all bullshit.

728
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,120
And the employee are ladies like,
why

729
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,930
should I always make fun of the impure
people even though I love the station? Um,

730
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,270
that's ridiculous. He goes,
cause I knew it, you know,

731
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:59,530
after a certain amount of days of
guys in Pakistan, we just have to,

732
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,340
we got to at least look for the,

733
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,940
we have to do this level of force
to the Taliban. Fuck him up.

734
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:06,891
Well,
what,

735
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,340
because you know what was funny was
because of the amount of people that were

736
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:13,390
looking for him, they thought he
was a really important guy. Uh,

737
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,880
so I think that they went more
towards trading the guy. I mean,

738
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:19,460
I only listened to like two and
a half of them, but it's real.

739
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,600
I couldn't listen to the whole fucking
thing because once it was like,

740
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,150
once I found out the reason why he did it,
um,

741
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,220
I was just like, dude, you,
you get, you're, you're off.
You're just fucking fuck.

742
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,210
Yeah. And he's trying to
come off, like he says,

743
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,350
Guy who was really trying to do
something noble. It's like, no dude,

744
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:43,460
you have like some sort of hero
fantasy. It's a selfish move dude. Yeah.

745
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:46,970
And you were going to get in front of
like the brigadier fucking general or

746
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:48,950
whatever and they were going to
listen to you and be like, wow,

747
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:53,450
this guy's making sense. You
know, we're going to change
all of this. Yeah. I don't,

748
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:58,280
I don't, I, I, I was listening
to it and I just like,

749
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:01,190
the sickest thing was when he was
talking about like, he could do it,

750
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:04,310
he gets like 20 minutes away from the
base and realizes he makes this huge

751
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:06,920
fucking mistake and yeah.
And he wants to fucking go back.

752
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:11,921
But he got lost and then because
he's so fucking terrified,

753
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:16,340
his fucking ego kicks in again and he
decides to go even further into the shit.

754
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,000
Oh Man, do something. Like I was
just sitting there going like,

755
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,380
yeah, I do like your middle. Literally
keep palms are sweating but sort of,

756
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,260
but you know he's getting caught
and you know that he made it.

757
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:29,570
So that took a little of the edge
off. But it's just like, dude,

758
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:33,260
like they literally skin people alive
out there that fuck you're doin.

759
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,810
Do their cut and fix the
fucking heads off dude.

760
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,840
Well that's what they
would when they would do,

761
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:42,590
what's funny is the Afghany people are
on the podcast talking of some of the

762
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:47,030
guys that found them, not the Taliban
guys, but they're funny going like,

763
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:50,810
uh, they're like, what did he seem
like they will laugh and I go, yeah,

764
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:53,600
he seemed pretty scared. That was the
funny thing. Listen to the Afghan,

765
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:54,860
they just sound regular.
You know what I mean?

766
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:57,680
Cause there was makeup everybody out to
be a fucking monster and it was ray. Yay.

767
00:43:57,681 --> 00:43:59,870
Seems scared.
So at one point they wanted,

768
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,080
because they couldn't speak English and
speak that they were trying to make them

769
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:06,050
feel like, don't worry, we're not
going to kill you at this, you know,

770
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,070
so there was some sort of dance that
they did and the, and he goes, freak me.

771
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,110
Exactly again,
we're going to kill this guy.

772
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:20,270
So they though they said that that calm
him down and the Afghany guy laughed.

773
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:22,920
He goes, Nah man, it made
them more nervous. Go Dude.

774
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:27,410
I would have done some sacrificial
like that's like the ready to kill,

775
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:30,540
Ya know? It was fucking funny. But with
the thing about it is, so what I liked,

776
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,480
the thing that I enjoyed
most about the podcast,

777
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:36,000
I was listening to somebody on the other,

778
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,890
or just a towns person over there just
sounded regular and cool because the way

779
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:43,200
they make it, see this is the
stories you hear over there.

780
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,760
When I picture Afghanistan,

781
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I just picture a barren wasteland
and if you walk anywhere there,

782
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,070
somebody is going to jump out from behind
a rock and saw your head off as you're

783
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,750
alive. Yeah. I think
of, I think of it, uh,

784
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,010
while lighting the other part of the bond
fair foot turban going, we will, yeah,

785
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:04,620
they touch you think. Yeah. And then
he listen to this guy going. Yeah,

786
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:08,610
we did the common values. Like,
Nah, Beta one, nervous listening.

787
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,620
I'd fucking hang out with this
guy. So anyways, all right.

788
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:15,840
That's the Thursday afternoon
podcasts. Do it. I'm psyched.

789
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:18,420
You're out here on another great year.
A bunch of great shows.

790
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:23,280
So we're going to do tonight, uh,
downtown La fucking Rogan's at the uh, uh,

791
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:26,790
the Wiltern. Yeah. Lot of comedy
here tonight. I can't believe, uh,

792
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,380
enough people showed up for ours to
make it good shows here. Um, you know,

793
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:33,510
with rogue and a robe
with a fucking monster.

794
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,310
You ever seen him live long time ago?
Ah, unbelievable. So it's huge. Huge,

795
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:41,400
uh, like, uh, influenced when I,

796
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,410
when I first saw him as
far as like, like, uh,

797
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,230
there was such like a glass ceiling
to headlining and Boston. Yeah.

798
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,730
It was just like,
he just didn't have,

799
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:54,660
they had the legends and they weren't
leaving and they were fucking hilarious.

800
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,330
So there was only, so you had
a, he was the guy that like,

801
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:02,910
like I learned like you got to leave to
come back and headline because if you

802
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:06,060
stay here it's literally you
got to wait for people to die.

803
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,730
It's like getting fucking
season tickets to the packers.

804
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,200
It's like it's not happening man.

805
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:13,680
I got to go move to where in
Jacksonville I'll get 50 yard line seats.

806
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,700
That's kind of actually cool that Boston
like doesn't let those guys die out.

807
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:18,751
A lot of places.

808
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,900
Let those guys die out and they turn
into dinosaurs and it's almost like a sad

809
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:24,420
thing where the thing is
they didn't stop writing.

810
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,820
So they just kept going and
going and going and going.

811
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:30,510
So you got the both things like Rogan
I learned he had to leave and then come

812
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:33,300
back. And then with those
legendary guys in Boston,

813
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:36,600
I learned that you got to keep writing
if they cause some kept riding,

814
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:39,750
some didn't. And the ones
that didn't, the ax suffers.

815
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:43,080
But the ones who kept
writing, um, it's that, yeah,

816
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:47,040
you stay like contemporary.
Yeah. Um, so anyways,

817
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:50,590
I'm going to babble here so I get, I got
pies to make. I have paused some egg.

818
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,150
All right. Happy new year to everybody.
Thank you Jennifer for having me, man.

Go Fuck you shoe

827
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,690
first. He's got me addicted to Florentines
podcast and now verse, he does like,

828
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,850
he does a pretty good Florentine
Florentine is the funniest motherfucker

829
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,650
Florentine complaining about anything.
Oh my God, that role buys camera robot.

830
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,240
You're fucking kidding me.
Garbage fucking Geo.

831
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,770
Like a Fox News robot. Fucking you got
that height robot the way it goes up.

832
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,000
All right. Like drags the word
out at half time. So again,

833
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,330
that's really good man.

834
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,240
He's fucking funny man. Let's get
it to that guy complained. Really,

835
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,620
really like we never seen a beautiful
woman before bud light commercials.

836
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:11,950
I can ridiculous. Um,
alright. Uh, we got here,

837
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,770
this is a okay.
Sunglasses.

838
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,180
There's some really some weird ones
this week. People like this guy says,

839
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,540
hey bill, I need, I need to uh, make my
listeners sent in like questions and shit.

840
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,040
And I read it just to let you know.
Billion.

841
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,350
I need to ask you a
very important question.

842
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,930
My wife makes fun of my
choice of sunglasses.

843
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,410
She's thinks they're not hip enough.
Um,

844
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,820
I told her I was wearing brown tinted
sunburst aviators since college,

845
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:40,060
before the whole aviator hype is there.
Aviator,

846
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,370
I don't even remember top. Yes, we say
it back then. Those people who in 1980,

847
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:48,720
right? Yeah. Who wanted to be like
Tom Cruise. You know, my neighbor,

848
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:52,860
when I was growing up, any movie that
Tom Cruise was in, he got into that,

849
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,480
like whatever. It was like a top
gun. He joined like the fucking, uh,

850
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,290
no, he, no, he joined like the, the,
the, the, the air force reserves,

851
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:06,090
the alligator on it. He joined
that and then, um, days of thunder,

852
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:09,380
he started racing cars. No cocktail.
He became like a bartender.

853
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:12,960
His Rich Dad got him out of
the fucking reserves. Yeah.

854
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:15,360
He started getting into that.
And what else did he do?

855
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:17,850
There was like three things.
So it kind of became this running joke,

856
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:20,520
like whatever,
fuck a Tom cruise movie was coming out.

857
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,090
And then eventually he moved
out to la finally. Just, well,

858
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,100
why don't we just be a fucking actor,
you know,

859
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,570
so not to actually join
the fucking air force.

860
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,380
That's a don't know what ever happened
to him. So anyway, aviator glasses,

861
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:35,310
which were, yeah, the Tom
Cruise fan slash date rapist.

862
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,420
Remember that fucking kid
I was talking about him.

863
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:40,110
Do you remember that kid who he had the
rough sex with a girl on them in central

864
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:44,480
park and she died? No, you're too
young for that. Yeah. This guy. Yeah.

865
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,520
Fucking psycho. No, he killed
her. He tried to, he tried to,

866
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,250
he tried to say that they,
that she wanted rough sex,

867
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:55,190
it was consensual and I don't know
what it is. He accidentally killed her,

868
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,610
whatever. I mean the whole of the
meetings who are killing it. Yes. Price

869
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,620
kill it.
Crushed it.

870
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,990
Fucking crushed it. Um, so

871
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,630
anyways, do, that's fucking
brutal. So anyway, put this guy,

872
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:16,830
you know what actually made me mad when
he got out of prison? Not only that, that,

873
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,160
that he got out of on two loves
and maybe mad, first of all,

874
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,480
the guy got out of prison,
but uh,

875
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:26,310
the idiots on the news going off on the
guy was saying, because when he got out,

876
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:29,960
he wasn't on parole because he did all
his time because he didn't get time off

877
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:33,680
for good behavior because they were just
like, you know, he had fights in prison,

878
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,150
he was selling drugs and blah, blah,
blah. It's like, yeah, the, all the,

879
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:40,550
all that that says in there
is he didn't get raped.

880
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,670
He did what he had to
do in there to survive.

881
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:47,080
So on some level yet you have
to respect that because that's,

882
00:50:47,081 --> 00:50:50,930
that's the big fear is a guy. Did he
raped a girl or it was just rough sex?

883
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,250
I don't know what he did. I don't know.
What has such a big difference though?

884
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,970
Well, I don't know if he
went like Ron our tests,

885
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:58,580
like it was going good and he was
excited and then he fucking elbow.

886
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,140
Why are we joking about this?

887
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:05,390
Fucking started pounding his chest and
then they didn't show the replay because

888
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:07,310
it was a home game.
Um,

889
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,570
no, he, he fucking a, I dunno how long did
it, do they let them out of jail? Yeah,

890
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:19,040
he did like all 15 or 16 years because
they couldn't get him on murder because

891
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:23,720
he said it was like, I know like
on, on rape trials like that, what

892
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,380
they always do,
like the,

893
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:30,650
the hardest thing to get them on
is when they say it was consensual,

894
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,690
so then all DNA is out the fucking
window. Then you have to like, it's,

895
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:37,250
it's, it's, it's the
worst fucking thing. If,

896
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,520
if somebody does that to a woman that
they should be. Honestly they should.

897
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:41,354
They should just,

898
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,140
they should have like a flame thrower
and they should just have it pointed at

899
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:46,370
the defendant and Jerry,

900
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:50,780
would you like to read on
the count of a rape leave?

901
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:54,470
Find him guilty in the first degree it
says just light them on fire right in

902
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:57,470
front of the family. Yeah, right in front
of it. Right in front of the family.

903
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,190
That's how I would run it. Just same,
same thing with a child molester star.

904
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,350
That's the word I'm lessons.
That's it. Sean molested.

905
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:08,050
I would actually have them get chased
by rabid dogs first and then to descend.

906
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,560
He got fucking,

907
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,710
the Sandusky guy should get fucking
drawn and quartered in the courtroom.

908
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,760
I always put his fucking
body parts in her.

909
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,870
He should be underneath an oil tanker
and then they should drive it to fucking

910
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:22,070
or is that all you've got to drive
a boat, drive it to like, fuck man,

911
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,470
that's walking this earth these.
If that's what I would do with that guy,

912
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,790
what I would do with that guy.
Well,

913
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:29,510
I would go into shark infested waters and
I would give him a bunch of paper cuts

914
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:30,490
and at time to the front of,

915
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,170
Oh my God, I never heard of
that one. That's, that's a
good one, man. Well, Paul,

916
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,600
you've got understand, wait, when you
do something like that to somebody,

917
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:42,780
you didn't just,
you,

918
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:47,210
you ended that kid's life and then you
affect the generations of people because

919
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:50,240
who they're going to marry, how they're
going to treat the person they married,

920
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,150
how they're going to treat their kids,
and then the treatment of the kids,

921
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:57,140
how they're going to act in society,
society. It just, it creates,

922
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:01,640
it's like that little Confucius thing
when you drop the pebble in the still pond

923
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:05,060
and the ripples just go like that. He got
a little poetic on you. It's like that.

924
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:08,270
No, see, that's what I say. Time
to the front of a boat. Paper cuts,

925
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:11,030
shark infested waters.
And that's it.

926
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,400
And you know what's fun and this
is the thing about it. That's fine.

927
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:16,940
That'd be awesome. Um, and
it's still wants stop him.

928
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,600
It's the one stop it from happening, but
you should just start weeding them out.

929
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,170
Like that's a sickness man from young.
That's fucking crazy, man. Yeah.

930
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,840
That's just uh, uh, and it ruins the lives
of everybody but put the kid forever.

931
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,470
Yeah. So why you saying
what I just said Paul. Oh,

932
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,970
did you set it up so you won't even
listen to the typical comedian you're

933
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,690
thinking about what you were going to say?
Literally exactly what I just said. No,

934
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:41,750
I was thinking about the singing.

935
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,030
I was thinking about him actually like
hitting the thing like a boat. Oh,

936
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:47,960
that's right. You got, you got that. You
got that weird fucking shit where you,

937
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:51,250
you every once in a while you think
about doing crazy stuff, right?

938
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,760
I was getting nervous about
admitting this type of stuff.

939
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:56,630
Like someday if you're like
on trial, like, you know,

940
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,490
I'm going to get put in contempt of court
because that's still never rat you out.

941
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:00,840
But it'd be like,
we were talking about,

942
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:04,110
you guys talked about this on the
podcast, but it killed me. It was a joke.

943
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,350
Oh, we didn't ask the fucking guys
question here. We were talking about avs.

944
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:11,641
He said,

945
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:15,930
what's the breakdown of Douchey sunglasses
verse acceptable versus acceptable

946
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:18,450
ones?
What kind of sunglasses do you wear?

947
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,400
And does Nia have any say in the matter?
I imagine you were very nonthreatening,

948
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:24,970
low profile shades.

949
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:29,880
I can't tell if that's an insult or if
he's calm. Sounds like an insult, right?

950
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,120
Um, no, I don't think it's an insult.

951
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:36,750
I think this guys genuinely wants to
know what you could wear to make his girl

952
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:40,320
stop trashing them. Well, this is
what you have to do. First of all,

953
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:42,210
depending on where you are
and your relationship is,

954
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:44,460
is if you feel secure
in your relationship,

955
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,760
maybe she's just doing you a solid and
telling you that you look like a Douche.

956
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,210
But if she's always telling
you everything what to do,

957
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,360
that you have to continue wearing those
glasses and you have to wear them over

958
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:56,710
to her mother's house. Defiance, yes. And,

959
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:59,700
and wear them into the house and don't
take them off when a mom's talking to you.

960
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,750
That's like a buddy, a buddy of mine.
Right. Do Women know? Women just,

961
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:07,240
I just want me to say something
real quick. Oh God. More
women trashing her slip.

962
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,480
You're going to be nice to them.
Like,

963
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,500
could you like a guy's really thinking
about it and this happens all the time.

964
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:14,110
This guy's got a genuine concern here.
But like for like,

965
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:15,240
I've heard of guys going,
yeah,

966
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,520
my girl just looked over at me and
looked at that shirt and goes, oh,

967
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,300
it's such a turn off. Take
it off and I want to be, it's
in my mind, I'm just like,

968
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,760
I want to be like, dude, shut up.
Are you at? Yeah. But those guys,

969
00:55:23,761 --> 00:55:27,060
those guys deserve it. They
fucking deserve it. Paul, if you,

970
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:30,060
if you let the woman in your
life talk to you like that,

971
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,850
they fucking deserve it the same
way a woman deserves it. If,

972
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:37,590
if that guy is a fucking as a minus,
then beating the shit out of you.

973
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:39,930
But I got it. Yeah. Mine isn't
beating the shit out of you,

974
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,810
but like if they beat you up and
that's just complete bullshit, quit.

975
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:45,180
If they're walking around being a
fucking asshole, disrespecting you,

976
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:47,610
that that's on you. Okay.
You guys break up with them.

977
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,810
But what if the guy says to him, you shut
up and I'm wearing the shirt. Shut up.

978
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,620
Yeah. Is he a dick now? Right. But
then it's like, oh, I'm like, I don't,

979
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,160
that's a total turnoff that discussed.
We take that off. Just flip it around.

980
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:02,610
What if you ever said that to
you girl? Exactly. Disgusting.
It makes you look fat.

981
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:06,360
You come on, you'd never do that.
Even if you said that disgusts me,

982
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:07,620
that would be it.
Listen,

983
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:11,490
here's my aunt threw the fucking
dessert that night at the meal. Well,

984
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:14,190
here's my answer to your, to your,
uh, your listener's question here.

985
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,190
If you like 'em dude, and you look in the
mirror and you go, you know something,

986
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:19,950
I liked it. I liked the glare. I
like, if it's orange tint or whatever,

987
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:22,340
you'd like it fucking where Paul,
you know some,

988
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,010
that's why you and your was so comfortable
to hang around because how many times

989
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:28,410
you guys tell each other go, fuck you.
See you say go fuck yourself. Right.

990
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,640
You do that right now we'll just be like,
ah, you know, something shut like, yeah,

991
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:35,880
shut up. Not Enough. But Lloyd in a loving
way, like, uh, yeah, but you have to,

992
00:56:35,881 --> 00:56:37,890
you have to keep them.
You got to keep off the same way.

993
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,350
She has to keep you off or you know,
she didn't keep you in check.

994
00:56:40,351 --> 00:56:44,550
You'd golf fucking nine times a week,
right? Yeah, no, no, absolutely.

995
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,570
There's a fine line. And what's
like, you know, yes, exactly. Dude.

996
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,050
I had a buddy of mine,
he fucking,

997
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,490
we went fishing right when we
were done fishing. Uh, you know,

998
00:56:53,491 --> 00:56:55,260
we drank a bunch of booze or whatever.

999
00:56:55,261 --> 00:56:57,600
We were smoking cigars and his
wife pulls up and you know,

1000
00:56:57,601 --> 00:56:59,940
they told their kid about the
dangers of smoking, right?

1001
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:03,510
So the kid starts fucking crying and blah.
There's all this big fucking thing.

1002
00:57:03,511 --> 00:57:03,931
And the kid,

1003
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:07,560
the guy was literally in the dog house
and I guess maybe because the kid was

1004
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:11,370
crying, I kind of saw her point, but
he's one of those fucking guys. I,

1005
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,930
I wanted to save him. Like, dude,

1006
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:16,710
you know what really helped
your relationship next time
you drop your kid off in

1007
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:21,550
the car, take out a big fat fucking
Cuban and just light it up. Yeah.

1008
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,441
And again,
what are you doing?

1009
00:57:22,441 --> 00:57:26,160
I'm smoking a cigar because I enjoy it
when I come home I'm going to watch a

1010
00:57:26,161 --> 00:57:28,620
game and I'm smoking this fucking cigar.

1011
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,290
And when she says why you say,

1012
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:35,340
because you can go fuck yourself and
that and I'm telling you it's a little

1013
00:57:35,341 --> 00:57:37,250
blunt. You can, you can
round off the edges.

1014
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,210
I want to say you could go fuck yourself.

1015
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,110
I'm just saying that would help you
a relationship. It's like that movie.

1016
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:46,530
Remember that movie there with the
Kevin Spacey when she comes home?

1017
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:51,090
What does that in the driveway? He's
like, that is a 1969 Firebird and he just,

1018
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,370
I went out, bought it cause I
wanted it go fuck you. Like,

1019
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,800
and you saw the look on her face.

1020
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:58,860
There was a shift for the
better in that relationship.

1021
00:57:58,861 --> 00:58:02,750
But doesn't he die in the
end? I he get killed. I don't
know. It was that was that,

1022
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,300
that was a weird one. He wanted to
fuck that 12 year old. Fuck that movie.

1023
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,310
Sitting with rose petals falling all over
him. Um, so we're saying, you know what,

1024
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:14,370
you, whether you were the God damn
sunglasses you want to surface, right.

1025
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,060
Rather was

1026
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,980
done with it.

1027
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:37,320
Rather
rather

1028
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,450
the and a dog base man,
rather

1029
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,010
wake

1030
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:19,740
up,
shower.

1031
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,393
No.

1032
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,800
[inaudible].
