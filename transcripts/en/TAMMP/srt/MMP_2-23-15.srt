1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,950
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,040
January 23rd I'm sorry,

3
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:13,250
February 23rd February 23rd,
2000 and uh,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,010
we'll go 15 [inaudible] I know
what you're thinking. Jesus belt.

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:19,480
What happened to your voice when
we would have from my voice,

6
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:23,500
it's fucking February.
That's what happened to my
voice. Okay. It's winter out.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,360
I was just in Southeast Asia.
Blatant breathing and fucking pollution.

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,560
And then I was in fucking New York City,
you know, hanging out with that animal.

9
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,880
Paul Versey. Yeah. Jesus Christ
from drinking throat coat tea.

10
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,714
I don't know what happened.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,960
I was kind of fighting off a cold all
of the whole time I was in New York,

12
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:45,240
but there was just so many people that
I wanted to see and all of them are

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,080
turned out to be raging alcoholics.
So, you know, what are you going to,

14
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:54,220
I've actually been doing really well.
Okay. I haven't drank in like a week.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,170
Oh Man. Well me and this other guy
I'm on the other guy's name will,

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,590
will remain nameless.
I cause I'm all stolen.

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,540
I don't name names. Okay.
I'm not taking notes,

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not going to write a book someday.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,380
Some tell all book about every cunt that
I went out and smoked a fucking cigar

20
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:17,650
with and drank booze with and all
the shit that they said to me.

21
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,360
It's a great thing about alcohol.
You can't really remember it anyways,

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,180
somewhere in my brain they used to
be a tell all book and it's gone.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,950
And I think that's a good thing.

24
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:31,951
I think it strengthens
relationship friendships when
you fucking drink it away.

25
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:38,080
Anyways, I was staying at a
hotel and a, for whatever reason,

26
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:42,120
the bartender just decided that he had
to do something and take inventory or

27
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:47,070
some shit. So the bar was open all
night and uh, it was hilarious. We was,

28
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,650
we were staying at the
hotel, right. And um,

29
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,840
I don't,
I didn't really remember what happened.

30
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,140
It was just basically it was one of
those things where the place was full and

31
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,220
then it was half full.

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,050
And then it was like me in this
other comic just sitting there now,

33
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:08,630
it wasn't very easy and it wasn't any
of the Rosebowl legends all right.

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,960
With somebody else.
And we would just sit in there and uh,

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,153
you know,

36
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,260
okay.

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,330
And of course, you know the tail
once it gets to around four,

38
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:21,680
five o'clock in the morning, right?
You get a text from your lady, right?

39
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,130
Then the text becomes a phone call and
then she comes down there in her bathrobe

40
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:31,640
with the fucking rolling pin and drags
you up. Nia said when she came downstairs,

41
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:36,320
I had his full scotch, not a full
God, probably like half full scotch.

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
And I,
it was tilted so far in my hand.

43
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:44,540
It was almost pouring out of the
glass, but it wasn't. And um,

44
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,160
and then the next day I had to get up
early and I had to fly back to finally be

45
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:54,020
back out, you know, out here at
my house. And, uh, Jesus Christ,

46
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,700
I gotta tell you, man, that's the
closest I've come to. Just, you know,

47
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:02,830
like you drank so much and
someone just goes, okay,

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,360
you want to get breakfast? And you just
got to tell him to stop talking. Like,

49
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:10,020
just please don't bring up breakfast
or I'm going to Puke. No, no.

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,990
People will be like, what? It
get the fuck he talking about,

51
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:16,880
but the look on my face and
the dead serious tone, she
just knew. So she was like,

52
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,990
alright. And I forget what the
fuck I had. I don't even remember,

53
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:24,410
but I was just like, you know
what? The whole freckles here, oh,

54
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:27,680
Billy bread face needs to fucking
shut it down for a while. So, uh,

55
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,360
you know,
whatever.

56
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,550
I'm like fucking eight days into it and
I have no desire to drink again for a

57
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:35,730
while.
I think I'm just going to fucking,

58
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,300
I think I might have a couple of pops
towards the end of the month and then I'm

59
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,310
going,
I'm going to go clean and,

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,320
and fucking a march going to go in
like a lamb and out like a lamp,

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,300
going to go a whole 31 days,
no booze, no cigar, right?

62
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:55,290
No cigars. Just going to be
me and my fucking thoughts.

63
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,340
How long has that month going
to fucking drag? You know,

64
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,950
I got to finish up some shit anyway,

65
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,860
so I might as well do that
every once in a while.

66
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:09,030
You've got to give you a liver a
fucking break, right when that work.

67
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,680
Well anyways, I'm recording
this Sunday night. I apologize
for how lady got up. Uh,

68
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,020
last week. I actually recorded
at Monday morning and um,

69
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,250
I just have really bad internet where
I'm at. I don't know why. And uh,

70
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,100
you know why? Because it's technology
and nothing works out for me.

71
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:24,940
So what I do now is I just fucking,

72
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,123
yeah,

73
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,180
I'm just going to start recording.

74
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,750
I'm going to upload them to my computer
and then I'm just gonna drive to a local

75
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,810
fucking Wifi.
I'm writing a script,

76
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:37,180
Coffee House and I'll
just upload them there.

77
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:40,990
So you cons can stop fucking bitching
about it and everything will be fine.

78
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,680
But I know you guys like to bitch so
it's kind of good when they're up late,

79
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,060
you know,
it'd be even better.

80
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:51,450
What if I did two podcasts a week and
both of them were kind of late then you

81
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:55,200
could pitch twice. Maybe you could
feel twice a good about your life.

82
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,320
Would you like to add? Would
you like to, what would you do?

83
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:03,060
Like if I did another cause I'm thinking
about doing it. In fact, you know what,

84
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,830
maybe just maybe next week there might
be a big announcement about a possible

85
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,670
second podcast that I'm going to be doing.
What should be a culmination of, uh,

86
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,510
so maybe some classic clips from the old
ones and then me also just going off on

87
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:25,500
topics that you guys pick, you know,
rent a rant or something like that.

88
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:26,670
I don't know what the
fuck I'm going to call it.

89
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't even know what I'm going
to call the podcast, you know,

90
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,600
I don't know what the epilogue,

91
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,550
I have no idea what the
fuck I'm going to call it.

92
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:38,490
But I'm thinking of doing a random
Thursday every once in a while.

93
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,820
Maybe a couple of Thursdays
that was maybe slowly,

94
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,870
I'll just do this like a fulltime
fucking podcast, five days a week,

95
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:47,700
like a real radio show.
I'll quit doing,

96
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:51,210
stand up and I'll just stay in a little
tree house talking to myself five days

97
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:55,770
of fucking week and you guys can
slowly listen to me slip it. Uh, no,

98
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:58,820
you can listen to me slowly slipped
into madness, not slowly listened to me.

99
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,820
Slip into madness. Listen to
me, slowly slipping America,

100
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,880
there's something fucking
wrong with my brain. You know,

101
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,170
the more I do this podcast,

102
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,620
the more I understand the grades I got
in high school and weren't necessarily my

103
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:14,390
fault. You know, I just think it's
the way the thin apps with fire.

104
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,381
So anyways,
it's,

105
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,970
it's fucking five 40 to 5:42 PM.

106
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,410
Uh, I got a big day tomorrow I'm
doing the Goddamn comedy jam again,

107
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:28,520
Josh, Adam Meyers. And
uh, as you guys know,

108
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,040
I always go down there
and whatever drummer,

109
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,560
do a little bit stand up and then
you jam with the band. And I always,

110
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:37,750
whatever drummer I'm imitating, I always
dress up like him cause uh, you know,

111
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,490
I want to keep it, it's gotta be a
go for fuck going to do it. You know,

112
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,930
I couldn't just sit down bill burr behind
a fucking, I'd look like a jerk off.

113
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:46,190
But if I dress up like an idiot,

114
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,930
then he can laugh at me
and then I can play drums.

115
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:50,270
And everybody has a good time and this,
there's no tension there.

116
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,880
There's nobody sitting in the crowd going,
wait a minute,

117
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:56,210
does he actually think that he can also
do this as a profession? Now I don't,

118
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,550
I'm just having a good time.
So anyways,

119
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,720
I'm not going to tell you that drama
I'm dressing up is because that's always

120
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:06,440
supposed to be a surprise for the
people come to the show. So anyways, um,

121
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,230
so I'm trying to on the costume tonight,
right?

122
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:14,180
And I put the wig on and I got the fucking
sunglasses, the jacket, the t shirt,

123
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,090
and I'll let shit, right. And uh,

124
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,670
I come downstairs to show Nia and as
I'm going down there, right? My fucking,

125
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,710
my dog Cleo is in the bedroom with her
and the door is closed. And I'm like,

126
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,120
what if my fucking pit bull
doesn't recognize me? What's
going to happen? Right?

127
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,930
And I fucking open the door. I'm like, Hey
Nia, my dog just goes, Whoa, whoa, Whoa,

128
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:35,990
whoa. Fucking launches
herself at the fucking door.

129
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,740
And I closed the door and I'm going,
Cleo, and I'm not taking off the wig.

130
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,170
Cause I'm thinking like she'll
smell me. Right. How does this work?

131
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,740
I'm actually doing an experiment behind
this brand new door that I just fucking

132
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,680
had put in that costs me a
fucking fortune downstairs. Right.

133
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,720
So I'm going to Cleo, it's me. Relax.
Okay, relax and I, she stops barking.

134
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:57,350
Then I opened it up again and as you
just go blah flipping the fuck out.

135
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,820
I finally had to take off the
wig and the sunglasses. But Dude,

136
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:06,821
she went to fuck this mode and
when pitbulls go to fuck this mode,

137
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,890
it's too late to take the wig off.

138
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,420
So my wife had a totally fucking calm
her down and the dog was just looking at

139
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:18,320
me like
sideways for like five minutes,

140
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,000
almost like don't do that to me.
You don't know how close she just came.

141
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,790
Do you understand that?
You don't know how fucking close you came.

142
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,540
I'm not shit,
not pit bulls.

143
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,360
I'm not shitting a pit bulls
because once you get a pit bull,

144
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,440
you actually realize how many other
dogs act exactly like fucking pit bulls.

145
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:39,290
They just don't have the capability.
You know what I mean?

146
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,250
It's like if some little twerp said,
I'm going to fucking kill you.

147
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:46,760
Do you just laugh and keep walking? That's
like one of those little chihuahuas.

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,390
But if a big guy said, I'm
going to fucking kill you,
you'd be, you'd be afraid.

149
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,690
You know, like you'd call somebody and
be like, can you beat that guy up for me?

150
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,990
That's what pimples.
Cause it's this little cunty dog.

151
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:59,210
Every five fucking hate this dog.
There's two dogs.

152
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:02,450
When I walk my dog that I fucking hate.
All right,

153
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,960
there's this one little
fucking dog he lives.

154
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,060
Okay.

155
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,960
Whatever it's allowed to live saying
he lives like he's making payments.

156
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,740
It's fucking dog lives at this House
with these people that allow him to live.

157
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,660
Although I don't know that they fucking
like the dog cause it's always outside

158
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,770
and they have one of these driveways.
It's like a little horse shoe, right?

159
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,880
So you get know entrance and an
exit could spin right around.

160
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,990
It's probably fat. People live there,
right? Fat People can't back up cars.

161
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,020
That's why I didn't know if he know that
that's why they have the backup cameras

162
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:38,440
now is because the fatties when
they would turn the neck fat,

163
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:42,370
which stopped the head and they can only
look so far and I was causing a lot of

164
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:46,360
problems. So uh, that's why they had the
backup camera. It's just right there.

165
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:50,560
They don't have to fucking turn around.
Oh, they got to do is move their eyes.

166
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,570
They're big Fred Flintstone. Waterhead
can just sit there. Right. So anyways,

167
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:57,790
he's fat. He's got this dog. And uh,

168
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,020
and what it does is when we
come walking up the block,

169
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:02,980
okay,

170
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,990
this, it's, it's on one side of the
driveway. The second is sees us,

171
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:10,370
it immediately runs to the other side.
Wait for us to come is probably like,

172
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:10,911
you know,
whatever,

173
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:15,030
like 20 feet between two and it
just fucking talks all the shadow,

174
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,930
all this fucking shit. And my dog
just looks at it and it's such bull.

175
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,960
Like my dog doesn't even give a fuck.
I actually react to the dog now.

176
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,070
Like it's been bugging me.
I'll take a little short step towards it.

177
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,120
A growl at it.
I do other shit like put my arms up.

178
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:34,220
You know like you're supposed to do
when there's a bear coming at you,

179
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,650
which I'm sure doesn't work.
Put your arms up so you look a bigger,

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,980
yeah. Well My, well my arms are up.
I don't look bigger than a bear,

181
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:45,020
so I mean I don't see what
the big fucking, if it,

182
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,230
if I was going to step on an ant and it
fucking put four of its legs in the air

183
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,000
while it's still not two of
them, I'd just be like, wow.

184
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:53,630
It's a very talented and Smush, right?
Isn't that what the bear is going to do?

185
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,343
Okay.

186
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,740
I level those people with theories.
What to do,

187
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,780
what to do if you're in the water
with a shark swim underneath it.

188
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:07,320
They don't like the vulnerable
underside of their bodies. Oh,

189
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:07,981
is that what I'm going to do?

190
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,490
I'm just casually swim underneath it
and it the thing they can swim 10 times

191
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:14,530
faster than me.
Do you know,

192
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:18,220
go to fight or you are when you just
use your mouth. Think about that.

193
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,330
That thinks not worried about taking
any sort of fucking, you know,

194
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,570
mad at you if you've just fought with
your mouth, you just fucking, you know,

195
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:28,060
kind of what if you just put your
arms out like they were fence,

196
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,210
you cut them down by your waist and you
just turn your hands out like they would

197
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,600
fit. How many bar fights do
you think it went? All right.

198
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,660
What was the last time you saw
a bear loose in a bar fight?

199
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,960
What if a shark could go in a bar?

200
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,270
You think it would have a loose
to say could breathe, right? Yeah,

201
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:45,970
but some sort of reverse auction can mass.
It was like full of water.

202
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,580
You know when you sit at
the end of the Bar, right?

203
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,670
And you're fucking lady just can't stop
looking at the shark down there. Right?

204
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:53,620
And then you're like,
you fucking looking at this all night.

205
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,370
Will you make me a fucking jerk off?
And then you went down there,

206
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:59,860
you know how many punches do you
think you'd get in? He fucking eat it.

207
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:04,000
He your damn man. Alright,
so fuck your whole, you know,

208
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:08,440
put your arms up to make yourself look
bigger, curl up in a ball, play dead.

209
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,150
You know, you've only
got one option. Okay?

210
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,430
Hope you're near other humans and run
near them and hope they don't see what's

211
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:22,360
chasing you and maybe they get eaten.
That's the move.

212
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,400
That's the fucking move.
You never go in the woods by yourself.

213
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:28,690
All right?

214
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,500
You always want to go into the woods with
somebody that can't run as fast as you,

215
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:37,180
and it looks a lot tastier, okay? That's
called the buddy system. All right?

216
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,090
And I don't do a lot of scuba diving
is everybody knows I'm terrified of the

217
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,330
ocean. But I would think that that
would be the same case when you,

218
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,280
like if I was scuba diving,

219
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,450
I'm trying to think which one
of my friends looks like a seal.

220
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,230
Uh, Joe to rose. It looks like an eel.

221
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,610
Sort of like an old eel. You know,
it's got a little bit of a punch.

222
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,400
A God. Who else? I don't know. Fucking,
I'm going to start this bullshit.

223
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,400
Whatever I picked, somebody is
going to be somebody. I know.

224
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,160
Somebody I know that
it looks like a Walrus,

225
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,300
although you know walrus can kill a polar
bear. God knows. We've all seen that.

226
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,134
Right.

227
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,740
And pull the IRIG must seen that famous
youtube video with a polar bear just

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,260
rather than picking on a little one.

229
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,700
He went for the Thanksgiving
dinner and went for that big one,

230
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,150
a big one with the giant fucking teeth.
It didn't even lay,

231
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,600
got him that bed and a polar bear justice.
It was like a fucking,

232
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,980
he got shanked and that was it
fucking thing like walked off.

233
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,070
I thought it was just like regroup and
like, all right, that wasn't worth it.

234
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,230
Maybe I'll, I'll live to fight
another day. And it didn't,

235
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:45,490
it just kind of walked away only
about 50 yards and just laid down,

236
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,600
curled up in a ball and uh,
just bled out and died.

237
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,190
I felt really bad for it too.
It's weird how, you know,

238
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,760
you fucking look at a polar bear
just attack and walruses you like,

239
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,540
it's so vicious and everything
that you fucking hate the thing.

240
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,140
But then the second you see it vulnerable,
you actually kind of feel bad for it.

241
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,510
Like you guys ever seen that Youtube
video where that that pride of lions are

242
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:11,520
attacking,
I dunno,

243
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,950
one of those bowls or whatever the fuck
it is and one of them gets kicked in the

244
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:19,930
John at breaks his jaw and his
mouth is just hanging open.

245
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:22,330
Like you have a Roger
Rabbit right before he died,

246
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:25,570
that fucking awful cancer he had.
That's what this line looks like, right?

247
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:28,930
Just sitting there and how can I,
as his mouth opened,

248
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,170
and it was trying to play it off,

249
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,900
but like all the other lines where Eaton
and this thing was and eat and it was

250
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:39,430
getting skinnier and skinnier and they're
just looking at him like, dude, just,

251
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:43,240
you know, either say it or shut
your fucking mouth. They were just,

252
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,720
and the thing just basically
starve to death and you felt bad.

253
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,560
You felt bad for this thing
that would have no problem.

254
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,980
Just eating alive actually
don't eat you alive.

255
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,460
They fucking go right for your throat.

256
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,890
The worst thing is if
you ever got fucking,

257
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,730
I'd say a Komodo dragon where they just
bite you and then just fucking follow

258
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:06,820
you around for two days and wait for
you to die because the kind of bacteria

259
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:09,040
that's in their mouth,
once it gets in your bloodstream,

260
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,910
you know you had just done two days
and they just sort of linger around.

261
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,270
You just wait,
this thing's just waiting to eat you.

262
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,630
He's sitting there talking to you mother
fucker. It's just walking behind you.

263
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:24,990
Like Jason, you know, Crystal
Lake, no matter how fast
you run that fucking thing,

264
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:28,230
it's just lumbering along by, yeah,

265
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,220
I would just pick up rocks and just,
I would stolen it to death.

266
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,220
You know like what you know.
I don't know.

267
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:37,470
Like somebody who steals
an iPod and Saudi Arabia,

268
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,820
like what they have to fucking deal with.

269
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:42,740
I would treat the lizard the same
fucking way. I would just be, all right,

270
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,490
something's eating me,
but not you and mother fucker.

271
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:46,560
You're not going to enjoy this meal.
All right.

272
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,850
I think I would be a delicacy out
there. It's pasty as I am, you know,

273
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:53,520
God knows everybody likes still
for fucking breast meat now.

274
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,430
That's why they inject those
chickens with all the steroids.

275
00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:59,570
They can't even walk because they got
such big fucking, you know, breast.

276
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,320
This is now I'm talking about. All right,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

277
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:08,040
Everybody, I do this every
single week if you're new to it.

278
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,700
And I'm doing it a little bit
early this week. Ya Know, why?

279
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:16,140
Cause my fucking lady,
she's downstairs,

280
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,540
she's watching the Oscars,

281
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,080
she's watching the pre red carpet
Oscars and every year, you know,

282
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,090
I try to hang in there, you
know, I was like, all right,

283
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,360
I know this is your Superbowl.
I'll sit and I'll watch it.

284
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:30,930
Much of this as I fucking can. And
you know, I can only get so far.

285
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,830
You know, it was really interesting
at one point was the guy, uh,

286
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,420
who's hosting Daniel Day Lewis,
whatever his name is. Greg [inaudible].

287
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,090
Okay.

288
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,520
Kirk, I don't know what the fuck his
name is. Thomas [inaudible] Thomas House.

289
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,130
Thomas Haden Church. It's one of
those three name guys. Stiggy houser.

290
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,460
The fuck's his name.
I had it.

291
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,840
I had it anyways. He was talking
to this other gay guy, right.

292
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,870
And I felt like the other gay guy was
like the old style gay guy and the new

293
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:06,450
guy. Diogenes what? I got
to look up his fucking name.

294
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:10,680
It's going to ruin this story.
It's going to ruin this fucking story.

295
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,820
I love when they asked the guys,
what are you wearing? You know,

296
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,070
we're all wearing Tuxedos.
Does it fucking matter?

297
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,470
Okay.

298
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,960
You know, what are you wearing a, it's Tom
Ford. Oh my God. I knew it was Tom Hardy.

299
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,600
Tom Ford. Yeah. Actually it's missed
a Tux. Alright, you're dumb. Fuck.

300
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,493
Uh,

301
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,050
I like how Ryan Seacrest has
his own line of fucking clothes.

302
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:37,940
It's hilarious to me.
Doogie Howser.

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,680
What is his fucking name?
Doogie Howser. Alright,

304
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,270
MD. Wikipedia. Here we go. Okay. Neil.

305
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:51,470
Patrick Harris. I knew that. So anyways,

306
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,040
he's talking to this other gay dude,
right? And I felt like the other gay dude,

307
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,890
let me ask gay guys,
any gay guys will listen to this.

308
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:02,270
Is there a such thing as hacky gay or a
zero kind of gay that fucking annoys you

309
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:04,160
on television, this gotta
be, you know what I mean?

310
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:07,070
There's a kind of redhead that bugs me,
you know what I mean?

311
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:10,580
That aw shucks guy tagging along
with the fucking funds. A rally guy.

312
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,210
At what point was Richie Cunningham
going to be like, hey, you know, Fonzie,

313
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,440
you kind of a cunt, you know you're
bang and everything that, well,

314
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:22,370
you're not that tough. I'm fucking
taller than you. They might kick my ass,

315
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:26,870
but I'll get one in. I wanted to do
all fucking five, 10 seasons of that.

316
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,170
He never did it. So the
other, the pudgy gay guy,

317
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,810
like he was going, he was like, that
really affected gay, like gay dude.

318
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:40,070
Just go and like, uh, go over to Neil,
Patrick Harris. He was going like,

319
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,000
is there anybody in the crowd that you're
just like excited to say, you know,

320
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:47,670
like those gay guys that
say honey, right? It's like,

321
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
isn't it like hackey gay
because the Pudgy guy goes,

322
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,190
is there anybody you're excited to say?
Like for me,

323
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,950
it'd be lies them Minnelli
and I just went like, really?

324
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,780
Would it really be Liza Minnelli?

325
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,100
Okay.

326
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,330
Wasn't that like funny for a gay guy to
say like 30 fucking years ago? Come on.

327
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,280
Right. I mean, I'm talking out of
school here, but I just seemed like,

328
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:12,270
what's his face? Neil Patrick
Harris. He had like, you know,

329
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,280
yeah,

330
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,780
he was a fucking human being.
The other guy was just fucking,

331
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,110
I don't know what he was doing.
It was like he was uh, uh,

332
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:23,800
who was in that fucking movie with that
guy or hung himself. I can't remember.

333
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,810
I can't even remember
the name of the movies.

334
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,733
You know what I mean?

335
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,820
Just because you're gay doesn't mean
you're not a person. You know what I mean?

336
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,910
It's almost like when
somebody is acting regular,

337
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,070
then all of a sudden they plug become a
game show host and then they just stop

338
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:45,580
being human. They just become
game show host guy. Alright,

339
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,140
let's bet the whale.
I feel like when,

340
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,710
when gay dudes that's like
the gay version of doing that,

341
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,610
I just want to shake that fat guy
and just be like, who are you really?

342
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,740
How do you, what? What do you
really talk like? Um, anyways,

343
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,190
I'm sure summer we'll fucking take
a snippet of that and send it to a,

344
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,350
we've had enough of that.com
and next thing you know,

345
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:09,590
there'll be another story out there, but
that's what they do. And you know what,

346
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,280
you should do that. You should take
this podcast seriously, goddammit.

347
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,730
The nerve of me to be out here joking
around. Okay, this is in my park.

348
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,410
It's your podcast and you
should take it seriously.

349
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,830
It's somehow shape it into whatever
fucking cause you're trying to get an

350
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:29,510
attention to. Um, anyway, so she's down
there watching these, these fucking,

351
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,300
okay.

352
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,170
I don't know what the hell are you?

353
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:34,560
I really helped somebody gay
chimes in on that because I got,

354
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:38,170
as I got a sense that I'm fucking right
on that one. You know what I mean?

355
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,210
Anyways,
going back.

356
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:47,970
So Nias downstairs and she's just totally
into it and somebody is the red carpet

357
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:51,520
and she's just gone. Oh my God. No,

358
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:56,110
I can't stand it. I can't. Sounds like
it was a bad call, but she's actually,

359
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,670
that's like how into the dresses she gets.
And I sit there and go build,

360
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:05,650
don't ruin it. Don't ruin it.
Okay. Just let her enjoy this.

361
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,470
You Watch sports,
it's just as fucking stupid.

362
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:12,820
If you really sit down and think about it,
it's just is fucking stupid.

363
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,240
It's just as stupid.
All right.

364
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,980
And I get more fucking upset about the
outcome than she does with the Oscar.

365
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,270
I think.
You know what?

366
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:24,790
I actually had to walk away from the
Oscars with at one point they were like,

367
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:29,290
you know all the best pictures, all
of them are starring men, you know,

368
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:33,550
like every fucking award show. Is
that? No. Well, what the flow. Well,

369
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,400
can't that just mean that guys
make better movies this year?

370
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,130
You can't say that, can you?
You gotta be like, no, no, no.

371
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:46,960
The witches of Eastwick that was fucking
phenomenal. Which is at Eastwick.

372
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:50,150
Really? I don't watch movies, so fuck
you. Why do, what do you want from me?

373
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,090

Bangladesh and this, you know,

376
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:04,330
what are you trying to suggest?
They don't like lemonade. No,

377
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:08,920
I wasn't thinking about it. I
was just making lemonade. Um,

378
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,600
anyways, let's, let's
get to the fucking gonna.

00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,330
okay.

557
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,780
All right.
I uh,

558
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,140
I've gotten back into reading everybody
and by reading, I mean I just,

559
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:13,730
I just liked reading autobiographies
right now I'm reading this actually the

560
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:16,760
book about Richard Pryor. That was fucking
amazing. Then I started, um, you know,

561
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,730
I got add. So I'm always reading like
two, three at a time. So reading that,

562
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,370
the ESPN book,
uh,

563
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:26,390
those guys that having too much fun and
I'm also tearing through Steven Adler,

564
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,280
my favorite drummer from the 80s.
I just, I've fucking, I dunno,

565
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,650
I absolutely love the way he played.
Um,

566
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,970
and he's got a book called a my
appetite for destruction, sex,

567
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:39,440
drugs and guns and roses.

568
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,270
And it was really cool as if you've
already read slashes book to hear him go

569
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,090
over like some of the same
stories in his version.

570
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,170
I mean they line up pretty good,
but uh, I don't know. It's pretty,

571
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,870
it's pretty fucking awesome.
He actually talks about some shit that

572
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,390
I had no idea it happened to them and uh,

573
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,790
maybe have even more empathy for that guy.
You know,

574
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:05,390
what I watched recently this week was,
um,

575
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,000
they actually,
I never knew this.

576
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,690
I was literally like two
things devastated me.

577
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,430
Like two major blows. One was more severe
because it was a death of somebody.

578
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,170
But in 1990 as far as the
music fed was the first,

579
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:24,020
obviously the top of the list
was when Stevie Ray Vaughn died.

580
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,780
I couldn't fucking blow
was the first time, um,

581
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,080
someone that I was into to that level,
uh,

582
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:38,020
died and just, it was just
so fucking shocking. Like,

583
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:42,280
I didn't even, uh, you know, it
didn't register until after, you know,

584
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:44,500
then family style came
out with Jimmy Vaughan,

585
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:49,150
so there was still new material and
I just remember thinking like, wow,

586
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:52,720
this is going to be no more Stevie Ray
Vaughan and double trouble, new material.

587
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,110
And he kind of had this,
this theme where he would always,

588
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,030
with a lot of his albums,

589
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:01,030
he would start with an instrumental
and end with an instrumental.

590
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:05,380
So I'd always be excited when
I bought his new album too. Um,

591
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,690
what did he do that or wouldn't eat?
Maybe he did it in a few, getting older,

592
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,940
starting to get a rude mood. I think it
was the first song on the second side. Oh,

593
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,700
I guess you would have one
instrumental every album or to wait.

594
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,930
He had stang swing and couldn't stay
on the weather and scuttled button.

595
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,590
He had rude mood on Texas flood.
It's say what?

596
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:31,950
Unsold his soul. He had Riviera
paradise. Oh, y'all said Lenny,

597
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,610
how can I forget that one? So
anyways, I was always thinking like,

598
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:38,890
oh man in his plane always would go to
next level. I just remember thinking like,

599
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:42,970
wow, this is never going to happen
again. So there was that and then um,

600
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,540
Steven ads or got kicked
out a guns and roses.

601
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,950
Okay.

602
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,940
I couldn't fucking believe it. It was
just, he was, he was the guy for me.

603
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:57,200
Like I was all about all these
other guys from the 80s that I saw,

604
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,290
you know, and they all had the
double bass drum set up and all that.

605
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:05,291
And I just remember when I saw guns and
roses live at the Ritz on MTV and I saw

606
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:11,180
all the music that Steven Adler was
getting out of that little four piece drum

607
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:16,181
kit and it was so fucking cool to just
go see somebody go back to having the one

608
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:21,140
rack Tom with just the one ride symbol
and this is how dumb I am when it really

609
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:24,660
comes to spatial relations and shit.
Like I'm really fucked in the head like I,

610
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,960
so I don't have a good mechanical mind.

611
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,580
Even like when they say if there's
cooking directions, like, you know,

612
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,790
turn it on the front burner.
When I look at the stove,

613
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,700
the front burner is not
the burner closest to me.

614
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:39,110
It's the one furthest away to me.

615
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,040
I always view the stove like I'm
standing behind the car and that's,

616
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,110
I don't know why that doesn't
make any fucking sense,

617
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:47,690
but I'm always looking
at shit ass backwards.

618
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:52,490
So at the time I had a
five piece Slingerland late
seventies all bond of size is

619
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:54,800
24 like 14 by 24 bass drum.

620
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,890
I think I had a 1214 and a 16

621
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,830
two racks and a floor.

622
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:06,010
And I had my ride a pie
over the second rack,

623
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:09,200
Tom and I was telling a guy
at work, he's like, yeah man,

624
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:10,820
I really don't play a fourth.
This is how dumb I was.

625
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,090
I really want to play a four piece, but
you know, I got a five piece kit, man,

626
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,640
maybe next kid I'll buy it would
be a four piece. And he goes, well,

627
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:20,120
why don't you just take that other time
off and then it becomes a four piece.

628
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:25,100
And I was like, Oh yeah, do you know bad?

629
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:27,530
I want that story not to be true.
But it is true.

630
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,890
So I took that fucking rack Tom off and
it changed my world as far as drum and

631
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:35,930
how much fun was it?
I've never gone back.

632
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,130
I absolutely love that setup because the
way it makes you go around the kid is

633
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:44,630
totally different because once people
started having the two rack toms,

634
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,150
it became start your fill on the snare,

635
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:52,190
go up to the first rack Tom and then
just blow down every fucking Tom you had.

636
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,530
And every fill kind of
started to sound the same.

637
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,270
But when you had the fucking sorta the
l shape thing going there one up and one

638
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:01,790
to the one straight up,
but one over to the right,

639
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,860
it made you go around the kit differently.

640
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,770
I mean nowadays I don't even think kids
can relate to that shit because there's

641
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:11,600
so much information on Youtube and kids
compete with each other that the, the,

642
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,380
the growth of the average
drummers through the fucking roof,

643
00:38:15,381 --> 00:38:17,600
like in the last five years,

644
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:21,650
how good people have gotten into playing
the drums compared to five years when I

645
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:24,480
was a kid, it's not even close. Um,

646
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:25,760
okay.

647
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,280
And now, you know, they had the bass
drums in with the fills and all that.

648
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:32,390
Did that just fucking there there are
unbelievable, you know, but whatever. So

649
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,090
that was my thing,

650
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,470
know I started off playing with to ACDC
records and then rolling stone source,

651
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:41,840
Phil Rudd, Charlie Watts,
really simple two for shit.

652
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,490
And then I'm moving up to
two appetite for destruction,

653
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,570
which was all, you know, rock and
roll type of shit. But you know,

654
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:54,920
Bass Drum was more busier and uh,
he had,

655
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,750
he has a signature licks
and that type of thing.

656
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:01,040
But the degree of difficulty as far as
just technically was harder for me and I

657
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,190
used to play the hand,
got stripped it down to the four piece.

658
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:07,340
I ice to play that fucking album
every day after work, man, I would,

659
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,520
I would unload trucks all day in
this warehouse, laugh my balls off.

660
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,680
One of the great jobs, I have a
hat, you know, and then I would,

661
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:19,730
uh,
I would fucking go home,

662
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,670
lift weights.
This is my day lift weights.

663
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:25,880
I go on a bike ride and then I fucking a,

664
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:28,910
then I would sit down and play drums at.
That was it.

665
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,680
I would just fucking play from the
first song all the way to the end of the

666
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:38,150
album. And my older brother used to
drive him fucking nuts because I sucked.

667
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,561
But Steve,

668
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:44,561
what was funny was Steven's drum parts
was so unique to each song that in his

669
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,720
head he knew all of the tracks.
He knew what,

670
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:52,550
what's if he came home in the middle
of the album, he'd be like, ah, fuck.

671
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:56,240
He's only on Mr. Brown stone.
He's only on the f. He's only,

672
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,220
he's only halfway through the first
side of the, the fucking tape. You know,

673
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:05,180
it was funny is I had the tape and a
boombox. I didn't even have headphones.

674
00:40:05,181 --> 00:40:07,490
I should've just got headphones that I
did and I could have heard it so much

675
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:10,340
better. I would have that
thing fucking cranked up.

676
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,660
And I have my head turned to the side
with this little shitty plastic fucking

677
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,590
poor excuse for a boombox. And
I used to play that thing, uh,

678
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:24,440
all the fucking time. And I
remember just in, you had no idea,

679
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,720
just had to figure shit out for yourself.
There was no youtube.

680
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:31,530
He just listened to it and I was convinced
anytime any drama was playing on the

681
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:34,470
snare drum,
it was never just singles with accents.

682
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:38,850
I always see was convinced it was some
sort of rudiment he's got to be playing a

683
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:41,760
rudiment. It sounds too cool. And um,

684
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,060
well I guess a single stroke roll is a
root of it, but you know what I mean?

685
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:46,470
I thought it was some
sort of special sticking.

686
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:50,550
So I remember it's so easy
in the beginning where he's
got those fast 16th notes

687
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:53,580
on the snare drum with the what?
The crash accents.

688
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,550
I thought he was playing paradiddles
so I would be trying to crash and play

689
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,900
paradiddles. It was, oh my God,

690
00:40:57,901 --> 00:41:01,180
it was a shit show until fucking
somebody at this other warehouse,

691
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,060
this burnout musician.

692
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,800
He showed me that it was singles and
a, I dunno, that was just a great,

693
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,620
it was a great time of
my life as far as like,

694
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,923
mmm,

695
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,550
I was fucking up bad.

696
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,380
But like it was going to be a while
before the chickens weren't going to come

697
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:23,220
home to roost because it was still in
my early twenties I was fucking up in

698
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:26,700
college, but nobody I knew had graduated
college. So even though I was behind,

699
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:31,270
you know, none of them had jobs yet.
I hadn't started doing stand up.

700
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,460
I was working out like a fucking
is the best shape I was ever in.

701
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:39,200
I lifted weights every fucking day and
rode a bike like 11 miles every day.

702
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:44,210
In other weekends I have one dad right
at 18 miles and I was like 20 years old

703
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,970
and I had like zero body
fat. I was just like, yeah.

704
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,420
And I would go out and booze like
fucking four nights of the week,

705
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,060
eat McDonald's at the end of the
night. Just metabolism was, it was,

706
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:57,440
it was the best. And I went to work
and my job was unloading trucks.

707
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,510
That's all it was.

708
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,580
And then stock on the shelves and
everybody I worked with was a fucking,

709
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:06,860
either it was a warehouse,
they were the class clowns,

710
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:11,810
struggling musicians or some sort
of just, I dunno, drug addict,

711
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:15,290
free spirit. It was just the best fucking
group of people I ever worked with.

712
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:20,230
And um, anyways, I remember, um,

713
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,443
okay.

714
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,250
Somewhere. Yeah, he, I always
heard they played farm aid.

715
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,290
I remember hearing a story like it went
nationwide I think as MTV was running.

716
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,153
That's right.

717
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,570
Was Axel said that someone in this band
is fucking with Mr. Brown stone when

718
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:36,980
they opened up for uh,

719
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,780
the rolling stones and I was
like, Oh wow, that's cool.

720
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,010
They live in just like that song.

721
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:46,910
I didn't know that that was a bad
sign for the band. And then, um,

722
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,290
I dunno if they played far made or
whatever and I just heard that, you know,

723
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,380
I heard that he got fired and
I couldn't fucking believe it.

724
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:01,590
And I never thought the band was the same.
Once he left and his,

725
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:05,070
he left and then they got,
they got all those other guys,

726
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:09,930
they added a fucking keyboard thing. And
it just, the whole thing, just like, yeah,

727
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,700
you know what happens. So, um, anyways,

728
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,790
this is a long drawn out story,
but I didn't realize that,

729
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,550
that uh,

730
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,640
there's video of Steven Antholis last
performance with guns and roses and a

731
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:32,150
slash tells a story that Steven was high
and they went out to go perform any,

732
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,820
went to jump on the,
the drum riser,

733
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,140
but his depth perception was off
because of whatever he was on.

734
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,630
And he missed it by like eight feet.
And he does,

735
00:43:42,631 --> 00:43:45,250
he comes out and he fucking just eats it,
does a face plant.

736
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:48,840
Then he gets behind the drums and
evidently he didn't really know what songs

737
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:53,580
they were going to be doing, got to
know that was his fault or whatever.

738
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,730
So they did civil war. Then you see
the look on his face in the video,

739
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:02,580
like what the fuck we do? I haven't,
I've rehearsed this with a bear,

740
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:06,150
but never with axel dude out to zip me.
He fucking kills it.

741
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,570
I mean, they're all a little bit
sloppy, but I thought he did fine.

742
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,730
And then they pulled out some punk tune

743
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,450
and duff had to count it off for,
but even then,

744
00:44:16,451 --> 00:44:21,451
he still fucking did a great job and it
made me Madec all over again that they

745
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:24,280
fired a, but like I'm getting
through his book and I think, uh,

746
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,940
obviously they wouldn't have got rid of
them if he wasn't completely fucking up.

747
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:28,774
But,
um,

748
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,900
it's weird to read this book because
know how it ends as far as this trip with

749
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:37,230
guns and roses,
but I'm still fucking rooting for the guy.

750
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:40,650
Like that's how big a fan I am of his.
So all right,

751
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:44,050
there's your drum nerd part of the
fucking podcast for this week. So anyways,

752
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:48,930
so I'm reading that Shit
and um, oh, here's what for,

753
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,540
I wanted to read you this shit.
All right,

754
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,810
let me type this in here. People always
say this shit like, dude, you're type A,

755
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,500
type a right?
Like this is some negative fucking thing.

756
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,893
MMM.

757
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,230
Oh, you're tight B and all
that. Here's, here's what you,

758
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,330
next time somebody says that,

759
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:13,070
because people usually what they do when
they run out of points to make with you,

760
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,510
they say, oh, you're type
bay, you're tight bay. Right?
Rather than being like, no,

761
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:20,530
I made some good points and now you can't
refute them, so now you're going to,

762
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,200
you're going to fucking hide behind
this fucking pop psychology horse shit.

763
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,030
This is really interesting to me.
A type A and type B personality theory.

764
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,580
Yeah,
the big word there theory,

765
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:36,590
the those type A and type B personalities
are just theories and it basically

766
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:41,150
describes two contrasting personality
types that could either raise or lower

767
00:45:41,151 --> 00:45:45,740
respectively one's chances of
developing coronary heart disease.

768
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,720
There was a considerable controversy
about the role of these personality types

769
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:55,990
in coronary heart disease and the role
of the tobacco industry funding of early

770
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:57,770
research in this area.

771
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Early research turns out they funded
this study for 40 years and basically the

772
00:46:03,651 --> 00:46:08,651
theory about the tobacco industry is what
they were trying to do is cover up the

773
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:13,871
fact that cigarettes smoking caused
heart disease and they tried to blame it

774
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:19,451
more on if you were this type bay guy who
gets impatient with people that's goal

775
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:24,340
driven, that loses his temper and all
that. Like you, you had a bigger chain.

776
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:29,410
Like that was more of a cause of the heart
disease than smoking then that if you

777
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:33,830
were actually like more chilled and
relaxed, like a type B personality,

778
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,290
you wouldn't get heart disease.
So

779
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,940
as far as my ignorant way of reading this,

780
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,530
like these personalities are just like,

781
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,050
okay

782
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,150
cause I feel like everything
that they bring up by him,

783
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:52,970
like Taipei describes individuals
as rigidly organized. I'm not,

784
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,050
my office is a shit show and I don't
write anything down and I never look at

785
00:46:57,051 --> 00:47:01,310
emails. Highly status conscious. Yeah.

786
00:47:01,311 --> 00:47:03,980
I mean I drive a Prius and
I dress like Malcolm Young.

787
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,990
I don't give a fuck a
sensitive yes. Impatient. Yes.

788
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,800
Take on more than they can handle
it. I got like 20 Ha uh, hobbies,

789
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:18,220
maybe one other people to get to the point
who doesn't anxious that as much as I

790
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:24,140
used to be proactive. Depends on what
you're talking about and concerned with.

791
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:29,030
Time management. Who wants to waste
of fucking time? I'm all right. Tight.

792
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,040
Yeah.

793
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,980
By definition,
generally live at lower stress levels.

794
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:38,090
It typically work steadily
enjoying achievement,

795
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:41,180
but not becoming stressed
when they do not achieve.

796
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,300
I mean,
I've kind of come to that point,

797
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,590
um, where I'm at, you know,

798
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,350
I think they're just means being more
happy with your life. You know what,

799
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,830
I'm a comedian and I sell tickets.
I mean, what the fuck else is there?

800
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,660
Everything else after that is gravy.

801
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,070
I felt like I made it like four years
ago after like a somewhere between, um,

802
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,990
why do I do this and let it go.
Once I was selling the tickets at clubs,

803
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,460
I could go out twice a month, live my
dream it live a comfortable lifestyle,

804
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:14,320
take care of my wife.
What the fuck did I care?

805
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,630
So I dunno. But anyways,
it's good to know. There were
actually a fucking theory.

806
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:25,200
It's just a theory. You know
something, you know, poof.

807
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:30,150
We came up with this pussies
fucking jerk off.

808
00:48:30,151 --> 00:48:32,340
Stick up for yourself. Good.
Come on up with this crap.

809
00:48:32,341 --> 00:48:36,990
Here's funding by the tobacco companies
further discrediting the so called type

810
00:48:36,991 --> 00:48:38,250
a behavior pattern.

811
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,260
A study from 2012 based on searching
the legal tobacco documents library

812
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:48,470
suggests the phenomenon of initial pro
initially promising results followed by

813
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:53,110
negative findings to be partially
explained by the tobacco industry's

814
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:58,130
involvement in the type a B personality
research to undermine the scientific

815
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:02,340
evidence on smoking and
health industry is newest.

816
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,040
The industry's interest in type AB person.

817
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:10,041
I lasted at least for decades until the
late 1990s involving substantial funding

818
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:13,500
to key researchers
encourage to prove smoking,

819
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,770
to simply correlate with a personality
type prone to coronary heart disease and

820
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:24,210
cancer. So I dunno, I
find that interesting.

821
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,250
After the 50th time somebody said,
I'm type a

822
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:28,750
yeah,

823
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,560
let's just say it's not a theory. I think
I have elements of type A and type B.

824
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:38,130
I really think a type a type person
wood,

825
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,170
we'll throw it down in a bar,
which I never did.

826
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,790
I never did that.

827
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,120
I haven't had a fight since like
fucking junior high and I lost,

828
00:49:47,121 --> 00:49:50,420
I was playing stick hockey and I
lost to this fucking guy that was,

829
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:54,080
it was over and I was just like,
yeah that sucked. You know,

830
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,120
just cause you have a temper,
it doesn't mean you type a does it.

831
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,090
I don't think it does to me it type A's
like a fucking guy's guy knows how to

832
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:07,200
fix a car or break your jaw. To me
that's type A, he's like a hero.

833
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,030
I think very few people at type A
and type is the whole, you know,

834
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,990
either live in like the Zen.
I think there's,

835
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:20,290
there's two ways to live in both
if they actually exist. Okay.

836
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,550
It can be type A, this is zenway
maybe you'll live both. I don't know.

837
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,840
Cause like there's the type B person
that actually knows how to fight but re

838
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:32,660
recognizes how stupid it is.

839
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,890
It doesn't throw down unless they have
to and then they throw down and they win.

840
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,550
In the end they still think it's stupid.
That person.

841
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,850
Does that person exist or am I just
thinking about a cool guy saw in a movie?

842
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,000
Speaking of that,
do you guys see the movie the drop?

843
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,320
I saw a bunch of movies and my 70 plus
hours of airline travel over the last,

844
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:58,670
uh, month. Uh, the drop
is a great fucking movie.

845
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,140
James Gandel Finis last movie and there's
another actor in there. Of course,

846
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:06,130
I didn't get his name.
I was on the plane. Um,

847
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,120
I can't, I don't know. I don't, I gotta
I gotta get his fucking name, his son.

848
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:17,050
He'll fuck this up. I absolutely love
that guys performance of that thing.

849
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,900
Really cool movie.
Come od the drop.

850
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:24,370
2014.

851
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,330
What would be great if I actually
looked this up in the meantime,

852
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:32,230
as I'm waiting for this to come around,
I saw horrible bosses too,

853
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,540
which I thought was fucking hilarious.

854
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:39,790
Did you see anybody else
see that movie nanny body?

855
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,720
Um, today? Chris was fucking hilarious.

856
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,990
Is it Tom Hardy said, oh, it is

857
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,180
Jesus Christ. He looks so different. Every
fucking picture. Yeah. That's the guy.

858
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:57,380
Tom Hardy was the shit in the drop.

859
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:02,600
He was so fucking good in that
movie. Um, horrible bosses too.

860
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:05,390
I fucking love that. Would Kevin
Spacey's fucking Hilarious in it,

861
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,860
Charlie Day so day because all
three of those guys, just a payment,

862
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:13,780
just funny ass fucking movie. It's
laughing like an asshole on the plane.

863
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:17,420
Everybody looking at me and I didn't care
cause I had another 10 hours to go and

864
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:21,590
I was drinking the fucking
Johnny Walker black there.

865
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,240
I saw a dumb and dumber
two was disappointed.

866
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,540
It was a couple of really good scenes,
but I was disappointed.

867
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,530
I didn't think that the script
was there for those guys.

868
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:36,870
And that's obviously a fucking classic.
Uh,

869
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,470
okay.

870
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:42,760
What else did I see? I think I told you
I saw a chef a while back when I was, oh,

871
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:46,020
I was in New Zealand. I saw
chef. What a fucking great, well,

872
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:49,360
let me ask you this as,
as John Leguizamo ever been bad.

873
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:50,960
Okay.

874
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,490
That guy,
he's been in bad movies,

875
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:56,750
but he always makes the movie better
as long as he's fucking in it. So,

876
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,090
okay,

877
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,660
it's a great script. He's great. If
the movie stinks, he's still great.

878
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,480
The guy's fucking money in the bank money.

879
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:08,090
That's probably why he's been
working for like 30 fucking years.

880
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:13,220
It's unbelievable. Uh, it was that
feting that I'm talking about.

881
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:17,120
This shit on Oscar night. Everybody
as you don't watch as many movies,

882
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:20,150
I usually don't fly this much.
I usually talk this much.

883
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,120
I usually don't start sentences with
I usually every fucking two seconds.

884
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:28,110
Let me get back to what the fuck I
was talking about here. Um, oh yeah.

885
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:31,180
Hell is it? What was I gonna
talk about those Bruins. Huh?

886
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:36,340
Beaten the Black Hawks. Oh, by four
goals. How do you like that? Chicago.

887
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:40,420
What's up? Ah, Vancouver, Calgary,

888
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,130
Edmonton St Louis. That said we
lost two on this trip already.

889
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:48,400
Brutal fucking losses. I
got all of my tape. Uh,

890
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:52,300
I don't have the nerve to watch the
Calgary game. I watched the, uh,

891
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,160
the Saint Louis one. I was really
jet lag last week, so every,

892
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,560
every to Vancouver and Calgary.
But I watched the Saint Louis one,

893
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,220
we called up [inaudible].
It was probably the wrong team to do it.

894
00:54:06,221 --> 00:54:10,270
Some people said, well, who gives a fuck?
He'll be fine. Um, but I can't imagine.

895
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,900
Why don't we try and get rid
of two kinds? I mean, you know,

896
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,850
guys had a little bit of a rough
patch all of a sudden. What?

897
00:54:15,851 --> 00:54:20,410
He's not good anymore. It's his fucking
fault. We lost all these great defensemen.

898
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,580
It's been all these injuries. We lost
a fucking boy, chuck. I mean, come on,

899
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:29,140
you're gonna blame him. It's
stupid. That's like, well,
you know what that's too,

900
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:33,340
does shit like that New York does that.
Boston does it too. It's so fucking dumb.

901
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:35,843
Yeah.

902
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,030
You know,
every two fucking years,

903
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:41,670
the goddamn giant fans trying to get rid
of their coaching. Fucking Eli Manning.

904
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,090
It's like, oh, you mean those
Superbowl champions? Yeah,
I'm sure it's their fault.

905
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,460
Um, what else? I think that's it. I got
into, I'll watch the end of the day.

906
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:54,990
Total of 500. I've got to go to that one
of these years. The OT is self someday.

907
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,420
I never been to Nascar.
I've been to two Indy 500 racist.

908
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:01,470
But you owe it to yourself at some point
to go to any sort of auto racing event.

909
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,910
Because the funniest fucking thing
about it is the difference in intellect

910
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:09,750
between what's going on in the pit row
and what's going on in the fucking stance.

911
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,310
It's unbelievable. I mean,
you're talking state of the art,

912
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:16,963
like

913
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:22,120
mega brains trying to figure out how to
go half a second faster 10th of a second

914
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:26,240
faster it like 200 miles an hour.
See when by a fucking bumper.

915
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,623
Right.

916
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:31,230
And then literally you
look across the street,

917
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,860
which is the track and there's some guy
fucking just crushing old Milwaukee,

918
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:44,040
you know, would dip in his mouth. He's
so fat is t shirt can't cover as navel.

919
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,840
That's what I loved and I,
you know, I would love to
say at the Indy 500 you know,

920
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,930
open wheel racing though is a
little more snooty. It wasn't,

921
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,590
you could bring a cooler end, you
get, do whatever the fuck you wanted.

922
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,740
It was a great time.
And uh,

923
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:02,410
I've been meaning to go
to Talladega and Daytona.

924
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:05,820
I got to scratch those off the bucket
list at some point. I always forget,

925
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:10,110
it's just NASCAR starts at such a weird
time. It's a great time. It go right.

926
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:13,830
No football. This is the time of year.
I was getting into like college hoop.

927
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,590
Like I didn't realize Kentucky was
still undefeated. Saipem watching.

928
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,000
I just hate the fucking pack.
10 I like watching Kansas,

929
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:24,540
Kentucky and liked tobacco road man.

930
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:29,010
I like fucking a Carolina Duke, NC
state. I like watching that shit.

931
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:33,060
It just sucks. The big east has gone
now. Well he's back in the day, man,

932
00:56:33,061 --> 00:56:35,190
the 80s when I first started
watching fucking who?

933
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:40,580
The ACC and the fucking big east lake in
a five year period I watched like James

934
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:47,070
Worthy. Uh, Michael Jordan. Patrick Ewing.

935
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,180
Ralph Sampson.

936
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:49,930
Yeah,

937
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:53,920
Elijah one. And what's his face?
Clyde Drexler wear out and Houston.

938
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,960
Chris Mullin was Saint John's.

939
00:56:55,961 --> 00:56:58,990
Pearl Washington is Syracuse
and it was just fucking,

940
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:03,991
every week there was some sort of fucking
epic goddamn battle always would come

941
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:09,100
down to the end.
Those great coaches,

942
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:13,720
I forget the coach for St John's always
wearing the Cosby sweaters then. Yet.

943
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:18,310
John Thompson, who was as big as fuck
in you and almost always wondered like,

944
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:23,311
how fucking long is his tie that it
goes all the way down to almost as belt

945
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:25,720
buckle when that fucking guy,
he was like six foot 10.

946
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,680
It's like when a fuck do
you get your suits made?

947
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:29,703
You know,

948
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,490
just picture like the, like the
haberdashery guy. Like they like Elvis,

949
00:57:34,491 --> 00:57:36,590
like standing on ladders
trying to measure the guy.

950
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,303
MMM.

951
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,210
Yeah. And you had, what's his face?

952
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:42,680
Okay.

953
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,470
Uh, oh my God. Am I going to
forget his name? Dean Smith.

954
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,520
I told you, you guys all these
fucking stories about, go to the dean.

955
00:57:50,521 --> 00:57:52,410
Don't see Michael Jordan play.
I told you that

956
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,840
as an NBA player right
before the Charlotte,

957
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,460
whole year before the
Charlotte Hornets came,

958
00:57:59,461 --> 00:58:03,720
they tried to get NBA excitement
going on down in North Carolina.

959
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,520
So they scheduled a two NBA
scrimmages during the summertime.

960
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:09,590
Okay.

961
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,590
And before the NBA season,
probably like in September,

962
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:16,240
and I went to both games and each
NBA team had a former tar heel on it.

963
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:21,490
So it was the Chicago Bulls. Michael
Jordan, no championships, still had hair,

964
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,510
still was skinny then bulk up cause
Detroit had beat him up enough. Right.

965
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:30,770
I saw him play, uh, who was it?

966
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:35,771
I think the Cleveland Cavaliers that
had a Brad Doherty think his name was,

967
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:39,320
he's that guy with the fucking hairline
that went right down to his eyebrows.

968
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:42,980
Who'd actually now he
actually commentates for a

969
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,450
okay.

970
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:48,950
Stock car racing. And then I saw the
Lakers with James Worthy magic. Karima.

971
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:52,130
I think Kareem didn't show up though.
He used to weld at that point.

972
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:54,560
Like man ain't fucking coming down for
that shit. He might have been retired.

973
00:58:54,561 --> 00:58:59,320
It was 87 [inaudible] 87. Um, yeah,

974
00:58:59,321 --> 00:59:04,120
he didn't play 87 88 30. I don't fucking
know. And then they played the Cavaliers.

975
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,450
They had Sam Parker's. That's
right. Anyway, so let me, uh,

976
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,360
let me fucking read some of
the letters for the, Goddamn,

977
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:12,310
we camped before 40 fucking

978
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:16,330
go off the rails here. All right. Um,

979
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,200
okay.

980
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,130
Okay,
here we go.

981
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,860
Alpha brain build a half
a man. Thrill ride. Uh,

982
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:29,060
go fuck yourself. I know your
buddy buddy. With Joe Rogan then.

983
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:32,390
I'm not sure if he's already
turned you onto onto this,

984
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:36,500
but his company on it pronounced on it.
Thank you.

985
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:41,150
Oh, you know what? I think I already
knew it was on and I wouldn't have known.

986
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,790
I wouldn't have known how to say it.
Anyways,

987
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:47,030
PR produced a product called Alpha brain,

988
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:52,370
which helps with cognitive brain function.
He's been talking about it for years,

989
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:55,250
but try to a couple of
months ago and is great.

990
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:57,590
It helped me focus on a novel.

991
00:59:57,591 --> 01:00:02,591
I'm writing on nights and weekends and
nights and weekend away from my boring

992
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:08,870
day job. Weekends away from my boring day
job. It's why he should have written it.

993
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,350
A, you always talk about I forget
stuff and have trouble concentrating.

994
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,840
You should give it a shot
and report back to us.

995
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:19,820
I'm sure he gives you some free samplers.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Ah, yeah.

996
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:23,450
I don't fuck with drugs other than boots.
I just don't,

997
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:30,020
you know.
All right.

998
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:34,670
Sorry. Um, do you that tried to do
with solid thought she was downstairs?

999
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,430
Um, yeah, I'll fuck
around with miracle drugs.

1000
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,070
If I have a disease,
I'll do that. Like, look,

1001
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:48,110
being scatterbrained is working out for
me. It does. It just churns more comedy.

1002
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:53,000
I just fucked up and I embarrassed
myself. You know, it's like,

1003
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:57,170
didn't you ever see that episode of taxi
where they showed Reverend Jim before

1004
01:00:57,171 --> 01:01:00,380
he fucking ate the pot brownies? It was
just some boring guy with the sweater on.

1005
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,490
If I took Joe Rogan's pills and all
of a sudden I started focusing more

1006
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,320
that what I would just,
I don't think you'd like me

1007
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,290
now. I don't fuck with pills. I
don't fuck with pills. I don't take,

1008
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:19,070
I don't take sleeping pills, you
know, I don't fuck with them.

1009
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:22,460
I think they beat up your liver and he
thinks it's a bunch of shit out there

1010
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:25,790
that they say is healthy in
it doesn't have side effects.

1011
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:30,380
And I feel like the food and Drug
Administration has, you know,

1012
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:34,820
I've seen documentaries where people
used to work for these drug companies are

1013
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:38,950
now they've infiltrated the food.
Uh,

1014
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,600
the five, whatever the fuck
it's called. I just said it,

1015
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,080
uh, who's a better candidate for
this shit than me? The fruit,

1016
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:51,860
food and drug organization,
food and health, whatever
the fuck it is. I just said,

1017
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:56,480
and I just had it. It's
unbelievable. The FDA,

1018
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:59,570
there you go.
You've got the nuts running and not house,

1019
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:01,700
so they just push and shit
through clear and it, you know,

1020
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:05,630
they're getting kickbacks on the side. I
don't fucking trust any of it. All right.

1021
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,120
I think the way I was born is natural.
You know,

1022
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,770
I don't think being
scatterbrained is necessary.

1023
01:02:15,771 --> 01:02:20,030
It's bad as far as the way
things are set up right now, but

1024
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:23,900
back in the day, if we were still living
in the woods, I'd be fucking killing it.

1025
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:28,760
I'd have those squirrel like instincts,
so I fucking be looking around, you know?

1026
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:34,160
But it just weirds people out in the
office environment. I'm all write with it.

1027
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:37,460
I'm staying with that,
with how I up. All right.

1028
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,770
I saw Joe the other night.

1029
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,180
I had one of my best sets of the
fucking year up at the ice house band.

1030
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,180
I just had a great time.

1031
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,740
I saw Joe the other night and I got to
tell you something that Matt had laser

1032
01:02:48,741 --> 01:02:52,280
focus when he was talking to me.
He didn't break eye contact.

1033
01:02:52,281 --> 01:02:54,290
What's so maybe that shit works.
I have no idea.

1034
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:02,060
I taken any drugs, man. I gotta do enough.
I do enough fucking damage to myself.

1035
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:05,090
Last thing I need to do.
Does that make any sense though?

1036
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:09,360
I play devil's advocate here. Oh
my God, I can't fucking think. Oh,

1037
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:13,460
take this pill and then now you can
think straight. All right, and that's it.

1038
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,190
That's it. Right? Those
side effect. No, nothing.

1039
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,780
I just take this and magically I'm fixed.

1040
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:25,000
I Dunno about that. They're, there
always seems to be like this,

1041
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:28,180
like back in the day old
school shit like penicillin,

1042
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:32,380
thank shit like that seem to work, but
all this shit since then I feel like the,

1043
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,580
the drugs, like they just
sort of peeked at some point,

1044
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:38,403
you know,

1045
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,610
and there was no more new drugs
to kind of come up with Lsa.

1046
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:47,500
They fix something while fucking
something else up like Rogaine. Right.

1047
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,270
You put that shit on your head,

1048
01:03:49,271 --> 01:03:53,080
you grow a little bit of hair and then
your kid has like three feet, you know,

1049
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:53,651
or whatever.

1050
01:03:53,651 --> 01:03:56,770
Your heart starts racing and it was always
something good to have your cake and

1051
01:03:56,771 --> 01:03:59,560
eat it. This is what I want
to let, it's a brand new drug.

1052
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,390
I'm going to let all you guys take it.
All right?

1053
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:05,650
And if 10 years from now you
still have laser focus. All right,

1054
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,690
can you levers are fine then
maybe I'll think about doing it,

1055
01:04:09,691 --> 01:04:13,050
but at that point I'll be uh,
I'll be pushing 60.

1056
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:16,560
So what the fuck do I
care when I'm pushing 60?

1057
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,560
That's what I would start thinking.
Like, what am I going to feel like?

1058
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:22,620
I can try heroin only once.
I'm going to do that.

1059
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:29,220
Most smoke it not fucking
with you. I ain't get it.

1060
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:32,990
I shouldn't say that. This,
you know, people who actually
give me shit about that.

1061
01:04:32,991 --> 01:04:35,790
I would never fucking try that.
How many fucking people got it?

1062
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:40,430
That's bad this week to bring that
shit up so I'm not going to, anyways,

1063
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:44,330
that's the trouble with Improv. All
right. Girlfriends. Breath stinks. Dare.

1064
01:04:44,331 --> 01:04:47,960
Billington the red. Uh, I been,

1065
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:52,220
I've been seeing my girlfriend for a
little over a year now and if you could

1066
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,550
tell me your fucking breath
is stuck the entire time.

1067
01:04:54,551 --> 01:04:58,610
I've really not gonna have any sympathy
for you and I don't know how you fucking

1068
01:04:58,611 --> 01:04:59,010
bring it.

1069
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,520
And the only way you bring it up now
is if you act like it just started.

1070
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:05,270
I've been seeing my girlfriend
for a little over a year now.

1071
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:08,810
We're very much in love and have a
great time when we're around each other.

1072
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:09,501
However,

1073
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:12,590
in the past couple of months I've
noticed every so often or breath stinks.

1074
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,220
I'm not talking.
She had ate something bad,

1075
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:19,600
but some deep seated stench that
makes my eyebrow hair burned away.

1076
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:25,080
I noticed that her teeth have a certain
yellow tint to them that is hard to look

1077
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:29,840
away from. It's like a film of American
cheese. Oh Jesus. Sorry for the grocers.

1078
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:32,890
But that's just the truth. It's not
like she doesn't take care of herself.

1079
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:35,020
She's very beautiful, responsible. Anyway,

1080
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:38,680
she has health insurance but not dental
and hasn't been to a dentist in three

1081
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:42,790
years. Well take her, take her. Okay.

1082
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:47,590
Cause she's starting to sound like a
woman that lives in a tree in a fucking

1083
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:49,800
fable.
Um,

1084
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:53,230
I think she might have some buildup
of Tartar or gum disease. Yeah.

1085
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:56,260
Or something she needs a deep cleaning
to start with and then they should have,

1086
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,710
if that doesn't work, I would check
for some sort of sinus infection.

1087
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,370
Okay.

1088
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,440
Yeah. If that doesn't work, uh,

1089
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:10,650
you know, I dunno, consult a specialist
rather than a comedian doing a podcast.

1090
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,950
MMM. We're going to move out
together when I go to my new job,

1091
01:06:16,951 --> 01:06:20,660
but I'm going to pay for dental insurance
when I make the money because everyone

1092
01:06:20,661 --> 01:06:22,040
should be able to see a dentist,

1093
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,520
especially as a girls asked him
of her until that day comes,

1094
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:28,880
I want to say something but don't know
how to say it. Obviously I just can't say,

1095
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:32,690
honey, your mouse smells like shit. We're
very open with each other all the time,

1096
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,820
but I can't get the balls
to tell her to say this.

1097
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:38,910
Any suggestion from you or the loving
you would be appreciated. All right. Ah,

1098
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:42,390
fuck. I got to get Nia. Nia
for this one. Yeah. Hang on.

1099
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,260
Hey Nia.
Nia.

1100
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:52,290
Yeah.
Can you help me on the podcast?

1101
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,850
I need you to help me answer a question
cause I can only think of a way to say

1102
01:06:57,851 --> 01:06:58,810
it in a mean way.

1103
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,953
Okay.

1104
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,080
I just,
I don't understand.

1105
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,950
Shut up or you're not capable of just
pressing pause and come and get me instead

1106
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:15,240
of I have shit to with a crazy person.
I have shit to do it. What do you want?

1107
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:19,230
I'm watching something. Alright, here we
go. This guy's girlfriends breath stinks.

1108
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:22,650
Okay. Um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
go through it really quickly.

1109
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:25,170
Can you talk about how
you ate garlic today? No,

1110
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:28,380
I did raw garlic because I had
a sore throat, ate raw garlic,

1111
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:32,620
and then you wash it down with milk. How
gross. Is that too fucking? Yeah, I know.

1112
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:37,770
What's to somehow fixes your sore
throat. I Dunno. Is it working?

1113
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,260
No, and I feel like I fucking
ate a lit cigarette. Um,

1114
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,940
anyways. I'm just gonna say it real quick.
Was the only of what would microphone.

1115
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:48,160
So anyways,
her breath didn't stick.

1116
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:50,120
And all of a sudden lately
it's just stinking. She's,

1117
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:54,250
he's noticing a film across the teeth
kind of yellowish. She hasn't, um,

1118
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:59,010
seen a dentist in like three years.
How does he, how does he say, listen,

1119
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,250
yeah,

1120
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,850
I love you but your breath stinks.
I want to pay for you to go to a dentist.

1121
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:09,680
I don't want you walking around the world.
You're going to get a nickname.

1122
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:14,660
Like that's how bad your breath smells.
Does she not brush your teeth? No,

1123
01:08:14,661 --> 01:08:17,650
she does. She hasn't been to a
dentist who I said it takes care.

1124
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,060
She might have some target built up.

1125
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,400
The first thing you'd do is go
brushes her teeth every day.

1126
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:25,690
And she still has all of this going on?
No, we said there's a yellow film. Yeah,

1127
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:27,370
that means he's not brushing her teeth.

1128
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,200
Cause why would there
be a yellow film on her?

1129
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:32,170
But she brushed her teeth in the
morning and then before she went to bed,

1130
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:37,130
even if it's once a day, she needs to
go see how does, how does he tell him?

1131
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,170
How does he get her to go to the
dentist? Okay. Okay. You know,

1132
01:08:41,171 --> 01:08:43,210
I would just say it to me how,
no,

1133
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:47,020
how would you want me to say it to you
if that's, if that was going on. Oooh.

1134
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,940
See I practice one.
Let me practice one.

1135
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:55,570
We all know you're going to anyways, it
doesn't, go ahead. Yes, go ahead. Hey Nia.

1136
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,970
No, no. You don't have to get up. You can
sit right over there. Stay over there. Um,

1137
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,750
do I love you, but it's sometimes I like
looking at you from across the room.

1138
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:07,880
Listen,

1139
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,750
I'm only telling you this because I
love you and I would want you to tell me

1140
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:16,220
this. It hasn't been, you know,
the whole time I've been with you,

1141
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:21,200
but at some point in the last six weeks,
like you've had like moments,

1142
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,280
especially like actually right now,
like I don't know what's going on,

1143
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:28,960
but your breath really smells bad

1144
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,960
and I,
I don't want to be near you

1145
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,730
and it kills me to tell you this,
but your breath stinks.

1146
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,860
And I think you need to go see a dentist.

1147
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:45,920
I know you don't have dental insurance
and I want to pay for it. Okay.

1148
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:50,510
Cause you're too beautiful to be walking
around with that rotting smell in your

1149
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:53,230
mouth.
You still love me.

1150
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,680
I wouldn't be mad at that cause I haven't,
I would start with it.

1151
01:09:56,681 --> 01:09:57,700
We're using that to me.

1152
01:09:57,701 --> 01:10:00,170
I would laugh at it and I would know
that was coming from a good point.

1153
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:04,150
Would be mortified. Mortified though.
I would be really, really embarrassed.

1154
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,520
But obviously,
you know,

1155
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:10,030
if anyone's going to tell me it's going
to be the person that has to kiss you

1156
01:10:10,031 --> 01:10:13,600
and be around you all the time. So yeah.
Well then fix it. Fix what I just said.

1157
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,780
How's Kaushik? How can you tell it where
a lady wouldn't get pissed? I don't know.

1158
01:10:16,781 --> 01:10:21,700
That's actually not too bad.
I don't think. You know,
it's just, that's so hard.

1159
01:10:21,701 --> 01:10:23,920
I don't, hey ya. Shit mouth.

1160
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:29,080
Why don't you go see a fucking dentist
before you kill the house plants.

1161
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,980
All right. Go eat your
pizza. Yeah, I mean,

1162
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,980
I think that's it just to be
really just brutally honest,

1163
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:39,910
but try to do it in a
cute, funny way, you know?

1164
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:44,410
And just be like, yeah. Oh God.
That would be so hard. Yeah,

1165
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:45,280
you're beautiful.

1166
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:49,570
You're too beautiful video walking around
because at least you're throwing in a

1167
01:10:49,571 --> 01:10:54,070
compliment your body and faces a 10.
Your mouth's a negative too.

1168
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,990
We got to get those numbers closer
together. How are we going to do this?

1169
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,620
All right. Can you be fair? Can you
give me a glass of water by fucking,

1170
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,450
I ran out of water.
My throat is killing me.

1171
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:10,870
I sound like this woman's
breath. Um, all right. Good
luck with that, sir. All right,

1172
01:11:10,871 --> 01:11:12,490
let's wrap this up.
Um,

1173
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:18,550
bodyweight exercises, spelt, B, O, d, y,

1174
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:23,560
boody weight exercises, Willie Bond Bond.
Uh, I heard of the podcast last week.

1175
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:26,230
You like body weight,
exercise me to fucking love him.

1176
01:11:26,231 --> 01:11:29,980
Last year I found a great app with a
shit load of great bodyweight routines.

1177
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:33,730
It's called,
is this the one app that you invented?

1178
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:35,940
This might be free advertising.
I don't care.

1179
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:40,270
It's for working out a bodyweight
training. You are your own gym.

1180
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,130
I think it's about three to $3
and it's fan fucking tastic.

1181
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,130
It was developed by a navy seal fitness
trainer and it has four different 10

1182
01:11:48,131 --> 01:11:50,170
week programs for
different fitness levels.

1183
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,830
All the workouts are short and
will kick your ass in a good way,

1184
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,600
plus a bunch of other goodies.

1185
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:59,500
I can't recommend it highly enough and
I am not in any way feel affiliated with

1186
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:02,110
the APP. It's just a great
workout at a great price.

1187
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,140
No equipment needed by recommend
picking up a pull up bar.

1188
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:08,920
You stick in your doorframe for 20,
$30 at target or somewhere.

1189
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:12,580
I started using it back in September
and in a much better shape because it,

1190
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:16,990
because of it. Fucking awesome
dude. Uh, while I'm at it,

1191
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:20,170
I also recommend a regular
full body stretching routine.

1192
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:25,060
I've been doing that for months as
well and I'm as limber as a whole.

1193
01:12:25,061 --> 01:12:29,320
It's clamp. That's
something he wrote near. Oh,

1194
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,020
what was clam there and for the ladies,
um,

1195
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,310
as bendable as a drunk and
louses WIC whiskey Dick,

1196
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:41,030
they a kid see that he was trying to,
it's trying to do one for the women. Yeah,

1197
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,040
like a negative noodle deck. You
know, when there's no blood in a deck,

1198
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,780
he can bend it. Let me, let me ask you,

1199
01:12:46,781 --> 01:12:49,840
if he's talking about how
great and how in shape he is,

1200
01:12:49,841 --> 01:12:54,841
why would he ever compare himself to a
limp Dick Women's sucking the common,

1201
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:02,050
I have everything for over a hundred
years. All right. Take this. What is it?

1202
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:06,300
It's a fucking Ricola. Oh, Rico law.

1203
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,370
All right.
By the way,

1204
01:13:09,371 --> 01:13:12,760
it'll recent study I read about
and health showed that to best,

1205
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:17,020
the two best things you can do before bed
to get a good night's sleep is stretch

1206
01:13:17,021 --> 01:13:17,980
and visualize.

1207
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:20,130
Correct.

1208
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:23,220
Um, what do you jerk it off
after you fucking touch utopia?

1209
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,380
I'm sorry.
It's so fucking childish and I love it.

1210
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:33,770
So I often stretch and then do a guided
visual mental meditation from Youtube

1211
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:36,510
before bed.

1212
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:38,803
What

1213
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:43,320
does that mean? You're
watching a video, do you think?

1214
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:48,390
I took it to a weird place
there. I didn't, these
guided meditations are Corny,

1215
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,040
but they're great.
Super relaxing.

1216
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:55,820
Hope this is his info is useful to you
and my fellow m m p see brothers and

1217
01:13:57,001 --> 01:14:01,500
sisters be well, um, you know something

1218
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:07,240
right. I think that makes a lot
of sense. I might try that. Oh,

1219
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,810
you don't wanna use it. Do you know
when I was doing the helicopter lessons,

1220
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:14,450
which I'm going back to my final and
much before I test for my license here,

1221
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,373
um,

1222
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:19,700
I was having problems with auto rotations
and I just sat there visualizing doing

1223
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:22,490
them but not close my eyes.

1224
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:25,820
I was just like my minute at the end of
the bed pretending I was in there and

1225
01:14:25,821 --> 01:14:28,640
the next day I did them, I
was much better. So maybe
there's something to that.

1226
01:14:28,641 --> 01:14:29,474
I have no idea.

1227
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:34,770
He said a be well miniature
version of animal to your bill.

1228
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:38,870
Okay. Miniature version of animal. Here
we go. I think this is the last one here.

1229
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:40,603
Um,

1230
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:47,090
if you could have a smaller version of a
normally large animal, what would it be?

1231
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,600
Ideally it would be trained and you'd
have it as a pet signed weird roommate.

1232
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:00,530
Well, it couldn't kill me. Um,

1233
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:07,040
I love animals too much to have
a, make a wild animal, a pet. So,

1234
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,520
oh they, I have, I'd have a
miniature version of my talk, Cleo.

1235
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:15,770
So even when it flipped out,
when I dressed up like a drummer,

1236
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,700
I wouldn't have to worry about it
killing me. That's a lame answer.

1237
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,400
I'd have a miniature gorilla.

1238
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,340
That's what I would
have made sure gorilla.

1239
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,730
Right then I do pull ups as it
climbed a tree looking at me like,

1240
01:15:29,731 --> 01:15:32,250
why can't you go all the way up?
But I'd be like, because I'm human,

1241
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,450
miniature gorilla. The fuck's wrong with
you. Then we'd smoke some weed. Man,

1242
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:41,310
that's a weed fucking question man.
If you could,

1243
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:44,820
if you could have any animal miniature,
what would you have?

1244
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:49,980
I'd have an alligator man and I'd have
a clip. My toenails, dude. Alright.

1245
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:53,130
Old Billy red face. First
off, go fuck yourself second.

1246
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,980
I'm having some issues with my roommate.

1247
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,730
I'm in college and share a campus
apartment with one roommate.

1248
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:04,110
My question is how do you motivate someone
to be more considerate? Uh, you can't,

1249
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,320
I grew up in a house with
brothers and sisters,

1250
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:10,230
so I try to respect other people and
those who I live with, for the most part,

1251
01:16:10,231 --> 01:16:12,360
my roommate on the other hand,
doesn't do dishes.

1252
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:15,880
It doesn't take out the garbage and
doesn't even change the toilet paper where

1253
01:16:15,881 --> 01:16:19,860
we're out of it. I've asked him to do
it, do the above, mentioned nicely,

1254
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,810
and he gave up on it pretty quickly.

1255
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:25,680
He doesn't even say what's up and make
eye contact when he walks in the door.

1256
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:27,780
I'm not trying to be a Douche,
but at what,

1257
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:32,310
at what time do you think I should take
a shit on his bed now or later? Thanks.

1258
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:34,530
Um,
I don't think you need any help.

1259
01:16:34,531 --> 01:16:36,990
I think you're mentally
moving in the right direction.

1260
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:41,200
You know, there's gotta be, um,

1261
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:48,560
you don't have communal dishes,
right? Dental start using yours.

1262
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,590
Uh, you know, you're going to have
to drop this guy at some point.

1263
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:54,223
Okay.

1264
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:58,270
This is what you do next time. He
doesn't flush the toilet. Yeah.

1265
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:03,120
I would just stick his pillow in
the toilet. I mean, I think that,

1266
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:07,580
what else are you going to do?
What does pillow back on the fucking bed?

1267
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:12,840
Um,
I had a roommate like that.

1268
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:16,320
I had a roommate like that
and we almost came to blows.

1269
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,720
And I'm thrilled when you live in with
an animal you live in with an animal and

1270
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,501
it's just like,

1271
01:17:22,501 --> 01:17:25,030
you're just going to have to tough
it out for the rest of the semester.

1272
01:17:25,031 --> 01:17:28,250
We get somebody different and,
um,

1273
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,630
is the deal, just know that some, he's,

1274
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,020
that's the type of guy that's probably
going to get divorced or he's going to

1275
01:17:37,021 --> 01:17:40,920
marry an unbelievably understanding woman.

1276
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:45,930
Um, I fucking hate guys
like that. I never,

1277
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:48,960
that whole fucking,
you know,

1278
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:52,290
you know that stereotype of how on a
guy's apartment it looks like they just

1279
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:57,060
slice a pizza between the cushions
fucking and I never was like that.

1280
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:02,070
What a fuck what you want to live
like that? Never did that. I mean,

1281
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,850
when I was living in New York, right? Um,

1282
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,640
I had this roommate and um,
you know,

1283
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:13,220
from day one if I did,
you know,

1284
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:17,630
fight dirty some dishes and he had a
few in there. I did mine and I did his,

1285
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:21,200
you know, if I took out the trash couple
times in a row, I didn't give a fuck.

1286
01:18:21,201 --> 01:18:24,950
And you know what, he immediately was
the same way I showed him respect,

1287
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:28,610
he showed me respect, we got
to look fucking great. Alright,

1288
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,680
I've fucking move out.

1289
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,540
Other dude moves in and all of a
sudden all the harmony goes away.

1290
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,650
He starts telling me what a fucking
asshole the other guy is. And I read,

1291
01:18:39,651 --> 01:18:41,300
it took me awhile to
realize this. Like, no dude,

1292
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:45,200
you are the fucking asshole and you
pissed. This guy was a respectful guy.

1293
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:49,340
If he showed him respect,
he took out the trash to without asking.

1294
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,940
He actually hooked me up. Took me a
minute to figure out the math on that one.

1295
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:56,720
So you just got a bad roommate and
when you live with that animal,

1296
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:02,090
you got to treat them like a, you
know, you've got a wholesome doubt.

1297
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,460
I Dunno what you do.

1298
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,880
Just break one of his glasses
in front of them. Just say,

1299
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:15,960
let's just start throwing out his dishes.
Go look, I'm not going to wash up,

1300
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:18,150
so I'm just going to put
your dishes in the trash.

1301
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:19,650
Okay.

1302
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,830
Okay. Which is ridiculous. And it will
be like, why I go, because I'm like,

1303
01:19:22,831 --> 01:19:27,390
you fucking bitch. Do your dishes, your
fucking animal. I would literally take it.

1304
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,840
I mean, I don't know. I don't know if
you can take this guy, but like, I dunno,

1305
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,400
that's make us making me go back
to an angry place in my life.

1306
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:34,830
So I'm not going to give you
any more advice. Talk to that.

1307
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:37,950
Don't bring it to violence.
Don't stick his pillow and the toilet.

1308
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:41,220
They'll do that.
It's a short time when your fucking life,

1309
01:19:41,221 --> 01:19:43,480
you'll get a better
roommate. But, uh, just,

1310
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:47,850
you learn a lot of lessons with this cut.
And, uh, when you go to meet a woman, uh,

1311
01:19:47,851 --> 01:19:51,210
you know, check out her fucking
apartments. Yes, she lives all right.

1312
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,210
And don't do a one and done either.
So, yeah, she has over time.

1313
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,060
She's a fucking does nothing
worse than a messy woman.

1314
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,970
They have way more shit than
any guy could ever have.

1315
01:19:59,971 --> 01:20:02,460
Just imagine all your
fucking male roommates. Shit.

1316
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:07,140
Just multiply the amount of sneakers.
He has times 20 fucking pairs of shoes,

1317
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:11,050
all that makeup and crap fucking animals.

1318
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,070
I used to clean bathrooms and um,

1319
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,460
when I worked in this restaurant,

1320
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:17,420
okay,

1321
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,170
and you'd think the guys bathroom would
have been dirty or at the fucking a

1322
01:20:20,171 --> 01:20:21,740
woman's bathroom?
I swear to God.

1323
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:25,760
It looked like there was a ticker tape
parade and then somebody shit all over it.

1324
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,110
I was a fucking right

1325
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:33,760
water all over the place. It was like,
what the fuck are they doing in here?

1326
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,220
Because they have to sit down to pee.
They would just build a nest.

1327
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,090
I don't know what it was.

1328
01:20:39,091 --> 01:20:42,270
It was just an ungodly amount of toilet
paper all over the fucking place and

1329
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:45,840
you'll getting dolled up in
there. And I was just, ugh. God,
