1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,100
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burrows
sign for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:07,500
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcasts.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,580
Ah,
I'm

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,700
just checking in on you. How are you? Um,

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,050
it's Thursday,

6
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:20,820
November 15th and old
freckles is off the road. Hey,

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,950
he's dropping pounds right in,

8
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:27,840
left because he's not up there
eating from a chef. He's Billy.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,260
He's losing his freckles. Sorry. Um,

10
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:36,150
I'm excited to be home with my wife and
kid. And speaking of which I last week,

11
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:40,770
last Monday. Can you guys
remember back to November 12th?

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,350
Remember that Trump was still president?
He's still president anyways. Uh,

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,110
what was I gonna say?
Um, I read a question.

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,720
Best friend's wife from a lady and
felt that Nia needed to chime in.

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,880
So what did I do?

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,190
I got in touch with my wife's people to
try and see if I could put her on the

17
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:06,090
podcast and she was nice enough
to take time out of her busy,

18
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,620
beautiful schedule as being
the greatest mother ever. Um,

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,910
welcome back to the program. Thank
you Nia hill. Thank you so much.

20
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,840
Thank you for having me. Oh, well what
was it like to work with Tom Cruise?

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,840
Oh my God,
he is so amazing.

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,730
He is just so generous and do his
own stunts. He did his own stunts.

23
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,300
So he really banged you in that
scene, right? Oh my God. It was great.

24
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,200
He didn't let it stop me do it.
No, no. He'd stand commitment.

25
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,380
He stabbed me in the eyes the
entire time. Real. It's like wow.

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,330
It's like we're in a real relationship.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,130
After he got to the Invisalign,
you fixed that snaggle tooth.

28
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,790
I just felt like it all just
went to another level. His
commitment to the craft.

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,480
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am. We're
trying to do a podcast over here.

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,200
I got the little one out here too.

31
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:59,820
When she has her favorite show on
the one created by Harland Williams.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,880
I can't say the name of it or she's
going to freak out cause she's kind of

33
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,830
looking at it like,
why is there no sound?

34
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,660
It's almost the 2000 twenties not the
1920s then once you have some old lady

35
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:15,300
playing a piano when the
corner. All right, Neil.

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,930
I know you have a lot of stuff to do.
We're going to do a little Bang Bang here.

37
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,580
Going right into it. All right, great.
All right. Best friend's wife from a

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,940
best friend's wife. All
right. Hello, Billy Baldwin.

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,650
Oh, hey. I like it. Yeah, but I went
in that I liked that I win. Yeah,

40
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:39,000
that's bald. And I, when do
I, I don't think so recently.

41
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,760
I must saying, hey honey, speaking to the
mic. He rather than chime in. All right.

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,050
Yes. Oh, you're talking about,
yeah, me. All right. Uh,

43
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:53,730
recently I've been posting pictures
and videos on my Instagram that are not

44
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:56,130
slutty.dot, dot. Not slutty,

45
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,020
but I wouldn't show my parents either.
Ah, period. Now, where it now, where,

46
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:03,550
where would you call if you had to
rate that as a movie? Where is she?

47
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,050
What do you mean? Like
some movie PG, PG 13 are,

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,570
it's not NC 17,
but it's not me.

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,100
If she's showing nip and booty.
So then you would say PG,

50
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,340
PG 13, now somebody's, oh,

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,500
um, I am 26 years old. Prime of your life.

52
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,690
And I've been feeling very
confident about myself. Wow.

53
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,610
Add Up Bay Vida.
Show it off girl.

54
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,810
I want to bring that back.
What happened to [inaudible]?

55
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,210
Me Guys don't dance anymore. Bring what
back burlesque. The old stripper song.

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,310
Yeah. Dita von Teese does it not in
the club. What do you mean in the club?

57
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,430
The in duck club Da. No, not
we're black duck club. No,

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,610
that was never our,
are you going down? Um,

59
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,160
and I've been feeling very
confident about myself and my body.

60
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,890
I'm single with no
boyfriend or even dating

61
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,590
anyways, my friend, sorry, since I was 16,

62
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:16,591
has told me that his wife
has been uncomfortable with
us talking because she's

63
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:20,320
seen my pictures.
So they'd been friends since camp.

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,330
So what happens at camp stays at camp.
That's right. She, she's told him,

65
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,460
uh, she feels insecure and sees
my pictures even before he does.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,840
Uh, he has the following
here. Yes. She's watching you.

67
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,780
Private eyes.

68
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,700
He has expressed that he may not be
my friend anymore because of this.

69
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,350
And this is not the first time I've been
blocked by male friends because their

70
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,640
female counterparts,

71
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,670
our social media stalking me and
claiming I'm trying to get their men,

72
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,560
first of all, nobody's stocking
you. You're on social media.

73
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,490
If you are hanging these up in your
house and you looked and she was staring

74
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,324
into your window,

75
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,560
you can let go and just be like really
looking through someone's feed and just

76
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:09,370
be like every time they pose looking and
not only looking at the picture and see

77
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:12,850
who's liking the picture and the tag,
like all that kind of stuff.

78
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,080
All of that is all out in the open.
I know, but like you can pay like a,

79
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,070
just a little bit more attention to it
then a normal just scrolling through. Oh,

80
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,800
like, like, like it's like a little
kid playing hide and go seek.

81
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,020
The first time they hide,
they lie down on the floor,

82
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:30,400
face down and cover their eyes.
I'm hiding. You're not hiding.

83
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:33,550
You're putting this out for
the world to see. And judge,

84
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,340
I've been told uh,

85
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,840
to maybe tone it to tone
down my post or not. Right.

86
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,730
How I feel because the girls take it
personally and take it out on my friends.

87
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,680
Uh,
and these,

88
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,520
are these my real friends or do their
girls have legit reasons to be upset?

89
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,980
Yours truly a huge fan and
love to Nia and the baby. Oh,

90
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,960
um,
well first of all I had to say,

91
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:07,430
I don't know why you're surprised at
this reaction because you're out there

92
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:11,870
thirst trapping and these girls don't
want their men to get caught in your trap.

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,100
So even though you may not be trying to
break that down for the white audience,

94
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,470
what, what thirst
trapping? She's out there.

95
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:22,790
Thirst trap trapping means like you post
photos that are intentionally like sexy

96
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,550
or provocative cause you're trying to get
legs. You're trying to get out of this.

97
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,680
Pretend that they're not, you're just, Oh,

98
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:31,820
this is just me eating cornflakes with
most of my breasts to sit down. No,

99
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,160
I don't think that you're
necessarily acting like it's not,

100
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,850
but you know that there's just like
certain photos that are going to get like

101
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:42,140
the IEA reaction as opposed to the like,
Aye Yai Yai.

102
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,620
Is there any, uh, d going on here?

103
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,610
Teas, D, teas,

104
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,660
Dixie, you, it's the kids
here. Oh, a vibrator.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,670
Uh,
I don't know that it's a Dt,

106
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:02,671
but it's definitely like showing
you what your life could be.

107
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,590
Yeah. What you could be throwing around
the bedroom for sure. So I don't,

108
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,630
I mean it's not surprising that their,

109
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,740
their girlfriends and wives or whatever
are going to be like feeling some type

110
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:15,880
of way if they're liking your
pictures. So, um, I don't know.

111
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:19,360
I don't think that you're doing
anything wrong, but I didn't write this.

112
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:24,040
I don't think that, um, there
are necessarily wrong either.

113
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:28,000
But here's the thing. I feel like they
were going back to one of my earlier,

114
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,120
my earliest appearances on the podcast.

115
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,700
The only thing is she's been friends with
this kid since she was 16, so that's,

116
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:34,420
they're fine.

117
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,420
But I also noticed in her letter that she
said that like all of her male friends

118
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:42,100
are most of her male friends.

119
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,910
So it was this another situation where
you've got a girl who's got a lot of male

120
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:50,380
friends, nothing wrong, no friends
involved, male friends. And it's,

121
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,770
Oh my God, there's stalking
me on Instagram and Oh my God,

122
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:57,670
there's such haters and my are these men.
Really? My friends, it's like, listen,

123
00:07:57,671 --> 00:08:00,820
you just have to understand like you
have to kind of be a grown up about this.

124
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,720
Like it's one thing for you. Like I
said, the Post thirst trapping pictures,

125
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,500
all your girlfriends are going to be like,
yes. Oh my God, you're giving me live.

126
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:11,680
You're so a hard look at you,
Bam. All that kind of stuff.

127
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,220
That's what your girlfriends and
like your gay friends are for what?

128
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:19,570
His thirst trapping me. I just told
you what it was earlier. Yeah. I said,

129
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:23,410
when you're posting a picture that's
intentionally provocative or sexy to get

130
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:25,450
likes, that's like a thirst
trap. In other words,

131
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,850
you're not really going to hook
up with anybody. No, you're just,

132
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,380
you just saw all these postings, a sexy
photo. But Steve, for women, lady, uh,

133
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,210
guys are showing thirsty for attention
that Oh, that's right. Sorry.

134
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,790
Sorry. I'm the White Cup on
Sanford and son. I'm rapping.

135
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,650
So I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm just
not surprised that they're there.

136
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,560
What should she do so she stepped away
from these people. I mean step away.

137
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:55,350
How far away from the car with your hands?
No.

138
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:56,040
Do you have

139
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,670
to understand that if you start to move
into this space where you're posting

140
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:04,200
sexy photos, your viewership and the way
people look at you is going to change.

141
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,050
Huge point.
If you're okay with that,

142
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,830
then keep doing what you're doing,
but if you have a problem with it,

143
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:13,020
then maybe you want to pull
back a little bit, but yes,

144
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:14,880
people are gonna look
at you some type of way.

145
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,200
Women are gonna look at you differently.

146
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,800
Men certainly are going to start to
look at you differently and certainly,

147
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,750
but go ahead. What comes
with that territory is that
women are going to be like,

148
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,860
oh, I saw you liked her photo when she
was like, you know, bent over being like,

149
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:32,190
you know, I actually, if I could
just meet cute or whatever,

150
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,700
I don't know what people are here.
They're both,

151
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,090
certainly you're not going to insert
anything. That's, that's what I know.

152
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,470
It's a rough one. Both men
and women equally are going
to look at it differently.

153
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,030
Right. Okay. So let's not, let's not turn
this into yet another, that's what I said.

154
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,070
You said women are going
to look at you differently.

155
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,770
Men are certainly gonna
get your differently.

156
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah. Well, okay,

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,600
so just say what you're saying.
Just don't, don't, yeah.
Well, okay, me just, yeah.

158
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,480
I mean I stand by what I
said. You think that, well,

159
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:12,540
why can't you say that so we can
discuss it? I've been doing that.

160
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,990
Yeah. Well, okay. If Lola
wasn't here, I right now,

161
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:22,590
I would transcribe what you just said
to me. What's his, what? Huh? I can't,

162
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,750
there's too many f words in it.
That was,

163
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,950
that was like, if you put a bunch of f
words into a shotgun. Right. Well, um,

164
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,790
so I,
women know what other women are doing.

165
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,700
I think you have to expect that.
You know,

166
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,890
if these women are already uncomfortable
with your presence in their man's life,

167
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,430
if you start posting booty shots and all
this other kind of stuff and they see

168
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,420
that they're dudes liking it,
they're going to be like,

169
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,630
she didn't say that she was bending
over and or any of that type of stuff.

170
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:57,420
She just said, this is some stuff that,
you know, it's a little more risque,

171
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,590
but I wouldn't show my parents.
Right, exactly. Meaning
it's, yeah, it's, you know,

172
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:05,280
your parents or your knees
get back in house. Priest,

173
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,540
I think you should post whatever you can.
The Catholic church,

174
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,210
if you're feeling good about
yourself and about your body,

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,030
you should post all the live long day.

176
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:19,410
Just know that it's not going to be
this perfect scenario where you can just

177
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:23,040
post and no one's gonna look at you
differently. I disagree, fortunately.

178
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,850
Unfortunately. That's just the way that
it is. I disagree with that. With what?

179
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,511
With it.

180
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:31,080
You should go and post all these sexy
photos of yourself and put them on social

181
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:33,240
media. Women can not be doing that. Why?

182
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,200
Why are you telling women what they
should be doing with their bodies? It is.

183
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,130
There it is. Yeah,
exactly. There it is. Yeah.

184
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,710
And there it is from
you to tell it like it.

185
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,660
I don't think women should
post the like who are you?

186
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,690
You don't get to decide what
people do with their body.

187
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,210
Please not say that expression.
You don't get to just

188
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,650
whatever. I want to say everything
in her dot trying to police my words.

189
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,260
You haven't even heard what my point
is. What's your plan? Okay. My,

190
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,460
my point is bad.
I don't want to hear it.

191
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,110
You have the way you wish the
world was and the way it really is.

192
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,760
Okay.
Okay.

193
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,060
So to go out there and do all of that
stuff and be all provocative and get all

194
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,630
these people hot and bothered,
there were so many fricking cycles.

195
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:27,631
That's the same reason why you don't go
out there and as a celebrity sit there

196
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:32,850
and, and uh, you know, tree stump or
whatever the hell you call it for, for a,

197
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,790
for a candidate,

198
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,780
all you're doing is just going out there
and getting that lunatic in the white

199
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:41,380
van with the two seats that wants to
make a pipe bomb and stick it in your

200
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:44,650
mailbox. You doing stuff like
that, you're a good looking person.

201
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,660
People are going to know
you're good looking. Like the,

202
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,660
literally social media has been around
so long that that people aren't even

203
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:53,350
understanding that there's no
perspective on it anymore. Half of these,

204
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:56,350
so many of these photos that are on
Instagram and all that type of stuff,

205
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,890
those were like the kind of photos that
were in the beginning of a magazine at a

206
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,520
truck stop like 20 years ago and
these are just regular women up.

207
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,320
But back then you didn't
know where these women were.

208
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:09,380
You couldn't find them on the Internet.
There wasn't cvs taken. Everybody's, uh,

209
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,540
information and you can go on and find
everybody's address out there and you're

210
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,480
going to go out there thirst trapping
or whatever the hell you calling it,

211
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,780
showing your goods and you're just,
you're playing.

212
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,190
There's not a person in law enforcement
that the would not 100% agree with what

213
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:24,700
I'm saying.

214
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,880
This has nothing to do with a guy telling
you to do what you should be doing

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,870
with your body.

216
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,170
And it has to do with somebody looking
out for your own personal safety.

217
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,440
And the doing that is no
different than these f and morons.

218
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:40,441
You see out there riding a bicycle in la
on busy streets allegedly in this bike

219
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:44,220
lane that's not even painted and they
have their headphones on. You have you,

220
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:48,520
you have completely no responsibility
for your own personal safety.

221
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,110
And then when something happens to you,

222
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,340
this is this a hundred percent looked at
that you're a victim, you are a victim,

223
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,920
but there's nothing looking at
like some preventative measures.

224
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,350
Like why would you go on
the Internet and do that?

225
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,600
Just post a picture yourself smiling.

226
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,540
You're a good looking person and you'll
attract the kind of person you want to

227
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:04,990
meet.

228
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,950
You're going to go out there and show
your booty crack and you and you in your,

229
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:11,500
your your, your ass cleavage there.
I mean, what do you, what do you,

230
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,710
what do you like you even said that
if you're going to start showing that

231
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,680
everybody is going to look at
you differently. Certainly guys,

232
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,350
now all they're going to think
is really one of the Fq, right?

233
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:23,360
That's all they're thinking. That's
the best you're going to get, right?

234
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,140
That is the best you're going to get
with those photos and the worst you're

235
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:30,400
going to get is an Effient stalker.
Right? Okay, so that's what I was saying.

236
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:34,060
I wasn't trying to get in your world.
I wasn't over here man spreading.

237
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:39,070
I'm just saying doing that,
it's literally like becoming a comedian,

238
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:41,950
posting something on the Internet and
then you're going to get upset when

239
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,950
someone just tears the hell out of
it and says you absolutely stink.

240
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,950
And it's just like, well, you
know, you're not a victim here.

241
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
You're the guy who posted your,

242
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,210
you're the person who decided to get up
on stage and people are going to judge

243
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:56,810
you. That's all I'm saying. And I think
that women that do that type of stuff,

244
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,270
I don't think because there's so young,

245
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:04,271
I don't think they understand the level
of f and lunatic that is out there.

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,310
I don't even understand that
because women get it way worse.

247
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,110
So to go out there and sit there,

248
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:11,660
I mean that's like when you order the
frigging alligator farm and the dangling

249
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,690
those frigging chickens over the thing
and all the crops go in the water.

250
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,340
You're out of your mind.

251
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,990
Uh,
well I understand your points,

252
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,610
but I still think that people
should post what they want to post.

253
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,410
It's their license

254
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,950
roll the dice that you were in the herd
of people showing most of their boobs. I,

255
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,780
I mean, you're not going to get
flipped peoples. Yeah, I do.

256
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:39,220
Because I don't think that you should
be living your life and in fear of what

257
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:42,670
could happen or what might happen
because of that was the case.

258
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:45,370
I wouldn't leave the house.
I'm not talking about going after a dream.

259
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,900
I'm talking about keeping your
ass crack and your pants. Well,

260
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:55,150
I respectfully disagree,
but the thing is,

261
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,760
oh, we're going to have a problem when
so and so gets to be a certain age.

262
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,890
You don't, you dare tell her
that that's going to be okay.

263
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,840
We'll see that without it. No,
no, I, no, it's your daughter now.

264
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,674
It's not okay.

265
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,970
I recognize the hypocrisy in this,
but I would be like,

266
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:13,420
please don't post that
type of stuff on there,

267
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:16,060
but I also know that I,

268
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,390
at a certain point I'm not going to
be able to control what she does.

269
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:23,980
She's not going to be sitting here
watching cartoons. What do you mean?

270
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,863
What does that mean?

271
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,740
You know, beyond a certain point. I
mean, what, what, what, what age is that?

272
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,880
What are we talking about here?

273
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,230
When she's 80 and she's an adult,
I'm not going to just, he isn't.

274
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,540
If we could what you thought your, your
18 hours, the logos, you're not an adult,

275
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,720
right? Oh, you're not okay.

276
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,570
You and I get a divorce and I'm with
an 18 year old. What? She's an adult.

277
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,070
You're going to be like, she's a shy. Oh
my God, I would kill you. I kill myself.

278
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:56,820
But yeah, just because I lost you. Oh God.

279
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,410
Oh, say that no more
romantic. Little enough.

280
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,400
Sweet nothings. I don't even know how
to be romantic, do I not to be romantic?

281
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,790
Um, Oh, you know what romance is?

282
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,120
You're not, you're like a generous
like sweetheart, but like romantic. No,

283
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,520
I wouldn't say that your romantic,
but I wouldn't argue with that.

284
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:23,600
You like romantic things you
like like music, like dancing,

285
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:26,300
like in the middle of the house.
Like you like to do stuff like that.

286
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:30,380
I want to take you to Frankie
valley out here in La. Marque first.

287
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,090
Yeah.
Oh boy.

288
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,010
Can I have a jersey boy
and I have a date mistress.

289
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,400
Someone that totally platonic.

290
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:44,570
Just somebody that I bring to
all the stuff that I want to go.

291
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,910
You want to find like a 50 year old
white woman to take to stuff like that.

292
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,050
Why you got to bring race into it?
Yeah,

293
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,310
because I mean they'll go see Fall
Frankie Valli heavy. C'Mon lets me,

294
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,150
are you kidding me?
I maybe my mom would go,

295
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,690
where'd she go? I take her. You
wouldn't take my mom. I wouldn't go.

296
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,010
I love you mom.
I'll go in a minute.

297
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,280
You got some probably have a really nice
time. You know, just too good to be true.

298
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:14,850
You don't want to see that dude. He's in
his eighties he's still kills it, right?

299
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,940
Yeah. That's the guy
from Jersey Boys, right?

300
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,820
Georgia.
Even though what?

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,910
On never laid a hand on you as the door.

302
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,600
So anyway, back to the
question. 1 million module,

303
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,860
my Neil's perspective,
my Neil's perspective isn't that,

304
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,210
is that you're not doing anything
wrong by thirst trapping on Instagram,

305
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,860
but you should know that that's going
to come with a change in how you're

306
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:47,650
perceived. And yes, they
are. Here's the thing.

307
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,810
If I had a girlfriend who was hot single
and she was feeling really good about

308
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:55,390
herself and she was posting,
you know, sexy photos,

309
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,200
I would be one of the first ones being
like, yes, bitch, get it. Oh my God.

310
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:02,890
Amazing what? Get it. Get your life.

311
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,930
Just get everything. What is
that? That, yes girl show you.

312
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,770
But if bill, are you doing, if I saw
that bill was lacking all of her photos,

313
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,410
I might be like,
now wait just a minute.

314
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,060
So that's just the reality.
Yeah.

315
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,010
All right. Let's see. I've, I've
finally got my abs. Like I finally,

316
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,540
I didn't have to go on the road for,
you know,

317
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,350
and just ruin everything that I got.
I get my abs back and I start,

318
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:29,160
I start posting shirtless photos
cause I feel good about my,

319
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,970
I'd be like, yes, yes, yes.

320
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,780
Yeah I would, but yeah, and when
I have a problem with women,

321
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,220
but women already like

322
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,890
are looking for you and trying to
like put it out there. I've seen it.

323
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,100
I see your comments ladies.
My remarks.

324
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,750
That's one of the funniest things you've
ever said. Just no, I'm watching it.

325
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:53,480
I've never had that attention
ever. Uh, it's been happening.

326
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,370
Perhaps you have a notice it,
but it happens.

327
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,830
It doesn't count when you
get to where I'm at now.

328
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,670
What do you mean it doesn't count?
It counts when you nobody.

329
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,230
That means you good looking above
a sudden you start selling tickets.

330
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,400
Hey Baby.
Hey Baby.

331
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,270
I was just like, that doesn't mean
anything. Look how good she's been.

332
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,180
You liked me when I was broke.
I did.

333
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,100
I fell in love with you when you were
broke. It was a great time. You know.

334
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:22,350
I got you.
I was thirst trapping.

335
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,550
That was going to say something else.
Oh nanny.

336
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,673
Um,

337
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,860
all right, well I'll agree to disagree
on those photos. I mean I think you know

338
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,560
what people are.
Yeah,

339
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,240
it's just like you were in inviting like
I would love this gotta be something up

340
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,360
there. Somebody in law enforcement
and stories and all of that.

341
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,010
This stuff that dude, these people
are, I like, people are lunatics now.

342
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,430
Like people will already nuts but this
like this computer with all of this stuff

343
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:58,720
that you can look at like you couldn't
do like, you know what I mean?

344
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,030
Like down the look back in the day,
Nia,

345
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,730
if you had like a crush it
somebody on work. I mean,

346
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:08,320
you needed your imagination when you
went home to conjure up some sort of fit.

347
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:13,321
Now you just go to their Instagram page
and just sit there like an absolute void

348
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,640
or it's not even considered voyeurism
anymore. Right. And you just sit there,

349
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:19,420
it's weird.
The whole thing is weird.

350
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,420
And he'd go further down and then their
pictures out enough and then you need

351
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,410
video.
And then the video like God,

352
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,580
he's just some weird thing the way she
like cracks and egg when she's just

353
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:29,290
showing you how to make uh, uh, uh,

354
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,440
over easy egg or something and you get
all of this psycho world and then what

355
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:36,370
happens is you get so into that virtual
world that if you ever asked her out and

356
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:39,280
she actually approached you,
you then have a performance,

357
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:43,690
a prob problem because it's, it's too
intimate. Cause he used to this stuff,

358
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:47,970
this thing, there is a disease
and you know, I, I'm, I'm, I'm,

359
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,920
I'm not judging anybody cause
I felt the ramifications of it,

360
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:55,040
you know what I mean? Trying to lay
off the, uh, the, the, the, the,

361
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,260
the bad stuff on there. If you know
what yeah, it's, you know, it's, yeah,

362
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,350
it's just too easy. So I'm
just saying, I don't know.

363
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,890
You know, you don't mean yet.
I'm liberal and conservative.

364
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,340
I'm conservative when it comes to this.
You are conservative when a car is,

365
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:13,630
you know, last call at a bar.
I get a little liberal and
that hasn't, what do you,

366
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,120
what is ty man? Like? What is to
a, um, do you realize that it's,

367
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:23,020
it's 12 noon in Japan
right now, man. Oh, Jesus.

368
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,580
Okay.
All right ladies as a door do.

369
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,580
Hi. How you doing buddy? You were so good.

00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,223
Excellent.

372
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,100
You watch him? Pj Masks. Pj Mask.

373
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:44,170
It's the PGA math.

374
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,690
I don't know what she said,
but she said no masks.

375
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Yeah.
Can you say hi baby?

376
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,090
No, no. There's no baby
there. Say Hi baby.

377
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,130
All right. This is my favorite word
she learned all week. Hello? Hey. Hey.

378
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,303
Football.

379
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,620
Football.

380
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,280
Okay.

381
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,120
You say football?

382
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,820
She just kissed the microphone. Can
you say football? Football. Football.

383
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:31,850
I love it. It's two separate
words. Can you say hockey for sure?

384
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,400
Can you see hockey? Yeah. Kashi.

385
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,340
What else? What else did
you teach her? Score.

386
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,610
All right, let me, I gotta

Some advertisement.

And other weeds.
Hold my hand.

392
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,000
All right. Oh No. Pop,
pop, pop, puppy dog.

393

No dog. That's right. You're

394
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,190
Yeah. Yeah. Alright, here we go. Four
reads everybody. Hey. Hey Nini? Okay,

397
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,330
For any smokers out there trying to
quit or if you know someone who is,

398
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,800
there's a revolutionary way to
quit called zero zero, zero.

399
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,990
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Zeroes.

400
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:50,991
Quick Kit is a new quilting solution
proven to increase your chances of kicking

401
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:56,160
the habit by up to four times
compared to going cold Turkey.

402
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,080
In your own words. Oh sorry.
Capital letters words.

403
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:06,420
Talk about your experience or experience
of someone you know who was trying to

404
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,100
quit smoking.
Ah Man.

405
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:10,890
I remember there was this guy and
he was trying to quit smoking,

406
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:15,630
but he couldn't do it cause it
was too hard. And then he died.

407
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,580
Uh,
no he didn't.

408
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:20,910
He's still lift and he eventually
quit and I think he went cold Turkey.

409
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,280
I don't know why these people
want me to tell you that. Anyways,

410
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:28,281
how many times did you slash they try
before you slash they were finally

411
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:31,500
successful. He tried
a lot. A lot of times.

412
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,570

that includes prescription
medication, nicotine,

414
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:45,570
gum, and continued support
through a mobile app.

415
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:50,320
Dare I say this is like
the blitzkrieg. Oh, it's c.

416
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,500
Okay.

417
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,210
Atlanta. Jesus. I almost forgot
the last way. How would you do it?

418
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,440
Okay.

419
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,750
Well the English Channel
said there ain't off.

420
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:00,080
How the hell would you do the rest of it?

421
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,500
How are you going to get him on
lending and a walk across the water?

422
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,960
How are you going to bring up? How are
you bring up that person during this read?

423
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,900
I don't think I didn't get done what
he did. He had a hell of a battle plan.

424
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,530
I don't think your advertisers,
Hey Rick,

425
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,170
I think we would have rolled right past
it. He brought it up. Here's how it works.

426
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:21,940
Go to quit with zero.com to
start your online doctor visit.

427
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,770
After your five minute visit,

428
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:28,510
a physician will then determine if
you're eligible to use the quick kit.

429
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,310
If you're eligible, like they're going
to say no, the doctor will prescribe.

430
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:34,150
We don't want money.

431
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:39,510
We'll prescribe your medication and the
quick kit will be shipped directly to

432
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:44,340
your door. Why is that so hard
to say? Quick Kit zero zero,

433
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,370
zero will cost less than what the average
smoker spends on cigarettes and less

434
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:53,070
than other quitting options.
Yeah. How come? Well,

435
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,170
how expensive our cigarettes now per pack,
Nia.

436
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,923
Oh,

437
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,030
I thought you were one of those bad girls.
Smoke it in the board room

438
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,370
lies, uh, go to quick with Zen.

439
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:11,740
Quit was zero.com/bar
and for a limited time,

440
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,770
my listeners can get their first month
of quit kit to stop smoking for just $37.

441
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:22,021
That's quit with zero.com/sorry B
U R R is all in capital letters.

442
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:24,640
One more time.
Hey,

443
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
quit with xero.com/indochino talk.

444
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,200
Nia.
Talk about how every man looks better in,

445
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:36,170
feels more confident when he puts on
his suit. Could you do that for me?

446
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,880
Every man looks better and it feels
more confident when they put on a suit.

447
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,340
What does it do to you
when you see me in a suit?

448
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,620
When you see Mike Pasty Body March,

449
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,863
Huh?

450
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,160
No, you look great in a suit. You know,
I like the whole habit dash. Yeah,

451
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,030
I like that whole look. I like
bottom. I like a three piece suit.

452
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:03,550
I like a nice tie. Good shoes, nice
socks, good trousers. Does that,

453
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:04,384
uh,

454
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:09,190
does that increase my chances later on
of getting some sort of physical contact

455
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:12,100
with the consensual? Of
course, yes. Consensual.

456
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,760
In the old days I could just tie you
down with my neck tie and that would have

457
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:20,530
been fine. But that was considered
working it out amongst yourselves.

458
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,150
Oh my God. They're like in Japan or
something. That's all right. Yeah, no,

459
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,050
definitely. And I definitely like it
when you wear a suit. Visit a stylist.

460
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,870
What if I wore one of the bedroom tonight?
Just showed up. That's weird though,

461
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:36,250
because that's not, I would like that
if I just showed up in a suit. Yeah.

462
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,640
Really? Yeah. And you were
like the businessman. Oh boy.

463
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,240
And then they gave you the business.

464
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,920
Yes. Okay. This bit.
This man giving me the

465
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,860
business.
All right.

466
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,090
It looks like somebody's gonna be doing
some business with Indochino. Alright. Uh,

467
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,720
visit a stylist at our showroom and have
them take your measurements personally

468
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:59,970
or measure at home,
uh,

469
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:04,971
yourself and shop online@indochino.com
choose your fabric inside and out.

470
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:09,480
Honey.
Choose your design customization.

471
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,790
Submit your measurements
with your choices.

472
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,150
Relax while your suit gets professionally
tailored and mailed to you in a couple

473
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,040
of weeks. Really folded up
like a frigging pocket square.

474
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,600
Just watch as the complements rolled
in. Oh my God. Look at your package.

475
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,220
November is November is black Friday.

476
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,140

month. Wow. You get a month in a day.

Even our kid knows that was messed up.

478
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,250
Hey,

that day after Thanksgiving when, uh,

482
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,140

arrested for apple from all races,

483
00:30:00,141 --> 00:30:03,900
trample each other and in
a department store, no gay,

484
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,600

that should be on the discovery channel.

485
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:11,660
It's like they should do be doing it.
You know when the Serengeti,

486
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:15,170
when the water starts drying up and all
of a sudden you know you're a zebra and

487
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:18,320
you're taking a drink next to an alligator
and there's a line on the other side

488
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:19,154
of you.

489
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,130
It's like those mob movies when they tried
to have a truce and then somebody you

490
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:25,400
know every like somebody
screws it up. Oh, I'm sorry.

491
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:30,170
That was the professional I
should've said. Oh, all right.

66% of men lose their hair by age 35

507
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,250
or if you are a certain red headed
comedian a little bit before them.

is when you start to notice hair loss.
It's too late.

510

It's easier to keep the hair you have
then replaced the hair you've lost.

511
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,983
I ask you,

Hims connects you with rail does.
Have you been with Kimmy that good Lord?

520

That's definitely not true.

521
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,700
That's right. You came up in the
Michael Jordan era, didn't ya?

522
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,560
When people weren't even bald,

they wanted to be like Mike. All right,

Ex girlfriend's sister. He
Billy Birkenstocks stocks. Uh,

593
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:38,860
I'm 26.
Um,

594
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,440
and still in love with my
high school sweetheart.

595
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:46,060
We've been on and off again for 10 years
and I've gone through a lot to say the

596
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:47,500
least. Jesus Christ. Yes.

597
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,960
I just got back from a two week vacation
with her where everything was perfect

598
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,640
and we had the time of our lives.

599
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,210
This is the woman I want to start a
family with and it became more and more

600
00:37:58,211 --> 00:38:01,750
apparent on this trip.
Congratulations. What could go wrong?

601
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,320
Um,
here's the thing.

602
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,200
I slept with her sister on a drunken
blacked out night three years ago while me

603
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:16,170
and her,
we're not together and we're on bad terms.

604
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,160
Oh boy. Who? Billy.

605
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:24,670
My heart was broken and I had a lot
of resentment. I was 23 drunk week.

606
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,060
If shut the fuck up dude,
you had a dick.

607
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,220
You fucking jerked off to her while
you were dating her other sit. Stick.

608
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,400
Get the fuck Outta here. Don't fucking
come at me. I got a dick too. All right.

609
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:40,960
Don't fuck. And our younger
sister came on to me. Oh my God,

610
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:45,310
you victim. Things were different
then and I was a mess. Listen,

611
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:47,780
I'm not saying you weren't
fucking heartbroken. You A, yeah,

612
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:51,190
you were fucking psych the next
day. There you go. You know what?

613
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,440
You just got to check off a whole family.

614
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,420
Well, you got to love to do
is bang their mother. Um,

615
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,050
okay.

616
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,940
That's got to be called something
like the Grand Slam. You know,

617
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:08,160
like when tiger woods won four in a row
and they were saying he won the grand

618
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:09,160
state, you won, you won.

619
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:14,080
All four majors would be if you bang
the mother and all the daughters,

620
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,190
that would be the Grand Slam. Uh, the
amount of guys. Laughter right now.

621
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,610
Why the women are pissed.
Uh, well a year or so later,

622
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,580
me and my high school sweet,

623
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:27,220
he started talking again and started to
become close leading up to where it is

624
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:30,820
now. I had an unbelievable guilt for
what I did with their sister. The,

625
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,460
the closer me and this
girl got years later.

626
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,300
It is the only thing that I haven't been
honest with her about and I had to tell

627
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:40,030
her, you fucking idiot. No you didn't.
You should have talked to your sister.

628
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,860
And just, there'd been like,
look, what are we gonna do here?

629
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,663
You know,

630
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,620
is it, is it good? How does it make
things better that you told her

631
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,220
that's such as [inaudible] and then like
for the rest of their fucking lives,

632
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:59,010
that's going to be a problem
between the two of them. Ah, Jesus,

633
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:04,770
you shouldn't have said Shit and just
waited till 20 years later when the sister

634
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,000
who never got married gets
fucking hammered and yeah,
yeah. Well I fuck jasmine.

635
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:12,030
25 years ago. And at that point, you know,
what are you going to do? He'd be like,

636
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:15,810
yeah, it was, dude, I was in the fucking
two thousands. What do you want from me

637
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,323
anyways?

638
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,530
Okay.

639
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,710
He goes, uh, well a year or so
later me and in the high school,

640
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,530
sweet start talking again, blah, blah,
blah, blah. I had an unbelievable guilt.

641
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,190
MMM.

642
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,640
So I had to test sold the
last night of our vacation.

643
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,810
Okay.

644
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:36,020
Oh my God. We were laying in
bed and I told her everything.

645
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,830
Okay.

646
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,180
I took a slap.

647
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:44,340
She was crying for hours and it was
his ugly. As you can imagine. Well,

648
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:48,800
you know what dude, I commend you. You
got it off your fucking chest. He goes,

649
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:52,880
I feel terrible. And I'm torn on if
it was the right decision to tell her,

650
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,560
my friends are giving me mixed answers
and I would like an outside perspective

651
00:40:57,561 --> 00:40:59,900
from someone who I respect greatly.

652
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,933
Uh,

653
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,550
oh Jesus Christ. I appreciate
the respect me. Um,

654
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:05,320
okay.

655
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,621
I don't know.

656
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:08,140
Do you know if it was really bugging
you and you felt like you had to tell a

657
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:09,220
good good?
You told her,

658
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,933
you know,

659
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,920
now you don't have to worry about that
fucking thing coming out of nowhere.

660
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,030
He goes, it is still fresh and
everything is confusing. On what is next.

661
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,570
We love each other very much,
but obviously I fucked up big time.

662
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,290
Do you think this relationship stands
a chance? I really hope it does,

663
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,520
but I'm worried I ruined it.

664
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,810
She seems to be getting through it
better than I thought after her first

665
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:34,120
reaction. She me, she loves me, but

666
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,140
I really harder and she needs
some space because when I'm, well,

667
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,900
she needs some space. I hope
you don't have a brother. Right?

668
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,480
Because when I'm with her,

669
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,430
okay,

670
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,600
okay.
She told me she loves me,

671
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:51,480
but I really hurt her and she needs
some space because when I'm with her,

672
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:52,560
she can't be mad at me.

673
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:55,530
I'm not a scumbag and this is completely
out of character for me to do.

674
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,140
I just made a terrible mistake.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

675
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,580
I will say the fact that you actually
feel this level of guilt, um,

676
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,420
uh, you're a better man than me
cause I wouldn't have said Shit.

677
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,800
I just would've just been like,
well,

678
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:10,690
I hope this doesn't fucking
come out someday. Well,

679
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,370
we're having a pumpkin
pie over thanksgiving. Uh,

680
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:16,290
and I bet there's a lot of people
out there that live with that secret.

681
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:20,940
My thing is not only the cowardly self
preservation that I would try to have,

682
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:25,590
I would also,
I'm also thinking like

683
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,340
this is, I, I would have
handled that situation.

684
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:35,370
I either wouldn't have said shit or I
would just break up with her and just walk

685
00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:38,380
away from it because

686
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,090
I wouldn't say, Hey, by the way,

687
00:42:42,091 --> 00:42:44,970
I banged your sister and then
for the rest of their life,

688
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:47,730
they have to fucking deal with that.
Um,

689
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,480
yeah.

690
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,070
When I'm the piece of shit that did it.

691
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:56,071
But I have to commend you that you
actually felt that level of guilt and said

692
00:42:56,111 --> 00:42:57,700
something, uh, because I, I don't know.

693
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,940
So it sounds to me that
you're going to get past it.

694
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:07,630
So the good thing is that now you don't
have to worry about that fucking grand

695
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:12,650
piano fall crashing down on
your fucking life someday.

696
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,600
So that's the upside.

697
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,643
Okay.

698
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,340
MMM.

699
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:23,470
Maybe there's an upside that you told
her where she'll have faith in you that

700
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:28,940
like, wow, this guy actually
feels guilt about stuff like that.

701
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:33,740
So I can't trust them. We were
broken up while it happened. Um,

702
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,130
you know, let me see if I can get Nia
in here for this one. Hang on a second.

703
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,960
All right. The magic of the pause
button again. The lovely Nia is here.

704
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,140
Hi. Hey, how you doing? Right?

705
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,040
Ex girlfriend's sister. Oh,
Jesus. All right. Really quickly,

706
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,370
this guy. All right. I'll
give the abridged version A.

707
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:53,450
I've been on and off again for 10 years.

708
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:56,360
Just got back from a two week vacation
with her. Everything was perfect.

709
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,830
We had the time of our lives. This is the
woman I want to start a family with. A,

710
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:01,551
here's the thing.

711
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:04,730
I slept with a sister and a drunk and
blacked out night three years ago while we

712
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:07,040
met, while, uh, while we,

713
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:10,820
me and her were not together and we're
on bad terms. My heart was broken.

714
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:11,690
I had a lot of resentment.

715
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,200
I was 23 drunk week and her
youngest sister came on to me.

716
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,320
Oh no, that's right. That's a
rough one. Was a real rough.

717
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:27,440
You like how he makes himself the victim.
She came onto me. Okay. I said, really?

718
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:31,400
I said, dude, I have a dick too fucking
lie to me. Exactly. I stopped it.

719
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,280
I said, you rubbed one out
to her before you fucking

720
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,940
yes. The seeds of implanted for a
while that you've been whining a fuck.

721
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,760
The sister don't try to act
like, oh, I was so heartbroken.

722
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,980
You and the sister are both dirty.

723
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,790
Okay, so here's the deal. He
goes, he felt hard, terrible.

724
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,710
The last night of the vacation.
He couldn't deal with the
guilt, so he told her,

725
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:58,940
he goes, I tell, he goes, I took a slap.
She was crying for hours and it was ugly,

726
00:44:58,941 --> 00:45:03,230
as you can imagine. All right.
She told me she loves me,

727
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:06,830
but I really hurt her and she needs some
space because when I'm with with her,

728
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:08,180
she can't be mad at me.

729
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,600
I'm not a scumbag and this is completely
out of character for me to do.

730
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:14,750
I just made a terrible mistake.
So he's basically saying,

731
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,680
do you think the relationship stands
a chance? I really hope it does,

732
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:19,940
but I'm worried I ruined it.

733
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,870
She seems to be getting through it better
than I thought. After a first reaction,

734
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,800
what do you think? It's not going to
happen. You fucked her sister. It's over.

735
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,750
That's anything.
So

736
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,490
yeah,
because I mean maybe,

737
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:36,810
maybe there are some people who are
more emotionally evolved than I am,

738
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,120
but I couldn't get that.
Like that's her sister.

739
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:42,810
Like her sister is not going anywhere
and like how's it going to be at like

740
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,080
Thanksgiving and Christmas and
like all that kind of stuff.

741
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:49,500
Like you're just going to avoid each
other or just kind of like, it's weird.

742
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,130
I mean maybe the three of
them can have a threesome. No,

743
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,510
what I was thinking you can't, you
can't have a threesome with your sister.

744
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:03,030
That's disgusting.
That's gross.

745
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,550
I would never want to see
each other on these bond.

746
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:12,210
Yeah. Talking to each other. Hey,
I know we went to a waterpark.

747
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,220
Oh No,
stop.

748
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Unless the three of them sit down and
both the guy and the sister are so

749
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:23,530
repentant and so whatever,
but like you,

750
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:27,660
you'd never be able to trust them.
You'd never know. He like, Oh yeah,

751
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,860
can you guys run out and like, you know,
get some extra sugar and more groceries.

752
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,620
Exactly. So, and that's the thing.
She might be okay with him now,

753
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,800
but in the end she's going to choose
her sister like that no matter how her

754
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:48,270
sister betrayed her. That's the
sister. So you are disposable.

755
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,060
You're just like the
dude that's her family.

756
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,910
So if you think that you really like
the hands on to her and the sister, yes,

757
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,330
sister will probably get past it.
Like I have a long,

758
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:03,210
long ways from now and it'll
probably always still be there,

759
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:07,780
but because their family family betrays
each other all the time, you know? No.

760
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:13,000
Here's the thing. I think what she did
was worse than what he did, the sister.

761
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,100
Oh definitely. If we're going to like
put them on, who was the worst person?

762
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:21,250
That situation?
The sister 100% here's what I learned.

763
00:47:21,251 --> 00:47:25,610
You never do that if you're
with a woman. Okay, okay,

764
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,130
you guys break up and blah blah blah.
If her sister comes on you like

765
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,720
you are effectively ending that
relationship forever. Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,990
And what do you think he should, they
told her, her and the relationship.

767
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:39,010
You think he should have told her?

768
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,000
The thing about it is,

769
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,950
is that he told her
because he felt guilty.

770
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,130
So it was to unburden his own conscious
because it wasn't real because there's

771
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:56,740
nothing in telling her that would
make her feel better and oh my God,

772
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:59,590
thank you so much for being
honest with me. That's the sister.

773
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,110
So I don't know.
I don't really know nothing,

774
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,440
nothing compatible that he had such guilt
that he had to tell her. Not really,

775
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:12,280
because people are bored with shielding
all the time and they like, oh,

776
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:16,090
I just had to get it off my chest.
And it's like, great, congratulations.

777
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:18,070
It's off your chest.
And now I feel shitty.

778
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,950
So was that really for
me or was that for you?

779
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,480
Near Renee Hill coming
in and bringing the law?

780
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:31,420
Yeah, I, I don't, I don't, I'm
not with that whole like, well,

781
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:34,420
at least he was honest with
you. It's like, for what?

782
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:39,190
For me now that was all for him to,
I never looked at it that way.

783
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:44,170
Wow. Yeah. Not that I don't think
apologies are worthwhile or I don't,

784
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,040
I,
it's not like,

785
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,860
I don't think that you should
apologize for something you did wrong,

786
00:48:47,861 --> 00:48:50,800
but I just feel like you really need to
question. That's what you were saying.

787
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:51,310
Yeah.

788
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:56,050
You really need to question
your motivations for
confessing something of this

789
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:59,770
level. You know what I mean? It's
like what are you really trying to do?

790
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:02,650
A lot of times people are just
trying to unburden themselves.

791
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,271
Well that's what I was saying,

792
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:07,750
that the best thing now is he got it out
there so he doesn't have to worry about

793
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:10,710
that grand piano coming crashing
down into his life someday.

794
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,120
Like get the same way they haven't
like fucking Thanksgiving dinner.

795
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:18,400
What I want to know is what is going
on between the girl and the sister?

796
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,560
Cause obviously that's no sister.
That's no real. I don't know.

797
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,150
That's what I'm working on.
Something else.

798
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:30,151
Why that's fucked up is because
now you know that the parents know.

799
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,830
You know, you think she would have told
the parents like mom, what if they know?

800
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:40,750
Yeah. And then they got to be
like, oh my God, we raised a whore

801
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,580
and I don't think that she's a whore.
She's at a horse person.

802
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,760
But you will make mistakes.
But that's really, yeah,
that's issued. No, no, that's,

803
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:53,230
that's beyond, that's a power
thing yet it is total power. It is.

804
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:57,550
I wonder if this was a younger
sister and I wonder like who knows?

805
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:59,560
But that's what I'm more
intrigued about now.

806
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:04,480
It's like what's going to happen with
these sisters? You know, that's like,

807
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,990
that's some deep shit right there.
So I don't know.

808
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,690
That's like a power thing on
her thing saying like, you know,

809
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,630
as much as you're into her, you still
can't fucking resist me. What is it?

810
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,050
Yeah,
maybe so because who does that?

811
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:20,350
Who goes after the lettuce
into the female mind?

812
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,830
I can't let you in on that.
That's not a female thing.

813
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:28,040
That's like a dirty ass
ho bitch, nasty person. I

814
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,120
don't know what that's like.
I would never go after, uh,

815
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:36,200
relatives like significant other.
So where do you draw the line?

816
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,180
What do you mean coworker?

817
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,473
So you're not

818
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,490
just so the people know because you
really have strong opinions on this.

819
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:49,230
So I want to know too. So
family obviously. Yeah. No,
you don't do that. No fee.

820
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:54,820
If the person that is clearly
in a relationship with
somebody else and you know

821
00:50:57,241 --> 00:50:59,040
that all of that together,
I want to know

822
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,050
no where you draw the line coworker.
Okay.

823
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,980
You guys occasionally have lunch together
with the sisters. Coworker. Yeah.

824
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,230
And there's something the guy's got like,
he does like the,

825
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:12,030
the Paisley tie with the suspenders.

826
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:16,240
You know that you guys always
go nuts about that. No belts.

827
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:21,420
Yeah. Well if you have suspenders, you
don't need a belt. So, but anyway, um,

828
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,760
what if he has both suspenders and a
belt and then you think like what it is

829
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:30,200
that you're trying to do? Well, maybe
how would you have both when that,

830
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:34,290
when that like get that thing, that
female thing would like, you'd feel safe.

831
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:36,000
Like this guy's really going to have,

832
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,460
like he's going to have
an alarm system and a gun.

833
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,870
Yeah. I'm not a sword. And
where to condoms. Yeah. No,

834
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,200
I dunno about that. Yeah, no,
I mean if they're not involved,

835
00:51:47,201 --> 00:51:49,730
if they're not like in a
real relationship neighbors.

836
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,860
Yeah, Babe, would you bang a neighbor
when I Bang like my sister's neighbor. Oh,

837
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:59,100
not your sisters. Now we've taken
family out of it. I'm saying where,

838
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:04,130
where is the line where it's just
like, well whatever bitch, you know,

839
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,010
is it that you guys say you put
the hand up, whatever bitch,

840
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,340
what are you talking about? I'm saying,
cause you're saying like that's family.

841
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:14,940
You can't fucking do that. I was just
trying to find a comedic angle here. No,

842
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:19,470
I see what you mean.
I mean neighbor two streets over.

843
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,450
Your neighbor knew them,
invited you over and you went over there.

844
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:27,540
You know what? I have a real life example
of the guy. The guy was an architect.

845
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,600
Okay. All right, I got it. Um,

846
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,790
I have a real life example
of this. During, yeah,

847
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:38,660
during my prom I went my senior prom.
I love somebody else already.

848
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:42,390
Yup. Wait a minute. I went with
somebody who was just a friend. Okay.

849
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,760
But my friend has biz
Markie he was just threat.

850
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:49,303
Um,

851
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,440
but my friend went to the prom with this
guy that she had just met and they were

852
00:52:55,231 --> 00:52:58,440
set up by another friend.
He went to a different school.

853
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,250
So they didn't really like
know each other. The job was
the day of justification.

854
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,620
They was set up by friends.
So I'm totally innocent.

855
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:12,650
So when you say really we really connected
during prom and like as you know,

856
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,810
that was not what happened. As you
know, my prom did not end that great.

857
00:53:18,811 --> 00:53:21,960
My parents like came and like took
me from this house and I was in,

858
00:53:21,961 --> 00:53:24,900
cause I was dumbing up,
wait to tell them the truth.

859
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:28,500
I called my parents because I was supposed
to spend the night at a girlfriend's

860
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:32,670
house, but instead we're going to
be hanging out at this boy's house.

861
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,880
His older sister was there. There was
a whole bunch of us were hanging out.

862
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,120
I was having such a great time that
I called my parents and I said, hey,

863
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:41,370
just so you know,
I'm staying here.

864
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,560
My mom completely flipped out and she and
my step father came and like extracted

865
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:50,700
me from the homes. That's how my prom
ended. Exactly. So it didn't end on any,

866
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:55,340
it was a very traumatic, but ultimately
they did the right thing. Um,

867
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,790
but anyway,
he,

868
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:01,830
me and this guy ended up connecting
and we ended up like dating afterwards,

869
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:06,270
so you know, um, oh that's different. I
thought you were saying that, you know,

870
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,590
like I,
we went in the bathroom,

871
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,810
went to the front part of the Limo
and put the window up. No, no, no, no.

872
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,350
But it wasn't her boyfriend.
They had just met.

873
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,770
I think she definitely felt some
type of way about it. You know,

874
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,340
I'll leave because he chose you over her.
Exactly.

875
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,340
You guys didn't have any sorta
like friendship, friendship? No.

876
00:54:26,341 --> 00:54:30,770
She and I were really good
friends. Yeah. That yet. No, no,

877
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,613
that's not good.

878
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:37,060
Oh, that's a rough one. But it
wasn't a lot of rough, rough one.

879
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,590
And we dated for a while.
We dated up until, you know,

880
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:43,410
like I went to college basically. And
that was, that was the end of that.

881
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:47,100
So it wasn't like this law of the
term, you know, Torrid affair.

882
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,800
It wasn't like he was my
first love or anything.

883
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,510
He was just really cute and a football
player and lights Bob Marley, you know.

884
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:56,010
Hey,
what can I say?

885
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:02,290
SORTA sordid details here. All right,
well that's the podcast for this week.

886
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,140
Um, need, he came hard
this week. You came hard.

887
00:55:05,141 --> 00:55:07,360
You're really fucking just put that
guy. He just said, you know what,

888
00:55:07,361 --> 00:55:09,970
that and that's it. It's a fucking rap.
And you know what? I think you're right.

889
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,070
I think you're right. I can
say that. Yeah. As I said
to him, like thank you. Yes.

890
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:16,143
Yeah.

891
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,770
Hey,
what's going on?

892
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:32,640
It's Belper and it is the Monday
morning podcasts for Monday,

893
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,750
November 15th, 2010. And a,

894
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:41,200
I'm doing this one really,
really, really fucking late. Uh,

895
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:46,180
had to fly back from Columbus this
weekend. Columbus, Ohio. And uh,

896
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,810
before I start the podcast, I want to
thank everyone who came out to my shows.

897
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,520
I had six phenomenal shows out there.
Every damn one of them sold out,

898
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:00,070
people smiling and waving. I was shaking
hands and kissing babies after shows.

899
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:05,610
Everything was great. So I want to thank
everyone who came out. Uh, seriously,

900
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:10,140
man, that was amazing. The, uh, Sun,
even the Sunday shows sold out. So, uh,

901
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,130
yeah, definitely. Um, definitely
going to be back, you know,

902
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,160
cause that's how I do it.
If you show up to my shows,

903
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,890
then I come back to your town. Yeah, no,

904
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,740
the fuck you think I'm
doing this for free.

905
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,580
Paypal only the podcast is free.

906
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,630
Um, but even that, if anything free,

907
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:34,150
there's a price to pay for everything.

908
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:39,130
My girl is fucking pissed at me right
now because my apartment was so god damn

909
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:43,360
quiet until I came home and she was
praying to God that I had already done the

910
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:46,840
podcast and she was asking me, did
you have, did you already do it?

911
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:51,460
They should do it. And I said, no, I have
to do the podcast. And she was just like,

912
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:53,800
gosh,
it's just so nice and quiet.

913
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,880
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
do a more subdued podcasts this week.

914
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:03,220
I'm just fucking with you. I live
to irritate people. All right.

915
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:07,810
So I'm going to be doing it. All right.
What the fuck am I talking about?

916
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:10,720
I just got off the plane. All
right. Back from Columbus.

917
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:14,320
What the fuck do I want to talk about?
I don't fucking know.

918
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:18,760
I'm starting to take pictures of people
sleeping in airports and just some of

919
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:23,500
the fucking faces, you know,
especially on the planes,

920
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,450
when people don't bring those neck braces,

921
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:30,400
you know those people like they're fucking
sue happy people during the day and

922
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:33,380
at night they fly in planes and they
have those little neck braces when,

923
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,750
when people don't have
those, just watching people's
heads, Bob and all around,

924
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:42,460
you know that's a good time to be
obese because he got like that built in

925
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:43,294
neckbrace

926
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,260
big neck brace of fat. You
know, you want a pillow.

927
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:53,800
All you do is just lean your head
45 degrees to the right of the left.

928
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:58,180
You're all good. I bet they never
have any neck pain, you know?

929
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:02,140
But what do they do every fucking week on
the biggest loser sitting there, bitch,

930
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:05,560
Moan and complain it. Oh,
it's so fucking hard. Really?

931
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,980
You have a body temperature pillow
on all four sides of your neck.

932
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:16,150
I know it's round,
but my world,

933
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:21,130
you still have sites. So there you
go. Fatties fat people. I know.

934
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,030
And I know I tease you a lot because
you know what? I'm sick of you.

935
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,830
I'm citizens that you know,

936
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:30,850
there's enough fucking groups out there
that I got to watch what I say that I

937
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:35,260
got to tippy toe around. Okay? I'm not
tick, I'm not fucking add in another one.

938
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,530
All right. I've added up to here
with the fucking tippy toe and

939
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,640
God damn bastards lay off the fudge.
Um,

940
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,810
I first realized though,

941
00:58:48,811 --> 00:58:52,750
I thought of control when I went to fall
asleep on the plane and I felt like I

942
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:57,010
was laying on a cloud and I
realized it was part of my neck.

943
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,500
Jesus, how fucking cranky am I
when I get off a God damn plane?

944
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,810
Um,
anyways,

945
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,620
I was a good boy out in
Columbus as far as boozing goes.

946
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:13,480
I did not booze as far as eating
goes. I did all right. You know,

947
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,690
you know so fucking funny is when you
go to the Goddamn Midwest and you try to

948
00:59:16,691 --> 00:59:21,510
ask people, where can I get
something healthy to eat like that?

949
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,400
There's no such thing as
healthy food in the Midwest.

950
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,520
They don't even fucking understand it.
You know,

951
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:33,620
all they know how to do is to have some
big block headed fucking blonde haired

952
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:38,120
kid come out of that
Goddamn wife's fucking Twat,

953
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,490
right?
They don't even raise them.

954
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:44,420
They just send them out in a fucking
cornfields and just, just have the kid,

955
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:47,870
the kid grazes until these
fucking 16 all right?

956
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:50,870
Then they signed them up for
pop Warner fucking football.

957
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:56,290
They can't even find a helmet to fit
his big fucking big 10 goddamn put your

958
00:59:56,571 --> 01:00:01,490
block of a fucking head.
Right? And then what happens?

959
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,160
Some piece of shit can't beat him.
So what do they do?

960
01:00:04,161 --> 01:00:07,820
They fucking crack one of the crack
back block, whatever the fuck they take.

961
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:11,540
His fucking needs out.
All right.

962
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,730
His dreams over.
He's not going to block for Jim Plunkett.

963
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,770
It's fucking over.
So then what?

964
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,030
He gets a job at a fucking hotel
desk and here I come walking in,

965
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,200
you know the fucking Pussy,
California boy now going, oh,

966
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,680
excuse me,
is there a place to get something healthy?

967
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:35,730
And these fucking people there, their
eyes cross. I said, this all, I says,

968
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,600
you know, I'm really craving a stake
does. Is there a place to get a steak?

969
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:41,120
And I don't mean like an Applebees steak,
you know what I mean?

970
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:44,420
I'm talking cloth Napkins.
I'm talking, you know,

971
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:49,421
somebody related to a Rockefeller sitting
at the bar sipping on some God damn

972
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:53,930
old booze talking to a broad 70
years younger than him. That's,

973
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,150
that's the kind of fucking place
I want to go to. All right,

974
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,610
that's what I want to go to. And you know
what? This fucking God damn idiot sends.

975
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,830
He sends me to some fucking
barbecue shack. I walking
towards it like, you know,

976
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:07,491
I don't have a car.

977
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:12,350
So I'm walking around the hotel and
as I'm walking towards the complex,

978
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:16,400
he told me to go to one of the first
red flags I saw was a neon sign.

979
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:17,541
All right.

980
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:21,440
We got any steak eaters out there who
listened to this fucking podcast? Yeah,

981
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,430
the like a quality steak.
Do you like going to a quality place?

982
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:30,380
Exactly. Now, have you ever
seen a fucking neon sign?

983
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,270
Neon signage?

984
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:37,690
Does Peter Luger's have neon
signage? I don't think so. Huh?

985
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:42,320
Smith and Wollensky now it's
always supposed to look stuffy.

986
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,300
It's supposed to look like this.

987
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:49,301
Politicians in there doing fucking
dirty backdoor deals for fucking defense

988
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:52,910
contracts. That's what it's
supposed to look like. All right.

989
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:59,960
Fucking guys in suits.
That's what it's supposed to look like.

990
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:01,850
And I come walking into this and you know,

991
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,850
I don't have enough time before the show,
so I just say fuck it.

992
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:05,870
And I go over there,
right?

993
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,630
And I walk into this barbecue joint
and if you guys have listened to this

994
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:12,680
podcast before, you realize I fucking
hate barbecue. I don't like it.

995
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:17,570
It doesn't taste good. I think the
sauce is just their way of, of,

996
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:22,530
of covering up the fact that you're
eating a very poor cut of meat.

997
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:23,983
You know,

998
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,620
eating the fucking Cartlidge out of a
Goddamn oxen or whatever the hell they do.

999
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:33,750
The piggers sandwich is it really did
you get all the cartilage in there?

1000
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:37,830
You fucking moron. No wonder you got to
slather it with all that smoked Hickory,

1001
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,640
whatever the fire it actually, isn't
that what you cook it with? Whatever,

1002
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:44,640
with all the barbecue sauce.
So I go in there, you know,

1003
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:48,210
and I'm fucking grumbling like
the Goddamn fucking old man I am.

1004
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:53,220
So I open up the menu and I just, you
know, something just pops out at me.

1005
01:02:53,221 --> 01:02:56,460
It's says pulled pork.
They got some uh,

1006
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:00,690
some Broccoli and some beans
and I say, fuck it. You know,

1007
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:05,700
he's cute girl comes over, right? Like the
round is tits I've seen in a long time.

1008
01:03:05,701 --> 01:03:09,750
It was fucking perfectly fucking
round and they weren't fake.

1009
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:12,390
And I was just kept looking at him going,
how are they so fucking round?

1010
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,560
And I was like,
you know what?

1011
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:18,160
She probably has on one of those fucking
Hocus pocus bras. That's what it is.

1012
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,550
She's probably got an eight cup,
possibly a B Cup.

1013
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:25,230
And I don't know what the fuck did
doing the padded, but you know,

1014
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,530
still it was fun to look at.
She,

1015
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:33,550
she had one of those bras that I think
Doug Henning made and master of illusion,

1016
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,380
Doug Henning. Um, he's a magician.

1017
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:40,230
Everybody the big space
in between his teeth,

1018
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:44,220
like that fucking guy used to play for
the giants who's now on television,

1019
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,760
who had a failed Sitcom and I can
never remember his fucking name.

1020
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:50,790
Yeah,
you haven't had something like that.

1021
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:55,791
You just can't remember the fucking
name and the same facial hair as Rosey

1022
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,330
Greer.
The fuck is his name.

1023
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:03,090
One of the great defensive ends
of all time broke the sack record.

1024
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:06,780
Remember that when fucking Brett Farve
curled up into the fetal position because

1025
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:11,010
they were friends. The fuck is his
name. He plays for the goddamn giants.

1026
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:17,820
Ah, Shit. I keep thinking Richard Seymour.

1027
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,590
I know that's the guy that
Patriot shouldn't have
traded the fuck is his name.

1028
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,950
Begins with an s.
There's an s in there somewhere.

1029
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,670
That guy could fucking,

1030
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,800
he could spit a walnut at you between
his two front teeth that even open in his

1031
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:37,320
God damn mouth. Um, anyway,

1032
01:04:37,321 --> 01:04:40,650
so I go in there and I fucking order that
shit and I'm just looking at this girl

1033
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:42,170
with their round tits,
right?

1034
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:45,780
And she brings this stuff over and
they got this little, you know,

1035
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:49,380
they got the Kansas City, which is a
sweet, that's a sweet, sweet or one.

1036
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:52,950
And then you got Carolina's more
vinegar base. And then we got,

1037
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:57,020
we got the fucking Mexican one that's
going to make your eyes water and you nose

1038
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:01,380
run. And then they had one other one, the
Pussy one, right? So I go with the kids,

1039
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:02,700
a city one,
and I got to tell you,

1040
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,630
it was one of the best fucking meals
I've had in a long time. It was absent.

1041
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:10,770
The pork was absolutely delicious.
I loved it.

1042
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:14,490
The beans were phenomenal.
The Broccoli, of course,

1043
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:19,090
had been steaming since they opened the
place because nobody in the Midwest eats

1044
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:24,070
vegetables. They're horrible people, man.
They all got big heads and block Colin's,

1045
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,300
you know, that's why they play
that smash mouth football.

1046
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,390
They're not going to use a spread offense.
They're all fucking clogged up.

1047
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,330
Ah, just fucking around people. I'm
just fucking around. I'm, I'm, I'm,

1048
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:43,270
I'm going on adrenaline here. All right.
I'm going on adrenaline. That's all I got.

1049
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,340
It's all I got this week.
So I actually, I, I,

1050
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:48,740
that's the one time when
I didn't eat well and, uh,

1051
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:52,190
we're going to talk about food this week.
I went to fucking [inaudible], Panorama,

1052
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:55,810
Panorama, fucking Panera bread,
whatever the fuck you call it.

1053
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:01,570
Went in there and I got a
breakfast sandwich. Um, hi.
Sarah can help you down here,

1054
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:05,950

registered, sir. Thank you sir. Hi Sarah.

1055
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:10,650
Can I help you sir? One of those places
where it's like, did somebody drug you,

1056
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:15,580
you know, did Alec Baldwin of
Panera bread come in and scream,

1057
01:06:15,581 --> 01:06:19,810
fuck you at you? You know the
whole Glen Gary, Glen Ross,

1058
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:22,930
and now you're out here with, you know,
just trying to be all fucking happy.

1059
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:28,450
Stop being, you're not that happy. So
anyway, Sarah, can I help you Sarah?

1060
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,130
It's Sarah can help you down here. Can
help the next person down here. Sir,

1061
01:06:31,131 --> 01:06:34,050

I go down. There I go. Let me get a,

1062
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,750
let me get a breakfast sandwich. Okay. We
have our choice between egg and cheese,

1063
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,900
egg, cheese and sausage or
egg, cheese and bacon. I got,

1064
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:43,240
let me get the egg and cheese. What
kind of bread kind of bread do you got?

1065
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,210
What did you get the hickory smoke.
We got the salmon flat. Fuck it.

1066
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,850
Just gimme week. Okay. Third,
there's no reason to curse, right?

1067
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:51,130
So I get the wheat and uh,

1068
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,990
they just microwave this shit. I don't
know. It was one of the most, uh,

1069
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:59,380
it was almost like a, a joke
sandwich, like a prop sandwich,

1070
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,820
like the kind of thing that would be
sitting on a plate in the background and

1071
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:08,620
that old show. Uh, what was it?
Peewee's playhouse. Peewees fun house.

1072
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,170
Peewees uh,

1073
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,610
let's give some kids some acid and invite
a pedophile over whatever the fuck his

1074
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:19,570
show was called. I Dunno. See, adrenaline
doesn't always work. That was a,

1075
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:24,160
that was a shit sandwich and the
story was even shittier. But anyways,

1076
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:28,840
this is the fucking podcast for this week.
I need help from you guys. All right.

1077
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,970
Uh, I went out and I bought
some Ram for my computer.

1078
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,510
My whole do it yourself kick.
All right.

1079
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:41,410
I know I could've gone down to the
apple store and had one of those fucking

1080
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:46,411
nerds that God damn body odor walking
around with the nerve to have,

1081
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:51,570
you know, genius written
on this shirt. All right.

1082
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:55,000
With their buddy Holly glasses and
that type of shit. And I'm like,

1083
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:58,270
how fucking hard can it be
to put ram in a computer?

1084
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,910
That sounds pretty intimidating,
doesn't it? Well, you know what,

1085
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,760
I went on Youtube and evidently
it's pretty fucking easy.

1086
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:07,660
Take a Goddamn Nicoletta your pocket,
right?

1087
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:12,370
You unscrew the fucking battery
for some reason you, you a,

1088
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:13,870
you turn right to loosen it,

1089
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:17,990
you know lefty Loosey righty tighty you
have just go right pop out the fucking

1090
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:20,060
battery and there's like two screws.

1091
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:24,410
You remove a band and then there's two
switches and the things pop out like

1092
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:26,990
toast. You take out the old
one, you put in the higher one.

1093
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,590
He slammed that fucker back in. He used
to the reverse process and you're done.

1094
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:35,000
But this is the problem.
You need special screwdrivers.

1095
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,810
All right?
You need precision screwdrivers.

1096
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:41,870
And I went down to fucking home depot
and they don't have any small enough.

1097
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,200
So now that I have insulted
all the tech nerds out there,

1098
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:48,490
where the fuck can I get these
screwdrivers? I have a Mac. Oh,

1099
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:51,260
s x or is that 10 I have no idea.

1100
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:56,530
Version 10.5 0.8 I need some precision
screwdrivers to unscrew fucking three

1101
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:01,790
four bolts. You know, I
feel like I'm going to,

1102
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,820
I'm going to put a fucking
heavy in my laptop. It's a joke.

1103
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:05,930
You guys should go on Youtube,

1104
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:11,200
go on youtube and check or go on the FM
podcast cause we'll have this v.com mm

1105
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,400
podcast.com we'll have that video up
there. Just look up youtube videos,

1106
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:18,470
how to add ram to your Mac.

1107
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:22,460
And this guy will show you how to do
the whole fucking thing. It's a joke.

1108
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:27,080
All right. This is my new kick. I'm sick
of these fucking guys with their Dickies.

1109
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:28,520
Come walking into my apartment,

1110
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:31,340
charge me all this God damn
money and not one of them.

1111
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,450
Seems like there are
any smarter than I am.

1112
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,800
So basically they just have information,
information.

1113
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:42,920
Who are the new number two?
Who is number one?

1114
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:48,130
You are number six. I am not
a number. I am a free man.

1115
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:54,050
Uh sorry. Iron maiden flashback. Um, yeah,

1116
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,200
I'm sick of these guys coming in here.
Charge me all this fucking money.

1117
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:59,420
I want to learn how to do shit myself.

1118
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:02,420
I'm still trying to get the balls
up to replace the trim on my doors.

1119
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:05,840
I've gotten to the point where I've
watched enough youtube videos where I

1120
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:09,110
definitely know how to get the shit off.

1121
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:15,470
Like most weekend warriors. Oh,
I can start the fucking job,

1122
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,180
but bringing it on home,

1123
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,350
you know it's going to be hilarious and
or great for my act is when I actually

1124
01:10:21,351 --> 01:10:25,670
try to do this shit and fail and then I
have to call another guy over to finish

1125
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:30,140
it because I wasn't man enough to figure
it out myself and it'll be emasculating.

1126
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:33,740
But you know what? I'll learn.
I'll stay. I don't give a fuck.

1127
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,500
I don't have any God damned
pride at this point. I'll, I'll,

1128
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:39,800
I'll stand right there and figure out,
look over shoulder.

1129
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,570
I'll be that annoying guy.
Huh?

1130
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:47,000
Oh you blue collar guys out there who
fix shit. I did that for a minute.

1131
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,440
I used to finish basements.

1132
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:54,400
You know in the fucking worst job you
could ever do is you go into somebody's

1133
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:56,000
fucking house

1134
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,270
did go in to finish their basement and
the fucking cunt would be sitting down

1135
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:06,260
there in the basement watching
you do the entire project.

1136
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,140
So anytime you made a bad cut,

1137
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:13,040
anytime you know all you know all
the bullshit that's behind the walls,

1138
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:16,200
there's a lot of knee and elbow work
and they sitting there freaking out.

1139
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:18,510
What does that is as
that going to be a pro?

1140
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:23,440
Like when you go to put the fucking
installation and you know what?

1141
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,890
I can't remember the fucking
measurements. I was, I was a grunt.

1142
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:28,470
I just handed the dude to shit
and I remember that like the, the,

1143
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:32,970
the fucking installation would go like
80% up the wall and then you just reach

1144
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:36,150
over and break off some more insulation
and stuff it in there and the fucking

1145
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:39,550
Goddamn broads would get so pissed.
Why?

1146
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,810
What about that little space in between?
It's not gonna matter.

1147
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,150
Why are you here? Do you think we're
going to steal your fucking laundry?

1148
01:11:48,151 --> 01:11:52,820
Get outta here. The Fuck Outta
here. That was a bit late then.

1149
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:55,480
You know what's funny is you
just sit there and, and the,

1150
01:11:55,481 --> 01:12:00,481
the fucking shit that would go on
between me and the other person I was

1151
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:03,390
finishing the basement with,
you know,

1152
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:06,810
when we realize the person wasn't leaving
do they do, would just be like, yeah,

1153
01:12:06,811 --> 01:12:09,240
hey me the nail gun.
And you know you do that shit where,

1154
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,230
where like the Douche is behind you,
right?

1155
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,660
It's basically he's talking to me.

1156
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,670
I can see his face and over his shoulder
I see the person who owns the fucking

1157
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:23,640
house and he turned to him and he'd be
like, hey me that nail gun. And you know,

1158
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:27,900
his eyes would be wide and his eyebrows
to be down, you know, that look like fuck

1159
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:34,370
shit. Um, so anyways, that's probably
what's going to end up happening to me.

1160
01:12:34,371 --> 01:12:37,530
So this is the Monday morning podcast.

1161
01:12:37,531 --> 01:12:41,790
If the subdued version of the Monday
morning podcasts for November 15th and

1162
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:46,050
guess what? Guess what everybody does?
I stuttered through this fucking thing.

1163
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:51,620
It is November 15th and old Billy boy
here has got 30 days and no Busan,

1164
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:57,060
no booths,
not a drop of fucking booze.

1165
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,350
How do you like that for
fucking willpower? It's not
that impressive as well.

1166
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:05,880
Fucking means a lot to me. I was actually
on the plane reading, rolling stone.

1167
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:10,330
M and M is on the cover and he was talking
about two and a half years of being

1168
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,310
sober.
And I was thinking,

1169
01:13:11,311 --> 01:13:16,170
that's pretty fucking amazing considering
the most I've been able to go 75 days.

1170
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,140
You know,
I,

1171
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,130
granted I don't feel like I
have an addictive personality.

1172
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,040
I just don't want to have a huge fat head.

1173
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,550
Although I could use the side of my neck
for a pillow when I get on the God damn

1174
01:13:32,551 --> 01:13:36,480
plane. Um, so anyways,

1175
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,590
this is the podcast for this week.
Uh,

1176
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:43,610
last week I actually began a new segment
here on the podcast a inadvertently,

1177
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,011
uh,
when I,

1178
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:51,600
when I brought up that movie over the
edge and when those kids right in the

1179
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:55,530
school and they locked the police and
the parents and the teachers because they

1180
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,960
were having that meeting in the cafeteria,

1181
01:13:57,961 --> 01:14:02,520
they lock them in the fucking cafeteria
and then they start vandalizing the

1182
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:07,521
school and the cop runs up and he's
tugging on the fucking chain link fence or

1183
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:12,070
whatever the fuck they put up. And he
can't get out. And this chick, big chick,

1184
01:14:12,071 --> 01:14:15,400
like six foot two comes running
by with this giant globe.

1185
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,500
She runs by the camera and then comes
running back, looks at the cop and goes,

1186
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:24,630
ate it. You stick in pig. What are the,

1187
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:29,140
what are the most fucking horrific
lines I've ever seen in a fucking movie?

1188
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,650
And that ended up inadvertently
creating a new segment,

1189
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:36,730
best lines in awful movies.
And uh,

1190
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:42,140
I got one for Ya. Uh, it
is called shark attack. Uh,

1191
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,620
I can't tell you what the line is.
You have to watch somebody sent this in.

1192
01:14:44,621 --> 01:14:48,070
I should say it's a shark attack.

1193
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:52,180
Three just, just search. We're
going to have all of these,

1194
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:57,100
all of the ship shit. Sorry up on. I'm
actually apologizing cause I didn't curse.

1195
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:01,160
Sorry. I said ship instead of shit. Um,

1196
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,810
we're gonna have all these videos
up on the FM podcast.com. All right.

1197
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:07,330
But for some reason,
if you want to look it up yourself,

1198
01:15:07,331 --> 01:15:11,800
if you're a control freak, I understand
that. Go ahead. Make your life harder.

1199
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:15,130
I don't give a fuck.
Go on Youtube and look up shark attack.

1200
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:20,131
Three famous line and I challenge you
to be silent after you fucking hear what

1201
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:26,830
this guy says.
I think I just said what it just,

1202
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:31,780
it's the most, one of the most fucked
up lines I've ever heard in a movie.

1203
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,680
And you know that that's the challenge.

1204
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:39,850
Give me a line worst than this fucking
line in shark attack. Three famous line.

1205
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,360
And also I was kind of surfing.

1206
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:48,361
I started surfing bad movies cause I
got into that part on Youtube and a a

1207
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:52,150
definitely must rent,
but definite rental for me.

1208
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:53,950
I'm taking a month off here,

1209
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:59,770
coming up around Christmas is
a silent night, deadly night,

1210
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:04,300
part five. I have to watch
that fucking movie. Um,

1211
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,920
there's another great one.

1212
01:16:05,921 --> 01:16:09,010
Just just go on Youtube and
fucking just look at the movie.

1213
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:13,930
Just look at the trailer for
that fucking movie. You know,

1214
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,480
somebody asked me the other day,
he's like, you know, as an actor,

1215
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:20,740
when you're in a bad movie, do you
think you realize it? You know,

1216
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:25,470
and I think on a movie like that,
you'd do. But the scary thing is,

1217
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:29,590
is I think on anything else you'd doubt
because you're so at the fucking mercy

1218
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,970
of the music, of the edits and all that
type of shit. You just pray to God.

1219
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:34,810
You got somebody good.

1220
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,960
That's what I learned in date night
when I delivered eight fucking lines.

1221
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:41,050
Listen to me talking like I'm in an
inside the actor's fucking studio.

1222
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,350
I had eight lines more
than a goddamn extra.

1223
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:48,730
And here I am talking like I'm a fucking
professional. Why do I have the hiccups?

1224
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:53,140
Um, so anyways, there you go. People.

1225
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:57,010
There's 21 minutes where I didn't
talk about sports. All right,

1226
01:16:57,011 --> 01:17:01,180
so be prepared to roll your fucking ice.
All right,

1227
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:05,770
let's talk NFL football real quick here.
I went one in three this week,

1228
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:07,930
betting against the spread.

1229
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:12,860
I got my fucking ass handed the fucking
ass handed to me. I knew the second.

1230
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:16,160
Yeah. You know, gamblers out day. You know
like those certain weeks where you just,

1231
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:20,630
you just can't see a winner. Some weeks
you get excited, you're like, oh fuck.

1232
01:17:20,631 --> 01:17:22,910
This is easy, man. Like that,
that they'll definitely cover.

1233
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,010
They're definitely covered.
Course half of them don't,

1234
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,650
but I'm not even talking about
whether you win or you lose,

1235
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:30,980
but you have that excitement like,
yeah, I can fucking see it. Right.

1236
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,610
You know you liked that
the black dude who's,

1237
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:36,770
who's constantly shaving
his head and Predator.

1238
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:41,660
I see you over there and then trees,
right. You're looking at it like that.

1239
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:46,040
This week I was more like Tom
Cruise in top gun. You know,

1240
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:49,760
when he loses his edge and he's going,
yeah, Nah, it's no good. It's no good.

1241
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:53,390
You know, turn the fucking playing around
you fucking fag. What are you doing?

1242
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,640
All right. And he says, it's no
good. It's not good. I can't,

1243
01:17:55,820 --> 01:18:00,500
I can't see anything that, that's how
I was this week. I just, you know,

1244
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,680
I looked at the bills and lines
and I just didn't like it.

1245
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,380
Hated that fucking game. You know,
those two Goddamn Jekyll and Hyde teams,

1246
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:14,090
who the fuck's gonna show up? You
know? So I stayed away from that one.

1247
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:19,300
I looked at fucking Miami and the
Ravens and something was telling me Chad

1248
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:21,020
Pennington,
Chad Pennington,

1249
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:24,650
but I was like against Ray
Lewis and fucking Ralph Nader,

1250
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,510
whatever the fuck the name
of this quarterback is.

1251
01:18:26,511 --> 01:18:30,860
If for some reason I can't
remember, Edie Falco, ed Falco,

1252
01:18:30,861 --> 01:18:34,400
what the fuck is his name?
Flaco Joe Flacco.

1253
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:41,000
Um, soil. My Gut told me Miami,
but I didn't have the balls.

1254
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:45,410
I didn't have the balls to
pull the trigger. So I said,
fuck that one. All right,

1255
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:49,670
so I bet Tampa Bay, because they've
been working for me and they covered.

1256
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:52,310
And then I just picked two
games where I just couldn't,

1257
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,610
I couldn't see a fucking
winner. I bet that, uh,

1258
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,880
the Houston Texans against Jacksonville,

1259
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:03,680
I was getting a point and a half. I
said, uh, God damn Jekyll and Hyde,

1260
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:08,360
Jacksonville, who's going to show up?
Texans have been consistent. Fuck it.

1261
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:11,120
They beat the colts. I'm going
with the Texas. All right.

1262
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:15,830
Lose that Goddamn fucking
bet on that Hail Mary Pass.

1263
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:17,900
All right.
But that happens.

1264
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:23,120
And then I looked at the Arizona Seattle
game and I picked Arizona and I said,

1265
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:26,360
no, wait, Seattle, Seattle. I say, yeah,

1266
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:28,280
Pete Carol is not a fucking NFL coach.

1267
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:33,590
And I picked Arizona as I was saying, no,
not Seattle. So I fucking lose that one.

1268
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:35,090
And this was the worst one.

1269
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,010
Pittsburgh plays my fucking
New England patriots,

1270
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:44,060
and I was so god damn fucking depressed.
After that Brown's loss,

1271
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:48,920
the Steelers are at home and they're
only given fucking four and a half.

1272
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:52,490
They got that great defense.
They got Ben Roethlisberger,

1273
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:56,330
Joe fucking cool won two super bowls

1274
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,680
that held a lot of water
with me. So I said, fuck it.

1275
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:03,950
I'm taking the Goddamn steel is I
bet against my own fucking team.

1276
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:09,870
And I lost that one. I was
my Sunday night show, um,

1277
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:13,560
at, at the funny bone in Columbus
and I get off stage and I'm going,

1278
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:18,470
it's going to be like 17,
three or 17 to nine or something.

1279
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,900
Pittsburgh and I get off stage and
it's fucking 10 to nothing patriots.

1280
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:26,340
And I was like, you gotta be shitting
me. Right. You know that sinking feeling.

1281
01:20:26,341 --> 01:20:28,800
You're like, you gotta be
kidding me. Really, really.

1282
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:32,490
I lost faith in my own fucking team on
running, be able to enjoy this. Actually,

1283
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:35,850
I still did enjoy it.
It's kind of a win win for me.

1284
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:39,300
Either the Patriots get to
fucking asses kicked, right?

1285
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:43,140
But it helps my gambling record or
they go out and win. But the thing is,

1286
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,810
is I didn't bet on the patriots,
so I can't brag this week.

1287
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:50,580
I can't even bring up the fact that we
fucking own the Pittsburgh Steelers.

1288
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:54,540
We are seven and two against those
motherfuckers. The last nine games,

1289
01:20:55,020 --> 01:21:00,020
the six time world champion that
the fucking Yankees of the NFL,

1290
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:05,160
the Boston Celtics of the NFL,
the Montreal Canadians,

1291
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:10,080
the ones with the most fucking
titles. We have seven and two. And I,

1292
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:12,960
for the life of me, I can't
figure out why. I remember a few,

1293
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:17,310
like a month ago when all the jet
fans had this stupid green chest hairs

1294
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:21,240
standing at attention, and I was saying
that Rothenberger hadn't come back yet.

1295
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:24,510
And that's the team that's going to kick
the shit out of you or until you beat

1296
01:21:24,511 --> 01:21:26,850
that fucking team that,
that's the team that I believed in.

1297
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:32,820
What the fuck happened?
I Dunno. So anyways,

1298
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,370
and uh,
being in Columbus,

1299
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:40,170
I actually got to watch the browns and
the jets game and uh, you know what?

1300
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:44,580
I don't fucking Wa the Browns,
like Cleveland fans.

1301
01:21:44,581 --> 01:21:48,000
I don't know what the fuck you
guys did to the sports gods.

1302
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:51,240
That's another one of those fucking towns.

1303
01:21:51,241 --> 01:21:55,380
It's just like they just can't lose
a game. They have to fuck it up.

1304
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,680
You know?
By the way,

1305
01:21:58,681 --> 01:22:02,490
can I get any credit on this podcast
for that stat that I created?

1306
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,400
Remember I told you, I said Mark, uh,

1307
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:09,780
fucking Sanchez leads the League in
drop inner dropped interceptions.

1308
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:14,280
Any fantasy football nerds want
to start keeping track of that.

1309
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,810
I've never seen anything like it.

1310
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:20,700
It's like he's got a little remote control
in the football that went defenders

1311
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:24,840
catch it with both hands.
It's, I don't know what he
does. Like he's, he's got like,

1312
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:29,730
he turns it into a knuckle ball, that
fucking piece of shit. No, I'm joking.

1313
01:22:29,731 --> 01:22:33,270
He's actually a good quarterback.
That fucking guy, he threw a pick.

1314
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,900
He throws a pic.
I could've caught the ball.

1315
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,960
It hit this dude in both fucking hands,

1316
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,870
but because Sanchez throws it,

1317
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,870
the dude just goes Wallay he took it like,
Yo,

1318
01:22:46,871 --> 01:22:48,120
that it was a hot potato.

1319
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:52,290
It just sort of throw it past himself
and then he's like, Whoa, no wait,

1320
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,940
I think I want to catch it now.

1321
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And at that point the jet def a wide
receiver wisely slapped it to the fucking

1322
01:22:59,371 --> 01:23:03,840
ground. You know, I don't
in defense of the jets,

1323
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:06,580
I mean they did miss three fucking
field goals so they should have won it

1324
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:09,940
regulation, but Jesus Christ,
they opened the fucking door.

1325
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:13,120
That's what scaring me about the jets is
they fucking lose games and they still,

1326
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:17,010
when they got luck be a lady to night.

1327
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:20,620
They got that on their side.
And you know what Chet fans,

1328
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:24,550
cause I know you have no idea what it's
like to win a championship. All right?

1329
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,730
That's what you need when you
start seeing shit like that.

1330
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:31,060
That's the kind of shit that should get
you excited and scares the shit out of

1331
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:31,840
me.

1332
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,740
Because if you mother fuckers are actually
going to be a halfway decent team and

1333
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:38,230
the people are going
to drop interceptions,

1334
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,410
I mean how do you stop the,

1335
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,170
even when they're trying
to lose a fucking game,

1336
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:49,210
there's still winning games but jet fan,

1337
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:52,480
she got to admit how fucking
insane is that running back.

1338
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:54,730
I told you that guy who was,
I keep forgetting his name,

1339
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:59,230
the guy with the dodge ram grill
on the front of his fucking helmet.

1340
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,620
Who the fuck was talking about?

1341
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:06,610
His arms was saying that's why he
fumbled the ball. Oh, that motherfucker,

1342
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:10,960
they will write in field goal.
Just step out of bounds,

1343
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:15,400
protect the fucking ball,
whatever. Here's my prediction.

1344
01:24:15,401 --> 01:24:19,630
I think Cleveland very quickly is going
to get over Lebron leaving and they're

1345
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:23,800
going to become a football
town once again. And uh,

1346
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:28,830
I am all for it because I fucking
loved the Cleveland browns in the 80s.

1347
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,150
I loved those teams.
Brian Sipe, Bernie Kosar.

1348
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:34,570
Ah,

1349
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,930
that fucking orange helmet used to play
in municipal stadium and it was always

1350
01:24:37,931 --> 01:24:42,790
like fucking minus 60 degrees,
uh, those games with a shit,

1351
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:47,590
those games with a fucking
shit, um, cardiac kids. Right.

1352
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,301
I Dunno.
You know what?

1353
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:53,380
I actually get excited when a team
that that's been bad for a long time,

1354
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,360
but actually used to
have a winning tradition.

1355
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,650
Like the browns were the shit in the 50s,
right through the 60s.

1356
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,630
You know, that's something I should have
looked up. I should have looked up. Uh,

1357
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:09,200
how many NFL titles that they, uh, that
they want. Isn't that fucked up at that?

1358
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:12,130
They don't count those.
You know what I mean?

1359
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,880
Like how the Pittsburgh Steelers are
a top the league with a measly six

1360
01:25:18,431 --> 01:25:19,211
championships.

1361
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:22,210
It's not a measly because they've
won in the last 40 something years,

1362
01:25:22,211 --> 01:25:26,080
but like six championships is all it
takes for you to get to the top of the

1363
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:30,760
league. You know, it's
fucking 27 in baseball,

1364
01:25:30,761 --> 01:25:34,210
17 in basketball.
I always forget what the Canadians got.

1365
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:38,470
The Canadians got like fucking,
uh, they got at least 22,

1366
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:42,680
something like that. Jesus
Christ, some fucking French do.

1367
01:25:42,681 --> 01:25:47,440
She's going to correct me on that
one. All in capital letters, um,

1368
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:52,790
squiggly lines over different
vowels. Yeah, I don't why?

1369
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:56,410
Why don't they see anybody know why? Why
don't they count those titles? You know,

1370
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,320
why don't they count like a mean,

1371
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:03,170
would it be nice if eagle fans could
actually have like 1960 or whatever the

1372
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:03,741
fuck they had?

1373
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:08,741
At least some sort of championship
banner hanging on top of the fucking a

1374
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:14,090
Blimpie subway, sandwich.com stadium,
whatever. Wherever the fuck they play.

1375
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,170
Why don't they, why don't they
count those? Does anybody know?

1376
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:20,690
Is this even fucking remotely interesting?

1377
01:26:20,691 --> 01:26:25,280
Let's get to the the obscure sports stat
of the week. Somebody sent this shit in,

1378
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:30,490
you know last week I started this topic
by saying how the last time sports teams

1379
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:34,400
in St Louis lost the world series last.

1380
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:39,401
The Stanley Cup final lost a super bowl
and an NBA title way back when they had

1381
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:44,711
the Saint Louis Hawks before they moved
to Atlanta the last four times they've

1382
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,630
lost in the finals.

1383
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:50,570
Last Times they've lost in the finals
and all four sports is what I'm trying to

1384
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:55,220
say. We're all from teams all at
the hands of teams from Boston.

1385
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,070
There's your obscure staff from last
week and this is the one from this week.

1386
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:06,200
All right. This is the most fucked
up thing I've seen in awhile.

1387
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:10,910
Evidently back in 1973
all right.

1388
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:15,770
The glam rock was going on, right? Let's
give you a little historical perspective.

1389
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:20,360
I think this is right during Watergate.
What did Nixon get bounced out?

1390
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:21,410
Like 74

1391
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:27,500
that's right cause he wanted 72 and then
the fallout was in 73 and then he was

1392
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:30,190
gone.
What else happened?

1393
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,900
We got out of Vietnam is a year
before we got out of Vietnam.

1394
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:38,210
And uh,
I know chicks are pretty hot back then.

1395
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,240
You know that whole Mary Tyler Moore look,

1396
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:44,030
and that was never in
the Mary Tyler Moore.

1397
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:46,130
She looked better on that
show at that skinny drunk.

1398
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:50,840
He used to fall over the Ottoman.
But Dick Van Dyke,

1399
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:55,340
um, was the other ones, the ones that
did the guest stars and they had,

1400
01:27:55,341 --> 01:27:58,370
they had the fucking mini
skirts, mini skirts, you know,

1401
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,870
barely hanging over those
fucking Harry muffs. Um, anyways,

1402
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,930
there's your historical perspective,
uh,

1403
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:10,960
to Yankee pitchers in 1973 I never heard
of this traded their wives and kids,

1404
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,140
they just switched off families.
And this is the story.

1405
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:23,180
According to the Daily News, 1973,
um, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

1406
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:27,590
March, March, March 5th, Yankee Pitcher,

1407
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:31,160
they call by their last names
here because I guess, you know,

1408
01:28:31,161 --> 01:28:34,370
people knew who the fuck they
were. Kekich K, I. E. K. I,

1409
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:39,371
c h and Marilyn disclosed today that they
had exchanged families several months

1410
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:44,540
ago.
Peterson moving in with Susan Keck,

1411
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:49,541
rich and her two daughters and Keck rich
moving in with Marilyn Peterson and her

1412
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:51,170
two sons.

1413
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:56,660
The pitchers in separate talks said
they decided to reveal the arrangement

1414
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,800
because too many people knew about it.
Evidently everybody in baseball,

1415
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:05,801
I mean can't really keep a story like
that quiet I guess all around the fucking

1416
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,580
spring training.
Everybody was talking about this shit.

1417
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:11,980
So they finally just went
public with it. So, um,

1418
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:17,010
they thought it was time to clear the
air and the 31 year old Peterson confided

1419
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:22,280
that they hope that you won't make
anything sorted out of this according to

1420
01:29:22,351 --> 01:29:24,810
Kekich.
I'm sure I'm saying that wrong.

1421
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,980
Unless people know the full details that
could turn out to be a nasty type thing.

1422
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:34,250
Don't say this was wipe swapping
his wife swapping because it wasn't,

1423
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,030
we didn't swap wives.
We swapped lives. Ah,

1424
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:43,590
Jesus Christ. Look at this guy. Fucking
sprinkle in a bunch of sugar over it. Um,

1425
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:46,650
I guess technically he is right dude.

1426
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:50,490
How fucked up or their children Keck it.

1427
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,040
Your Dad just taps out.
Yeah, I'm Outta here.

1428
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:56,790
I don't want to be with you mom anymore.
And you know, you know my best buddy,

1429
01:29:56,791 --> 01:30:00,000
he was always over here drinking beers.
Yeah, he's going to be your dad now.

1430
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:03,030
He's going to be banging your mom
when you hear that Moan and just, no,

1431
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:06,300
that's not me doing that
work or right kids and uh,

1432
01:30:06,301 --> 01:30:08,700
I'm Outta here and uh,

1433
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,590
I'm going to go fuck his wife
and go raise his children. Okay.

1434
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:17,830
How does that sit with you? Jesus
Christ. You want to talk to them?

1435
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:18,780
If they had daughters,

1436
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:22,500
you want to talk about the easiest
chicks to lose your fucking virginity to,

1437
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:25,650
then they go right there.
There they are.

1438
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:28,440
Well them up fellas.
All right.

1439
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:32,760
New Jersey where the forehead resided
for four years requires simply that the

1440
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:36,960
parties proved separation for a
year in order to file for divorce.

1441
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,620
It's a no fault rule,
meaning no grounds are required.

1442
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:46,550
You know what's amazing about this
fucking story is how like that you could

1443
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:51,840
actually keep something like this
quiet for a, for a couple of months.

1444
01:30:51,841 --> 01:30:56,040
Because if you ever tried to
do any bullshit like this, uh,

1445
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:58,020
today,
I mean Jesus Christ,

1446
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:02,760
three different 24 hour sports networks
and ESPN alone. The first is network.

1447
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:08,220
I mean then you get, TMZ would jump on
that would just TMZ late night talk shows.

1448
01:31:08,221 --> 01:31:12,380
They got like 58 of them now.
Oh my God,

1449
01:31:12,381 --> 01:31:13,350
it'd be over manager.

1450
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:17,820
Ralph Houk said it was a situation
that he could live with a,

1451
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:21,750
that it would not rip apart his team
and that it still had its best chance of

1452
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:24,000
winning a pennant since 1964.

1453
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:28,680
I always like Ralph Elk fucking kept
it positive and just for the record,

1454
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:33,681
they went 80 and 80 to two games
of under 500 Jesus fucking Christ.

1455
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:39,210
Jesus Christ. How the fuck he
is the top, that obscure stat.

1456
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:40,620
Has Anybody noticed that?

1457
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:43,710
I've been stuttering more and more
as this fucking podcast goes along,

1458
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,630
the sun is gradually going down. It got
36 stutter and fucking minutes in here.

1459
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,810
Hang on a second. I've got to turn the
light on so I can read here. Hold on.

1460
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:54,210
Just stay there.
Don't freak out.

1461
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:00,070
I'm not leaving you for somebody else's
wife and family across the street.

1462
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,790
How to fuck men talk. That was
like the fallout of the, the,

1463
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:12,490
the free love man
society's rules,

1464
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:16,270
man. What does it mean? You know
what's funny is they, they really, um,

1465
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,280
I saw a great documentary on,

1466
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:23,340
on hippies because literally called
hippies and it was awesome because one of

1467
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:24,311
the former,

1468
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:29,311
a hippy dudes was really honest where he
just said he didn't like what was going

1469
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:37,600
on and he rebelled against it,
which I totally fucking related to,

1470
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:42,550
but he talked about living
in those communes, you know,

1471
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:45,010
where they were going to start their
own fucking churches and their own

1472
01:32:45,011 --> 01:32:48,370
education and everything.
And everybody shared everything.

1473
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:54,150
And He came to the same conclusion that
we all come to is that basically other

1474
01:32:54,641 --> 01:32:56,590
people are fucking irritating

1475
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,520
and you want to get away from him.

1476
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:04,030
And that's basically what happened at
the commune, at least for this guy.

1477
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:07,300
Like he was hanging out and have
free love and all this type of shit.

1478
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:10,030
And after awhile you just like,
oh my God, I gotta, I gotta get,

1479
01:33:10,031 --> 01:33:12,520
I gotta get the fuck away
from these people. You know?

1480
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:17,740
So you really gotta hand it to the native
Americans how they were able to live

1481
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:22,030
like that. It's somehow,
uh, you know why that is,

1482
01:33:22,031 --> 01:33:25,450
of course is because they didn't realize
they didn't understand the concept of

1483
01:33:25,451 --> 01:33:29,980
having an apartment much
less a fucking door. Um,

1484
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:33,010
that right. That was pretty ignorant.
That's plow ahead. Oh, by the way,

1485
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:36,100
I've really pissed off a lot of
potheads evidently on my podcast.

1486
01:33:36,101 --> 01:33:36,751
They think that I,

1487
01:33:36,751 --> 01:33:41,440
I am against smoking weed and then I'm
trashing that whole fucking lifestyle.

1488
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:46,870
Why don't you guys go take another hit
off your fucking blunt and fucking relax.

1489
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:50,260
All right? Just because
I, I trashed that guy

1490
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:55,600
who was a pot smoker.
I wasn't saying that weed was a bad thing.

1491
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,830
All right. At this point, with
those vaporizers that they have,

1492
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:05,160
it's probably fucking 10 times healthier
than sitting around drinking a six

1493
01:34:05,831 --> 01:34:10,810
pack. I don't have a fucking problem.
I wasn't talking about smoking weed.

1494
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:13,600
I was, I wasn't. I was
making fun of a loser.

1495
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:18,430
I was telling that woman
that she was dating a fucking
loser. All right? As a man,

1496
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:22,480
your job is to go out and fucking provide,
you know,

1497
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:27,100
and when somebody breaks into your house
not to shit yourself and to grab the

1498
01:34:27,101 --> 01:34:30,490
nearest blunt object and
fucking go brave hard on him,

1499
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:34,960
that's what you supposed to do.
You know me, I would shit myself,

1500
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:37,330
lock myself in the bathroom and
called nine one one of course,

1501
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:43,390
but I can provide God dammit. That's
when he got to fit fucking pit bull for.

1502
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:48,940
Um, speaking of that, I watched
no country for old men again, man.

1503
01:34:48,941 --> 01:34:51,010
What a fucking awesome movie that is.

1504
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:54,640
That is just absolutely
phenomenal fucking movie.

1505
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:57,770
It actually made me sad
that we were in descent.

1506
01:34:57,771 --> 01:35:00,880
That's how good that goddamn
movie is. Um, but anyways,

1507
01:35:00,881 --> 01:35:05,060
so I just know that potheads
I'm not making fun. You know,

1508
01:35:05,061 --> 01:35:09,230
if I make fun of some guy
who's a booze bag, booze bag,

1509
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:12,320
fucking losers sitting around
drinking beer all day on the couch,

1510
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:16,580
that doesn't mean that I don't
think that anybody should drink.

1511
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:20,450
All right,
so fucking relax.

1512
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:26,150
Jesus Christ, that touchy got
mellow when you smoke weed. Um,

1513
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,670
anyways, let's plow ahead. Hey Edge.

1514
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:34,340
Can you guys basically just admit that
you want weed to be free just so you can

1515
01:35:34,341 --> 01:35:37,490
just sit around, smoke it, and not have
to worry about anybody hassle and Ya,

1516
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:41,810
you know,
to use a classic Hippie word,

1517
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,260
why can't you just admit that and
stopped telling me about, you know,

1518
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:49,720
how the fucking declaration of
independence was written on hemp and all,

1519
01:35:49,721 --> 01:35:53,920
all these, you know, I mean, Jesus Christ,

1520
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:57,590
you can make a potted plant
out of a 40 in empty 40 ounce.

1521
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:01,190
I'm not going to sit there and act like
I don't wish that I want to drink in

1522
01:36:01,191 --> 01:36:05,990
public, right? Dude, my brain
shut down seven minutes ago.

1523
01:36:05,991 --> 01:36:08,840
I don't even, what the fuck I'm talking
about? I need to start reading again.

1524
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:13,790
Overrated. Underrated for this
week. Everybody. Um, all right.

1525
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:17,360
This guy said underrated banana pancake.

1526
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:22,430
Damn. I made a simple pancake with
bananas in it and I had some, uh,

1527
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:27,230
some great real maple syrup from New
Zealand and it was fucking amazing.

1528
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:30,650
I couldn't believe how great it tasted a,

1529
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:33,350
it never was a pancake guy
and when I used to go to,

1530
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,950
and it was never a pancake guy when he
used to go to diners back in Jersey,

1531
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:41,951
it was delicious but
overrated to banana pancakes.

1532
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:46,820
All right. I got greedy. I thought the
first one was so good. I went back,

1533
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:49,160
I made a second one man,
was I wrong?

1534
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:53,210
I ate it and felt like a gluttonous pig.
I should have known,

1535
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,480
but I at least for temporary
temporarily forgot.

1536
01:36:56,630 --> 01:37:00,620
Happiness comes in spurts and
too much of anything can be bad.

1537
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,730
I hate to relate life to a couple
of pancakes, but it's true.

1538
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:09,110
I overdid it and ruin the great
single pancake experience.

1539
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:13,460
A one and it was great. I ate a second
and I felt like shit. Yeah, they go, dude,

1540
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:18,500
dude, batter. Pancake
batter is a edible cement.

1541
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:20,600
That's what it is.
All right.

1542
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:23,780
I told those stories before for all
you struggling comedians out there,

1543
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:26,150
you don't want to blow
a bunch of cash on food.

1544
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:31,390
Go down to Denny's or an I hop
and about nine 30 in the morning,

1545
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:35,690
get the fucking full stack
of pancakes and force.

1546
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:39,890
I don't even know if they make them
anymore with all this talking about

1547
01:37:39,891 --> 01:37:44,750
nutrition, I don't even think back in the
day they give you a five and you just,

1548
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:48,410
I just like man versus food.
I just shoved that.

1549
01:37:48,411 --> 01:37:50,720
She'd be sweating by the
time he got to the third one,

1550
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:52,970
all that syrup and all that butter.

1551
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:56,250
And then you'd suck down your water and
the Oj and I swear to God you weren't

1552
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:58,020
hungry again to like 10 o'clock at night.

1553
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:03,270
So you got to skip at least one
fucking mail. You know, just a tip.

1554
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:06,420
Just a tip for you.
Let's wind this podcast down.

1555
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:10,470
Let's go short and sweet this week shall
we, uh, youtube videos for this week.

1556
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,910
And I'm going to tell you right now,

1557
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:15,090
I think these are arguably the
best fucking youtube videos,

1558
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:18,450
the best cluster of youtube videos that,
um,

1559
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:23,080
that you guys have suggested since I've
been doing this topic because you guys

1560
01:38:23,081 --> 01:38:25,890
have, are now actually going
outside the realm of Youtube.

1561
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:30,720
And finding some really obscure shit.
So for all of you,

1562
01:38:30,721 --> 01:38:32,310
they're listening at home.

1563
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:35,760
Just go to the FM podcast.com and uh,

1564
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:39,630
we'll have all of these lined up for
you to watch. All right, here we go.

1565
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:42,090
First a youtube video.

1566
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:45,360
And this one right here is
an instant fucking classic.

1567
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:48,030
I absolutely love this guy.
Uh,

1568
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:53,150
this youtube video is called man is
tased mocks cops and still gets away.

1569
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:57,300
I want you guys to watch this because
not only is it fucking hilarious,

1570
01:38:57,301 --> 01:39:02,301
but this guy really shows why it's so
important to know what your rights are as

1571
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,670
a citizen. I'm not saying the cops aren't
still gonna kick the shit out of you,

1572
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,290
but just to watch this guy,

1573
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:14,850
he's actually stumping the
cops on a certain level
because they can't answer his

1574
01:39:14,851 --> 01:39:19,200
questions. They got pinned on the
ground and they said, go and sir,

1575
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:21,840
you're underneath the rest. You're,
yeah. Do you realize you aren't ya?

1576
01:39:21,841 --> 01:39:25,650
You're aware that you're under arrest? And
he goes, no. He goes, what's the charge?

1577
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:27,600
What is the charge? And
they just kept going, sir,

1578
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:31,050
are you aware that you're under arrest?
He's like, I don't speak the language.

1579
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:34,650
I'm not in your king. I'm not a
subjective your kingdom. Right,

1580
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:39,030
and for the first minute and 20 seconds,

1581
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:43,410
this guy's fucking hilarious. Then
he gets all religious, oh gee.

1582
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,540
And then it gets funny,

1583
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:49,550
looks like a freak and then he just starts
singing this fucking song and they're

1584
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:55,551
trying to handcuff him and he is doing
the most simple fucking move with his

1585
01:39:56,971 --> 01:39:58,860
elbow.
Really look to see it.

1586
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,300
The cop keeps going over the risks
go under the risk over the wrist,

1587
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:04,890
under the wrist, and he just
keeps moving his fucking elbow.

1588
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,810
It's literally a two inch move.

1589
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,580
He's moving it up to inches and down to
witches in this fucking cop cannot get

1590
01:40:11,581 --> 01:40:14,580
the God damn handcuffs on him and
the whole time he's doing this,

1591
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:19,140
he's singing this fucking song.
He's like a poet or something like that.

1592
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:24,270
Then they tased him and as they're
tasing him he standing up and he's,

1593
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:29,010
he's presenting his case because his wife
is filming it. As he's getting taste,

1594
01:40:29,011 --> 01:40:31,470
he's standing up going,
I defending myself.

1595
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:36,420
I am defending myself from this
unjust hazing. And then he runs away

1596
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:43,800
one of the greatest youtube fucking videos
ever. This guy is, is my fucking hero.

1597
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,470
I love him. All right, and let's stick
with the arresting this week. Uh,

1598
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:53,410
another one is a funny arrest and this
is black dude getting arrested for

1599
01:40:53,411 --> 01:40:57,550
drinking and driving. And this guy
is absolutely fucking hilarious.

1600
01:40:57,551 --> 01:41:01,360
He is adamant that he was not.
He goes, I haven't been drinking,

1601
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:04,540
but I wasn't driving. I Sat, I
was drinking, I wasn't bribing.

1602
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:07,340
You gotta see this guy,
I'm shoving it in multiple.

1603
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:11,860
I will take no motherfucker test.
And then they, and as he was yelling,

1604
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:15,160
the lady would be like,
sir. And he just go, Yo,

1605
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:21,220
why am I trying to reenact these?
These are all fucking hilarious and um,

1606
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,620
be fair and balanced.
We've got a drunk black guy.

1607
01:41:23,621 --> 01:41:26,590
Now we got a drunk fucking white dude,
uh,

1608
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:31,030
drunk redneck arrest and this guy
isn't drunk. I guess he is drunk,

1609
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:35,350
but he's fucking,
he's one of the angry as he says,

1610
01:41:35,351 --> 01:41:40,060
the mean is shit ever. The
cops going to arrest him. Um,

1611
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:43,600
I'll just give you a little
quick little youtube trailers.

1612
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:46,960
They go to a rest of the guy and they
already got them fucking handcuffs in the

1613
01:41:46,961 --> 01:41:49,420
cops going, listen, now, c'mon
man. We don't want to have,

1614
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:51,700
we don't want to have to hurt
you. And guys like, I know,

1615
01:41:51,701 --> 01:41:54,970
I don't want to have to hurt you either.
Break your fucking neck.

1616
01:41:56,530 --> 01:42:01,000
Oh fuck it. I can't make up funny. Just
go watch them. Um, oh. Silent night.

1617
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:05,980
Deadly night, part five. Watch that movie
trailer. Um, for those of weak of stomach,

1618
01:42:05,981 --> 01:42:09,460
do not watch this reporter
Shit herself during interview.

1619
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:13,150
She has on white pants
too. Just to warn you. Um,

1620
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:17,110
and what is the last one? Oh, the last
one for all the drummers out there,

1621
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:19,570
I had a bunch of musicians,
uh,

1622
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,410
specifically drummers send me all these,
uh,

1623
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,660
all these emails this week.

1624
01:42:25,661 --> 01:42:30,661
I had no idea the amount of musicians
and the amount of drummers in particular

1625
01:42:31,481 --> 01:42:34,720
who listened to my podcast. Everybody,
yeah, you got check out Stewart Copeland,

1626
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:38,190
Danny carry all these fucking
people actually read something.

1627
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:41,740
Rolling Stone about Phil
Collins Today and, uh,

1628
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,860
for as much shit music
as he made in the 80s,

1629
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:50,340
like that guy's a fucking a
fucking beast of a drummer.

1630
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:55,120
Left handed drummer, still plays
those concert toms with the no bottom,

1631
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:58,300
no bottom heads. This guy, I'm
telling you, there's not enough.

1632
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:02,650
If anybody's got a great youtube
video that just has him just playing,

1633
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:06,310
I don't want to hear him solo in with
Chester Thompson who was another great

1634
01:43:06,311 --> 01:43:08,050
drummer.
I just want to hear him by himself.

1635
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:12,190
That guy is a fucking beast.

1636
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:17,340
And the sad thing is he stepped out
behind the kit and it was good in the

1637
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,360
beginning and then the end,
it was just,

1638
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:24,280
you can't hurry love since since studio.

1639
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:29,080
Just some of the worst
fucking music ever made. Um,

1640
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:31,870
and they're actually actually
check out rolling stone.

1641
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:35,860
He has this whole article with it.
He's talking about how, you know,

1642
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:39,640
he became the antichrist and he's
actually confused as to why that happened.

1643
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,230
So I kind of felt bad for him as
an artist, but it's like, you know,

1644
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,640
look back on that music filled.
Do you really think that fucking holds up?

1645
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:53,090
She seemed to have at a vigil,
both Todd,

1646
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,230
Oh,
oh Jeez.

1647
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:02,230
Terrible music. Um, anyways,
so checked. So somebody,

1648
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:05,720
everybody was sending me these videos of
drummers telling me all this shit that

1649
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:09,500
I should check out. And uh, this was the,

1650
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:14,570
this was the drum video that really
stood out for me. Um, two things.

1651
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:16,280
One,
this is a video I already knew about.

1652
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:20,180
If you guys are into like drum and bass
music or if you're drummers out there

1653
01:44:20,181 --> 01:44:25,100
and you wonder where that fucking music
came from. This is video that explains,

1654
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:28,580
says a video video,
explains the world's most underrate,

1655
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:32,780
most important six second
drum loop. And it's, um,

1656
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:36,530
it's basically this,
this song from a sort of obscure,

1657
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:41,080
I guess rnb group called the Winstons.
And uh,

1658
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:42,830
they had this song called amen brother,

1659
01:44:42,831 --> 01:44:46,760
which was actually a B side and it had
like this, uh, I don't know what it was.

1660
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:47,450
It was like,

1661
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:52,450
I don't know musically how to say it was
like a fucking two bar drum break that

1662
01:44:52,851 --> 01:44:55,670
these, uh, I don't know if people
used to rap over it or what.

1663
01:44:55,671 --> 01:45:00,150
They explained the whole fucking thing
and basically how Dj's took that toolbar

1664
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:05,150
drum brake and isolated every sound of,

1665
01:45:05,290 --> 01:45:09,470
of, of the recording, every like,
I don't know how to musically,

1666
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:12,950
like if you could cut it down to like
32nd notes, they just isolated everything,

1667
01:45:12,951 --> 01:45:15,590
the sound of the ride cymbal,
the sound of the bass drum,

1668
01:45:15,591 --> 01:45:19,700
everything and the sign of all of it
together and just splice the whole fucking

1669
01:45:19,701 --> 01:45:22,040
thing up and then re
edited it in different,

1670
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:26,150
in a different order and then
sped the whole fucking thing up.

1671
01:45:26,151 --> 01:45:29,510
Created all these new drum beats and
car and sped the whole fucking thing up

1672
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:35,230
past the point where human beings could
actually play drums at that point.

1673
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:42,410
But what's great about fucking human
beings is I like to believe is that we're

1674
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:43,970
better than fucking machines.

1675
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:49,940
So the great dramas of the world's
figured out how to fucking play that fast.

1676
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,180
That's a whole nother thing guys.
Like Joe,

1677
01:45:52,181 --> 01:45:56,270
Joe Mayor actually through fucking cause
these different techniques to play in

1678
01:45:56,271 --> 01:45:57,860
molar method,
push pull and all that.

1679
01:45:57,861 --> 01:46:00,020
They figured out how to
fucking play at that level.

1680
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:03,980
But this video explains basically how
all that drum and Bass Shit Kinda came

1681
01:46:03,981 --> 01:46:07,340
about. And a checkout, Joe, Joe Mayor,

1682
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:10,420
it's another drum video we'll
have up on the MN podcast.

1683
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,450
If you're interested in that shit,
how,

1684
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:17,540
how fucking fast this guy can
play and single bass drum players.

1685
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:19,400
I got to show you this fucking video.

1686
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:24,230
This guy can get three and
four bass drum hits in a row,

1687
01:46:24,231 --> 01:46:28,610
like broke, broke, broke, like
doing like that heel toe shit.

1688
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:34,670
It's fucking unbelievable. It's unfucking
believable how this guy can do that.

1689
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,840
Um, anyways, I know I'm
born in a lot of this is,

1690
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:41,960
this is even more fucking
obscure than sports. But anyways,

1691
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:45,350
that all the drum videos you guys sent
me, a lot of them I knew. And one,

1692
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:48,530
this is the one that I was the least
familiar with because I figured everybody

1693
01:46:48,531 --> 01:46:53,300
knows Danny carry in a tool and
all those major bands. But, uh,

1694
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:58,400
this, this band called Russian circles,
which I had never heard of. Um,

1695
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:01,530
and they have a drummer called
Harper Louis and there's a,

1696
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:05,100
there's a youtube video called
Russian Russian circles.

1697
01:47:05,101 --> 01:47:09,900
Harper Louis a live at
wicker park fest oh seven.

1698
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:14,340
And it just starts off with, you
know, he just, this fucking guy,

1699
01:47:14,341 --> 01:47:18,690
if I could play drums at this guy's
level, this dude's basically, you know,

1700
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:23,220
as much as you want to be the guy hitting
fucking 8 million drums and smashing a

1701
01:47:23,221 --> 01:47:24,450
gong that's on fire,

1702
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:27,920
when it really comes down to what you
want to be able to fucking be this God

1703
01:47:27,921 --> 01:47:32,400
damn bad ass and still be
playing for the song. It's like,

1704
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,260
it's kind of like that David growth thing.
He's another fake,

1705
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:41,070
the drama that David Grohl did on
Queens of the Stone Age. It's like,

1706
01:47:41,071 --> 01:47:45,010
it kind of reminds me of
that. It's like he just, Ah,

1707
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:49,560
it's fucking unreal. The whole, it's
all there. It's all fucking there.

1708
01:47:49,561 --> 01:47:52,840
The dynamics, the building,
the excitement plane,

1709
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:55,680
not getting in the way of
anybody else he's playing with.

1710
01:47:55,681 --> 01:47:58,340
He sees the fucking shit.
Um,

1711
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:00,700
and I got to download some of this shit.

1712
01:48:00,701 --> 01:48:04,170
So if anybody knows what their
best album is, Russian circles,

1713
01:48:04,171 --> 01:48:06,830
please let me know when I'm downloading
that shit this week. Cause uh,

1714
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:12,030
I fucking the drummer alone, I got, I
got to listen to more of this stuff.

1715
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:15,510
All right. I know I'm babbling on here.
I'll, we'll end with this this week.

1716
01:48:15,570 --> 01:48:18,210
All right,
a little bit of advice here.

1717
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:24,150
Listen to this fucking situation. This
guy got himself into, um, all right, Bill.

1718
01:48:24,151 --> 01:48:28,260
My girlfriend is 10 years older than
me. Oh, Jesus. She has two kids.

1719
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:29,910
Oh Jesus.

1720
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:33,390
And has been married and divorced twice.

1721
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:38,880
Dude, what the fuck? I'm 26.

1722
01:48:38,910 --> 01:48:42,960
Jesus Christ college graduate.

1723
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:48,060
Has any of this made any sense to any
of you? Would anybody else be out there?

1724
01:48:48,061 --> 01:48:50,160
26 college fucking graduate.

1725
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:54,240
Have a girlfriend 10 years older than
you with two kids who's been married and

1726
01:48:54,241 --> 01:48:58,320
divorced twice. Good God man. He goes,

1727
01:48:58,321 --> 01:49:00,600
I consider myself somewhat intelligent.

1728
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:06,430
I'm sure you are, but
not in this area. Um,

1729
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:10,890
by that I mean you should have no problem
understanding this email. Well, yeah,

1730
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:12,690
I know everybody trashes me.
I know,

1731
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:16,290
I know I'm the worst when it comes to
reading this shit. So anyways, here we go.

1732
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:17,671
He says,

1733
01:49:17,671 --> 01:49:22,671
four weeks ago I found text messages to
some dude on my girlfriend's phone that

1734
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:29,121
although innocent enough made it clear
that whoever she was texting was on more

1735
01:49:29,551 --> 01:49:33,480
familiar grounds than just some
work colleague or a friend,

1736
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:38,160
Jesus Christ. Dude, is that
going to be a happy ending here?

1737
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:43,430
I confronted her about it
and it predictably led to
a lot of finger pointing.

1738
01:49:43,741 --> 01:49:45,780
We went back and forth and if and uh,

1739
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:50,800
for a few days and air it out our
grievances, but it seemed agreeable.

1740
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:53,860
Now he bakes I guess point number two,

1741
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:57,280
two oh two more weeks
passed by and Lo and behold,

1742
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:02,200
I find more text messages
from the same fucking guy.

1743
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:05,260
At first I tell myself,
okay,

1744
01:50:05,710 --> 01:50:10,000
maybe she can't break things off with
this dude so quickly, Jesus Christ,

1745
01:50:10,001 --> 01:50:13,000
who you know, sometimes liberal
thought is a, is a great thing.

1746
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:17,800
Like let's have a fair fucking trial for
somebody before we hang them from the

1747
01:50:17,801 --> 01:50:20,830
nearest tree.
But then this times it's fucking stupid.

1748
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:24,370
This is just liberal thought to the,
I mean,

1749
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:28,660
how much of a benefit of the doubt can
you give somebody, you know? So he goes,

1750
01:50:28,661 --> 01:50:32,470
so I confront her about it and this leads
to another round of finger pointing.

1751
01:50:32,730 --> 01:50:36,790
At which point she tells me
to pack my shit and leave.

1752
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:40,540
I'll do it. I'm gonna tell you right
now before I read the rest of it,

1753
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:43,930
that's fucking great. You didn't have
to do any dirty work. You're out.

1754
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,560
You fucking out. So anyways, he goes,

1755
01:50:47,561 --> 01:50:52,030
were separated for a week when she
asked me to come back and move in. Dude,

1756
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:57,490
this chick is a fucking psycho. Here we
go. We talk about our future together.

1757
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:02,470
How, sorry she is to have done
that to me, et Cetera, et cetera.

1758
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:03,640
For Fuck Sakes.

1759
01:51:03,641 --> 01:51:07,510
We even talking about getting married
when things finally fucking evened out.

1760
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:10,510
I was full of piss and
vinegar and felt vindicated.

1761
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:15,220
Vindicated that I was the one wronged
in the whole situation and that she was

1762
01:51:15,221 --> 01:51:20,221
actually making good by
taking responsibility for
what she had done through

1763
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:25,591
taking responsibility would have been
fucking after he do the second you see

1764
01:51:25,781 --> 01:51:27,850
those weird texts, just get,
I'm telling you right now,

1765
01:51:27,851 --> 01:51:31,150
just get out of the relationship.
There isn't, oh, sorry.

1766
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:36,370
Sorry about that. Now that that's
it. It's over. It's fucking over.

1767
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,920
Um, but whatever, you're 26, I
guess you still haven't learned.

1768
01:51:41,921 --> 01:51:46,230
I was dumb in my 20 self. Here we
go. Let's read the rest of this. Um,

1769
01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:50,200
all was well and good until she
didn't come home this Thursday night,

1770
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:54,910
November 11th. She came in Friday
morning with no explanation, no apology,

1771
01:51:54,911 --> 01:51:58,300
no nothing.
She asked me to give her some more time,

1772
01:51:58,301 --> 01:52:01,960
but I decided to cut bait and just
get the fuck out of this situation.

1773
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:06,190
Hang on a second, everybody. Sorry.
I had to give him a little applause.

1774
01:52:06,191 --> 01:52:07,720
Break there.
Of course,

1775
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:11,710
now I'm wracked with guilt of leaving
the woman I loved and live with for the

1776
01:52:11,711 --> 01:52:15,520
past five fucking year.
You got what her when you were 21 dude,

1777
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:20,410
she was 31. Wait, let's do the
math. She was 31. You were 21.

1778
01:52:20,411 --> 01:52:22,990
She was already married twice.
All right.

1779
01:52:22,991 --> 01:52:26,440
This chick's is psycho and you know what
that means? She's fucking great and bed.

1780
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:31,480
You were 21. She fucking devastated
you with fucking her pussy,

1781
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:35,740
right? Best blowjob. You have a
had. Isn't that what happened?

1782
01:52:35,741 --> 01:52:39,670
And next thing you know,
you have to fucking too young and dumb me.

1783
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:43,150
The of you fell for
Jesus Christ.

1784
01:52:43,151 --> 01:52:47,000
He stayed there for five fucking
years. So anyway, I guess just check,

1785
01:52:47,001 --> 01:52:49,850
still calling them. Tell him she
still wants to get back together.

1786
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:54,110
I feel like every time I sack up
and do what I think is best for me,

1787
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:58,430
she wants me back. And every time what
I do, what's best for us as a couple,

1788
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:03,200
she uses that as an opportunity to
fuck with me all over again. Yes. Yes,

1789
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:08,450
you're absolutely right. Listen
to your gut. This guy, see,

1790
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:13,910
he knows the fucking answers. He's
listening to his gut. Good fucking man.

1791
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:15,710
Um,
is this,

1792
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:20,180
is it just that chicks can handle a guy
that is emotionally invested or do I

1793
01:53:20,181 --> 01:53:25,181
just happen to be dealing with one of
those sociopath's that doesn't give a fuck

1794
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:29,000
what she does so long as it
suits her in the moment. Yes.

1795
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:31,670
This plenty of fucking good women.
That was not plenty.

1796
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:34,520
Goodwin's there's good women out
there. All right? Just like good.

1797
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:38,420
A good man's hard to find this. Finding
a good woman's also difficult. All right.

1798
01:53:38,421 --> 01:53:42,560
But no, you happen to be dealing with an
absolute fucking sociopath. All right.

1799
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:45,830
She had a fucked up childhood. Something
happened to her. She got touched.

1800
01:53:45,831 --> 01:53:49,070
Her fucking dad took off. I don't
know. Or She just got the fucking,

1801
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:52,730
she got one of those bad brains.
You know,

1802
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:55,460
I began to tell you guys my
theory on that, the a brain,

1803
01:53:55,461 --> 01:54:00,050
the bee brain and the sea brain, the
brain is the genius to be brain is the uh,

1804
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:02,450
oh, he's a good fucking shit. You know?

1805
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:07,930
Fitzy and then the sea brain is
your fucking mouth breathing moron.

1806
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:11,870
All right.
And when it comes to being a sociopath,

1807
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:16,730
that's like just a, that's just
like getting an option on the car.

1808
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:20,240
All brains come with that option.
It's all available like satellite radio,

1809
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:23,750
you know, you get satellite
radio in a fucking Bentley.

1810
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:26,830
You can also get it my fucking Prius.
All right,

1811
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:31,070
so did that make any fucking sense?
You got a sociopath with the fucking,

1812
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:33,950
she could even have the a brain.

1813
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:36,230
That's the sad thing about
having a fucked up childhood.

1814
01:54:36,231 --> 01:54:39,860
She could actually be a fucking genius,
but she's got the sociopath shit.

1815
01:54:39,861 --> 01:54:44,510
So tell her go call fucking doctor drew.
All right?

1816
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:49,370
And you get the fuck out of the
relationship. So anyways, he say,

1817
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:53,330
I'd imagine you'd agree that
I did the right thing. Uh,

1818
01:54:53,331 --> 01:54:56,840
but it always helps to get a little bit
of press, better perspective on it. Dude,

1819
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:59,900
I totally understand.
You've been in a five year relationship,

1820
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:01,910
you're emotionally invested in this shit.

1821
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:04,190
So you know what the right thing to do is,

1822
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:06,680
but your emotions keep fucking with you.
All right?

1823
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:10,400
So what you got to know is just look,

1824
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:15,020
going through a breakup is painful.
All right?

1825
01:55:15,021 --> 01:55:16,790
It's not going to not be painful,

1826
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:20,450
but just because it's painful doesn't
mean that it's not the right thing to do.

1827
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:25,490
You are 100 fucking percent
doing the right fucking thing.

1828
01:55:25,491 --> 01:55:30,110
Your 26 year old years old, you're in the
prime of your fucking life. All right?

1829
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:33,590
Get out of that situation. Okay.
She's 10 years older than you.

1830
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:38,120
By the time you're 29, she's going to
be hitting fucking menopause, all right?

1831
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:40,730
Or something like that.
Whatever. Sliding into it.

1832
01:55:40,731 --> 01:55:42,620
I have no fucking idea what
she's going to be doing.

1833
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,950
She's to be wearing those mom jeans
at that point if she's not already,

1834
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:52,510
which I don't think she is. She's
probably that fucking, you know that,

1835
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:55,540
uh,
that anorexic cougar look,

1836
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:59,210
you know where they got a varicose
vein in between their fucking,

1837
01:55:59,211 --> 01:56:03,620
you can see their breast plate, uh,
Jesus Christ will stay on topic. Yeah.

1838
01:56:03,621 --> 01:56:07,310
So to just get out of that, hang out
with your fucking Fellas, you know,

1839
01:56:07,311 --> 01:56:10,940
hang out with your buddies. Go out and
fucking have some beers. Join a gym,

1840
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:15,560
get fucking shredded. Go Out, start
talking shit when you're ready.

1841
01:56:15,561 --> 01:56:19,010
But don't go back to that man.
You dodged a fucking bullet.

1842
01:56:19,130 --> 01:56:23,680
The fact that you were with her for five
years and you didn't knock her up and

1843
01:56:23,681 --> 01:56:27,610
you got out of it, and even after
five years, you're only 26 years old,

1844
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:30,840
you made the best fucking move
you're going to make. All right.

1845
01:56:30,841 --> 01:56:32,160
And now this is what you need to do.

1846
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:33,750
You've been in a
relationship for five years.

1847
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:36,720
You need to be single for at
least a fucking year and a half.

1848
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:40,180
And I don't mean just be
single and fucking booze.

1849
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:44,930
Figure out what the fuck you looking
for. All right? And when you meet a girl,

1850
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:49,960
if she doesn't have it, just
walk a banger and leaf. You know,

1851
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:53,120
there's nothing wrong with
having a good fucking time,

1852
01:56:53,121 --> 01:56:58,121
but do not get sucked into another fucking
relationship because you're going to,

1853
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:03,300
cause you're going to have to go
through this shit again. You know? Well,

1854
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:05,330
you just sit there and you
know what's fucking wrong,

1855
01:57:05,331 --> 01:57:07,940
but you don't want to go
through the fucking pain of
it and you keep coming back.

1856
01:57:07,941 --> 01:57:11,170
It's a fucking nightmare. It's a
fucking nightmare. Good for you, sir.

1857
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:13,420
I'm fucking proud of you.
He did the right thing.

1858
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:16,390
You sorta a fucking wavering cause
you're going through the motions.

1859
01:57:16,391 --> 01:57:17,230
You're only 26.

1860
01:57:17,231 --> 01:57:20,450
She got with her when you
were 21 is probably your
first major fucking break up.

1861
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:24,490
So it's acceptable that you fucked
up and went back that second time.

1862
01:57:24,491 --> 01:57:28,570
But do not go back again and if any your
fucking friends are listening to this.

1863
01:57:28,571 --> 01:57:30,280
Don't let them do that shit.
All right.

1864
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:35,250
Time to a fucking bar stool and start
throwing drinks down his throat. Ah,

1865
01:57:35,251 --> 01:57:39,900
that's it. That's the Monday morning
podcast for this week. Uh, anything else?

1866
01:57:39,901 --> 01:57:42,810
Where am I going to be this week? Oh,
this week I'm going to be at the uh,

1867
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,350
the listener theater in Washington DC.
There's only a,

1868
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:53,300
I believe, oh, under a hundred tickets
left. I'm doing a bunch of radio,

1869
01:57:53,301 --> 01:57:54,970
so if you want to come out,
please come out.

1870
01:57:54,971 --> 01:57:59,230
I'll be hanging out afterwards doing a
meet and greet. I have my brand new DVD,

1871
01:57:59,231 --> 01:58:03,770
let it go. I'll be signing up, taking
pictures and all that type of shit. Uh,

1872
01:58:03,771 --> 01:58:07,580
Saturday night I got two
shows at comics at Foxwoods.

1873
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:11,440
Both shows are sold out,
but for those of you who have tickets,

1874
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:15,730
I will be showing up with my
DVDs afterwards, shaking hands,

1875
01:58:15,731 --> 01:58:18,280
sign and DVDs, doing all
that bullshit. And, uh,

1876
01:58:18,310 --> 01:58:20,410
thanks to everybody's been
coming up to me after shows,

1877
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:25,030
telling me how much they've a, that they
liked the, uh, the podcast and a joy.

1878
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:28,750
My latest special really means
a lot to me. And, uh, that's it.

1879
01:58:28,751 --> 01:58:33,290
You guys all have a great week. A, sorry,
the podcast is so late this week and die.

1880
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:34,960
That's it. Go fuck yourselves. See? Yes.
