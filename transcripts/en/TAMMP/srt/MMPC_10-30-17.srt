1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,800
Is this on? Is this all right? Here we
go. Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:09,060
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for mine. Gay Monday?

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,940
Yes. October. Uh, what's today?

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:16,860
The 28th 29th the 30th it's going to
be the 30th this is my first live.

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:18,780
Whenever I'm sitting on,

6
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:23,220
I'm at the very best it
very metro sexual couch.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,120
This looks like a lot of guys blue.
Other guys on this thing. This is,

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,790
this is sort of the reverse w hotel.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,220
The way they have this
thing like the w hotel.

10
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,270
It just looks like everything's been just
on and then a bunch of Yolo Douche has

11
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:41,910
had a threesome.
There is something this looks like.

12
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:45,480
Is there like a gay chain of hotels
that just caters to gay people?

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,571
You don't see,

14
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:51,210
this is why this is going to be weird
with the live crowd because to me that was

15
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,570
no big deal. Everybody got
real quiet. They're like,
it's like that was a problem.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,350
Is he trashing gay people or why is he
saying that there should be segregated

17
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:02,460
hotels? No, I am not. Okay.

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,270
I'm just saying that it would be nice
if you could separate them from the

19
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:10,860
general population in the hotels.
Okay. That's what I'm running on.

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,130
I'm going to out hate Trump and fucking,

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,510
whenever the next stupid election is
going to be, I'm going to out hate them.

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,930
I'm just going to start calling him a
pussy and I'm just going to fucking,

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,360
I'm going to hate even more than him.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,540
Then I'm going to get elected and then
I'll tear down whatever part of the wall

25
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,374
he made,

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,660
which I know is a hot button
issue here in Arizona. Oh yeah.

27
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:37,040
They should have the wall. Oh, they
should. They shouldn't. Um, yeah,

28
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,550
that's what I would run on a platform.

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,170
I would run on a platform that gay
people should have their own hotels.

30
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,460
I'm so sick of walking into lobby,
seeing men holding hands with other men.

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,740
It just started off on
something bizarre like that,

32
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,570
just so I can watch my opponent going,
wait a minute.

33
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:57,690
I never even thought about hating this.
You know,

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,480
why won't Hillary Clinton go away?

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,410
Why can't you just understand
that nobody likes her?

36
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:11,000
She just fucking hanging around just
like that fucking kid who just shows up.

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,330
Nick, nobody tell her this a party
and then she shows up. You know?

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,990
You know what happened with her and no
one ever poured blood on her at a fucking

39
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,160
prom. That's what they should have
done to finally fucking get rid of her.

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,050
You know, she just keeps hanging
around like she's a winner. You know?

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,750
Did Jim Kelly hang around after losing
four fucking super bowls? He didn't.

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,880
He fucking disappeared.

43
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:40,740
And every once in a while an NFL crew
finds the fucking guy and goes, hey Jim,

44
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:43,330
let's talk about your career.
Yeah, I don't want to, I really,

45
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,830
I really don't want to.
I did have a great career,

46
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:51,540
but all you want to dwell on the negative.
Oh my God.

47
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,230
She says, she says she tries to
me, you know, she's gonna fucking,

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,540
she's going to take volume.
You still can't hear it

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,150
louder.
All right.

50
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,730
This was the dumbest for you guys
listening at home who can hear this?

51
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,600
Totally fine.

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,010
There's like 500 people staring
at me right now bitching
that they can't hear it.

53
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,420
So I'm holding a microphone with the
yellow wind screen and a little fucking

54
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,840
lapel mic. All right.
As far as I can tell,

55
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,660
only the foreigners for some
reason can't fucking hear me.

56
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,780
Everybody has some sort
of Australia and x six

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,430
that's fucking people.
Foreigners coming in.

58
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,360
What the fuck did you come here for to
tell us how fucked up our country is?

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,360
I love when people come here and they
said bitching about this country.

60
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:40,580
It's just like, Dad, I don't do
that. When they go to Australia,

61
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,530
talking about how fucked up your
country is that only around the edges?

62
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:49,340
Is it livable?
It's fucking unbelievable.

63
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:52,880
If you can't see the ocean, you just
completely, you're in no man's land.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,380
No Man's land. 200 of the most
poisonous fucking snakes ever.

65
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,670
Do I say that when I go to Australia?
No, I don't. I just go, oh,

66
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:05,930
look at the surf. Oh my God. It's
gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful.

67
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,350
Look at that sad Tanguy
blowing into that giant horn.

68
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,540
I bet he used to own this view way
back in the day that his ancestors did.

69
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,790
What is the, what is the call
on that? You know what I mean?

70
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,280
I never understand that. When I was in
fucking Canada, the rule was what they,

71
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,540
what did they say? Like I, I
called them the, uh, the natives,

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,990
the natives of, of Canada, and they
got all fucking offended. They said,

73
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:37,730
we're called the originals. He, Reginald
everything with Canada's, he original six,

74
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,370
the original people,
you know what I mean?

75
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,210
The original recipe of whatever fucking
syrup they're trying to sell you.

76
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,270
You know what I mean? Tiny.
Everybody loves Canada and like,

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,800
they're a bunch of friendly people.
They're not,

78
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:55,160
they're all bunch of fucking
racist sticky people.

79
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,750
They're in a bad mood from yanking
that SAP out of the fucking trees.

80
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:00,501
And then what do they do?

81
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:04,130
They kick all the indigenous people
all the way up north, you know,

82
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:07,430
to give him a perimeter between them and
the polar bears. That's what happened.

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,840
You know, you ever see any of these
big Hollywood types talking about them?

84
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:16,100
Meryl Streep? You know, I
don't know why I picked her.

85
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,400
I'm still pissed at her that she said
the martial arts or not the arts.

86
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,670
Oh really? What would you
know about that? Oh, I get it.

87
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,550
You wear a wig and you pretend to
be other people. Like by all means,

88
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:27,440
let me listen to you about social issues.

89
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,210
You get your fucking God damn car
to go back to your gated community.

90
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,520
When does she ever see minorities?
Huh?

91
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,070
When she's looks into the front
seat of whoever's driving.

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,710
Okay.

93
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,060
By all means, Merrill. Tell me,

94
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,650
tell me what society is like
from behind your gated community.

95
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,990
Um, somebody told me today
that it's, it's there,

96
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,940
this legislation right now going through.
I don't,

97
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,330
where does it go through the government?
Um,

98
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,400
right now I'm thinking the
school schoolhouse rock songs.

99
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,380
Right now I'm just a bill.
Yes.

100
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:11,381
I'm only a bill and then it's off to
the White House where there's something

101
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,740
something and then it comes back to a
bunch of white men and they vote to see if

102
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:23,890
it will be a low, um, how I hope and pray.

103
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,360
Normally I wouldn't sing in public,
but I feel like I'm in my bedroom.

104
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,580
I have plush furniture
like this in my bedroom.

105
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,120
We're going that one with
the fucking overhang. Sorry.

106
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,900
Did this go out again
with the, sorry, sorry.

107
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:38,660
I'm sorry to each and every one of you,
especially the millennials.

108
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm sure you're fucking hurt about it
and you're going to Hashtag some sort of

109
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:45,970
me too. Me Too. I couldn't
hear either. Me Too.

110
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,000
Me Too.
I also had something bad happen.

111
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,440
Okay.

112
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,300
Hey, here's something you
can say in this country.

113
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:59,220
Three fucking meals a day may
tow me to first world country.

114
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:00,150
Me,
Joe,

115
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,110
flatscreen TV, me, Joe,

116
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,020
everybody dwelling on the negative is
fucking feminist, man. I swear to God,

117
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:14,380
I want to go to one of their events and
just get up to that microphone and just

118
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:15,910
be like, excuse me, can I,

119
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,970
is there anything good about being a
woman at any point during your day?

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,380
Are you like, thank God I'm a woman, or
I would have had to step in that muddy,

121
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,690
that mud puddle,
whatever the fuck I'm supposed to do.

122
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:32,380
I'm supposed to take my
fucking coat off, you know? Oh,

123
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:35,110
a little more respect for these feminists
when they care a little bit more about

124
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,880
guys, jackets, you know,

125
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,990
it's always a fucking issue
that they care about. You know

126
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,900
it.

127
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,900
In the 70s we were forced to wear clogs
in a lot of our mothers blew out their

128
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:50,020
ACO.
Sam gives a shit.

129
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,380
I'll listen to a feminist,
but not if she's white. You
know what I mean? It's like,

130
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,660
you know, I won't. Okay.
At the end of the day,

131
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:02,830
you were a white woman in
the United States of America.
What is the problem? Huh?

132
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,830
Did someone take away your
Rosé for the afternoon?

133
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,900
Did they shut down the fucking
trolley down at the mall? What?

134
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:14,680
What is happening in your world?
No, seriously. All right. Look,

135
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:17,020
if you live in some honey
booboo lifestyle, right?

136
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:21,880
You're living off the
appellation. Somebody got
rickets in Lyme disease, right?

137
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,060
Husband never wear a shirt.
You know what I mean?

138
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,340
It is. Where's that long underwear
with the trap drawer behind the back.

139
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,150
You know what I mean? You know he's going
out when he puts on his best overalls,

140
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,830
right? Those guys have it right.
Those guys know how to live out there.

141
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,890
If you truly want to get along with the
woman you've got to live on right off

142
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,060
the Appalachian trail,

143
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:53,150
you know you gotta be off the grid and
you just have to have no television. Okay.

144
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,150
And then you can slap her around you
want and she's never going to know.

145
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,460
This is just how it is.

146
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,310
You know what I mean? If you have a
dirt floor, like taking a beating,

147
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:09,480
it's not the big, it just seems like
party of life. It's like seamless.

148
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,370
The worst thing we ever did for women is
linoleum and like wall to wall carpet.

149
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,130
Then we lost all of our power.

150
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,910
Yeah, you've seen it. When
Twitter first came out,

151
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:27,020
women were just hashtagging
whatever you say and

152
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,980
now somebody is going to
take a snippet of that.

153
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,430
They put it on a fucking new show
and then I'm going to get in trouble.

154
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:43,431
Are you trying to say that women deserve
to be beaten on dirt floors and at that

155
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:45,660
point you just got to go
with it. Just be like, yes,

156
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,560
and I'm running for
president and fucking 20, 20.

157
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,890
It don't even get me started
with the gays in the hotels.

158
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,680
Okay.

159
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,220
That's right. You run the most
hateful fucking campaign ever,

160
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:04,310
but you don't wear the confederate flag,
but all of your suits,

161
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,600
if you look quickly have all
the colors of it. Alright.

162
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,880
And then in the end you just totally
flipped the whole thing. You flipped toll.

163
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:17,540
Think you have an openly
gay guy is a fucking, uh,

164
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,180
like sit-com level gay, you know what I
mean? Not like real gay, like TV, gay,

165
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,253
you know what I mean?

166
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,030
Okay.

167
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,520
TV, gay. It's kind of like
when you watch wrestling,

168
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:35,350
how they enhance their personalities.
That's what they do with, with gay people.

169
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,260
Bill on TV, they got to just go
fucking through the roof with the SAS.

170
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,520
You know what I mean? Rather than just
having a coming out. Surprisingly,

171
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:47,240
every once in a while, um, I don't know
what I'm talking about. It feels like,

172
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:49,550
what does this feel that come
along of, I'm a doing up here. Oh,

173
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:53,690
10 minutes and 48 seconds.
There you go.

174
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,400
This is my world. This is my life.
This is what I do. This couch is not,

175
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,830
this couch is,
feels like it was made out of old coats,

176
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,270
like a couple of old tarps or
some shit like that. I hate,

177
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:09,170
I was trying to be plush.
This was considered like right here.

178
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:11,390
This was considered fancy in the 70s.

179
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,150
If I could just get this lapel
Mike up here. This, this,

180
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,920
anytime there was a button that was sunk
all the way in it to try and make this

181
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,210
look plush.
You know,

182
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:23,450
even though it feels like fucking
week old bread that you lay in on.

183
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,653
Yeah,

184
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,400
honey, all I want is the key. This
is what I literally have to do.

185
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:31,170
I have to fucking put the mic down here.

186
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,650
It just won't clip on in any fucking area.

187
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,380
That is acceptable.

188
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,580
Now the people at home can't hear it
probably cause I clipped it onto them.

189
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,060
This was like the biggest lapel ever.
There we go.

190
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,480
She's just going to got a bumblebee
thought was supposed to be like barely

191
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:51,840
noticeable, isn't it? Um, all right. You
know what? I don't give a fuck. Let's,

192
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:55,420
let's read about some, let's up some
Phoenix news here. Phoenix News,

193
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,270
Ladies and gentlemen.
Let's see what's going on.

194
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,790
Greater feed eggs.
You know what this shows reminding me of.

195
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,880
Do you guys remember when cheers
went off the air at Jay Leno?

196
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:10,840
Tried to do it live and the whole cast
got shit faced. Do you remember that?

197
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,250
And he had nobody to talk to.
Fuck it.

198
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:19,030
We'll do it live. All right, let's
look up Phoenix News. All right,

199
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,660
what do we got here?
All right. Update woman.

200
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:26,830
Critically injured in West Phoenix.
Shooting has died.

201
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,393
Ah.

202
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,860
See a woman shot killed in
Phoenix early Saturday morning.

203
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,900
Standard that standard.
Okay.

204
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,190
Homeless man beats cvs
worker for sunblock.

205
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,143
That's a new one.

206
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,130
Suspect is desired.

207
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,540
Is described as looking like
if Che Guevara fucked a lizard.

208
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,503
No.

209
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,670
Phoenix police arrest. Suspect in deadly
shooting. What is going on out here?

210
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,730
Stolen truck from Phoenix.
Captured on speeding.

211
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,080
Why don't they have anything nice.

212
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,310
Phoenix wedding invitation
designers must serve.

213
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,630
L G B T oh Arizona.
Here we go.

214
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:23,470
They don't like mark and Luke Martin
Luther King. They don't like the gays.

215
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:28,220
All Jay Jay's, oh the goddamn
gays. What are they going to do?

216
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,650
Well, they're going to walk
around and enjoy themselves.

217
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,800
Get back in the house where God wants you.
Phoenix woman,

218
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,930
21 accused of abusing three year old boy.

219
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,920
See ladies, it goes both
ways. Women also beat men.

220
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,150
Let's read that one. This
is always uplifting, Huh?

221
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,230
I don't know why this, there it is.
Alright, there we go. Okay. Phoenix woman,

222
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:01,860
21 accused of abusing a three
year old boy. All right.

223
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:04,560
My first question is a juror be like,
well what did the kid do?

224
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,260
You know what I mean? Can the kid
walk? Is it big enough to make a fist?

225
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,730
You know what I mean?
There's no excuse to hit a woman.

226
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:17,730
So if this kid was punching on her,
you know,

227
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,680
cause it wanted to
breastfeed or some shit,

228
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,150
then I think she had every right to just
pick him up by his osh gosh bikash's or

229
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:27,300
whatever.
Push them right off that plastic pony.

230
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,600
A Phoenix woman who's been,
who has,

231
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,680
who had been reported missing earlier this
month along with a three year old boy.

232
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:38,640
Now face is child abuse charges in a case.
Court documents says,

233
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm not going to say her name,

234
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:43,040
but I swear to God to first
name books like Tequila. Uh,

235
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,700
21 was arrested Thursday on suspicion of
one count of child abuse in connection

236
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:52,590
with injuries to the toddler.
Oh, shake it off. Investigation

237
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,060
said in a court dog, I'm to see how far
into the beating of a child I can go.

238
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,900
Just how quiet this crowd's going to get.
Uh,

239
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,180
the child was beaten on its birthday

240
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,680
because it wasn't happy with the cake.

241
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,090
The suspect said, well, if
he didn't like the cake,

242
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:16,730
you're surely not going to like
this lit candle. All right,

243
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm not reading the rest of this.
I'm not reading the rest of this.

244
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,370
This is too sad.
I don't know what is wrong.

245
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,740
I take this bag. This is fun. Make. Could
you guys fucking really uncomfortable?

246
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm enjoying the shit out of this.

247
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,250
Let's read some more sad news in Phoenix.
Let's see how far down we can.

248
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,340
By the way, you can feel the downtown
here. It's about ready to blow up.

249
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,050
I'm telling you, you got a great food
area down the street. You got, uh,

250
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,870
you got an arena.
There's a cvs. C'Mon man,

251
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:54,870
that you, I can feel it. I sense this
and Cleveland and it turned around.

252
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,570
I knew it was going to happen in Detroit.
And who's kidding?

253
00:15:57,571 --> 00:16:01,700
Who Phoenix is the Detroit
of the southwest. It is.

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,380
You just never had a riot because you
don't let African Americans in your state.

255
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,820
That's what, yes, that's what it
is. Who suits says no to a day off.

256
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:13,470
You guys ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

257
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,440
All right. What else? Okay. Local
headlines. This is the one I'll,

258
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,300
I'll end it with this here. I don't want
to shit on you guys too much. All right.

259
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,640
Uh, valley traffic closures.
That's not exciting. Uh,

260
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,720
thank you for backing that
up, man. No, it isn't.

261
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,030
I did not pay money to come out and listen
to you to do the traffic report and I

262
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,400
can listen to it on my am radio.
Thank you very much.

263
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,770
County offers free dog adoptions to ease
the crowding. All right, let's talk. Okay.

264
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,830
We already got a fucking beat up kid.
Let's talk about abused animals.

265
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,460
Is My dog where in there? No,

266
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:58,570
my dog lives in a house out here that
I bought for it. So go fuck yourself.

267
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,730
What was happening is,

268
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,940
is the amount of money that I was
spending to board the dog was less than a

269
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:09,430
mortgage out here.
So I said fuck it.

270
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,550
And I set up like a Hugh Hefner lease

271
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,620
with my trainer. It's like, all right, as
long as the dog's alive, you live here,

272
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:21,220
rent free and you take care of it.
And I come out and visit whenever I want.

273
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:25,090
He's like, cool. I go when the
dog dies, uh, then you know,

274
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:28,120
you either buy the house so you leave it,
you start renting it. He was like, cool.

275
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,150
So you know damn well that dog's
getting fucking sirloin every night.

276
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,660
It's clear.

277
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,960
The dog's name is Cleo and she barely
remembers me now because she's getting

278
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:43,290
treated so well and fucking
house is nicer than my one in La.

279
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,410
Um, so there you go, Mr. Guilt trip
over there. Now let's talk about,

280
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,220
let's talk about

281
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,180
this shit over here.

282
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,230
Let's talk about what you
guys do to dogs in this state.

283
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:59,610
What is with this fucking
advertising? Yeah. Am I on Netflix?

284
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,513
What happened?

285
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,873
Yeah.

286
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,850
Coca Cola. We are so much
more than colon. Yeah,

287
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:13,800
you're fucking gum disease.
Whereas Nia,

288
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,080
she's right backstage.
She'll be out in a minute.

289
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,610
Tom fucking with you. She's at home
taking care of our child. Ah Ha.

290
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,330
Ah Ha. Not going to happen.
It's not going to happen sir.

291
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,030
Just like your dreams,
that is not going to happen.

292
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,390
Your dreams won't come true
in Nia is not coming out here.

293
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,380
Anybody watching that Texas
tech, Oklahoma Game. Jesus.

294
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:46,040
It was like no fucking difference
in that man. None whatsoever. Um,

295
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,690
by the way, thank you to everybody here.
Thank you. Thank you to everybody here.

296
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,680
That is, that has come out to the all
things, comedy, podcasts, a network,

297
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,880
our first ever podcast festival.

298
00:18:57,881 --> 00:19:01,710
It's been a smashing success. Did you
guys see when you walked in? We had them.

299
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,880
We had Caddyshack playing outside.

300
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,800
You can play that a corn hole fucking
game. You can drink a bunch of beers.

301
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:11,770
This is what it's all about. It's all
about hanging out, getting fucked up,

302
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,930
listening to morons who don't
know how to read, do podcasts.

303
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,350
That's what this entire thing
is all about. All right.
What do you guy huge still,

304
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,510
what about those fucking Houston
Astros going up two to one,

305
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,770
two to one against the La Dodgers.
I don't know who to root for in this one.

306
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,310
Cause you know I live in Los Angeles.
You know,

307
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,660
I know Houston just had that
hurricane, but it's over, right?

308
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,550
Everything dried up.

309
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,640
Whose fans look all happy and dry when
you watched the gay me almost so much to

310
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,650
the point I was just going
to look out nicest looks.

311
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,460
What was all the fucking
complaining about? Jesus Christ.

312
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:52,510
It rains a little bit and everybody out
in Houston starts losing their fucking

313
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:56,740
minds. You know? Do you think one of
them has ever sent a postcard to Seattle?

314
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,170
Those poor people sit in rain,

315
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,650
but like 360 days out of the fucking year,

316
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:07,600
I will guarantee you not a fucking peep.
Not a peep from Houston.

317
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,210
Houston. Jesus. What is shady
city? That is, Huh? NASA.

318
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,930
How many people down there do you think?
I bet that whole fucking Houston,

319
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,420
that whole fucking hurricane.
I bet it didn't even happen.

320
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,410
I bet they just let some
damn water go down there.

321
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:27,700
And it was all only excuse to kill
the last few people alive that,

322
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,570
that were part of the fake lunar
landing reenactment at NASA.

323
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,730
So they got rid of them

324
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,320
and uh,
what

325
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,400
else goes on in Houston?

326
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:41,580
They got the clan right outside
there that drags people to death,

327
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,810
which I'm suppliers didn't get an
applause break here in fucking Arizona.

328
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,463
MMM,

329
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,810
okay.

330
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,760
There was one other thing.
What the fuck was I talking about?

331
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:57,310
I was talking about now, then
they got Halliburton, Halliburton.

332
00:20:57,311 --> 00:21:00,910
That changed their fucking
name. I know, I know. I know.

333
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,280
We're over there to fucking, what are
we doing over there? We're, we're,

334
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:07,510
we're concerned about their freedom.
We've got to get these Iraqis to be free.

335
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,120
Um, oh, when it gets
awkwardly silent here, um, oh,

336
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,350
you know what I did. So anyways, I think
I'm going to be, I think I'm gonna.

337
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,360
I'm gonna tell you right now why the
fucking Astros are going to win the world

338
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:25,030
series. Okay? I'm going to tell
you why it's going to happen.

339
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,840
It has nothing to do with baseball. It
has to do the fact with dead. Jason,

340
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:31,390
lie ahead,
is rooting for the Dodgers.

341
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,870
He's here tonight. Jason [inaudible]
head grew up in Cleveland.

342
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,210
All right. He's fucked. Okay. Like
the second you come out of the womb,

343
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:47,200
that curse of that city just engulfed him.
And everywhere he goes,

344
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:52,000
he's like the mush and a a Bronx tale.
Just tear up your fucking tickets,

345
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:56,410
la. It's over. You're not
going to win another game. Um,

346
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,590
no, I have no idea. I'm actually
rooting that there's going to be a,

347
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,290
there's going to be seven gapes.
I hope it will be seven games.

348
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:06,940
Give me something to do. Um, I don't know
that there's going to be seven games.

349
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:10,570
Do you know that there's going to be
seven games, sir? Does somebody know? Oh,

350
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:12,580
because of the money you had
thinks it's all about the money.

351
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,060
That's why it'll give. That's why
I don't give to charities anymore.

352
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,500
I'm done with fucking charities. Only
give one fucking dime to Houston. Okay.

353
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:24,850
Do you want to walk up to me up
to your neck and water with a,

354
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:27,310
I live in Houston hat.
Then I'm going to give you money.

355
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,750
Yeah.

356
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,121
All right.

357
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:34,450
But I'm not giving to any of these fucking
things anymore because they're these

358
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:38,170
fucking organizations. They keep the,
I'm, I'm convinced that the most of them,

359
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,000
they just, they just keep the
fucking money. That's what's,

360
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,210
anytime you see a tragedy, just know that
there's a bunch of people going like,

361
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:48,160
I can make a bunch of fucking money
off of that Hashtag I care too. Right.

362
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,390
And then you give them $20 you feel like
you did your part. You know what I mean?

363
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,320
How much money they think Trump collected
before he went over there with those

364
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,710
bounty paper towels.
It just handed them out in Puerto Rico.

365
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,410
He must've made a fucking killing.
Yeah.

366
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,800
Okay.

367
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,810
Probably spent the rest
on hair plugs and fucking,

368
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,830
I don't understand how he became a red
head as he got older. I don't understand.

369
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:13,180
He had brown hair.
Six,

370
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,040
somebody transitioning like I don't get
somebody like changes religions. Um,

371
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,900
not all of this is gonna
make sense everybody.

372
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,810
You can't still can't fucking hear me.
I don't know what to do.

373
00:23:26,811 --> 00:23:29,540
Should I stick this in my fucking
mouth thing? Could you hear me

374
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,160
all right. How's that? Is
that good? Does this work?

375
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:36,780
Is this working for both of you?
Maybe if I clip this onto the,

376
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,300
onto the microphone. Um, Jesus Christ.
You know what this feels like right now.

377
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:44,270
This feels like when I was in summer
school and was just staring at the fucking

378
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:46,040
clock like 23 minutes,

379
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,570
23 minutes.
Jesus Christ.

380
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,140
Why did I wear a sweatshirt out here?

381
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,153
MMM.

382
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,440
Oh, by the way, I got to do, I got to do a
promotion. I got to do a promotion. I saw,

383
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:02,640
I went to a movie premiere,
uh, of the 30 for 30.

384
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,180
The nature boy,
ric flair is coming out.

385
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,200
I have to tell you this right now.
Might be the best 30 for 30.

386
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,770
I have a fucking saw.
Um,

387
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,340
it should be not it actually it
is 90 minutes. It is 90 minutes.

388
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:21,800
I thought it was only 30 minutes,
so it was 90 minutes, sir.

389
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,930
It wasn't your dream came true.
See that everybody,

390
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,850
I'm going to start a charity for this
guy and a portion of the proceeds are

391
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,120
going to go to towards him.

392
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:38,060
The rest of them are going to go
to me and a new fucking drum kit.

393
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,060
I'll put his picture on the bass drum head

394
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,430
each day. Thousands of people are
dying of cancer and I want a boat.

395
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,290
If you call this number,

396
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,440
Aye,

397
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,730
we can put a slight dent in it and I can
get the boat of my fucking dreams and

398
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:04,540
finally get rid of my wife and start
living openly with my mistress.

399
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,120
Please take the number down.
The first 300 people that call in,

400
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:15,121
we'll get a free tee shirt with a
donation of over three times the cost to

401
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:16,540
produce this tee shirt.

402
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,580
No one will check to see if the
t shirts were actually sent out.

403
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,430
That's the move people.

404
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,300
There's two fucking this three moves
to making this country at this point.

405
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:29,860
If you want to exist in the future one,

406
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:34,480
you either grow weed in anticipation
that it becomes legal at a federal level

407
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,040
and you can get it out of your fucking
state. Cause I know in Colorado they're,

408
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:43,210
I guess they're drowning in the shit.
They got more weed than they got hippies.

409
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,720
They got more.
Oh my God,

410
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,280
I got to tell you that the dirtiest look
and white people you're ever going to

411
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:53,120
see in your life

412
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,630
are in Colorado.

413
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,670
I can't imagine being a
minority in Colorado looking
at the white people there.

414
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:05,600
You gotta be thinking like, how the
fuck are we working for these people?

415
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,500
How were these people
running? Shit. I mean,

416
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:14,150
everybody just looks like they fell
into a vat of put Chuli. Right.

417
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,630
You know, are they always inner tubing and
shit? They just live outside that just,

418
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,650
I don't know that that's like
in the Denver area, you know?

419
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,980
Then you get out in the western part of
the states and then, then it gets better.

420
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,690
You know you got the Illuminati is in the
rocky mountains, you know what I mean?

421
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,930
They make sure it stays
nice and cold up there.

422
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:39,860
So the body of their first wife never, it
never melts away. You know what I mean?

423
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:40,730
That's what they keep doing it.

424
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,913
Yeah.

425
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,110
That's the code word. What you're going
skiing with your third wife today? Yeah.

426
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,170
We're going on the double black diamond.
That's code for,

427
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:53,320
I'm going to fucking steer into a tree.
You know,

428
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,530
that's what's going to happen when global
warming really hits and all the snow

429
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,510
melts up in fucking aspen and Vail.

430
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,510
The amount of dead women that
are going to be underneath there,

431
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,240
the amount of first wives,

432
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,280
the before I made my first million love,
you know what I mean?

433
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:13,550
When I was at the college level
before I went pro, you know,

434
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,980
I dunno. Sometimes I think you ought to
be able to kill your first wife though

435
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,633
because

436
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,380
there's like too many people on the
planet and then also could maybe like put

437
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,300
them on their heels.
Not saying you do it,

438
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,750
but just the fact that she
would know it was okay.

439
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,510
I think from where I sit,
whatever really positive effect

440
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,210
on the relationship, I think the reality
television viewing would go down.

441
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,303
MMM,

442
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,710
I should do these more because with you
guys laughing, I won't get in trouble.

443
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,840
You know what I mean? It's when I'm
by myself and there's dead silence.

444
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,390
It stops sounding like I'm fucking around.
And it sounds more like,

445
00:27:58,391 --> 00:28:00,370
is this guy reading
from his own manifesto?

446
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,923
Yeah.

447
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,150
Yeah. The audit come up with
creative ways to get rid of people.

448
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:12,320
I guess the optimal number,

449
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:15,200
according to something that somebody
sent me is 500 million people on this

450
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:19,220
planet and we're up to 6.5 billion.
So I think that there's,

451
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:20,540
there's things that you could do,

452
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:26,180
like a stop rescuing pitbulls.
You should just set them free

453
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,370
and let them wander the streets in packs

454
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,060
and then everybody has a cyanide pill,
you know? So if you get, you know,

455
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,460
if he wants to be ripped
apart by a pack of wild dogs,

456
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:46,840
you can just eat it every once in a
while. Or maybe you do that like, I dunno,

457
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,290
like there's some sort of incentive
for your family if you off yourself.

458
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,260
You know what I mean? And I figure if you
off yourself, that's an even better way.

459
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:01,200
Cause then they can like prepare rather
than just have a bunch of carcasses on

460
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:03,720
the side of the road that'll
cause diseases, which is good.

461
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,340
But after a certain point you're beat.
But once we get under 500 million,

462
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:11,640
now you just killing the chosen
ones, the blue chips. Right.

463
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,600
They should have like an NFL combine
to find, you know, you gotta get your,

464
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,370
like every country has to get their
roster down to a, down to a number, right?

465
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,830
Like you're allowed to
have 100,000 people.

466
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,840
You're not allowed to judge
it by race, religion, sex,
or anything like that. Right.

467
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,760
And you just have the
best of the best of race,

468
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:39,210
sex, religion, all of that fucking
shit that we care about. Right.

469
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,290
You just have that

470
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,830
cruise ships now. No cruise
ships. That's not going to work.

471
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:45,650
Cause that's also an
environmental disaster. I,

472
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,760
I regret doing that
bit on my last special.

473
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,870
I never thought of all
the oil that was gonna to

474
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,620
be seeping there.

475
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,650
So my new one is that you just let
him pull into port and then you just,

476
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,190
you just mowed them all down.

477
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,120
They die happy with his silly
hats and their flip flops.

478
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,573
MMM.

479
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,020
I know. None of that's right.
This is, is in a time like this.

480
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,080
Don't you think this
should be more caring?

481
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,730
Yeah.

482
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,780
Somebody told me today that they're
actually selling land on Mars.

483
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,970
Can I somehow get in on that?
Can I,

484
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,600
I'll sell you the whole
fucking planet for 15 grant.

485
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,750
You can get out there and figure
out there's no atmosphere.

486
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:45,810
Then you're going to die. Oh, that's a
shame. I mean, it's there. You can see it.

487
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,290
Look right through the telescope.
I sold you that.

488
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,810
If you can get there and breathe,
it's going to be all yours.

489
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,640
It's going to be all yours.

490
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,743
MMM.

491
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,280
That's the way you know
something right there.

492
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:05,050
That'd be the first wave of
how you get rid of people.

493
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,290
You Sell Land on Mars and
anybody that goes to [inaudible]

494
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,700
buy it, you go, okay, you won. You
got to be a little bit of land.

495
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:13,080
Come down here to claim it.

496
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:17,370
And then they walk into a room like
Joe Pesci and good fellas, right?

497
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,190
You put a gun to their head, you're
like, Hey, wait a minute. What the fuck?

498
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:22,860
It's like, well dude, you
obviously don't want to be here.

499
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,670
You'd rather go to Mars.
It's too crowded. You know

500
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,890
I'm going to send you to heaven,
man. You can see all the planets.

501
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,473
All right?

502
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,810
I like when people wonder if there's,
if there's life on other planets,

503
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,080
you know what I mean? Like why would you,
you know, who gives a shit if there is,

504
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,640
you can't talk to them. They're
too far away. You know it.

505
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,100
What if they're smart enough to get here?
Do you really want to wave your arms?

506
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,691
You don't.

507
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:57,720
Why don't you just hitchhike down the
fucking highway and see what happens?

508
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,110
All right,
I got to do some reads here for this week.

509
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,500
Oh, okay. Here we go.

510
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:08,260
Uh Oh look who's Oh Indochino in dope.
And don't cheat.

511
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:12,710
Oh, uh, talk about how every
man looks better in a suit.

512
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,850
You know what I'm having gay thoughts.
You know,

513
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,680
if I was going to fuck a man,
I would,

514
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,930
I would prefer that he
was in a suit because,

515
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:22,760
okay.

516
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,290
I didn't want to feel dirty afterwards.

517
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:27,460
I'd like to feel that I was with a
gentleman that was raised right know,

518
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,170
last thing I'd want to do is fuck a gay
guy from Denver wherein his flip flops

519
00:32:33,171 --> 00:32:34,790
and his fucking Hawaiian shirt.

520
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,980
It's probably be the last read for

521
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,890
these guys.
MMM.

522
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,091

00:33:24,341 --> 00:33:29,020
Sit there creepily staring at your front
door like that crazy Asian chicken,

535
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:34,021
that fucked up movie when she stares at
the phone before she pukes in a bowl and

536
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:37,960
it makes the guy eat it. Do you ever see
that one? Yeah, it's called the audition.

537
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:40,690
Check that one out,

anybody who could. A microphone. Okay.

542
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,550
This is probably some homeless guy outside
reading the exact same fucking copy

543

589
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,331
I don't know.

00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:22,560
This fucking windscreens is soft as
your taint when you were repair of this

I hate that fucking word.

595
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,990
It's either your ass, you know,
but it's just to, you know,

596
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,690
I'm an ass man. I just that word. Never
just, but that's, if you have a flat ass,

597
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:54,330
you have a bun over,
lower back down to your ankles.

598
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:58,830
You know what I mean?
That's how I'm built naked.

599
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,040
I have the exact same
silhouette is the pink panther.

600
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,100
Big Head. Big Feet. Just
fucking straight right down.

601
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:12,480
I swear to God you could hang
advertising off my backside. Um,

602
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,350
alright,
me undies makes undies.

603
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:19,170
Your Butt will be proud to
wear and check this out.

604
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,270
I'm not the only one who loves me undies.

605
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,940
Listen to my longtime
listener in me undies.

606
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,900
Enthusiasm George has to say.
Is this George Michael,

607
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,490
did he write this from beyond the grave?

608
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,960
Maybe he wore the first month me on these.

609
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:34,240
Remember that when he was shaking
his ass and I take a Woobie. Nice.

610
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:39,620
Then can you touch your body and fucking
Jerky Bob in a fucking Porta party?

611
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,513
MMM.

612
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,230
Then get rested.
We are cheesy pasta bowl.

613
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,053
MMM.

614
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,910
Wherein Myers fucking cowboy boots.
I liked that guy and now he's dead.

615
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,950
All right. A note from
George and um, a bill, burr,

616
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,540
listener and me undies fan.

617
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,680
I decided to try out me undies because
I love beep bill burrs, me undies.

618
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:08,560
Jangle I smile every time he sings it.

619
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:12,880
This reeks of being rewritten by the
advertising. What kind of man says that?

620
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,340
I just look out the window and smile.

621
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,650
Do you, do you just smile when you,
I don't believe a word of this,

622
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,770
although it's so easy to
skip ads in a podcast.

623
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,800
I always listened to bill's reads and
I'm so glad me undies has stuck with did

624
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:34,580
Al Gore right? This, it's, this
is about as sincere as him.

625
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,240
If I told you guys my theory on why
Hilary keeps fucking losing, um,

626
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,530
even though she only lost once,

627
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:44,510
it's cause she has Mike
Dukakis is charisma and she's
isn't comfortable in her

628
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:45,950
own skin is Al Gore.

629
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,160
And you combine those two and what you
have is a dope that loses to an even

630
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:55,610
bigger dope. Um, Oh man, this
is a Trump state. I can feel it.

631
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,800
Oh yeah. Is he making it better
for you? Oh, it's too late.

632
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,850
It's too edit chance. You had a
chance at a day off and you said no,

633
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,890
this is the fucking candidate
you've always been waiting for. Huh?

634
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:13,880
Just coming in wearing his red tie and
his fucking silk underwear telling you

635
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:17,010
how it is. Alright. Although
it's so easy to scale.

636
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,430
Who gives a shit about
this fucking guy smiling,

637
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,210
looking out the window with silky
balls. Uh, before me undies,

638
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:27,230
I used to buy a three pack of underwear
it retail stores until I realized that I

639
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:29,630
wanted to treat my junk to
something more comfortable in.

640
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,780
And that starts with a
great pair of me undies,

641
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:37,781
cradling the family jewels to get 20%
off the best and softest underwear and

642
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:42,680
socks you will ever own for free
shipping and 100% satisfaction guarantee.

643
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:44,230
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash bird.

644
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,200
That's me undies.com/
[inaudible] all right.

645
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:53,090
I started to hype something here. 40
minutes. Everybody just like that.

646
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,350
Just like that 40 minutes that
you'll never get back. Um,

647
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,330
I thought he was going to be standing up.

648
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:03,860
I thought there was going to be more of
a show. I thought there'd be show girls.

649
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,250
Um, I saw I might as well stand up.
It's so fucking hot in here. Um, oh,

650
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:12,470
he's standing up. He's, he standing up.

651
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,750
He wants the world to know
that the fucking podcast.

652
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,550
What do you mean speaking up?
I got to fucking microphones here.

653
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,710
How much more can I speak up,
sir?

654
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,020
Are they canceling each other out but
the amplification or they both colyte no,

655
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:32,660
you go. No, you go. We
were both born in the 90s.

656
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,840
I want to offend you with my
yellow skin and your black skin.

657
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,330
I want to sit in this big chair cause it,

658
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,650
I feel like I would think that I know
something over here. Here we are.

659
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another
episode of masterpiece podcasting.

660
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,570
Um, wow. This is weird. Now I got in here.
There's a whole new sound in here. Um,

661
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,850
I hate that I'm at the fucking old age
where I have to cross my legs when I sit

662
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,440
down. I don't know what
happened. I remember as a kid,

663
00:42:01,441 --> 00:42:05,010
you just fucking sat down and I got to
sit there constantly stretching out my

664
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:08,570
fucking hip.
This couch was supposed to be nailed down.

665
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,730
Um, so I saw the premiere of
the ric Flair, nature boy. Dude,

666
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,990
I don't think I've ever
fucking laughed that hard.

667
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,070
I mean I have to go back to
like a Richard Pryor special.

668
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:26,820
That guy is arguably one of the
funniest fucking human beings ever.

669
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,470
And I have to tell you something.

670
00:42:28,471 --> 00:42:31,260
What I can commend about
that guy in this nature, boy,

671
00:42:31,261 --> 00:42:36,261
30 for 30 that you have to fucking
see is he did not run from anything.

672
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,890
He owned up to everything
good or fucking bad.

673
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,260
They were sitting there
talking about like,

674
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:47,090
you know him fucking around on his
wife and he was just going yet you go,

675
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,460
how long were you faithful for in
your marriage? He just goes one day

676
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,700
and he was like, I couldn't
do it. I couldn't do it.

677
00:42:55,701 --> 00:43:00,701
I came home and I spent a day with my
family and I was like bored out of my

678
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:04,310
mind. I was in hell and it
was so fucking refreshing

679
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,240
to hear a married guy talk about how
badly he wants to continue fucking as many

680
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:14,730
women as he possibly could right now.

681
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:19,170
I know the laughs are going to go down
because there's too many women here and

682
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:23,120
every guy has to sit there and
act like he was, you know, like

683
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,730
probably thinking about it right fucking
now. I don't know. But, uh, yeah.

684
00:43:29,731 --> 00:43:34,731
You talked about everything just being
like just all the women he was with and

685
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:37,980
then one point they cut back to his
first wife where we calls number one.

686
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:40,960
Okay

687
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,270
though this guy is a fucking legend

688
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,770
and she just cuts back to him and she's
just like, yeah, Rick wasn't a family man.

689
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,120
I was doubled over laughing and then, you
know, it definitely has its sad points,

690
00:43:58,121 --> 00:43:59,170
but he doesn't run from it.

691
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,530
You can say he's a bad father or
if he's maybe like an alcoholic.

692
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,920
I don't want to ruin too many of the
lines, but he was just saying like,

693
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:08,680
I don't know if I'm an alcoholic.
I know I never tried to quit.

694
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:10,550
Okay.

695
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:15,550
It was just one fucking closing
bit after another with this guy.

696
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,530
It's like, I would close with
that. I would close with that.

697
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,710
I would close with that
and he just kept going.

698
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,510
He did tell this one story. I'm all
twisted up on my 20 fucking microphone.

699
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:31,770
He did tell this one story to the crowd
that was there. He talked about how we,

700
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:34,740
one night he was on the road and
he was out partying and he goes,

701
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:37,980
and I woke up with a couple of,
I guess I woke up next to an alien,

702
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,280
which is what he calls being like blackout
drunk and just waking up next to some

703
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:45,780
woman, you don't even know
her fucking name. So he goes,

704
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:50,220
I woke up and there was an alien alien
on one side and an alien on the other.

705
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:56,000
And I looked down at my Rolex was missing.
So I waked the women up and I go, wow.

706
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,300
Hey, where's my, where's my watch? And
they go, you don't remember? They go,

707
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:03,060
you don't remember? And he
goes, no. He goes, yeah.

708
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:07,170
Last night you through your watch
into a bowl of spaghetti and you said,

709
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,790
I got 15 of these fucking things.

710
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,320
Yeah.

711
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,180
This was just a throwaway story.
I mean, this is a comedy club.

712
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:27,050
This is a packed house. I'm killing
just remembering lines that he said,

713
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:30,170
I'm telling you have to
fucking watch this guy is,

714
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,550
it's like I'm telling you, they ought
to give him like the Mark Twain Award.

715
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,090
They're always given it to like
these, these fucking people, you know,

716
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,950
I'm dealing with, they give it
to some people that are funny,

717
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:41,180
but then other times they just,
you know,

718
00:45:41,181 --> 00:45:44,270
sometimes it's like that guy is
not as funny as fucking ric flair.

719
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,120
You've got to get him in
there, you know? You know,

720
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:49,160
they wouldn't know cause
it's always like the, uh,

721
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,540
the arts and mere Meryl Streep
and Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Get the fuck out of here.

722
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:54,510
You don't,

723
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:58,100
you think she could fucking be that good
an actress after a couple of back body

724
00:45:58,101 --> 00:45:58,934
drops.
Okay.

725
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:05,270
You think she could do the flare flop
and kip that keep that period correct wig

726
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:09,230
that she has on, I dunno why I'm trashing
Meryl Streep. I have no idea why.

727
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,870
You know why? Because she's always
getting awards, you know? Yeah.

728
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,150
Fuck her for doing such great work.

729
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:24,410
It's the dumbest shit. You
know, this business works.

730
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:27,650
If you trash anybody, you, you
inevitably you end up working for them.

731
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,770
I can't tell you how many times that's,
I'd haven't gotten a lot of acting work,

732
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:34,370
but every time I've ever gotten acting
work and I'm in the fucking hair and

733
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:36,680
makeup, I always get to skip
the hair part. Of course,

734
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,690
I go over to the makeup
side of the trailer.

735
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,960
Inevitably somebody comes walking in,
I'm like, Oh shit, I trashed that person.

736
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,210
I hope they didn't hear that podcast.
All right. Um, I think that was it.

737
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:50,990
You guys want to listen to some reeds
here for this week? Can you hear me?

738
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:55,340
Is Everything fine? Is this, is this
working? How has this been so far?

739
00:46:55,341 --> 00:46:58,520
If you guys enjoyed this,
is this something I should do more of?

740
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:00,903
All right.

741
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,490
I've already have one guy. There's
always going be one guy, boring.

742
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,170
I didn't like it. All right. Uh,

743
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:12,220
on Monday I discussed silkworms and how
they take the spittle from a silk worm

744
00:47:12,951 --> 00:47:17,540
and that's how they make a silk shirt.
Um, somebody goes silkworms, hey,

745
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:19,940
you ugly red faced fucking Twat.

746
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,540
You really think silk shirts are
made from silk worms. Really?

747
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,010
Jesus fucking Christ,
Dude. Just think about it.

748
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,050
Just think about that for a second. Bless
your heart bill. But sweet. Fuck man.

749
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,930
Get your act together
and go fuck yourself.

750
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,840
You know what's funny is I did and I
still do until I was thinking like, wait,

751
00:47:42,841 --> 00:47:46,590
well how would they turn
that spittle into thread?

752
00:47:46,591 --> 00:47:48,990
But I also used to think that a fucking,
uh,

753
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,510
I used to think a pony
was just a little hoarse.

754
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:59,430
I did and I remember these people down
the street. They had, they had up,

755
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:02,310
they had a,
a little pony and I just remembered,

756
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:03,450
I just remembered thinking of why won't,

757
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,200
when is that thing going to
fucking grow up and become a horse?

758
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:08,701
And I finally,

759
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:12,720
one day I asked my mother when I was
like 15 and she just looked at me like,

760
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,840
how did you come out of me?

761
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,910
What do I Google here? What is silk made
out of? It's just going to say silk,

762
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,300
but what? They shouldn't call
it a fucking silk warm. Then

763
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,470
what is silk made at?
What is silk?

764
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,810
Oh fuck you sir. This shit I know
that you don't know. Okay. Oh,

765
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,080
everybody likes to feel
so God damned smart, Huh?

766
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,110
What is silk made of?

767
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,010
Yeah.

768
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,810
This right here.
If there's ever a hunger games,

769
00:48:47,811 --> 00:48:49,280
I'm definitely not gonna
make it right here.

770
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,690
The protein fiber of silk is comprised
mainly of fibrin and is produced by

771
00:48:56,451 --> 00:49:01,010
certain insect larvae to form cocoons.
All right. That was kind of right.

772
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The best known silk is obtained from
the cocoons of the larva of the Mulberry

773
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,650
Silkworm. Wait a minute. Was I right?

774
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:11,563
Yeah.

775
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,000
What the fuck? Well, it
wasn't spitting it out.

776
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:18,580
I thought it was basically
a silkworm spiderweb.

777
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,680
Why would a warm make a spiderweb
bill? Maybe so. What's, I don't know.

778
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,173
MMM.

779
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:34,070
There's another way to make money off
of suicidal sink. Silkworms each year,

780
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,260
over 30,000 silkworms

781
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,690
commit suicide.
And I would like to buy a Tesla.

782
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,900
So please send your money in.

783
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,960
All right. Fat But fit,
uh, Billy, no roles.

784
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:55,883
Uh,

785
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,810
a study just came out that speaks to
everything you've said about being fat

786
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,050
almost automatically.
Meaning you're not healthy today.

787
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:07,920
There are a lot of people who say you
can be in good health while carrying fat,

788
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,000
but that's just to soften the blow
to people who can't lose the lard.

789
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,650
All right. Anyways, thought I'd share.

790
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,350
You're not as dumb as Naea says you are,

791
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:25,850
but maybe still a bit of a moron.
Just kidding. Go Fuck Yourself.

792
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,950
I ain't no idea how much you guys
laugh at these people shitting on me.

793
00:50:31,951 --> 00:50:36,060
I thought, I thought you were all sitting
at home as offended as I was going. Hey,

794
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:41,160
don't say that about bill.
Bill was my podcast friend.

795
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,110
Well, well, well,

796
00:50:43,111 --> 00:50:46,050
well I guess you get to see all your
fucking friends are when you do something

797
00:50:46,051 --> 00:50:49,270
live.
All right.

798
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,510
I don't know if this is how
bad my short term memory's.

799
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,730
I don't even know what the fuck I just
said. I didn't want to just read that.

800
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:58,900
You can be a fed. Yeah. Oh yeah,
no. Yeah. You don't want to be fat.

801
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,600
Like that's a big thing now to be
fat and be proud of it, you know?

802
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,680
And they talk about fat shaming and all
that Shit. It's just like, you know,

803
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:08,410
you should just ignore what everybody
says and you should listen to your heart

804
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,010
going for the love of God. Lose the
weight. I'm going to conk out here.

805
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,100
Okay.

806
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:20,040
Ah, that was a cheap joke. That was an
easy one. I set you up, you know, easy.

807
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,360
I took you to the left and then
I went, right. That's what I did.

808
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:26,840
That was the old misdirection. You'll
comedy crossover there. All right.

809
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:32,050
Nestle cunts. Nestle cons.
That's right. Oh yeah,

810
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:35,160
they're the ones. They're the ones
causing all the wars. Hey there,

811
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,280
Billy in the mirror.

812
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,050
A saw this article about Nestle that
I thought might ruffle your feathers.

813
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,150
Uh, the line, the byline
says it all. Okay. Uh,

814
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,220
this year, this year is
Halloween confectionary. Oh,

815
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:53,920
this is so great. I have people hit
what the f what is a confectionary?

816
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,840
It's a white,
it's a candy store.

817
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,110
What kind of an asshole
calls it a confectionary.

818
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,480
You know what's funny? I got this
acting gig right now, by the way.

819
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:13,440
I got to promote the movie.

820
00:52:13,441 --> 00:52:16,320
You got to see it next to probably come
out next year. It's called front row.

821
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:22,320
Front runner Starts Hugh Jackman
as Gary Hart. If you're old enough,

822
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:26,790
you remember Gary Hart? Yeah, Gary Hart.
We went a little ric flair on the road,

823
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:28,440
right?

824
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,980
He banged some woman and then all of a
sudden he couldn't be president anymore

825
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:32,520
and that's how,

826
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,780
that's how Bush got in because this
guy was a good looking guy and uh,

827
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:40,470
all the ladies liked him. And that's all
you need to do to win the presidency,

828
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:44,940
right? You play the saxophone, you
hit a jump shot, you know what I mean?

829
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,740
You do something like that and then
everybody fucking loves you anyways,

830
00:52:49,741 --> 00:52:51,750
that's coming out. By the
way, all you hear on a,

831
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:56,430
on a movie set is people go and
copy that, copy that, copy that.

832
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:59,250
I need this, go over there,
copy that. And I get it.

833
00:52:59,251 --> 00:53:02,340
When you say it into like a fucking,
uh, you know, you're on a little,

834
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:05,880
your little CB radio copy that.
I get that, you know what I mean?

835
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,690
But people say it to just other
people. Now, just one person will be a,

836
00:53:09,691 --> 00:53:13,530
can you move that over there and
the guy go copy that. It's like,

837
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:17,700
why don't you just say, okay, it's a
lot quicker. Can you move that? Okay,

838
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,180
got it.
Copy that.

839
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,220
Those are the same kind of
people that call a fucking

840
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,150
candy store. Confectionary. All right.

841
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,423
Yeah.

842
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,980
Hey, that's my, then that's called a
callback. The guy just goes copy that.

843
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,680
He was waiting for the end
of the bit. See that? Now,

844
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:43,130
how does he know about callbacks?
How does he know?

845
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,210
Because Netflix has released
30,000 standup specials this year.

846
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:53,270
The creating a comedy special
housing bubble over there.

847
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:55,443
MMM.

848
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,670
Come Watch. The greatest open miker
is do an hour of their best material.

849
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,530
That's who they are down to.

850
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,900
At this point there's like
everybody has an hour special.

851
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,813
MMM.

852
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,500
I'm going to freeze myself after I die.
Don't they have that here?

853
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:17,640
The cryogenics right next
to the confectionary. Right.
I'm going to freeze myself.

854
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,410
So then when they figured
out how to cure death,

855
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:21,750
they can unfreeze me
and I could do a bit of,

856
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:25,170
I can do an hour long one man show on
Netflix about what it's like to be in a 40

857
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:30,000
year coma. All right. Net,
uh, Nestle, everybody. Um,

858
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,640
by the way,F is for family.
Please watch that on Netflix.

859
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,570
Now that I've made fun of them.

860
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,810
Just scroll. If he can't find it,
just scroll left for like 20 minutes.

861
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,270
MMM.

862
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,440
Anyways,
this year is Halloween.

863
00:54:50,441 --> 00:54:55,441
Confectionary will contain palm oil
grown on land that should lawfully be

864
00:54:55,511 --> 00:55:00,430
habitat. Be Habit by, can't
read this. H A. B. I t a t

865
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,360
lawfully be habitat to orangutans.

866
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:08,470
I was always a rang a tank
like the drink orangutans,

867
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:14,150
rhinos and clouded leopards.
I don't know why.

868
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,910
What the fuck that is?
Uh,

869
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,750
despite commitment to
clean up supply chains,

870
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,300
this is on top of them.
Siphoning. Yeah. This is, this is,

871
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:29,200
you know, a lot of times it's not me. This
is the sentence. This is on top of them.

872
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:32,440
Siphoning. I fucking screen just went.
I'll just finally gonna make a point.

873
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,900
This is on top of them siphoning.

874
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:39,660
They do have water from national
parks that you've spoken about.

875
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,330
I guess they take water out of national
parks where they had agreements with

876
00:55:43,331 --> 00:55:47,590
native American tribes
that have since expired. A,

877
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:50,230
what's it going to take to
end Nestle's corruption?

878
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,750
Maybe you can take this up as your,

879
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:56,500
cause the way the first lady's doe,

880
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:02,050
um, this is how you stop that. What'd
you'd have to do is have politicians,

881
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,340
politicians have to start earning fuck
you money rather than being grossly

882
00:56:06,341 --> 00:56:09,940
underpaid. The fact that, you
know, as a podcast or comedian,

883
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,970
an actor you can make almost as much,

884
00:56:12,971 --> 00:56:16,600
if not more money than the president of
the United States is fucking pathetic.

885
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:17,710
You know what I mean?

886
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:21,730
They should have fuck you money
the second you become president,

887
00:56:21,731 --> 00:56:23,560
that she'd just be like, like, you know,

888
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:26,860
like a pitching machine that's just throw
in one fucking heater over the place.

889
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:29,020
Just be a bag of money
the entire time you there.

890
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,120
So then when these guys go, Hey, can
we siphon this fucking Outta here?

891
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:37,720
You can be like, no, fuck
you. Well, if you doubt, uh,

892
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:42,070
we won't help you get reelected. I
don't give a fuck. I got fuck you money.

893
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,050
It probably wouldn't work. I don't
know. Sometimes I have good ideas.

894
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:49,900
Sometimes I don't. Um, so I guess, yeah,

895
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,740
don't buy any Nestle crunch bars
everybody and stay away from their bottled

896
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:58,380
water and whatever else they
make. Do they make thongs? Um,

897
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,683
all right.

898
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,300
Do you feel how the podcast
just immediately fucking
slowed down the second I

899
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:08,470
started reading out loud. It's fucking
unbelievable. Oh, why do I do this?

900
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:12,010
Why do I do this to myself? What is the
shame? Is it, cause I was raised Catholic.

901
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:16,480
All right. Accidentally made two
girls, my girlfriend. All right.

902
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,560
I like this guy already.
Hi William. The bald

903
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:27,820
big fan from Kenya. Oh, this is
a second language. All right.

904
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:30,640
Love the podcast andF is
for family is amazing.

905
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:36,330
That's amazing that you can watch it
over there. Um, no, you should see,

906
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,520
go on f go on the Internet. You can
actually watch all these people. You know,

907
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:40,720
you know whatF is for family?

908
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:44,830
I feel like captures the frank character
that's loosely based on my dad.

909
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:49,510
You know which one I think does
it the best is Mexico. You know,

910
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,720
cause they got a lot of fucking same
kind of people screaming and yelling,

911
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,210
temper. You know what I mean?
It just fucking works great. Um,

912
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,450
some of that'll come off as racist, but
it was supposed to be a compliment. Um,

913
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,860
long story short,

914
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:07,950
I have had a crush on two ladies in
my college class for over four years.

915
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,270
Jesus Christ. This guy moves slow, Huh?

916
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,040
Aye.

917
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:18,000
Now one of them is dying of ovarian
cancer and I feel like it's too late. Ah,

918
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,280
Geez. It's not that we
care. We care in Phoenix.

919
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:25,703
Huh?

920
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,000
I bet you guys all
pictured a white vagina.

921
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,543
Yeah.

922
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:36,490
Fucking act like you guys care how you
can try to bully me into your fucking

923
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:37,540
phony given a shit.

924
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,750
They probably showed that hurricane and
fucking Houston on comedy central out

925
00:58:45,751 --> 00:58:50,670
here. That's a little you people
care guys are all about yourselves.

926
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,603
Yeah.

927
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:01,200
All right. All I, all right. I
don't even know where I am and this,

928
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:06,080
I don't know how you follow
a white vagina next day.

929
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:10,610
And I'm up for bids. A
white vagina. Mika did Mika.

930
00:59:10,611 --> 00:59:14,710
I'm auctions for serial killers.
It would just be like women's body parts.

931
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,970
Oh, we're so offended.
Oh fuck. All of you.

932
00:59:18,971 --> 00:59:21,250
I'll steer even harder into it.
MMM.

933
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,920
Did you hear that? They're going to start
having Jeffrey Dahmer Day in Wisconsin.

934
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:31,320
That's true.

935
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,320
They have an all you can eat ms and
all you can eat mystery meat day in

936
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:37,824
Wisconsin.

937
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:42,030
They're trying to change the perception
that all they do is eat cheese up there.

938
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:47,600
See, we done groaning because
I'll keep fucking going on.

939
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,620
All right, so this guy had a crush on
these ladies for four fucking years.

940
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,620
But since breaking up with my
previous girlfriend three years ago,

941
00:59:58,621 --> 01:00:01,080
I decided to not get into
another relationship.

942
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,390
So the whole time you with
this girl for three years,

943
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,480
you had a crush on two other women
for four years. I love this guy.

944
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:09,360
He's a fucking mess.
Um,

945
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,780
all I did with these two girls was
light flirting from time to time.

946
01:00:12,781 --> 01:00:14,250
What is light flirting and Kenya.

947
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,060
Um,
what

948
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,140
I was going to do some starving Joe,

949
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,970
you want a piece of bread just fucking
with you. Ah, you're going to have it. Um,

950
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,070
he's going to write back
next, next week. Dear bill,

951
01:00:31,071 --> 01:00:35,060
we are not Somalia or Ethiopia.
We actually have food in Kenya.

952
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:36,960
Okay.

953
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,880
Running water and skyscrapers.

954
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:40,953
MMM.

955
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,400
Anyways, all I did you all he did was
flirt with one of them is the fun,

956
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:51,570
friendly kind,
but she's kind of loose parentheses,

957
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,650
open relationship and sending nudes types.
All right, so that's the one you bang.

958
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:58,800
You fucking, you're double rapid, right?

959
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,580
You double rapid and the
other is conservative.

960
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,480
The other is conservative.
Introvert, Virgin.

961
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:08,910
But I didn't really enjoy her company.
All right.

962
01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:11,910
There's the one you have kids
with. This is an easy one. Well,

963
01:01:11,911 --> 01:01:15,330
a few days ago it was my
birthday and I had both of them.

964
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,550
And you had both of them. You just going
to stop there. You bank both of them.

965
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:20,641
Well,

966
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:25,641
she's not a virgin anymore now is she at
both of them and some few friends over.

967
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,550
This is his second language
and I can't read for a party.

968
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,160
I had a shitload of booze and was on,

969
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:37,220
I'm going to guess right now the one
that he thinks is loose held her alcohol

970
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,380
and the Virgin Blue.
Everyone at the party,

971
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,613
what I'm going with,

972
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,540
maybe I'd been in Hollywood too long,
but this can't be linear.

973
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:51,770
It has to make a left turn at some
point to spin us into the second act.

974
01:01:56,350 --> 01:02:00,580
Okay, well, a few days ago it
was my birthday and I, okay,

975
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:03,490
and in both over I read, right, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. They came over.

976
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:06,880
I had a shitload of booze and
was on autopilot the whole time,

977
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:10,990
but apparently I had the balls to ask
the two ladies to be my girlfriend.

978
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,250
All he was drunk.

979
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:13,870
Okay.

980
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:17,710
I don't believe this is a true story or
did he watch some Kenyan version of the

981
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:22,410
Brady bunch
when Peter has two dates in one night up,

982
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,480
a few days later I get a text from both
of them asking whether I was serious

983
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:28,590
about asking them out.

984
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,740
I'm now in a huge dilemma of choosing
between the two who I really like and the

985
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:37,800
fact that I haven't been in a relationship
in a while and basically forgot how

986
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:40,710
to be in a relationship.
Oh, shut the fuck up.

987
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,960
You remember exactly how
to be in a relationship.

988
01:02:42,961 --> 01:02:44,160
That's why you don't want to be in one.

989
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,830
Okay.

990
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,910
Any advice would be appreciated and uh,

991
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,700
okay. And uh, Ooh,

992
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:59,500
Jen denia which is Swahili
for go fuck yourself.

993
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,360
MMM.
Okay.

994
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,240
All right. Well I think, uh,

995
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:09,330
yeah,

996
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:13,050
I think you got to go with the whore.
You know,

997
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:17,550
if you don't want to be in a relationship,
but you did say girlfriend.

998
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:19,843
MMM.

999
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,430
I would just own up to it. Just be,
just be like, listen, I've been,

1000
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:26,920
I was totally shit faced when I sent that,

1001
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:28,930
but I have had a crush
on you for four years.

1002
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:32,140
You always got to go with honesty
with women guys go into it. You know,

1003
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,500
you always think you got to lie to him
and all of that shit. You got to just,

1004
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,130
you just fucking lay your cards on the
table. It's the best thing he could do.

1005
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:42,370
She, they won't get mad. They might get
a little upset depending on what you say,

1006
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:46,870
you know,
it depends on how graphic you get.

1007
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:52,270
Where do you see this
going? I see you, uh,

1008
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:56,740
laying off the edge of my bed on your
back with your head hanging off as I fuck

1009
01:03:56,741 --> 01:03:59,860
your mouth while watching sports center.

1010
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,750
Okay.

1011
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,800
That might be a little too honest.
You could just say, um, you know,

1012
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:07,130
just looking to have a good time.

1013
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,380
I would just go with the honesty.
I would tell both of them, dude,

1014
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,510
you should use the fact that you're
not in a relationship right now.

1015
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:23,120
You get to hit the reset button
and you just go total. Honestly,

1016
01:04:23,121 --> 01:04:25,320
I would tell them exactly
what the fuck happened to say.

1017
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:27,740
I had crushed on both
of you for fucking food.

1018
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:29,150
I wouldn't have talked to both same time,

1019
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:33,680
but I would say I sent it to two
different people and that's what I did.

1020
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:37,970
And then just wait to hear what they say.
That's it. And if they don't like it,

1021
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:42,410
who gives a fuck? Take you
and your honesty to the next
situation of telling you,

1022
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:47,720
all right, that's the best way to handle
the fucking thing. Uh, then, uh, I dunno,

1023
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,770
somehow you just tell them
what's going on out. Christ.

1024
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:51,170
They get to tell the story.
Here's a story for you.

1025
01:04:51,171 --> 01:04:53,060
One time when I learned about honesty,

1026
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:58,550
I was in my fucking early to mid thirties
and I was just sick alliance and I met

1027
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:02,870
this chick. She was like 22 years
old. So we get back to my apartment.

1028
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:05,060
This lady's leaving right now. She
can't bear to listen to this, right?

1029
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:05,943
No.

1030
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:12,800
So we get back to my apartment,
you start making out and everything,

1031
01:05:12,801 --> 01:05:15,380
and she goes, wait a minute. She
goes like, when his second, she says,

1032
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,400
where's this going? And I said, nowhere.

1033
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,430
Oh, are you kidding me? I go,
I'm like 50 years older than you.

1034
01:05:23,431 --> 01:05:27,540
By the time you're 30, I'm going
to be like 86 years old. All right,

1035
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:32,420
this is going to go nowhere.

1036
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,740
So whatever you want to do sexually,

1037
01:05:36,741 --> 01:05:39,980
but you don't want to do with
somebody that you like you do with me,

1038
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:42,223
right?

1039
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,070
And then you'll never have a midlife
crisis because you got it out of your

1040
01:05:47,071 --> 01:05:51,660
system. And you know what she said?
She went all right. That was it.

1041
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:54,263
Yeah.

1042
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,420
They're not as prudish as you
think they are. Don't be afraid.

1043
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,410
That's the number one thing you gotta.
You gotta go with the fucking honesty.

1044
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:04,420
Yeah.

1045
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,310
Do you like me?
No.

1046
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:13,510
No. You don't have to be meat. You
don't have to be me. I like you,

1047
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:17,140
but not like that.
All right.

1048
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:21,820
Girlfriend loves my long hair.
I don't. Oh, go fuck yourself.

1049
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,480
Jesus Christ. What are you gonna do
next? Go Up to somebody with leukemia.

1050
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:31,720
My girlfriend loves my sick,
free body, but I don't,

1051
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,000
I just love how you guys
have this thing with disease.

1052
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:37,930
What is it with you guys and disease?
Why does it make you so sad?

1053
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:43,030
It's mother nature trying to help us.
They should close down all the pharmacies.

1054
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,750
Okay. And if you're lucky enough
to be disease free, you live.

1055
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,330
That's what we need to do.
Tough decisions have to be made.

1056
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,183
MMM.

1057
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,210
Okay. So I've been growing
my hair out for a while.

1058
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:00,883
MMM.

1059
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:06,630
Since I enrolled in college. Oh two,
that's the time to do it. Good for you.

1060
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:07,740
Grow your hair out.

1061
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:12,930
Livia Steven Seagal years
in your 20s get by a sword.

1062
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,550
Sit there Indian style,

1063
01:07:14,551 --> 01:07:18,390
meditating out on the fucking some
sort of bluff or would I never went to

1064
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:22,230
college. Really? I never lived there.
What do they call it out on the compound?

1065
01:07:22,231 --> 01:07:25,170
The uh, the quad area, the grassy area.

1066
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:30,720
Just try to act interesting anyways
and I'm about to graduate this upcoming

1067
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:31,470
spring.

1068
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:35,610
My girlfriend in a few friends convinced
me to grow my hair out since they are

1069
01:07:35,611 --> 01:07:39,090
all the hippie type. Ah,
that's not the cool long hair.

1070
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,330
Skype probably goes to
the University of Denver.

1071
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,470
I don't consider myself a hippy at all,

1072
01:07:46,471 --> 01:07:50,310
but that is the crew I run with since
I have known most of them since back in

1073
01:07:50,311 --> 01:07:53,460
high school and they are
all close friends. A couple
of them have long hair too.

1074
01:07:53,461 --> 01:07:57,030
I was open to the idea since I've had
short hair for most of my life before that

1075
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,640
the long hair turned out
looking pretty good too.

1076
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,970
My girlfriend though loves
the long hair on guys.

1077
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:07,140
A few days ago I told her passingly that
I've been thinking about cutting it and

1078
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:10,140
she immediately seemed
really concerned saying,

1079
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:13,500
I just don't think it would look good and,

1080
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:19,250
but I really how it is. And She
just dating you for your hair, sir.

1081
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,290
But that she's only ever dated
guys with longer hair. Dude,

1082
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:26,060
if you're looking to get
out of this relationship,

1083
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,190
one quick trip to the fucking barber,

1084
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,620
this is the easiest breakup
ever and you got to go hardcore.

1085
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,340
I'd get like a cop flat top

1086
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,213
haircut,

1087
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:41,800
detective mustache.
This is the easiest breakup ever.

1088
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,690
Her concern kind of annoys me that
she was saying that she would not be

1089
01:08:46,691 --> 01:08:48,600
attracted to me in general if I,

1090
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:53,140
if I cut it to me it seemed pretty shallow
considering we've been together for

1091
01:08:53,141 --> 01:08:56,800
almost three years. Yeah, dude, she
doesn't love you. She doesn't love you.

1092
01:08:56,801 --> 01:08:59,320
Get your fucking haircut and get
out of there. That's what I do.

1093
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:02,890
I'm pretty fed up with my long hair and
everything that comes with it. Knots,

1094
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:07,000
hair trying, you know, getting in my eyes
cause yeah, dude, you're, you're, you're,

1095
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:11,860
you learn something. You know you did
something for her, not for fucking you.

1096
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:15,520
Right. You don't like it. You're telling
you you don't like it. She says she's,

1097
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:19,780
she doesn't like the fact that you don't
like it. It's all there sir. All right.

1098
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:23,080
This is what you do. You fucker. One more
time and then you go get your haircut.

1099
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,220
MMM.

1100
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,760
I don't advise you doing that. That's
mean. I just, I just needed a laugh.

1101
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,103
MMM.

1102
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,500
Okay. Here's the last one,
everybody and then we'll meet.

1103
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:37,100
We'll be almost at the end of the podcast.
Hour and 10 minutes.

1104
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:40,880
Just like that first ever live one.
There you go.

1105
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,673
All right

1106
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:48,820
guys, lie on Tinder. Surprise.

1107
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,760
Hey.
Oh Bill.

1108
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:57,770
I'm a 29 year old single
lady living in Virginia. Uh,

1109
01:09:57,771 --> 01:10:00,050
along with most other singles my age.

1110
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:04,010
It seems I've had to try out various
dating sites and apps over the years,

1111
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,540
but haven't had any success cultivating
anything more than a date here or there.

1112
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,420
I realize this, allow, my
God, this is so fucking long.

1113
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,013
Ah,

1114
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,130
lady. Maybe if you got to the
point you'd get a second date.

1115
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,073
MMM.

1116
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,460
That was a cheap shot.
Admittedly, that was a cheap shot.

1117
01:10:23,461 --> 01:10:27,060
I got anxiety and how long this was in
rather than admitting to the fact that I

1118
01:10:27,061 --> 01:10:29,910
don't like to read out loud.
I blamed her. I'm sorry,

1119
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,240
and I'm sorry for your horrible
social life. Let's continue.

1120
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,380
I realize a lot of this was likely
due to the fact that I've been pretty

1121
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:41,340
overweight my entire adult life
now and now I'm sad. However,

1122
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,570
the last year and a half I've
managed to lose 112 pounds.

1123
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:47,600
[inaudible]

1124
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:53,690
that's fucking awesome. It took you
a year and a half. Good for you.

1125
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:59,030
112 pounds and counting. She's not
done yet. She's like John Elway.

1126
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,800
She's getting the rings
at the end of a career

1127
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:03,653
and

1128
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,490
the taking all that shit in the press.

1129
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:11,190
She's finally living up to
her expectations. I love it.

1130
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:17,510
And counting and counting by changing my
diet and literally running my tits off

1131
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,590
on the elliptical for an hour five times
a week. That's fucking amazing. Good you.

1132
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:27,210
Anyways, last week on Tinder, I matched
with a very cute 29 year old guy.

1133
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,000
Uh,
he initiated the conversation.

1134
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:33,390
We had a great back and forth
comparing what podcasts we listened to.

1135
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:38,391
I found out he actually lives in Ohio and
was only traveling in my area for work

1136
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:41,340
for the next few days. All right.
That's a red flag. And he's on Tinder.

1137
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,920
He's looking to get his dick
sucked. All right. That's it.

1138
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,010
He doesn't want to know how many
brothers and sisters you have.

1139
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:51,180
And what's your hobby? Oh, do
you like to cook? Fantastic.

1140
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:56,280
Why don't you cook my balls in your mouth
as I stroke my Dick over here?

1141
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:02,700
Uh, brutal honesty. Women
like honesty. Anyways,

1142
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:06,270
I know I should have called it quits then.

1143
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:10,770
But finding out someone that had that
can actually hold the conversation seems

1144
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:13,800
to be a real rarity these days.
He asked me out to dinner,

1145
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:17,610
but because of my diet I had a,
and wanting to be nice,

1146
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:22,020
I offered for him to come over
for a home cooked healthy meal.

1147
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,500
Uh, when you didn't fill
them into the backstory.

1148
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,370
Now he thinks he thinks he's getting anal.

1149
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,570
This is how guys think,
okay,

1150
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,560
we want this whole me too thing to end.

1151
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:37,950
Guys have to be honest about
how they think. All right.

1152
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:42,780
He came over was just acute, was just
as cute and person as in his pictures.

1153
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,940
The great conversation kept flowing.

1154
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,700
I can't believe you just met somebody
on the Internet and invited them over to

1155
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:48,810
your fucking house.

1156
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:52,530
Please tell me you had a fucking
pistol taped to the inside of your leg.

1157
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:58,070
The great conversation kept
flowing in six hours later,

1158
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,180
we were making out.
We both had to be up early.

1159
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:08,181
The next day he left with plans to hang
out again the next day after work we did

1160
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:12,180
and ended up hooking up.
He left Virginia the next day,

1161
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,680
but we continue to message pretty
constantly over the next week with him

1162
01:13:16,681 --> 01:13:20,730
initiating the conversation.
Most of the time, I swear to God,

1163
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:24,510
this three paragraphs left and I want to
apologize to each and every one of you.

1164
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:28,320
I want to have a benefit for all of
your ears having to listen to me.

1165
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,440
Have to fucking read this.
God Damn Lawn.

1166
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,700
Please call the number at the bottom of
the screen and a portion of the proceeds

1167
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:38,610
will go to everybody's
ear drums in this room.

1168
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,840
And also my dodge to door,
a hemi pickup truck

1169
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,610
for 40 grand. Um, anyways,

1170
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,110
all seem to be going pretty great except
the eight hour distance in between one

1171
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:53,970
another. Well, yeah. Okay.

1172
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:59,400
Guys never looked at a globe. Uh, however,

1173
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:06,660
you know what? There's an I in
Virginia, there's an I in Ohio.

1174
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:08,160
They must be pretty close.

1175
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:14,100
Don't alphabetize by a vowel in
the middle of them or something.

1176
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:18,810
I'm all seem to be going
pretty good. Okay. Except for
the eight blah, blah, blah,

1177
01:14:18,811 --> 01:14:20,970
blah, blah. Nothing really
came. Okay. However,

1178
01:14:20,971 --> 01:14:24,300
I just had a feeling something
wasn't quite right, so I googled him.

1179
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:28,830
I guarantee you he has a family.
Nothing really came up except his,

1180
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,770
I don't know what profile.
Then a few lines down.

1181
01:14:31,771 --> 01:14:35,820
I see an old wedding gift
registry site with his name.

1182
01:14:35,821 --> 01:14:40,070
I called it. Yeah. I swear to
God I didn't read this before.

1183
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,460
You think this sounds bad out loud.

1184
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:46,270
You should hear when I read quietly and
I just hear me stuttering in my brain,

1185
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:52,330
I searched all the girls' names on the
registry along with his last name on

1186
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:57,331
Facebook and Bingo all over this girl's
profile or cute pictures of a sweet

1187
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:02,390
couple. The other half of
which is the guy that was in,

1188
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,620
I was in bed with a week ago.
The son of a bitch is married.

1189
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,890
What do I do here,
Bill?

1190
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:13,060
Do I call the guy out on his
shit and rip him a new one?

1191
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,110
Do I send his wife a message
and tell her what he's doing?

1192
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,880
He travels. All the women are gone.
Yeah, so the guys were like, no, no,

1193
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,430
no. Move on. Move on.

1194
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:31,910
He travels the majority of the time
for work and I'm sure I'm not the first

1195
01:15:31,911 --> 01:15:33,320
person he's done this to.

1196
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:38,560
He already deleted his Tinder profile and
our text message have only been PG for

1197
01:15:39,921 --> 01:15:44,360
the most part, so I don't have any
concern, concrete proof to send her.

1198
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:47,870
I feel completely wretched.
Wretched.

1199
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:54,920
W R e t c h e. D, ratchet. All
right. That was right. Jesus Christ.

1200
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:03,170
Wretched. I thought this one you
would like puking. Retching all right.

1201
01:16:03,171 --> 01:16:04,490
Everybody's got a degree in the room.

1202
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:12,060
I feel completely wretched and terrible.
For the most part.

1203
01:16:12,061 --> 01:16:15,510
I unknowingly played in this entire,

1204
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,260
I played into this entire
situation. No, you didn't. Yeah,

1205
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,770
you didn't.
Unknowingly,

1206
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:25,170
if this is like one of the oldest
fucking stories on the Internet, also,

1207
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:28,630
any dating advice for me moving
forward is also appreciated. Uh,

1208
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:32,790
thanks for the advice and congrats on
that beautiful baby girl. He goes, oh,

1209
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:35,940
thank you very much. All right. Yay.

1210
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:42,630
Oh, Billy became a father.
All right. First of all,

1211
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:43,680
I gotta be honest with you,

1212
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:48,180
you're kind of going Hillary Clinton on
this thing where you're not taking any

1213
01:16:48,181 --> 01:16:52,560
responsibility for this loss whatsoever.
You're blaming him,

1214
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:55,980
you're calling him a piece of shit.
You're of the electorial college,

1215
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:59,760
you're blaming the Sandinista rebels,
everything

1216
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,380
but you, okay? You went on Tinder.

1217
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:09,530
Tinder is a total hookups site.
It's full of fucking scumbags,

1218
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:14,000
like, and then guess what?
You met a fucking scumbag. So

1219
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,490
what I would take out of that is to not
go on dating sites. And I would try,

1220
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:22,820
I don't know. I would join like a
fucking sports league or some shit.

1221
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:27,020
Like Yo play some softball.
I would try to do some hobby thing.

1222
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:30,470
I know that sounds like an old
guy thing, but like, you know,

1223
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,140
the fucking Internet is the Internet now.

1224
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:37,730
If you want to go blow up this guy's life
to make you feel better, I mean, you,

1225
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,650
you can also do that. I mean,
I mean, I dunno what I do.

1226
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:46,850
I just, when I fuck up, I just
go, I fucked up and I just, I,

1227
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:49,760
I walk away from it. I mean, if
you wanted, if you want to do that,

1228
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:53,390
that's up to you. I don't
fucking know. I mean, who knows?

1229
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:57,650
Maybe maybe his wife isn't blowing them,
you know,

1230
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,630
let's try to blame as innocent wife now,

1231
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:02,993
you know,

1232
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:07,270
I just feel like in this
age of hyper feminism,

1233
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:09,790
the way women always just
stick up for other women,

1234
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,440
that guys need to start doing this.

1235
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:16,400
So I have to stick up for this
complete piece of shit here. Um,

1236
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,880
maybe, uh, maybe, you know,

1237
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,220
maybe it's just the love's gone and
the relationship, they got the kids,

1238
01:18:28,221 --> 01:18:32,360
he doesn't want to leave. He just wants
to know what it likes to have fun again.

1239
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:36,320
And you, you were fun
and he fucking, you know,

1240
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:39,230
it's kind of on you though,
because the first night

1241
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,640
when you just hung out, all you
gotta do is look at his wedding ring.

1242
01:18:43,641 --> 01:18:48,050
And if he's wearing a ring, you'll
see the indentation from it. I mean,

1243
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:51,590
you got to go a little bump
up, bump up bomb. Right,

1244
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,090
ma'am? I don't know why I'm
blaming for you, blaming you.

1245
01:18:56,091 --> 01:19:00,440
I have no excuse for this
fucking guy. Uh, I dunno.

1246
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:01,670
I mean,

1247
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:05,990
what about George Clooney in that movie
where he's flying around in the planes

1248
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:10,610
and he showed up and that woman had a
family, you know, did he say anything?

1249
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,090
He did. And what was it
called? Up in the air. Right.

1250
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:18,290
And he was banging that woman and then
he went to her house and he found out

1251
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:22,100
that she was married and he was
like, oh fuck. He just walked away.

1252
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,250
That's what guys do think.
We just, we just walk away.

1253
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,060
Women start pulling hedges
out of the front yard.

1254
01:19:32,061 --> 01:19:37,061
They start putting rabbits
in the fucking stew and shit.

1255
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,260
Like,
is that why we die sooner than they do?

1256
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,250
Cause we just hold that in our chest.

1257
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:47,090
The fucking pitch had a family and you
just carry that around for the rest of

1258
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:49,970
your life.
Women get to get it out.

1259
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,570
We as the thing,
if he has kids and shit,

1260
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:59,980
like maybe he's just going through a
fucking phase that he's working it out.

1261
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:05,260
You're going to blow up that family and
their dad's going to leave. And just,

1262
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:08,430
just so you know, this is going to
be two kids with this guy has kids.

1263
01:20:08,431 --> 01:20:09,264
Does he have kids?

1264
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,740
I know personally I would just
take the loss and I would move on.

1265
01:20:14,741 --> 01:20:17,980
I would just go like,
listen, I, I checked you out.

1266
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:21,940
I found out you're married you
fucking piece of shit. And uh,

1267
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:26,790
because I'm a cool chick, I'm not going
to call your fucking wife. Go Fuck you.

1268
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:29,530
See, I mean, he could do that or you
could just, Oh, you can just say, I dunno.

1269
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:31,240
I Dunno.
I Dunno what to tell you.

1270
01:20:31,241 --> 01:20:34,030
I can't throw another guy under
the bus like this. That's a,

1271
01:20:34,031 --> 01:20:38,110
that's what you would do. There
you go. Someone in the crowd.

1272
01:20:38,111 --> 01:20:40,630
So that's what I would do.
Keep losing weight and move the fuck on.

1273
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:44,260
Yeah. Which you have to listen
to what you have to do. Yeah.

1274
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,200
You know what?
You got to look at that

1275
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,610
guy.
Like you got to look at that guy.

1276
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:54,320
Like when Columbus was sailing across
the ocean, he didn't see land first.

1277
01:20:54,321 --> 01:20:58,460
