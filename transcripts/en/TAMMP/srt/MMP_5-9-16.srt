1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,090
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:06,660
It's bill burr and his time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,560
May 9th,
2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:15,130
How you throw in there?
Fuckos um,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,640
oh, freckles laying on his back
trying to get rid of the Sayada cuts.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,710
Much better SCIATICA.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,860
Oh, cy. Anika,

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,580
a lot of people don't know that was the
original lyrics to Panama. You know,

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,910
David Lee wanted to say,
you know,

10
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:40,911
Sciatica and Eddie wanted to an Alex
wanted Panama and Michael Anthony,

11
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,530
he's like, come on guys. You know,
except he said it in a much higher voice.

12
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,210
Can we fucking just get along here?

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,150
And David ended up giving in to
the brothers and that's what it,

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,080
next thing you know, he was
on his own. I'm just a Gigolo.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,120
So, um, yeah, my back is
doing, it's doing much better.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,240
Slowly but surely I've,

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,250
I've kind of found out that it's going
to sort of work itself out if I just

18
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:07,110
don't have to sit on my fucking ass from
here to Jacksonville every other week.

19
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:10,020
But that's the life that I live,
you know,

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,270
it's just the weirdest injury ever.
Usually if you're fucked up, sitting down,

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,950
you know, and resting is a good thing.
This thing I just got to kind of, uh,

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,210
lay down.
I'm a mess.

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm taking that fucking Ibu pro.
I don't even, what the fuck it is.

24
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:30,450
Some anti-inflammatory thing.

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,750
I'm stretching like a fucking NHL goalie,

26
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,870
trying to get everything all fucking
undone down there, but I don't,

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,660
I don't know what's going on. I don't
know. But it is a, it is getting better.

28
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:43,530
But I,
um,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,110
I flew all the way back
today from Jacksonville. Uh,

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,750
had a great time. And by the
way, here's, here's some, uh,

31
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,780
here's some advice for you when you're
out on the road and you're going to get a

32
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:59,100
breakfast.
All right?

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,780
Unless you're in some mom and pop place
and he could see over the counter,

34
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:07,470
you can watch them making your food, which
I don't necessarily really like to do.

35
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,310
If you're gonna order eggs,
don't ever order scrambled eggs.

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,610
I know what you're thinking. Why,
Bill? Why, why wouldn't you do that?

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,850
Cause they got a giant fucking VAT
that they've made scrambled eggs or the

38
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:24,240
fucking oatmeal of eggs when he
go to restaurants. It's just,

39
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:28,530
it's like the trail is Anya. It's
just that is you fucking, you know,

40
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,950
is your fucking eggs.
Especially like this morning,

41
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,910
the place where I went to Jacksonville,

42
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:38,190
he ate at the Chili's restaurant in
Jacksonville, Florida. I know you guys.

43
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,220
You're jealous, right? Oh my
God. He gets to see everything.

44
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,930
So me and Forrest Shah who
murdered it all week, um,

45
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,800
we ordered the,
the whatever,

46
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:54,801
the American breakfast or something there
and your only option on the eggs was

47
00:02:55,831 --> 00:03:00,040
scrambled. Okay. Now if that's
the fucking case, that means they

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,270
got a giant VAT that was probably made,
I don't know how long ago,

49
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,990
whatever the health code violation
is plus five minutes, you know,

50
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:11,170
it's been sitting. So you get the
rubber fucking eggs and then bacon,

51
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,620
they just make a bunch of fucking bacon.
They got that sit to the side,

52
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,983
you know,

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,510
and then they had to have bullshit
Hash browns, which you know,

54
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,480
was already all the whole
fucking thing was already made.

55
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:24,940
The only thing that really
tasted good was the biscuit.

56
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,870
So, um, if you ever at
the airport, you know,

57
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,070
or if you're going down to the hotel
lobby for their continental breakfast,

58
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,440
um,

59
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,400
you always never would have scrambled
eggs or eggs over easy, get an Omelet,

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,220
you know,
um,

61
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,500
do something like that where they just
aren't going to just have the shit

62
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:49,070
already made. Um, or you could
do the gross shit with the syrup,

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,440
but that's going to fuck
your whole day up. I feel,

64
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,230
I mean now like I didn't
order a big salty breakfast,

65
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:57,050
but for some reason a salty
breakfast is as bad as it is.

66
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,850
I can continue to function.

67
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:03,380
But if you get a waffle or pancakes or
French toast to that shit, you know,

68
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,990
you might as well just have somebody
puts you in a fucking sleeper hold.

69
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:10,210
Cause cause you're going down
and you're going down early. Um,

70
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,660
so anyway, just a little
travel tip for you there. Um,

71
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,420
so anyways, you know, all this
past week, uh, the lovely Nia,

72
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:25,340
my beautiful wife was away and I was
telling you how immaculate I was keeping

73
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:29,390
this place fucking immaculate.
All right.

74
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,010
And um,

75
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,750
okay.

76
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,390
I literally like there was no
trash in any of the barrels.

77
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:39,140
All the fucking pillows were poofed up,

78
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,500
looked like it looks like a show
room. The living room. Right.

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,630
I made the fucking bed,
you know, it was spotless.

80
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,020
I wiped down my side of the fucking sick,
you know,

81
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,460
brushing my teeth and all
that shit spotless. Okay.

82
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,720
I got a car washed and waxed, filled
it up with gas, all of that shit.

83
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,090
Everything was done. Went through
all the bills, got the junk mail,

85
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:07,120
all the bullshit,
the recycling fucking everything.

86
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:07,950
Yeah.

87
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,760
I did everything right. So I'm thinking
she's going to come home, you know,

88
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:13,650
cause I was leaving and
right as I was leaving,

89
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:15,120
she was coming home so he
would just missing, yeah,

90
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,973
each other.
Right.

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,050
So I was thinking when she came
home she was going to be like,

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,350
like, Oh man, you know what? I might
have to bring her in for this shit.

93
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,500
You know what, I'm going to have to bring
them in for this. Hang on one second.

94
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,370
Hold on one second.

95
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,100
Hi. All right, so I'm back here. So
anyways, let me keep setting this up.

96
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,630
So my whole thing,
Nia,

97
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,720
was that when you came home, this place
was going to be absolutely spotless.

98
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:45,920
So you'd be like, oh
my God, that's so nice.

99
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,730
And then also you wouldn't feel like I
was just hopeless SAP without you because

100
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,360
that always bugs me.
Like when women go like tag take tiff,

101
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,980
they fall apart without
us. Like, like I've

102
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,390
never said that about,
you know,

103
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:03,530
or if I ever thought that I've never
come home after being away and the place

104
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:07,490
has been in shambles because you don't
know what to do. So I don't know why, you

105
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,370
know,
but you keep holding on to some idea of,

106
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:17,090
of something that was
talking to them like,

107
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:21,790
man spreading.
I gotta be on the fucking couch.

108
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,220
Um, no, I don't know what you're
so concerned about that for.

109
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:30,710
I like the place has never been disgusting
or gross after I have gone away.

110
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:35,380
So I don't know why you have this
big hangup about, you know, I don't,

111
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,940
I don't get it. You know
what? No, I don't either.

112
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,750
Well I'm trying to think where you fucking
relax and will be worked through my

113
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,540
shit. No. Okay. Sorry. What a jerk.

114
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,210
You're telling this story
and then you're out law.

115
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,940
So any don't like, cause I'm told
what happened. So I'm fucking wait,

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,750
I'm on the road on the road again
and I'm in fucking Hollywood,

117
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,980
Florida right at all. I'm thinking is, aw,

118
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,670
the text message I'm going to
get. Oh, it looks so great.

119
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,190
It's so wonderful to come
home to a nice clean house.

120
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,210
It looks like a fucking show room.
And what do I get?

121
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,580
I get a fucking video tape from you.

122
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,720
She's in the pantry now. Evidently
something went bad in the pantry. Okay.

123
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,530
Something didn't go bad in the pantry is
just some shit that's going down to the

124
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:27,590
pantry. There's some shit going down
to the pantry. So here's the deal.

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,460
I'm fucking done in the
pantry. Um, I'm here by myself.

126
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm writing on the fucking show every
night until seven o'clock at night.

127
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:39,320
I come home, my brain is fried. I come
home, I owe to a pizza, I pour a scotch,

128
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,090
I eat,
and then I stare at the wall.

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,220
I go to bed and I get right back up and
we stare at the next draft in the next

130
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:49,090
script. That's been my life. So
I didn't in defense of me. Okay.

131
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,030
The one fucking place I didn't go into.
So it was a pantry.

132
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,820
There was the pantry and stuff
saying, hey, I like that word.

133
00:07:55,821 --> 00:08:00,570
I just realized Pantry pantry stuff saying
I don't like it. Just, it's, I dunno,

134
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,150
it's too close to panties in this I
don't like good food and sex are combined

135
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,140
now. I know you don't like
that. You can't treat, oh,

136
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,550
that nine and a half weeks when he was
fucking her with all the groceries on her,

137
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,230
I just was like, either
eat or fuck, not together,

138
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,200
you know. So anyways. Um,

139
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,920
so she sends me this
video, she's like, Bebe,

140
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,550
how did you not see this?
Right.

141
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,200
It just starts fucking given me all this
shit. I'm like, what the fuck? All right.

142
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,140
And she pans up to the top of the fucking
ceiling and there was, what was it?

143
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,400
There's the larvae. Larvae.
Little, yeah, little moths.

144
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,470
Modal go. It's an inside joke.
Oh, go ahead and side with who?

145
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,250
But the fucking people listening
to, Oh, and I want to do,

146
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,770
no. Yeah, there's sort of larvae.
There's mods and stuff. Because some,

147
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,030
like if there's flour that's been opened,
it's not sealed up properly.

148
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:09,570
Or grains or cereal,
they'll create little mobs.

149
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:12,150
Like if you have fruit out for too long,
it'll make fruit flies.

150
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,480
So that was what was happening.
Fruit flies. It attracts them. No,

151
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,540
it creates them from that. I was just
talking to the Terminex guy about it.

152
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:23,280
They just, they, I don't know what
flies come from. Apples listened. Yeah.

153
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:26,640
Like if you have fruit and
stuff out to orange, apple,

154
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:30,230
and then fucking nine months later you
get a fruit fly. You're like, there's no,

155
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,350
there's no woman there that's making an
apple. No Bill. That's not what I mean.

156
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,920
It's not a fruit having sex.
That's what you're saying.

157
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:41,310
You're saying that I'm saying
they I pleasant. I don't know.

158
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm not a fucking terminex person,
but he was helping me dirty mobs.

159
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,910
Fuck on those apples
out in the orchard now.

160
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,090
And they plant their seed in there and
then it comes out like alien. Okay.

161
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,640
There's not any fruit in the pantry.
Okay.

162
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,920
So we have grains and he's just
staring at your crash right now.

163
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,240
It's so comfortable that my lower
back is so comfortable right now.

164
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,170
Oh, you know what? I figured out a thing
to get for you for that. But anyway,

165
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,041
we'll get back to that.

166
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,280
But if you have grains and cereals
out exposed and like this little close

167
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,800
environment where it gets warm,

168
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,990
it produces these larvae and
little flies and mobs and shit.

169
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,800
So that's what the guy just told me.
He's not saying it right.

170
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,960
Well how are you saying?
Are you saying?

171
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:29,160
I'm saying please like tell me how you
explain things and how clear it is when

172
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,150
you explain things.

173
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,230
What I would say is like,

174
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,470
you know if you're having a
cookout and you'll leave food out,

175
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,610
all of a sudden flies or an ant show up,
but they don't come from the food.

176
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,910
That's what he told me.
I'll be,

177
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,280
you keep saying they coming from
the apples and it's confusing me.

178
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,050
You said it came from apples.
I said nothing about it

179
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,960
came from Amarillo line this from apples.

180
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:01,590
I would never say it came for you.
The start throwing apples into the mix.

181
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:04,650
I was trying to explain to
you about grains and shit.

182
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,880
I was saying it's like
fruit flies in school.

183
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,950
I can't even hear what you're
saying because you don't listen.

184
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,030
That's why you got damn add. You
don't listen. You don't listen.

185
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:18,120
And he started saying things and you
said them and then you attribute them to

186
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:18,841
the other person.

187
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:22,100
Like it's so confusing to talk to you
sometimes because you don't let it. Oh,

188
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,550
it's so fucking hard.
It is hard.

189
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,930
How about we were just watching the
Simpsons and you watch the entire episode

190
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:31,230
and midway through it you were like,
why is that happening? And I'm like,

191
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,110
where did the blue snake,

192
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:36,690
like a major plot point that hadn't
been explained not even five minutes

193
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:39,240
earlier, but you don't pay
attention. How about this?

194
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,560
How about my fucking back is out and I
was in Jacksonville, Florida this morning.

195
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,680
How about that? What does that have to do
with anything that we're talking about?

196
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,330
Well, maybe I'm a little fucking, you
know, not focusing on a fucking cartoon.

197
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,550
Okay. You're going to such a baby when
you traveled to it. Whenever you travel,

198
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,930
you fucking for like one day like
Guma good. I do know how you do this.

199
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,230
And then it goes right out your
fucking head. And then the next,

200
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,410
next time I'm coming back off the
road, you like, oh, let's go. Uh,

201
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,030
you know Susie Fricker sees having a
fucking who hard down the fucking street.

202
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,440
You want to go to that when I say no,

203
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:18,820
you flip out at me and I don't know
what you're talking about. Shit.

204
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,290
Do you know exactly when you know who
she is to see the frequency? Oh yeah,

205
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,230
he's that bright. All
right, so what happened?

206
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,170
So she comes home and evidently there's
some sort of bug horror movie and you

207
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:36,850
know how, what infestation infestation.
And you know how the Lady's react.

208
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,820
They don't like insects.
You know what I mean?

209
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,940
They don't like insects the way men don't
like cats hate those fucking things.

210
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,910
There's nothing better than a cool cat.

211
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,050
I like a cool cat that chills
and lays in the fucking sun.

212
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,040
You know I liked her. A new Chris.
You? Yeah, I don't like that.

213
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,480
And when they're practicing killing it,

214
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,890
you just look over and they're
staring at you from the corner now.

215
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,740
Then they stop and try and play it
off. I don't like, I don't like that.

216
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:10,450
They stand on your chest in the morning,
waking you up.

217
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,940
I don't think they shit in a box.
And then like you gotta pick it up.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,140
It's just too much. It's too much
cleo shit. So it just outside.

219
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,220
But we still gotta pick it up.
I know, but I don't have to,

220
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,710
it's not in the house checking on me.
If you're going to shit in the house,

221
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:24,544
go in the toilet.

222
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,120
I think some people can train
their cats to shit in the toilet.

223
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,470
I don't know how, but, well,

224
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:35,380
I can tell you how they can't
communicate with other human beings.

225
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,490
So they put all their energy into yeah,
like they, they got like that gift.

226
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,230
They have like a,
like an Asperger

227
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,110
Aspbergers with cat. Some sort of, um,

228
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,010
what's that thing they're always talking
about nowadays? Autism. Autism. Yeah.

229
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,910
Like autistic with people.
But communicate with cats.

230
00:13:56,911 --> 00:14:01,911
Stop what the like play an instrument
stop with no one in his diagnosis of the

231
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,700
mental illnesses. It's just dope.
Just stop right there please.

232
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,050
He's talking about Ben. Are you going
to get angry tweets? I'm not mocking,

233
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,060
mocking any of that.
I'm making fun of people that put,

234
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,200
you can't fucking say anything anymore.
Everybody gets all worried. Oh, I know.

235
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,300
I do benefits for all of those things.

236
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,040
All of those things I know about
my free fucking all in black.

237
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,740
Oh Jesus Christ.
Ah,

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,630
I remember when things were funny.
Oh,

239
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:37,260
it was so simple back
in the day where it was,

240
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,020
you could change things and
never a fucking jerk off.

241
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:44,170
Didn't have some way that they could
just spout about up fucking annoyed they

242
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:47,740
are, but everything else is fine as long
as it doesn't come around to my world.

243
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:51,130
Can I just ask what the situation
is here with the Ziploc bag?

244
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,120
What about it and how you're
keeping your equipment stored? Yeah.

245
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,170
Bill's got this cord and the little
foamy part that you put on, uh,

246
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,980
the wind screen,

247
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,980
the windscreen and a couple of batteries
and an old Ziploc bag that's ripped and

248
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,650
just doesn't even zip anymore.
Right.

249
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,830
So I'm just wondering why basically,

250
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,640
because it, it still holds the things
and if I just throw that thing out,

251
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:20,800
another one's going to break and then
that thing right there is probably going

252
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,790
to end up on the nose of a porpoise
and it's not gonna be able to eat.

253
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,080
It's going to die because everything
ends up in the ocean. Yeah. You know,

254
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:30,990
they say that put litter in its place.
It's like the second,

255
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,290
all this shit that you throw out the
same. You don't pollute. We all pollute.

256
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,860
It's just some of us do take
this on the road with it.

257
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,820
It's not like I was having an
idea that good. I mean you,

258
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,480
I take it on the role that you're
just going to be like a babbling about

259
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,390
something that you don't
really know about us. I mean,

260
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:49,490
I don't really feel that's the
charm of the testing. Anything. Uh,

261
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,450
so you take this on the road with
you? Yes. All right. Well I was just,

262
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,970
I couldn't give you a nice
leather Satchel. Really?

263
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:59,790
You got a skin of fucking
cow because I already,

264
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,510
I already have one no last longer than
putting it in this ridiculous thing

265
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,540
that's never going to biodegrade.
What's this bad thing?

266
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,600
And that thing won't biodegrade fat that
they will be here somewhere in the dark

267
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:15,930
somewhere hundreds of fucking years after
we're gone saying you can have a nice

268
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,700
way to carry your things.

269
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,720
It doesn't look like you know the bag
that we should use for sandwiches.

270
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,650
What is your fascination
with just like buying shit,

271
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,940
but what do you mean fascination
with buying ships session?
I mean, look at this.

272
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:30,421
Look at this,

273
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,400
that you're carrying this thing and I
really wish you guys could see the Ziploc

274
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,250
bag right now. It's, it's a mess.

275
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,870
A man of your stature should not be
carrying around your podcast equipment and

276
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:43,680
an oil past zip lock bag.
A man of my stature.

277
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,880
Fucking two seconds ago I
was a fucking moron. You can
meet. But now, now cause you

278
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,080
to Shay from naenae.
So who do you like tonight?

279
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,270
Who We got Louis Blues
meet me in St Louis.

280
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:07,660
Louis v versus who?
The Dallas Stars.

281
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,980
Formerly the Minnesota North Stars.
Are these hockey teams? Yes they are.

282
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,290
If they're not like the kings or
the a Bruins, I don't really know.

283
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,410
Oh yeah. What are your feelings
about the kings and the Bruins? Well,

284
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:26,410
if it came down to it, I would be a
Bruins fan because I'm from Boston.

285
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:28,630
So are you just saying, are you
gonna root for yeah, but the other,

286
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,030
the rest of them, I don't know.
Those are my two. What do you like?

287
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,100
I like both teams,
but I just,

288
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,450
I started polling for the blues because
the blues have been in the league since

289
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:41,470
1960. [inaudible] who's getting hook?
Cause the Bruins didn't make the playoffs.

290
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,450
So I was like,
all right,

291
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:47,020
I got to pick somebody and I'm not going
to jump on the Black Hawks and kings

292
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,060
bandwagon because they're always in it.
So I'm going to go for sewer an underdog.

293
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,140
And I was like, wow. The Blues,

294
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,340
they've been around since 1967
so the Minnesota north stars,

295
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,500
but the people in Dallas
haven't been rooting that long.

296
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,310
But I really liked the players and shit.
I like, I like Dallas, but I, I've,

297
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:04,010
I've ever been written for um,
a babbling over here looking at it.

298
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,250
But yeah, St Louis, they're going to
be relaxed. They're going to be a,

299
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:10,090
a kings game that we can go to
cause I really enjoy going to that.

300
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,530
Those two kings games we went to,
they got bounced up. That done.

301
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,330
What do you mean bounced out bay? Uh, they
got beaten by the San Jose Sharks. Oh,

302
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,510
so they're not in it.
It's over. So for them,

303
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,860
the Stanley Cup playoffs, there you go.
They got, they lost in the first round.

304
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,490
What about the breweries? We
didn't make it. We were all,

305
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,370
well then I don't we we overtime,

306
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,790
well we over achieved throughout the
year because at least as far as I was

307
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,470
concerned, but guided we'll do, fuck am I,

308
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,960
but I mean with the players that we
had and every that we got rid of,

309
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:44,990
I thought we were just gonna be trying
to figure out who the fuck everybody was

310
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,680
for half the season. And
then maybe you know, I dunno.

311
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,130
What about the Toronto Blue Jays and
what happened was we were going to be

312
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,470
making the playoffs and
everybody's all bunched together.

313
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:55,730
We look a fucking third seat.

314
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,260
Then we'd had a west coast trip and we
got to fucking asses kicked and a and all

315
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:05,180
went away and it flyer and red
wings fans talk shit about,

316
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,970
you know how high you didn't
make the playoffs and they
both got the right there.

317
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:10,600
Fred in the first fucking
round. So I enjoyed that. Okay.

318
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,090
Well the Toronto Blue Jays,

319
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,040
is that a, is that a hockey
team? Nope, that's baseball.
Oh, the Toronto Maple leafs.

320
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,010
The amount of the maple leafs got the
first pick in the draft of the raptors.

321
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,870
Are they have a hockey team? Nope.
What were they? Basketball team.

322
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,260
Oh Jesus keeps, keeps
saying this shit. You know.

323
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,600
And then I'll do pick you pick something
else that I don't know anything about.

324
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,680
We'll see who's more. Right. What
do you went to that you know about?

325
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,090
Did I just say that question? What
are you going to, what you know about,

326
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,690
I don't know. Fashion. Okay, go ahead. Um,

327
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,930
oh Jesus. What's the name of the
guy who makes fun of fat people?

328
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:54,120
He used to be fat.
Ah.

329
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:58,750
Is that, that's, that's not Alexander
Wang, is it? No. Is that Michael Richards?

330
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,900
Is it Michael?
A Michael Kors?

331
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,590
No, he's German. Is it Paul Mitchell.

332
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,600
And he is the head of a very,

333
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:09,940
very like the most famous
fashion house in the world.

334
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,260
It's not for Saatchi cause
he got shot by that guy. Yes.

335
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,670
No, it's not the Chanel. Cause that
was a chick and she's dead right.

336
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,720
But she has an apartment in Paris that
you can go into if you're skinny enough.

337
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,530
Right. But you're, you're close.
You're getting that Chanel is right.

338
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,090
Chanel's the right fashion house.

339
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,800
A person who you're talking about is that
the cad creative director for Chanel?

340
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,140
He looks like a war criminal, right?
He's chairman. I'll say you go

341
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,270
and why would they war
criminals via cause they lost.

342
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,900
You would have just as many people going
to fucking Nuremberg really would've.

343
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,940
Okay. Dresden, Karl Lagerfeld. Ah Fuck.

344
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,260
Remember when we saw him and the last
time we were in Paris and the cab and I

345
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,760
started freaking out because I had saw
Carl was walking down the street in Paris

346
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:09,290
and I thought it was a cool
looking dude, man. He's a vampire,

347
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,690
a vampire war criminal,
old queen looking dude.

348
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,370
Pretty much. That's him.
Name a sports team. Go ahead.

349
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,340
Um, I'll name one of
you. Tell me what it is.

350
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,200
They are the yellow jackets
somebody or did I make that up?

351
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,540
Yellow check.
I feel like that was a high school.

352
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,540
I feel like that was a fucking
fusion band. Um, what about no,

353
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,710
it wasn't his,
that's like wake forest or something.

354
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,770
That's a college basketball team.
Some sort of jackets.

355
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,920
The Grizzlies Grizzlies
to right now Michigan,

356
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,940
it's some place cold that would
have grizzly bears. Right.

357
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,090
So it's not going to be a southern
union. Good guests. But they moved.

358
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,600
They were initially, they were
initially in very cool. Oh, okay.

359
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,060
Is there a Midwestern kind of thing?

360
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,320
They were initially in Vancouver and then
they went to another and Memphis. Oh,

361
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,390
that said the Memphis
Grizzlies for some dumb reason,

362
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:08,590
they kept the name kind of like when
the New Orleans jazz moved to Utah.

363
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,180
The widest fucking place ever.

364
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,710
Like you'll never see any
jazz or hear any jazz in Utah?

365
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,650
I wouldn't think so.

366
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,640
They are no jazz clubs and Utah.
It's like the New Orleans Mormons,

367
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,590
New Orleans Mormon.
I like that name better.

368
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,600
All right, well we enjoyed you hear
neo. Oh, I'm done. I don't know.

369
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,940
Your phone's ringing. Oh
God. Oh look at us. I know.

370
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,960
I get a call her back.
Um, are you down with me?

371
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,920
Are you wrapping up the podcast?
Did you answer questions? No,

372
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:50,500
but you can come back to that.
She kind of tired.

373
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,440
So I think I'm going to leave
Oh, down. Nice reversal.

374
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,900
I kicked you off and then you're
like, no, let me come back.

375
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:58,900
And then you tell me to go fuck
myself. You know what? I enjoy that.

376
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,300
I respect that. So I just came on. It's
how the larvae, larvae, larvae and then,

377
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,410
and get out of here so I could straighten
out my legs and fucking get my,

378
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,760
I feel like Kennedy,
right.

379
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,570
Are you even able to do a podcast
and the upright position anymore? Um,

380
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,300
this is why I married you because it's
the type of compassion that I've come to

381
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,730
expect from you. You're
such a fucking baby. I,

382
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,920
I tough my way through all of this
shit. I never, I never see doctors.

383
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:34,870
I don't take medicine. That's cause
you're dumb. You're dumb. Well,

384
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,410
it's because I grew up so
people don't go to the hospital.

385
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:41,380
They don't go to doctors. They will
take medicine. No, you're dumb.

386
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,760
We have advances in our society. I
am dumb, but I'm tougher than you.

387
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,240
You're a baby.
So fine.

388
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:52,010
Be tough all you want but like be smart
and tough goal to the doctor if you're

389
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:54,380
so tough. Go to the doctor and
hear what they have to say.

390
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,480
Like after school special. Yeah, I,

391
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,380
well I'm getting there beats up by going
to the doctor and hearing what they

392
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:04,340
have to say. That's real toughness.
That's real talk. That's real socks on.

393
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:09,650
All right. I'm out of
here. Nini out. Sorry.

394
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,950
I had to uh,
I enjoyed when you come out.

395
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,870
I miss you baby. Huh? All
right, good. Don't say, Huh?

396
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:20,870
You heard me listen, I went out. You know,

397
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,720
you know why you don't go to fucking
doctors and all that shit. Why?

398
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,380
Because doctors, they practice
medicine. They practice on you.

399
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,030
They don't have shit down.
And one of the,

400
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:31,590
one of the things that they still
don't know a lot about this,

401
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,920
but it's not like they don't
mean it like they're practicing.

402
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:36,230
Like you sit in here practicing drums,
you know,

403
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:39,140
that's not the same thing they went
to medical school. I understand that.

404
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,170
So why are you like taking that word?
So literally,

405
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,980
have you ever seen Lars Ulrich
play life and he practices,

406
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:50,180
he fucks up all the time with
Metallica. Oh my God, Nia.

407
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,730
I'm telling you if that's what it means,

408
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:55,520
you practice medicine and then
you learn off other people.

409
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,530
Just look how much
better hair plugs of God.

410
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,050
Look how much better they are
getting with the fucking, you know,

411
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,030
cut and part of your eye out
and then he can see better.

412
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,840
You told me you were going to go to a
doctor to figure out what was happening

413
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:09,620
with your leg. Okay. So I know,

414
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,500
I know you think you know what it is,

415
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:16,010
but can you please go to a doctor and
so it doesn't become a chronic issue.

416
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,380
And then when you're, you know, 50 which
is, can I, can I finish it far away?

417
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,010
Can I finish? You can have some
sort of handle on it. Yeah.

418
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,170
One of the things that they know
the least about is the back. Okay.

419
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,650
And I'm just, I'm just not going to
just go to a fucking chiropractor.

420
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:37,910
I'm going to find somebody you know
who has a good reputation of not just

421
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:42,740
fucking opening people up like a fun.
It isn't fine cause I wasn't done talking.

422
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,160
You always jump in because
you're suggesting that I
just want you to go to some

423
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:50,610
random ass clinic. I was just
joking around. I was joking around.

424
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm holding you to this because
you said you were going to do it.

425
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,650
So are you going to do it?
Um,

426
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,490
I don't know. I'm feeling pretty
good. I don't like going at this.

427
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,880
I don't like going to the doctor that way.
I don't like one to the fucking mall.

428
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,661
I just,

429
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:09,050
the whole idea of going over there and
parking and just the whole fucking thing.

430
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,940
I know. I need feel the shower. Make sure
you show up 15 minutes before. Oh yeah.

431
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:18,860
Y'All be there. See that?
I know. But once it's done,

432
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,470
it's done. And you need all my
first show in Hollywood, Florida.

433
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:24,710
There was a couple of
ladies in the front row.

434
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,900
Uh, we're asking if you were there
because they needed relationship advice.

435
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,670
Oh yeah. You know, so they were like,
how come we don't have boyfriends?

436
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,250
No, they didn't say this.
That's what they said.

437
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,730
Someone actually wrote me and asked me
about you proposing and actually that's

438
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:46,500
what I wanted to do.
I wanted to talk about this email I got,

439
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,070
should we do it today or should we
do it day to fuck his writing you on?

440
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:50,260
How the fuck are they writing you?

441
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,400
Because they write Mike because of
my website tender headed films.com.

442
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,800
So they were writing me because remember
I was going to do a podcast all those

443
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:03,190
years ago and then they just never did it.
No,

444
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:08,191
they wrote this whole thing about how did
you get a guy who was so anti marriage

445
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:12,940
to propose and all that kind of stuff
and how did it happen and did I propose?

446
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,650
No, I did not propose. But he'll
propose to me. Uh, and all that stuff.

447
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,650
It was interesting. I did, excuse me.

448
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,800
No, no. See this is why we have to talk
about it. Cause that's some bullshit.

449
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,030
Oh wait, even put that out there. I got
a joke. We have fucking relaxed down.

450
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:34,780
You love me. You missed me. You
told [inaudible] story. Now,

451
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:37,420
one thing about show business
is you leave them wanting more.

452
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,170
So get your fucking cute ass
outta here. All right, goodbye.

453
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,590
I want to talk about that story there.
I want to answer.

454
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,070
We all want to do things in life.

455
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,360
Beat it. Goodbye. Hit the road
jack. Don't you come back?

456
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:56,100
No, no, no. Oh, hit the road. Deni yeah,

457
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:57,240
so that's what I came up to.

458
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:01,170
She fucking shows me this big goddamn
thing about all the fucking mic.

459
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,240
Granted them as much as I'm going to bitch
it. It was a bunch of fucking larvae.

460
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,650
I swear to God. She says that
comes from apples in flowers,

461
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,060
in a flower and flower being left out
and grains what? App? You know what?

462
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,970
If you agree with her, you can go fuck
yourselves. How about that? All right,

463
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:21,720
let's read a little advertising here
for this week, shall we? Oh my goodness.

464
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:26,370
MVMT watches, you know,
it's been a few weeks now.

465
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,300
Um,
since they started advertising movement,

466
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:34,890
watches boxes and Oh my God,
what the f,

467
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,010
I don't even understand this copy.
As promised,

468
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:43,011
the quality of these watches are there
for an awesome price in the style

469
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:43,981
department.

470
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:48,981
The compliments that you'll get wearing
these things are really unbelievable.

471
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,820
You know what I'm doing?
I gotta start this over again.

472
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,290
This is what I'm doing is they keep
fucking having me say that I cracked open

473
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:01,770
these boxes and I'm fucking
wearing one right now and I'm not.

474
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,440
So it fucks up all the copy. All
right. I will read what you write,

475
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:10,710
but I'm not going to start lying saying
I have on your fucking underwear.

476
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:15,150
You'll watch is one I doubt. Listen
these. All right, let me start over again.

477
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,180
So they don't hear that part cause
they don't, they don't. Well listen,

478
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:21,470
that fucker apart. They just
listened to the read. All right.

479
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,250
Unless one of you cats rats me out on
Twitter like the fucking j Edgar Hoover is

480
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:29,970
everybody's acting like nowadays.
All right. MVMT watches.

481
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,890
If you haven't had a chance to experience
how a movement watch fits around your

482
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:36,800
wrist while God dammit,

483
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,810
this is your chance movement watches
start at just $95 seat when movement cut

484
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,630
out the middle man with
huge big brand markups,

485
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,970
the price of a stylist watch
finally got affordable.

486
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,560
Imagine that a watch with department
store quality for a fraction of the price

487
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,400
movement has grown organically
purely by supporters like you.

488
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,930
So join there more than 1 million social
media followers and get a movement

489

Helux or helix.

494
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,540
What is it about buying a mattress
that leaves you feeling violated?

495
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,770
This, that's not a good word
to use with the mattress. Um,

496
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,010
is it the pushy salespeople,

497
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,120
the fake presidents' Day
sales or the fact you know,

498
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,580
you'll regret what you bought,
um,

499
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,730
as you do the walk of shame out of the
mattress store cause you get violated.

500
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:49,180
Well, what kind of sex offender is
selling you your sheets hallux. He looks,

501
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,910
those days are over.

you get 100% refund. That's pretty cool,

511
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:26,770
Huh? That's almost three months. It's
over three months, no questions asked.

512
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,640
It's like it never happened. Uh, if
you do like the new helix mattress,

513

keep it and your dignity.

514
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,750
That's why everyone from Gq magazine to
Forbes are all talking about helic sleep.

515
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,100
Go to helix,
sleep.com/burr and get $50 off your order.

516
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,950
That's helic sleep.com/burr.
Hey,

517
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,110
he likes sleep.com/ [inaudible] one
of those pronunciations is right.

518
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,520
All right, dollar shave
club, everybody, all my God,

519
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,460
look who's back dollar shave club.

520
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,690
They're all a shave club.com as a special
offer for new members who join today,

521
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,820
you'll get a free month of the executive
razor when you buy a tube of Dr

522
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,480
Carver's shave butter. I swear to
God, it used to be easy shave butter.

523
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,100
This is the first time they've ever done
something like this and once you try

524
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:19,810
dollar shave club.com you'll become a
proud member like millions of others.

525
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:24,020
One reason is because they deliver amazing
raters razors right to your door for

526
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:27,010
a third of the price of what the
greedy razor corporations charge.

527
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,050
That means when you
joined dollar Shave Club,

528
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,220
you can afford to shave with a
fresh blade anytime you want,

529
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,050
which feels fantastic.

530
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,810
You'll get a first class shave when you
use the executive blade hurting your

531
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:40,230
wallet.

532
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,230
Another reason is that Dr cabbies ac shape
by using it with the executive razor,

533
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,000
the blade just glides gently for the
smoothest shave ever. Dr Carver's.

534
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:53,490
Shave butter isn't your
average shave cream.

535
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,180
It's a unique conditioning for me though
with high quality natural ingredients

536
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:58,050
leading your skin,

537
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:02,880
feeling unbelievably smooth and soft and
right now new members who buy a two of

538
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:06,060
shea butter get the executive
razor for absolutely free.

539
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,710
They'd never done this before.

540
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:11,850
Take advantage of it or you'll regret it
for the rest of her life and it's only

541
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:13,350
available by going to doctors.

542
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,780
Dollar Shave club.com/bar that's
dollar shave club.com/bar and lastly,

543

valuable resources as a small business is

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,790
You can't waste it making constant

553
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:54,624

Close the window and onto
the rest of the bullshit.

568
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,420
I had the worst.
Fucking keeps a good guy.

569
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:52,260
But I had a bad cab driver on the
way back from the fucking airport.

570
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,200
Use One of those, uh, one of those people
that can't keep a consistent speed,

571
00:34:58,201 --> 00:34:59,640
you know,
so they make your car sick.

572
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,570
And what was hilarious was he was driving
a Prius and the way he was driving

573
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:05,940
this thing, I would be surprised
if he was getting an eight count,

574
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,530
eight miles per gallon. He
just kept doing that. Yeah.

575
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,670
Eh,

576
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,140
just stomp and glide. Um, I can,

577
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,380
I just amazing to me some people
like how they cannot hear,

578
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,740
you can't hear the engine,
you know,

579
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:24,930
he can't hear the fucking
rpms going through the roof.

580
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:27,420
You don't understand that as wasting fuel.
I don't,

581
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,880
you know how bad those
cabbies get fucked over.

582
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,050
You think that he would be concerned
about something and you think if you drove

583
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:37,890
for a fucking living, you'd have an
understanding of how fucking works.

584
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,200
Um, it was so fucking
annoying. It actually,

585
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:47,400
it just Kinda just became funny and
he was a really nice guy. But, um,

586
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,040
I don't know.
Some people like it's almost like,

587
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:53,070
it's like they're driving
with a fake foot, you know,

588
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,270
or a mechanical foot like the prototype
and then, you know, it's either on or off.

589
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,110
There's no, um, consistency
of speed. This guy,

590
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:03,120
he just kept going up to like 65,

591
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:07,560
70 miles an hour and then glide
back down to like, you know, 52.

592
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,880
Of course I'm looking at my fucking
phone, some starting to get six. Yeah.

593
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:12,120
You know, it was, it was a shit show,

594
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,070
an absolute fucking shit show or,
you know,

595
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:18,480
when I went to Florida,
by the way,

596
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:21,510
I landed in Miami every
time I land into my Miami,

597
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:24,690
oh you immediately start seeing all
these beautiful women and every time I go

598
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:27,000
there I just hear Tony
Montana voice going.

599
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,420
The city is like one big
pussy waiting to get fucked.

600
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,223
MMM.

601
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,230
And I was trying to bait me into those
two women that was sitting in the front

602
00:36:36,231 --> 00:36:38,870
row to get into that fucking conversation.

603
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,040
Um, but she didn't buy the
bait. She didn't take the bait

604
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,920
cause they were like,
why don't we have boyfriends?

605
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,180
You know when you should have seen
him cause I dunno cause you guys are,

606
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,380
you're not wearing any clothes
that be,

607
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,350
the one thing is beautiful as you are.

608
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,480
No guy wants to put up with that.

609
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,410
You got to walk down the street
like some overprotective dog.

610
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:08,320
I am keeping everybody
away. Everybody's, we,

611
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,890
one of them was barely wearing a shirt.

612
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,970
Granted I wasn't complaining
for where I was standing front,

613
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:17,580
but I mean it just seemed kind of
obvious. You know what I mean? You got it.

614
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,500
You've got to cover up
the goods a little bit.

615
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,700
I mean I would say that to Madonna.

616
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,500
I don't know if she's currently
dating somebody right now,

617
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:28,700
but Mcdonald's and fucking unbelievable
shape for her age and if she would just

618
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:31,340
put on something elegant,
you know what I mean?

619
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:35,030
Still a rolling around with half
a fucking pussy lip hanging out.

620
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,570
I don't know why she does that.
She said something late, you know,

621
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,190
as she did yet another thicker,

622
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,580
all fucking career's been like one big
publicity stunt after another. You know,

623
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,960
I'm wearing a wedding dress,
but I'm fingering myself
at the fucking award show.

624
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:51,770
Right. You know, right from
there. And then, oh, it's Jesus,

625
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:54,680
but he's African American and
now I'm trying to fuck them.

626
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,780
It's just paint by numbers.
Shock. And what's funny is
I actually liked her music.

627
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,190
I just keep,
you know,

628
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:11,600
that's actually how I threw out my back
doing that Molly Ringwald dance. Um,

629
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,830
anyways, yeah. And then she
goes on Letterman. She says,

630
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:17,780
fuck 50,000 times.

631
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,070
She does stand up on the tonight show
was just one big fucking thing after

632
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:26,290
another. So our latest one was, she showed
up to a movie theater and I moved, Oh,

633
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,940
movie premiere,
whatever the Fuck Shit.

634
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:30,110
I don't know who the fuck
knows what it was, you know,

635
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,450
some fundraiser to get toothbrushes
to some fucking God's forsaken place.

636
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,340
So she shows and she literally has her
teddies and harass out like a see through

637
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:42,880
dress. And she of course says, well,

638
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,680
what I'm doing is I'm challenging
the boundaries and um,

639
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,500
you know, of course women, you know,
you've got to drag all that bullshit.

640
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,080
And then it's like, no, you're 57 okay.
Nobody wants to look at that. Okay.

641
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,840
Like it my h I.

642
00:38:57,841 --> 00:39:00,460
M I am willing to put on a fucking sport.
Yeah.

643
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,393
Coat

644
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,850
what he wants to see it. It's just a,
yeah, you're not pushing any boundaries.

645
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:12,290
It's just, it's a a, you know, you have
it. A little bit of a midlife prices.

646
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:15,260
I think she looks fucking great, but
she'd look way better if she fucking just,

647
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:19,880
you know,
you don't put on sprout a fucking dress.

648
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,940
Fucky I've, I dunno. But then again,

649
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:26,060
I saw Iggy pop and he
wasn't wearing a shirt,

650
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:30,890
but I don't find guys aren't
like attractive. It was
just sort of funny to me.

651
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,850
Not Funny.
I just was just him not giving a fuck.

652
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,580
So I guess if she just said,
look, I don't give a fuck.

653
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,420
I just fell a cabin my ass
and titties hanging out.

654
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,670
I wouldn't have a problem with that.

655
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:47,870
But put the fact that she's sitting
there trying to say that, no, no.

656
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:52,400
Wait a minute. I think she might
be right. Maybe she is right.

657
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,850
Hey, come here. You got
to answer this question.

658
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,730
There's a chance I might be common
life and understand the dawn of war

659
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,220
until she comes here. I'll sing a
sing some of my favorite songs by her.

660
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,230
A bad boy.
Bad girl home by six,

661
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,460
eight. Pick up the mic.
I got a question for you

662
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,490
now.
You want me back?

663
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,670
Yup. That's like that street
joke I told you. Right.

664
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,840
Watch when I heard Jackie
the joke, man, tell

665
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,140
the one about the gorilla.
No,

666
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:35,740
the one with the fucking
cause I liked that one.

667
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,770
The married guys walking out of the
house and his wife's yelling at him,

668
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,620
don't get the fuck outta here. Get the
fuck out. I never want to see you again.

669
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,220
So he's walking away and she goes,
I hope he had died a long, slow,

670
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:51,400
miserable death. And he turns around.
He goes, oh, what now you want me back?

671
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,730
That's stupid. That's a stupid joke.
Just reminded me of that. Anyway, school,

672
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,210
I could have told it better,
but I got to,

673
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:02,230
I just got off plink Jackie junk man
tells a way better. Um, all right,

674
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:05,520
so McDonogh recently borderline,

675
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,910
um, she showed up at some fucking,
you know, raise awareness thing.

676
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,193
I don't know what it was.

677
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,570
It was a carpet she showed up and she
had a butt cheeks out in a titties out.

678
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,380
Okay. This was the met ball that
happens every year in New York City.

679
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,880
And that's for the mets.

680
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:29,540
Yes, it is. Go math, but it's
just for wonderful. I know.

681
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:34,010
It's for the fucking museum.
Yes. The hacky date. Every person

682
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,720
in that twenties goes on in New York
and Madonna, let's go to a museum. Um,

683
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,910
it's a big gala and made the
Creme de Creme Darling. I invaded.

684
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,060
So Ralph Lauren pretends to fall.
He sniffs or butter and the way down.

685
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,470
So what happens? Well, you
know, this super rich people,

686
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:55,310
they're all freaks. They wasn't
at the point of eyes wide shut.

687
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,700
I don't know what the point
of eyes wide shut was.

688
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,630
What happened was Stanley Kubrick died.
He died halfway through.

689
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:07,400
I saw a great fucking movie on a plane
called the insiders. It's a movie made by,

690
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:11,300
uh, some Korean director. Man.
It was fucking phenomenal.

691
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,160
Really enjoyed it.
Okay.

692
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:18,410
Had One of the best fucking
fight scenes that I, I've seen,

693
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,840
cause the guy was missing her head,
you know, so he had to like fucking,

694
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,470
you know, everybody knew one
handy was throwing right.

695
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,820
And it was multiple attackers.
It was the shit.

696
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,950
I almost gave it a standing
ovation on the plane.

697
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,540
If it was pre nine 11 I could have done
it. But I started to do and they're like,

698
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,383
sorry

699
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,470
I had to sit down and okay,
it's another freedom lost.

700
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,960
So anyways,
so fucking,

701
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,550
but Donna shows up. Yes. Okay.

702
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,010
So she says that she's trying to fucking
push the boundaries of whatever the

703
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,900
fucking sex and that type of thing.
Yeah. Okay. So I was going like, no,

704
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:08,860
c'mon, you're 57 no wants to see
me without a shirt on grants.

705
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:12,810
She's in better shape than I, but like,
you know, Almond must my sport coat year,

706
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,230
like, you know, covered
up their freckles. Right.

707
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,940
So what I'm saying is you're in your
sport coat you yeah, yeah, yeah.

708
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:22,520
You get to a certain point, you get
to your forties and stuff like that.

709
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,370
Women Dress elegantly. And men dress like
gentlemen. Yeah. In other words, yeah.

710
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,860
You cover up,
uh,

711
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:31,670
you know the fucking battle scars
of what you've been through can too.

712
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:36,220
When he fucking wine and cheese plates.
No,

713
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,690
what I'm saying is, so I was saying with
Mark Madonna, just put on a nice dress.

714
00:43:39,691 --> 00:43:43,850
You could look really elegant. Right.
That's not really her vibe. Yeah, I know.

715
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,110
I know. But you know something. It's
like you look even, who's kidding who?

716
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,820
Michael Jackson, he, if he
was still alive, the short
pants with the glitter socks.

717
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:56,620
It's like, come on dude. Some point
you've got to update the look. What is it?

718
00:43:56,621 --> 00:44:01,040
What is your point? Let this
hall and Madonna thing. So
I was, I was saying that,

719
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:04,880
but then I was like, wait a minute. But
when I saw Iggy pop with no shirt on,

720
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,990
I thought it was bad ass that daddy
didn't give a fuck site. That's,

721
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:12,680
that's bullshit. So I should be actually
applauding Madonna. Wow. Look at you.

722
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:17,390
See that? That's not, that's not okay. I
was going to say, you're going like, wow,

723
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:20,480
look at you. You're really not as
dumb. So my apologies to Madonna

724
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,790
fee is like, I'm sure take it.

725
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,980
Look at my fucking 57 year old

726
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,580
kid tds teas.
She's my age with tense.

727
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,590
She's 10 years, we're 10 years
apart. So she's 50 wait, what?

728
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,110
Madonna? 57 years. Wait is she, is she
was born in the same area as prince?

729
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,740
Oh Shit. Oh, same year as Michael Jackson.

730
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,960
Michael Jackson was 58
prince was 58 and take,

731
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:58,550
but Donna was 58 I never
know how old Madonna is ever.

732
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,940
And that was like in 1957 Oh my God,
you're right. She's going to be 58 right?

733
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,500
Had no idea. And August, yeah,

734
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:09,510
she'll be 58 so 1958 as far as
music goes was kind of like 1943

735
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,260
1943 was Janis Joplin,
Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison

736
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,220
all born 1943

737
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,200
and then they all died in 1970 and then
people started to understand drugs and

738
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:33,400
you know, bringing a jump rope on
the road and maybe becoming a Vegan.

739
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,790
So now that they live longer and
Michael made it to 50 prints,

740
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:41,050
made it to 57 but don is still going okay.
Right.

741
00:45:41,051 --> 00:45:46,051
So all of them in their own way kind
of went on stage with their ass hanging

742
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:51,790
out. Right. Um, okay.

743
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,210
Are you going to fill up
an hour? I gotta fuck it.

744
00:45:57,211 --> 00:46:01,740
I want to do some questions here.
Okay. Say you brought me into,

745
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,370
show me that you've evolved and
seeing your own. Oh, I was trying,

746
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,360
I was trying to see if that was a double
standard women and showing their bodies

747
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,410
and you know,

748
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:13,350
double standard also works with women
the way they look at guys in certain

749
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:16,170
situation to what you guys
aren't like perfect. No one,

750
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,020
no one is claiming to be
perfect to media just seems to

751
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,240
cover your complaints.

752
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,410
And then this just told
you ever have a voice.

753
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,050
Thank God you have this podcast.

754
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,220
I know. No one would hear me. Okay,

755
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,870
listen, you got to understand
the world doesn't live with me.

756
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,270
They don't have the privilege of
living with me the way you do.

757
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,900
So I need to do this once a week.

758
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,200
That's a fucking beautiful watch. Who
got you that? You did? That's right.

759
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:52,660
Asshole response to stinky
German from last week.

760
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,100
So this poor bastard,

761
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:59,850
he's German, right? Yes. And
uh, so he lives in Germany.

762
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,450
He's old school. He didn't
leave and try to be like, hey,

763
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:07,650
I wasn't part of that Hitler thing.
Right. He still has his grandparents

764
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,990
said, you know, I don't know if it's me,
but this guy's making a lot of sense.

765
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,293
So,

766
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,620
so because of the mistakes
for fathers and mothers,

767
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,640
the gods have cursed him that he just
sort of smells a little musty and he's

768
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:33,430
cheese tries showering, it has all this
shit. He doesn't know what the fuck to do.

769
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,370
So evidently this,
this and this other musty guy,

770
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,940
formerly musty guy heard about this.
Okay.

771
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,980
Does he look into his diet? Yeah, we do.

772
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:47,980
We talked about that and how it ptosis
and maybe have a fucking as a sinus

773
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,510
infection. I don't know what, but
he just, he just smells bad. Yeah.

774
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,280
No matter how matter how much he
shower. So this guy says, yeah,

775
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:59,200
he wears deodorant. Yeah. It
was quite, it's quite a mystery.

776
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,740
Boy,
I tell you that,

777
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:06,010
Whoa, this person is in response to
this. This is a formerly musty person,

778
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:09,790
so I hope this helps
the, uh, the Sauerkraut.

779
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,780
Oh,
Jesus.

780
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,410
That is my best fucking fun ever.
I'm sorry.

781
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,370
Shit was great. All that was pretty good.
That was bad. Was good. That was good.

782
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,470
That was good. All right.
I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

783
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,031
He said,

784
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:38,420
I'm gonna and keep this simple because
we all know of you're reading issues

785
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,710
would, I admittedly have,
I've been a fan for years,

786
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,860
but this is the first time I feel
the need to chime in on something.

787
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,720
Last week you read a question from a
German guy that had a musty body odor and

788
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:53,210
did not know what to do about
it. He said, growing up,

789
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,270
I dealt with the same bullshit
that poor SAP is going through.

790
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:01,460
I always smelled musty. I could not wash
it away, no matter how often I showered.

791
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,380
This is brutal.
I feel bad for these people.

792
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,800
I tried everything and
finally realized it was,

793
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,280
it was antiperspirant
for some weird reason.

794
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:14,270
My Body reacted when I put
it on and I smelled musty.

795
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,840
I actually stopped wearing deodorant
for a few weeks in the winter,

796
00:49:17,841 --> 00:49:21,710
so I did not smell like a complete savage.
After that period of time,

797
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:26,340
I began wearing deodorant only
skipping all brands with anti person.

798
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,290
Uh, happily the stinky,
musty odor went away.

799
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,670
Hope this works. You Stinky
Fuck, love the podcast.

800
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,240
Your comedy and F is for family
and go fuck yourself. Yeah,

801
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:42,500
so basically what I got from that is
maybe his body is having a reaction to

802
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:45,830
something that he is using. I don't
know. Cause your body should sweat.

803
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:49,430
It's the way to keep you cool. Right.
That's the whole point of sweating.

804
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:54,890
So antiperspirant,
I know maybe people who sweat excessively,

805
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,470
they don't want to be sweating
through their clothes or something.

806
00:49:57,471 --> 00:50:00,470
So I don't know. But it sounds
like that person to go to a doctor.

807
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,680
Well they haven't been able to figure
out what's going on and he's in Germany

808
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:08,520
too and those guys don't fuck around over
there. They're very efficient. Yeah. No

809
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,230
cars. The trades, the
rocket side trick, you know,

810
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:19,280
everybody could just forgive him
for that one crazy 10 year period.

811
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,970
I think they got a little
sideways. They'll never,
they'll never live it down. No,

812
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,530
you can't. Sorry. You know what?
It's on video. That's quite,

813
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:33,080
you know, other countries could do shit.
And it happened before like a certain,

814
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:37,220
something that happened in 1915
that we always see advertised. Uh,

815
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,240
my vote dear bill on Capitol Hill
and I know what you're talking about.

816
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,223
Well you should,

817
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,100
you know what if there was movie cameras
around you with movie cameras? Yup.

818
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,450
Motion picture things.
Have you ever heard of vermin supreme?

819
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,230
Um, he's been on, I, I don't,

820
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,080
I don't believe that this is somebody
whose name I'm going to look this up

821
00:50:57,081 --> 00:51:00,860
before you guys make a fool of me,
which is not hard to do.

822
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,480
Why don't you read it first?

823
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,410
Because then I start commenting and then
halfway through I realize it's a prank

824
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:10,490
phone call. Vermin
supreme. It's coming up.

825
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,110
Vermin Supreme Vermin supreme
as an American performance.

826
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:19,790
Ardor artists and activists who has
run as a candidate and very low various

827
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:24,760
local states. Um, okay,
let me see what this,

828
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,710
what's up with this guy? Okay.
I never heard of this guy.

829
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,700
He's been on the ballot in New Hampshire
and his platform has a lot to do with

830
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:35,840
dental health. He also has a plan
in place for the Zombie Apocalypse,

831
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:40,841
which involves setting up thousands of
treadmills to put the zombies on to help

832
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:44,420
power the new world. He wears
a giant boot on his head. Oh,

833
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:46,640
I've seen this fucking guy.
That boot that's right,

834
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,200
and carries around a rubber toothbrush.
Here's an article on him.

835
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,280
He also has promised free
ponies for everyone. Oh,

836
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,210
so he's a whack job.

837
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:02,930
I don't know if he's a whack job because
that's a really funny joke though.

838
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:06,800
The zombies on the treadmill. Are
you looking them up? Are you texting?

839
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:11,090
I was looking at Madonna photos.
Okay.

840
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:14,570
We were back here and we've now,
we moved on. We've moved on,

841
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,680
but I had just was still looking
at photos. I'm here. Don't preach.

842
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:24,470
I mean trouble. Dino
happened, Dope Madonna songs.

843
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:31,910
I just said, I'm sorry. I did my
fucking, I did see your, your, your,

844
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:36,090
your vocal warmups. Yeah. This was
not a good luck at the met ball.

845
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,250
It was just I, yeah. Oh ladies,

846
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:43,370
can we stick together? First of all, it's

847
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,450
got something. I'm right
at home, but now it's not.

848
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:55,370
I'm not being catty. She
just, it's just so thirsty.

849
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,480
It's just, I don't, and I love Madonna,

850
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,800
but this is just too
much. I get done. Yeah,

851
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,320
I'm done. Sure. I'm
sure her kids enjoy, uh,

852
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,230
wife's family is a bunch
of dramatic babies. Oh God.

853
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,370
You're the baby. And we go, hey
bill, I'm sick of this election.

854
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:19,310
I hope Trump wins. I know he's
a jerk, but I hate Hillary.

855
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,510
I think Bernie is a nice guy without
a clue. He says a lot of great things,

856
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:28,210
but he's going to raise taxes. He talks
about making college free, but his taxes,

857
00:53:28,211 --> 00:53:31,570
we'll make it hard. Nothing is free.
Yeah, that's never going to happen.

858
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,210
But I think that, you know, free health
care, it's not, this is not free.

859
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,720
Somebody has got to fucking pay for it.
He talks about making college free,

860
00:53:37,721 --> 00:53:41,110
but it's taxes will make it harder for
people like me to pay my student loans.

861
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,930
I make 95 grand a year.
I have a kid,

862
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:47,530
a hundred grand in student loans between
me and my wife, we live comfortably.

863
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:52,150
But if you take another 20 $504,000
from him a year, I will feel it.

864
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:57,100
Yeah, definitely. I am already
only netting 60. What is
the fuck is all of this?

865
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,140
What's the point?
The family has adventure.

866
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,380
Dramatic babies.

867
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:03,940
Okay.

868
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,290
All right. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

869
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,420
MMM.

870
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,350
Okay. So we're getting to, we're getting
to a family here somewhere. Okay.

871
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,440
I'm not opposed to giving money to help
people who need it, but when is enough?

872
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:21,640
Enough, $1 trillion on dumb shit
every year. And you need more from me.

873
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,680
Fuck off Bernie. I love how
he's blaming Bernie. You know,

874
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,760
if Bernie didn't create
the fucking situation, um,

875
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,760
he's trying to get us out of it. I guess.
I don't know if it's going to work.

876
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:37,990
I don't think, I mean, I don't know if
people will work with the guy, but oh God,

877
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:41,740
what a fucking decision this year.
Um, so I make this point to my wife,

878
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,970
my wife's family. I didn't yell. I
didn't say fuck off Bernie. I just said,

879
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,960
I don't think we,

880
00:54:46,961 --> 00:54:51,070
the people should have to give more
money if they're wasting the money they

881
00:54:51,071 --> 00:54:54,850
already get. Well, my wife's
family lost their shit.

882
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:58,180
They said that I'm selfish
and that if I vote for Trump,

883
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,390
I'm endorsing hate and greed and fascism,

884
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:06,580
a really question mark. They endorsed
Obama and I have a problem with him.

885
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,180
Hatefully blowing up kids and
wedding parties with drones.

886
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,810
Why doesn't that make them hateful?
Uh,

887
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,730
they then went on to talk about for
30 minutes about hate and how theirs,

888
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,930
they were scared about what would happen
to the country and they're scared about

889
00:55:22,931 --> 00:55:25,390
how children would grow
up in a country with,

890
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,260
and I quote Hitler minus
the concentration camps.

891
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,910
I told him that comparing an Egomaniac
to Hitler is unfair to the victims of the

892
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:37,270
Holocaust.
It trivializes the actual evil of Hitler.

893
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,420
Hitler embodied her mother and father
were both taken it back and said that my

894
00:55:42,431 --> 00:55:45,880
way of thinking could potentially
be dangerous to their grandchildren.

895
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,320
What period the fuck period is going,

896
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:53,020
period on period. Well, you're dope.

897
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,010
Yeah. You fucking opened up your
fucking mouth of Bob's politics.

898
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,780
No, he isn't. He's young. He doesn't
know. Well, what's now, you know,

899
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,650
how did you learn? How did you learn
and how did I learn by bringing it out?

900
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:09,270
By doing that? Yeah. This is the deal.
Yeah. You know, you can't talk, talk

901
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,590
about politics and religion and shit
like that. Those are going to say it got,

902
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:18,240
it got really heated right
before they said that shit. Well,

903
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,950
you can't, and also he just, he
can't, I don't know. He got to,

904
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,090
if you really

905
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,750
are going to vote for Trump,
I just,

906
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:32,010
I think there's only certain sections
of the United States where you could say

907
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:35,220
that where you'll get a, yeah, I get it.
Oh, well tell me more about your opinion.

908
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,950
I feel like if you say, you know
what, fuck this, I'm voting for Trump,

909
00:56:37,951 --> 00:56:40,350
most people are going to be like,
are you fucking kidding me?

910
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:45,280
So I'm not surprised at that,
but no. Yeah, you really,
a lot of shit. And I was,

911
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,790
I made fun of him when, uh, you
know, I got some shit for it.

912
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:53,740
For making fun of Trump. Yeah. From
whole people who support Trump.

913
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,550
Oh, well, okay, fine. Yeah,
they have, believe it or not,

914
00:56:57,551 --> 00:57:01,210
this people that she has a lot
more than I thought. Remember when,

915
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,340
when he was first talking about
running and we're both like,

916
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,190
this is never going to happen.
This is a joke. This is ridiculous.

917
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:10,390
And now here we are and he's like
the only Republican left standing.

918
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,750
So I mean, I guess I underestimated
him and he's like the last home party.

919
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:20,070
He's like the Leicester City of Pollock
politicians. But here's the thing,

920
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,410
I family. But I think like, you know,

921
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,580
Hillary Clinton is the fucking devil
because she's acting like she gives a fuck

922
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,630
and she's, you know, she's one of those
Bilderberg people. I don't like her.

923
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:34,030
I like Bernie out of all of them.
I liked Bernie Sanders.

924
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:36,550
I just don't think anybody's
going to fucking work with, well,

925
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:39,430
the California primary is coming up,
so he's,

926
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:44,170
he's not thrown in the towel with Ernie,
but we got to Ireland.

927
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,053
I am.

928
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:50,610
I have to vote for a person that I feel
is actually truly gives a shit about

929
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:56,380
regular people and that would
be him. Whether he's going
to be successful or not.

930
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,740
And I know what a lot of people,
wholesaler,

931
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,530
you're going to put Trump good old office.

932
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,350
I've always voted for the fucking third
wheel. Every fucking God damn time. Well,

933
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:08,780
when the primary happens,
we got to vote for him.

934
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,990
That's the only way that he'll listen.
I don't have to do anything that you say.

935
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,470
Okay. But uh, I don't know what
I'm going to do. So basically his,

936
00:58:15,471 --> 00:58:18,530
this guy's in law, you know,
we just did. We just did.

937
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,330
We just did with this guy did,

938
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:25,130
which is what we just fucking
talked politics and it
gave endorsements to Bernie

939
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:26,060
said,
we shouldn't have done that.

940
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,680
I still haven't made up my
mind that I'm going to do that.

941
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,070
Why are we were giving endorsements
just by talking about it,

942
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,760
by saying that you're going to do it.
Well, that's how I feel like that guy,

943
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,970
that fuck, we're like those, those people
that you see on Facebook and they go,

944
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,320
Hey,
do you know me?

945
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,340
I pretend to be a doctor on his soap
opera and I think this is who you should

946
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:45,710
vote for. I apologize
for that people. I, I,

947
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,820
I tried not to say that eventually she
was going to come up doors seeing anybody

948
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,670
weird. Well, let's just
leave it. I'll tell you what.

949
00:58:52,671 --> 00:58:57,050
I'm endorsing a nice fucking
cold Budweiser. When I sit
down to watch game five

950
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,450
doors, what is, what does he want to know?
He is just sort of like, what the hell?

951
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,440
Now My,

952
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,860
now my inlaws don't want
me to have children with my
wife because they think I'm

953
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:09,770
evil and they're going to,
I'm going to raise a little evil.

954
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:14,420
Trump's might think about Trump is his
fucking lack of compassion for fucking

955
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:14,661
people.

956
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:18,620
When you sit there and say take his coat
and like riling people up like that was

957
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,430
just says that he says
really awful things,

958
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,180
but the thing I like about him is he
lets me know that they actually count the

959
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:29,720
votes because no super rich
people want that fucking guy.

960
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,180
And I always thought for years
my conspiracy theory is like,

961
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:34,940
they don't count these fucking things.
They do. Oh, it's pretty fucking close.

962
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,630
And they put the money on both horses
and then, then the fucking fine. But uh,

963
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:40,730
the fact that he's actually doing well,

964
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:46,730
he's speaking a lot of people out there
needing, it's going to build a wall.

965
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:48,830
He's going to have the people
he's walling and pay for it,

966
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,060
felony these talking mad shit.
And now I feel like I,

967
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:56,330
all those years of watching the apprentice
and the celebrity apprentice are now

968
00:59:56,331 --> 01:00:00,050
coming back to when you tried to find
a CEO for a company that doesn't exist.

969
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,970
It's all coming back
to bite me in the ass.

970
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:03,830
I've been supporting him
this whole entire time.

971
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:10,370
I'm partly to blame for this boss Shit.
So what does this look?

972
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:13,400
He can't be a complete moron. What does
this kid saying? What does this point?

973
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,740
He's just is, no, he's
just saying what the fuck.

974
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:20,430
So we just will not talk about politics
anymore around your inlaws, Huh?

975
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,780
Tell you that much. But then he said,
looking forward to seeing you in Dublin,

976
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,260
myself and some friends that will
be coming from Belfast. Well,

977
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:30,440
I'm going to be doing Belfast
too, so you don't even, yeah,

978
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:34,970
you don't even need to do that. Yeah.
I were putting together the dates,

979
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:37,370
so I'm definitely doing Dublin.
Definitely doing Belfast.

980
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,650
I'm doing a little 10 day tour over there,
cause skin.

981
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,000
It's not a good time to go to Scandinavia
this time of year because they

982
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:48,800
actually have sunlight and it's
warm out, so when I usually, well,

983
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,030
because they're going to want
to be outside. Okay. Yeah.

984
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,081
Yeah.

985
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:57,740
If you go in December and it's already
fucking dark and go to movies and stuff,

986
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:58,401
still though,

987
01:00:58,401 --> 01:01:01,580
I would imagine just cause it's sunlight
most of the time doesn't mean why would

988
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:04,330
I listen to the promoters over
there? I'll listen to it. All right.

989
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:08,270
When is this happening?
I'm going to go.

990
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:12,320
That's going to be happening and to Jill
like I think it's going to start on the

991
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:15,710
31st and it's going to go into August.
Very excited about that.

992
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:19,400
Exciting things are happening.
I love Ireland. I know.

993
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:23,360
I love the people in Ireland.
Look who you're with. Oh,

994
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:27,600
potato face himself here and vice
with neighbors emotionally. German,

995
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,310
all mighty Billy.
I don't,

996
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:33,960
I actually don't even know that cause I
never done the whole La [inaudible] is

997
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:39,020
like a more German than Irish cause I
am Jeremiah Irish Catholic podcasts.

998
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,490
It doesn't get any wider. Doesn't
get it. Doesn't get any wider, right.

999
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:48,500
All mighty Billy Ball bag. Ah, all
right. And vice with neighbors. Question.

1000
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:54,220
I live in an apartment complex here in
the lovely state of Oklahoma and I have

1001
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,950
this neighbor who lets her dog
out on her balcony every morning.

1002
01:01:57,951 --> 01:02:02,060
Somewhere between the hours
of four and 5:00 AM oof.

1003
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,870
The dog barks aggressively
for hours afterward.

1004
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,600
Of course it wakes me up.
Poor thing.

1005
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,440
The dog that is and this about this poor
bastard or lady Oklahoma in Oklahoma

1006
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:17,930
and Oklahoma in

1007
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,680
am Oklahoma. Oh sexual. No.

1008
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:30,280
Isn't that one of the characters
on your Nashville show?

1009
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,010
I want to write a song with you.
Lax about us.

1010
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:40,450
They gay cowboy, the gay cowboys to
gay cowboys. Cutting edge character.

1011
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:45,850
That's the first gay cowboy ever
in primetime in Bram time. Yes.

1012
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,400
Prime time during the lunch hour.

1013
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:50,110
It was just littered with
them when I was growing up.

1014
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:57,250
Those people on Captain Kangaroo, right?
Ernie and Bert isn't what they said.

1015
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:59,470
All those guys. Right.
All right, question.

1016
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:03,490
I live in an apartment complex here in
the lovely state of Oklahoma. Okay. Yeah.

1017
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:07,170
The dog barks aggressively for hours.
It wakes me up and I have to go.

1018
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:12,240
I have to work at 8:00 AM I filed
complaints after an altercation in which I

1019
01:03:12,551 --> 01:03:17,230
went out and scream, shut your fucking
dog up before I make you shut him up now.

1020
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:21,670
Was that your opening line now or
something along those lines? My mess.

1021
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:26,730
My message has not been
heard by the apartment cons
and she continues to let the

1022
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:31,540
dog out. What should I do?
Sincerely, a blue collar working man,

1023
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:35,560
just trying to get some fucking
sleep. Who's the soup? Also?

1024
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:40,090
Saint Louis Blues gave the stars
of fucking Molly whopping today.

1025
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,420
Hope you watched it. I missed that. Um,

1026
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:47,530
well fuck gear and you're in Oklahoma,
man. You know what she need to do?

1027
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:52,000
Take out your side iron.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, eh,

1028
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,150
take the fucking dog outs.
The bill plow.

1029
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:00,670
Don't even joke about it with rubber
bullets. Don't even check about that.

1030
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:01,870
Who is your super?
No,

1031
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,600
he put rubber bullets in the gun and
every time the dog barks, I resigned.

1032
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:09,670
The dog barks. You shoot it
and its ass and it starts, oh,

1033
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,290
when I bark and then I'll shut
up. Now you can't do that. Uh,

1034
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:18,220
you would get arrested for that.
So why don't I would just go down.

1035
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:22,600
I would buy a month's worth
a cube. Steaks. All right.

1036
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,450
Why does it,
does the dog shit and Piss on the balcony?

1037
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,450
Is that why she's letting it out there?
Cause that's gross. I don't know.

1038
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:32,950
But that is so fucking not acceptable
because you know it's probably the fucking

1039
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:37,920
dog gets up at four at 5:00 AM it's
keeping her up or him up. So they,

1040
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:42,250
oh my God. No, it's you gotta you gotta
call them on or something. I'll wait.

1041
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,680
Did he say that they're not
paying attention at the,

1042
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,320
like we say it's not going over well
with the people in the apartment?

1043
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,670
Well he has like, she just has a
neighbor. I can't, I don't think I was,

1044
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,530
it's an apartment complex.
Yeah.

1045
01:04:56,531 --> 01:04:58,410
You got to say something to the
management company. Oh look,

1046
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,600
there's no fucking way. He's the
only person that's ignored by this.

1047
01:05:01,601 --> 01:05:06,601
Of course I would go around and I would
get a bunch of signatures and then I

1048
01:05:07,121 --> 01:05:11,490
would, you know, try to have everybody
all get together and say, uh,

1049
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,190
that bitch needs to shut
the other bitch. Oh, oh,

1050
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,930
oh no.
What's up buddy?

1051
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:20,963
Okay.

1052
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,310
Yeah. This will be like, it's time
for this one probably to go out.

1053
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,590
Speaking of all that. All
right, well you do that. Well,

1054
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,420
I will wrap up the podcast here. No,
you take it around. I took my survey.

1055
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,350
It was a Jacksonville this morning. That's
my, uh, that's my excuse. All right,

1056
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,020
well that's going to be
the, uh, the lay down. Wait,

1057
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:44,670
so we didn't offer any advice
besides, you're a horrible
joking advice. Of course.

1058
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,800
I just said, dude, get
a bunch of signatures.

1059
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,990
You can get enough signatures
is not going to do shit.

1060
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:51,510
You got to go to the
management company and be like,

1061
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,690
this dog is barking at four or five
in the morning every morning. Oh,

1062
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,630
he said he already did that. Oh,
a narrow. Not Paying attention.

1063
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:00,630
You said he's in this fucking, what do
you think signatures are going to do?

1064
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:05,550
A technology like to hear about? Oh no,
that's not it. Oh wait, I missed one.

1065
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:07,810
Okay.

1066
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:11,910
He said, I have this name. I live in an
apartment complex. The dog barks. I've,

1067
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:16,610
I filed complaints. Yeah. Like
nothing's happening that sacks. Wow,

1068
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:20,470
you have to do this thing. I'm not going
to pay my fucking rent. There you go.

1069
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:24,310
I'm not paying my rent until you get this
woman to shut this damn dog. Oh yeah.

1070
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:27,520
Cause that's not fair.
Yeah, she's lived there.

1071
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,960
That sounds like something an older
person would do to just like put their dog

1072
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:36,961
out on the balcony and just let it bark
all morning because it probably goes

1073
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:40,150
out, takes a piss, takes a shit,

1074
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:43,210
and then wants to come inside
and meanwhile the owner
has gone back to sleep.

1075
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:48,910
All right, well obviously I was joking.
You don't shoot what the doc? No,

1076
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:53,880
you don't. That's right. Clear.
Here's the other one. Um,

1077
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:58,210
all right. Virtual
reality headset. Blow job.

1078
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:03,460
Uh, all right. I know you hate technology,

1079
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:06,610
but we'd like to hear your
opinion on this. My girlfriend,

1080
01:07:06,611 --> 01:07:11,611
half jokingly promised me a double
blow job from my 30th birthday.

1081
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:14,590
Okay.

1082
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,480
Um,
I do not expect this to happen,

1083
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:20,770
but I have been joking with her that the
date is approaching and she should have

1084
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:22,390
a girl lined up,
et cetera.

1085
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:27,190
I have also been talking about
virtual reality slash Vr headset.

1086
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:31,800
As I'm thinking of getting one, I don't
know what that is. Yeah. What is that?

1087
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:36,370
She asked me the other day, would I be
able to watch porn through it? I said yes.

1088
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:40,120
She then said instead of the double by,

1089
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:45,630
why don't you wear the headset
and I can give you normal.

1090
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:50,990
Oh, by while watching a porno.
What? What are you saying?

1091
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:55,030
Bye. Oh, Bj. Yeah. Oh, you know what?

1092
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:58,930
It was underlined in red,
so I couldn't see the bottom of products.

1093
01:07:58,931 --> 01:08:00,190
Like why does this by,

1094
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:07,510
Oh my God, you're really,
skills are atrocious. Yeah.

1095
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,730
And by would actually mean that there
wouldn't be a guy and a girl doing it.

1096
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:14,950
I wasn't even, I was thinking about
like his girlfriend would be like by,

1097
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,970
because she was down
there with another chick.

1098
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:22,280
I am stupid.
See this people,

1099
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:25,340
Youtube could be successful in life.
You're dumb as me.

1100
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:31,850
She then she then instead of instead
of a double Bj me read this again. Wow.

1101
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:35,690
Why don't you wear a headset and I could
give you a normal BJ while watching a

1102
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,190
porno. Why can't you do that now with
a TV? Because I feel like when they,

1103
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,370
I'm like weird tron futuristic shit.

1104
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:48,371
When you put it on this opening Pandora's
box or is this a way for Vr to be seen

1105
01:08:51,021 --> 01:08:55,430
as a techie sex toy? You are really
asking the wrong person that question.

1106
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,580
You know, Bill doesn't know. We're
looking forward to see you in Dublin.

1107
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:02,530
Myself and some friends will be
coming from belts. Oh this is the I,

1108
01:09:02,531 --> 01:09:05,090
that was the one. Okay.
Um, is this the same?

1109
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:09,230
I read the ending to the other one to
that one and it was weird because the

1110
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:10,730
ending was in front of the other one.

1111
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:17,510
Oh fuck you and fuck everybody
else. Yeah. Big. It's all funny.

1112
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:20,840
It's all fun and games. Until
I stopped podcasting. Ah, Oh,

1113
01:09:20,841 --> 01:09:25,710
I've had enough of this sensitive.
Uh, no I'm not, I don't care. Um,

1114
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:29,090
it is a slippery slope, but I feel
like that could be really kind of cool.

1115
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,030
Does she get to do it too?
Like does she get to watch some porn?

1116
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:36,680
Why you like go down on her? That'd
be really trippy. It would be trippy.

1117
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:39,470
But the thing is then,
then what ends up happening is,

1118
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,300
is then you end up getting
like a that that disconnect.

1119
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,340
Right.
And now you don't want to do anything.

1120
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:50,780
That's the one of you is wearing the
helmet. Yeah. It's weird. I'm like, God,

1121
01:09:50,781 --> 01:09:54,740
I have to like see you. So that's
all good. It's a dangerous, yeah.

1122
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:57,890
That's like one of those things like do
you think I could do however one once

1123
01:09:57,891 --> 01:10:02,540
and like be all right with
that now I saw something,

1124
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,990
I'm
trying to think where I saw it.

1125
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:10,850
Saw what in one of those Asian countries,

1126
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:15,350
because they're always ahead of us. They
have better cell phones. There was a, uh,

1127
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,430
a guy trying out like a
virtual reality sex suit,

1128
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,150
which I had a bit on this
thing in like the uh,

1129
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:28,070
late nineties when I first heard that they
were going to do that. And by the way,

1130
01:10:28,071 --> 01:10:30,590
the fact that you haven't already
called me outgoing, like bulk bill,

1131
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,040
how did you just stumble upon
this? I'm dead honest. What?

1132
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:37,430
I don't remember for the rest of the
story cause I felt like there was more,

1133
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:41,870
it could have been while I was
watching Internet porn probably. Yeah.

1134
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:44,390
But they don't have advertising
advertisers for that.

1135
01:10:44,391 --> 01:10:46,870
It was like a story on
the side of the thing.

1136
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:51,140
They have all those and how do you
know that? Yeah, right back at you.

1137
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:56,930
So yeah, but they don't have
any, don't have ads like that.
Right. That's true. Well,

1138
01:10:56,931 --> 01:11:00,610
this is what it was. It looked
like a fucking dude. He was like,

1139
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,920
let a mummy suit who's hilarious.

1140
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,900
He was all wrapped up in toilet paper,

1141
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:10,670
but that's how I remember it because
it was so horrifying. It was just,

1142
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:13,990
it was one of those things, whatever I
was looking at that came up and I went,

1143
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,500
wow. Right. And it looked like

1144
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,363
mmm.

1145
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:24,700
His hands went to his side. He
had on the fucking, you know,

1146
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,240
I'm old and I can't see anymore.
Those glasses,

1147
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:31,880
those cataract glad cataract
glasses from the drugstore. Yeah,

1148
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,730
so he had on those,

1149
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:37,930
I think it was all wrapped up because he
didn't want anybody to see who he was.

1150
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:41,170
Maybe that's what it was.
And then there was this thing,

1151
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:45,070
obviously his dick was in
it. Oh my God. And it just,

1152
01:11:45,071 --> 01:11:49,030
the same way your hand would be going like
bang, Bang, Bang, Bang against yourself.

1153
01:11:49,031 --> 01:11:52,300
It was this thing.
It was the most fucked up thing ever.

1154
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:55,150
Would you ever use one of
those flash bought things.

1155
01:11:55,151 --> 01:11:59,590
You know how porn stars they get
home old are so fucking gross.

1156
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,290
I think those things,
those things are so fucking gross.

1157
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,740
A long time ago I did somebody podcast.
I'm not gonna say who,

1158
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:07,720
but people who listen
to podcasts, no. Who is,

1159
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:12,310
he had one of those things and it looks
like some Jeffrey Dahmer body part.

1160
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:17,310
No automatically who you're talking just
sitting. I don't think you'd do. Oh okay.

1161
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,970
Cause I know who you're going to guess.
But it wasn't that person. Um, it looked,

1162
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:23,410
no, it just looked like
and it, did he say that it,

1163
01:12:23,411 --> 01:12:28,060
did it feel like a re it can't feel like
a real vagina obviously, but like it,

1164
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,740
if it's just, it's, I,

1165
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,190
I can't believe that it does.

1166
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:37,600
Like shit like that doesn't cause
you to either be like become like a

1167
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:39,850
necrophiliac or some sort of perk.

1168
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:45,640
Why would it make you feel necrophilia
cause you're fucking something that looks,

1169
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,920
looks like a body part and it's not alive.

1170
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:52,510
Women have like dildos and vibrators and
stuff and it's like the same sensation.

1171
01:12:52,511 --> 01:12:55,960
So why wouldn't a one of those
fleshed bought things feel like,

1172
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:56,660
isn't that kind of,

1173
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:01,660
it's just like another Madonna Iggy pop
thing by looking at it the wrong way

1174
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,720
maybe? No, I don't think. No, I
don't think you're looking at it.

1175
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:07,030
I remember back in the days,
back in the day,

1176
01:13:07,031 --> 01:13:10,090
don't like the idea of a fake vagina.
You don't,

1177
01:13:10,091 --> 01:13:14,050
you're not comfortable just sitting on a
table and it has a handle on it and I'm

1178
01:13:14,051 --> 01:13:17,590
holding it. No, that's not your thing.

1179
01:13:17,591 --> 01:13:21,100
You're not into that feels like
Henry portrait of a serial killer.

1180
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,010
I remember back in the day,

1181
01:13:24,011 --> 01:13:28,720
right when you actually had to go to a
porno store to get your porn and they had

1182
01:13:28,721 --> 01:13:29,530
like, you know, always,

1183
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:33,430
always behind the counter and
they would have shut up there.

1184
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:39,490
It was like what's in the box?

1185
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,040
It was literally a head in a box and
the chicks buck was like, all right,

1186
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,830
like you stick your Dick in it. You
know like somebody is going to buy that.

1187
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:49,660
Yeah.
It was in like the same box,

1188
01:13:49,661 --> 01:13:54,661
like a basketball came in and grab it by
its fucking ears that are stuck to the

1189
01:13:55,131 --> 01:14:00,131
side of its head and they're just going
to go home and fuck ahead just to head

1190
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,180
now. There's no fucking way
that that doesn't fuck you up.

1191
01:14:04,181 --> 01:14:08,560
Psychologically.
If you do that long enough,

1192
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,150
then you go out with a real person.

1193
01:14:10,151 --> 01:14:13,700
It's already annoying that they have to
buy it dinner and that this is a whole

1194
01:14:13,701 --> 01:14:17,480
body attached to it and you have
to talk to it. Yeah, and they all,

1195
01:14:17,481 --> 01:14:21,730
they're thinking of just grabbing you by
your ears. Water, water, water. It's over.

1196
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:24,800
Yeah, it's fucked up. Well,

1197
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,290
I still feel like we're
going back to the question.

1198
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:30,890
I feel like they can experiment
with it like once or twice,

1199
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:34,040
but it can't be like a regular thing
that they're doing all the time because

1200
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:38,600
then that'll completely fuck up your
sex life because then you'll just be

1201
01:14:38,601 --> 01:14:43,220
looking at everything you do. Like
it's supposed to be this hyper reality,

1202
01:14:43,221 --> 01:14:46,730
dual reality virtual.
It's just not good,

1203
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,660
you know? Fast forward here. Okay.

1204
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:56,320
Now. So that becomes the
thing, right? Which you know,

1205
01:14:56,330 --> 01:15:01,330
it's gonna people are gonna do it and
then it's going to become is porn stars

1206
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:06,810
will be making all of that
fucking money and it basically,

1207
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:11,460
you have a girl fucking now they'll
probably just be like the whole suit.

1208
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,290
It's eventually just going
to be the whole suit. Right.

1209
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:17,520
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about like in the future,

1210
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,870
like when like everybody has
like a virtual reality sex suit.

1211
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:23,880
This will actually help the
population problem, right?

1212
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:27,930
The virtual reality sex suit.
Okay.

1213
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:33,470
And then porn stars will
then have their likeness,

1214
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:39,120
they'll do a POV porn and then they
get money and then you have to like

1215
01:15:39,121 --> 01:15:39,954
subscribe.

1216
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:45,340
So you can do a virtual reality thing
where you with any porn star with like

1217
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:49,830
awesome. And then he, and then
here's what happens. Okay.

1218
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:54,980
Who's going to be the first celebrity
that crosses over and eventually,

1219
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:56,040
right,

1220
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,730
because they're sick of doing superhero
movies and they don't want to do the

1221
01:15:59,731 --> 01:16:01,860
grunt work of an independent cause.

1222
01:16:01,861 --> 01:16:04,920
Like you notice now they're all
doing ads over here. Back in the day,

1223
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,850
all the celebrities did ads, but
they did him overseas, right.

1224
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:11,040
Remember we used to go over and we all
look at so and so doing a fucking watch

1225
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:12,720
thing or look at her doing this thing,

1226
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:15,270
but they'd never do them here
because there was that whole

1227
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,760
stigma that if you did a commercial,
you're a sellout, blah, blah,

1228
01:16:20,761 --> 01:16:22,740
whatever the fuck it was.
Or it's like you're doing a commercial,

1229
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:25,890
you're a movie star, movie star. It's
not even on TV. Forget about doing an ad.

1230
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:28,710
Now that all went away,
you know?

1231
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:34,380
So I'm saying eventually
somebody famous would do it,

1232
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,580
right. You get that? Yeah.

1233
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,420
Get a suit and program it so that you're
having sex with like Lindsay Lohan or

1234
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:41,520
something like that.
And the first one,

1235
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,450
the first and the first
level will go down.

1236
01:16:43,451 --> 01:16:48,270
Now I'm like one of those
reality TV show stars. You know,

1237
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,140
one of the reality show goes off the year,

1238
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,410
like Jersey shore. They will all
fucking huge now it's just disappeared.

1239
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:55,210
Why the fuck are they right?

1240
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,300
You could probably talk a couple
of them and in doing it right,

1241
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,710
we pitched in a show right now

1242
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:00,491
I think,

1243
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:03,550
or some kind of like high tech concept
with that will probably make a lot of

1244
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:06,820
money that's going to end
up having something like a
movie. It sounds like. Like,

1245
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:08,830
uh, what was it that this
is what's going to happen.

1246
01:17:08,831 --> 01:17:10,050
You're going to have be self-drive

1247
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,070
and fucking cars.

1248
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:14,550
You're going to have self drive and
fucking cars and people are going to be

1249
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:19,260
laying in them in virtual reality suits
having sex with any famous person they

1250
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:22,890
want to write.
And they'll have like,

1251
01:17:22,891 --> 01:17:26,160
because you don't need a steering wheel
or gas or brake or anything anymore,

1252
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,500
you'll literally feel
like you're suiting there.

1253
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:32,520
And then when you're done your rollover
up from that seat until like another,

1254
01:17:32,521 --> 01:17:36,120
like a, uh, like a freshen
up like tub or some shit.

1255
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:40,100
So I think we're totally going in that
direction. I think you're right. We'll,

1256
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:43,220
we'll, we'll see it in the next
generation. Before it was just, yeah,

1257
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:48,170
the fleshbots stuff or just the mold
of the vagina or the deck or whatever.

1258
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,130
And then it's going to be this virtual,
it'll be super expensive at first

1259
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:52,540
going to go into a complete,

1260
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:55,330
that's gonna be like one flat screen
TVs first came out and then 14 grants.

1261
01:17:55,331 --> 01:18:00,331
So don't buy the first virtual reality
sex suits virtual wait till they come

1262
01:18:01,271 --> 01:18:05,590
down to like 800 bucks at best buy.
Then you get them right.

1263
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:10,350
Figure out how to like make
this technology and just
like patent it and that's

1264
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:11,184
how we'll make our,

1265
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:16,500
yeah, we're going to figure out how to do
that. I can't even read copy. We're not

1266
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,200
calling it that.
Like that's what's going to happen.

1267
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,620
I'm already selling right now
with these self driving cars,

1268
01:18:22,621 --> 01:18:25,620
like the interiors of cars.
What they're going to have now,

1269
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:29,580
they're going to have office ones.
They're going to have sleeper ones.

1270
01:18:29,581 --> 01:18:31,380
People just want to sleep,
going to work.

1271
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:34,590
They're going to have one second to catch
up on your emails and all of that type

1272
01:18:34,591 --> 01:18:39,150
of shit. Yeah, the different those
that'll be like the different, um, the,

1273
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:40,200
the social one,

1274
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:45,450
the social and office one, all of
that type of all, I don't know.

1275
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,340
And then eventually it's going to be like,
well,

1276
01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:49,380
why are you even going to work now?
Because everything's automated.

1277
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:50,500
Then there's robots,
right?

1278
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:55,020
And then one day the whole
fucking thing just turns on us.

1279
01:18:55,530 --> 01:19:00,330
What if there was a company
like in someplace really
random? Not really random.

1280
01:19:00,331 --> 01:19:04,680
Like a Japan or, by the way, neither one
of us is high right now. No, not at all.

1281
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:08,640
Completely that high. It's the middle
of the day. Never been more sober.

1282
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:12,390
What if there was a company somewhere
and like, I dunno, not Japan,

1283
01:19:12,391 --> 01:19:15,000
but like Eastern Europe that said,

1284
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:20,450
we want to do this deal with you where
we have these like sex dolls with the

1285
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:25,180
your face slot and they offered you like,
yeah,

1286
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,460
an insane amount of money.
No, no, to do it. Oh,

1287
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:31,940
and you can buy a bill birth sex to haul.

1288
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:36,970
Do you realize the photoshops I'm going
to get and I'm going to have to re tweak

1289
01:19:36,971 --> 01:19:37,990
now.
You asshole.

1290
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:42,970
Oh, you're right. Shit. Oh, they're
going to be horrifying but hilarious.

1291
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:47,530
Like a bill. Birth sex.
Um, what'd you do? Yeah.

1292
01:19:47,531 --> 01:19:50,830
They come out of like somewhere
random, like, you know,

1293
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:52,930
Norway or just Sunday or like,
you know,

1294
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,160
it's random like Norway, Norway. That's

1295
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,750
my random enough like,
you know,

1296
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:02,370
turns mid extend or one of those fucking
places. I'm not even saying it right,

1297
01:20:02,371 --> 01:20:06,000
but just a random little pocket
that was just like, you know,

1298
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:10,450
we $5 million that we want to
mix sex toys with your face.

1299
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:16,260
No, you wouldn't go for it.
Can you imagine that phone
call out of nowhere? No.

1300
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:20,660
No I wouldn't. No, I can
honestly tell you that I would.

1301
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,990
I know. I know you wouldn't.
Well, yeah, I would think so.

1302
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:28,170
How the fuck did we get all the way over
here, see this wildlife, the questions,

1303
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:29,100
great questions.

1304
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:33,440
Because the person in their
virtual blowjob look worn down by,

1305
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:34,350
according to you.

1306
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,820
I never claimed to be smart since
beginning of these podcasts.

1307
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,370
I don't know. I, I, I
don't claim to be smart.

1308
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,320
And with that go fuck yourselves.
I'm sorry.

1309
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:53,070
The podcast was so late. I was flying
back from Jacksonville. As I mentioned

1310
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:57,020
several times. I complained
about it and, uh,

1311
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:01,620
I'll be checking in on you on Thursday.
I'll see you go blues.
