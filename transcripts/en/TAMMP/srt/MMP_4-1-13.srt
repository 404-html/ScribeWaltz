1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,390
Hey, what's going on is bill burr and it's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,490
April 1st,
2013 that's right everybody,

3
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:16,380
it's April fool's day. Holy Shit.
Is this podcast going to be wacky?

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,570
Is he going to pull a prank? Is He
pranking us right now? Is that his voice?

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,970
I would tell you guys how much I fucking
hate this day. You know what I mean?

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,800
Back when I was in the Matrix and I
actually had a day job and I was a

7
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,950
productive member of society,
you know,

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,070
and I actually used to sit there and I'd
go to fucking work every God damn day

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,570
and every once in a while at the end
of the day they'd say some shit like,

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,850
ah, you know, we'd appreciate
it. It's not mandatory,

11
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,780
but we would appreciate it if you guys
could hang around for a couple minutes

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,380
after five today we'd like to talk about
a summary of our productivity goals in

13
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:06,870
the upcoming quarter. And I would actually
hang out going, I got to do this. I,

14
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,400
I gotta I gotta I gotta put on, I,
uh, I got to put on a, you know,

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,300
I've gotta be a team player here and
I would sit there and listen to these

16
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:20,130
fucking suits, you know, talking about a,

17
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:24,480
you know, unloading trucks or whatever
the fuck they were talking about it. Oh,

18
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,370
that is interesting. All that's great. Oh,

19
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:29,820
are we going to upgrade to the
electronic fucking Pallet Jacks,

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,950
Pallet Jacks? And we said Palliate
Jackson is like fucking 25 years.

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,900
We were all excited. Wow. They really
give a shit about us now. They know.

22
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,620
They just worried they're going to get
sued because the fucking coke had just

23
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:46,770
blew out his God damn back. You
know? And then they're like, well,

24
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:51,090
what if everybody blows out their backs?
How do we avoid debt?

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,500
What is going to be cheaper paying their
workman's comp or actually getting them

26
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:59,280
the proper equipment? Um, so anyways,

27
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,200
this stupid fucking April fool's jokes,
right?

28
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,580
I say hate those fucking God damned.
You know,

29
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:08,460
what I hated about it was half
the people who would get you,

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,680
they weren't funny and they their,
this is their idea. You know,

31
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:17,670
it'd be like, they'd be like, you be like,
Hey, do you know where the pens are? Yeah,

32
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,770
they're in there. They're right in that
drawer. And then you opened, they're like,

33
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,240
hey bro,
ah,

34
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,650
actually this one over here, I just
got, um, I got him with an April fool,

35
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,380
Ya know? And You wonder why
officers get shot up, you know,

36
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,080
just what it is. It's not because a
sociopath's it's not because of, um,

37
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,410
um, um, relaxed gun control laws.

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,720
It's not because any of that shit,

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,560
it's because of some stupid April
fool's joke that someone won't let go.

40
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:54,380
And the talking shit about
it still in June, you know?

41
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,660
And then somebody just finally snaps and
they come in there and they mowed out a

42
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,760
bunch of people and it's
considered a tragedy. And it is,

43
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,880
unless you're into the environment

44
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,050
and you look at it a different way
and you're like, well, you know,

45
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,170
as tragic as everything that just
happened is day's going to be a whole lot,

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,200
a whole lot less people drop and doses
in that building that will end up in the

47
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:25,390
water supply. Do you know I went to the
grocery store the other day, people,

48
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,340
oh yeah, I'm not a vampire. I need food

49
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,130
and I fucking walk.

50
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,020
I'm walking in there and there's some
fucking green peace guy with a clipboard

51
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,470
and he's singing like R and B shit.

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,853
And

53
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,010
I didn't want to hit him.
I just had to get away from him.

54
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,050
Like it was literally effecting how
I was walking. He was just singing.

55
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,990
He was,
I dunno what,

56
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:59,250
like he was trying to audition and save
the environment all at the same fucking

57
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:02,940
time. He was singing some song and
at one point he went like, Whoa Dude,

58
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:06,170
that fucking that R and B,
you know,

59
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,580
let me hold this note
like I'm getting tickled.

60
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,060
I'm sorry folks.

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,810
I did a benefit in a fucking mind
this weekend and I'm a little fucking,

62
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,830
I'm a little,
I'm a little,

63
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,720
okay.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,580
Oh, I feel like fucking shit
people. I caught one of these,

65
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,250
one of these super Coles.
Did you guys have it?

66
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,810
Did you get a chance to listen to me?

67
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,320
Last week on the Joe Rogan experience,

68
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,840
I might've mentioned that
I was starting to get sick.

69
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:40,820
That was the day when I did Joe Rogan's
podcast and I forgot that the guy does

70
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:44,820
an 18 hour podcast. You know, I'm thinking
like, all right, I'll go over there.

71
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:47,800
They'll be done in about 90 minutes.
I'll come back here,

72
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,610
get myself a little bit of Robitussin,
chase it with a little bit of Nyquil,

73
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,800
do a line of blow, you know,
fucking stare down the cold,

74
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:01,550
wide awake and then that'll be it.
And no, that's not what happened.

75
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,180
I did a three and a half
hour podcasts with Rogan. Yo,

76
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:07,430
what's amazing about two Rogan's podcast
is three and a half fucking hours long

77
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,050
and it feels like 20 minutes,

78
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,900
you know,

79
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,750
until he gets to the last 20
minutes. Then he just like, dude,

80
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,220
I can't fucking talk anymore.
And he may just think about Rogen is if,

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,130
I think if you didn't bring it up that
you were three and a half hours in,

82
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:25,850
he would do another three
and a half hours. Um,

83
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,120
but I had a great time on that one and um,

84
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,510
I sounded extra dumb on that because
Rogan actually reads, you know,

85
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,790
I sound dumb enough
when I'm just by myself,

86
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,330
but when I'm actually on a podcast with
somebody who's actually a well read guy,

87
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,590
you know, my level of stupidity
really gets fucking exposed

88
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,540
to an even higher level. So, um,

89
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,100
okay.

90
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,070
Anyways. Yeah, I've been sick
for like four fucking days.

91
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,130
I didn't actually then take any and I
didn't take any cold medicine because

92
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:01,790
every fucking cold medicine I looked
at said may do permanent liver damage.

93
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,330
So it was like, all right,
well let's do the math here.

94
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,270
I either go fucking two,

95
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:13,271
three days of hell and then I'm fine
or I fucking pussy out of three days of

96
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:21,050
hell in the trade off is permanent
fucking liver damage. Right.

97
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,150
How fucking dumb would that be?
You know,

98
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,910
if you take cold medicine,
you're a fucking pussy is
basically what I'm saying.

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,180
Nah, that's not true. That's
not true. Cause you know what,

100
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:34,520
I don't have to fucking go to work.
You guys do.

101
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,010
And how many sick days can really use,
especially if you're a woman, you know,

102
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,860
if you get knocked up and you're already,

103
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,460
how many days did they give you for that?

104
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,050
It's so fucking pathetic in this
country that like you ever see,

105
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,640
I don't know other countries like how much
time you get off and then people like,

106
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:55,620
yeah, but they pay like fucking, you know,

107
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:59,850
nine 90% taxes in that country.

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,100
Yes. So what at least they get
something for their fucking taxes.

109
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:08,270
What the fuck are we
getting in this country? Oh,

110
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,000
I got my two by four out of
the angry voter. Everybody.

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,970
Um, despite the fact that I was as
sick as I was, I was sick as a dog man.

112
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,280
I,
uh,

113
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,550
I still got the windows tinted on my car.
I got a couple of things done.

114
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,440
You know what's funny was, ah, the lovely,

115
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:31,441
beautiful and talented Nia was actually
leaving town on Wednesday and came back

116
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:36,820
yesterday and I got sick literally
Tuesday night and I was sick the whole

117
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:41,500
fucking time. I was so fucking
excited that, you know,

118
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,650
that like excited she was going to be
leaving and I was just excited that,

119
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:46,480
you know,
she wasn't going to be here,

120
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,450
you know, match madness, you know,

121
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:56,950
watch the fucking basketball
and have the fellas over, right.

122
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,140
Fucking barbecue, drink some beers, right?

123
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:05,350
I was going to have a great time,
great fucking time.

124
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:10,351
And then I got this God damn tsunami
of a fucking cold and a dude.

125
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,640
It really wiped me out.

126
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,520
Okay.

127
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,930
Two days. I was just laying on the couch.
It's going, really, are you fucking key?

128
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,830
This is a cold. This is what, this
is what a cold is in 2013, dude,

129
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:26,700
my fucking hair hurt.
I thought it was because I was dehydrated.

130
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:30,810
Just started sucking down water and
all it did was make me gag. You know,

131
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,400
it hurts to move my eyes.
I can't move my eyes, man.

132
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,060
Um,
was it was fucking brutal.

133
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,680
So I toughed it out and I still got,
I got the windows tinted. Oh, my car.

134
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,610
And uh, that was hilarious.
And went down there,

135
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,980
I went to this fucking
place where it's like,

136
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:54,180
do you guys like tint windows and also
torture people in the back room? You know,

137
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,110
one of those really shady,

138
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,500
I didn't go down to the dealership because
I knew they were going to charge me

139
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:03,501
like fucking 500 bucks to have the
official Toyota of tint on the windows.

140
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,080
I'm like, fuck this, let me just get this
guy to do it for a buck and a quarter.

141
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,663
Um,

142
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,250
okay.

143
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,240
So I go in there,
right.

144
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:15,410
And then obviously English as a second
language for this guy, you know,

145
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,023
and um,

146
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,610
okay.

147
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,620
I'm sure I could've had
my pick of women to,

148
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,660
if I actually went into that back room.

149
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,320
It just seemed like one of those things,

150
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,620
I just felt like I was in the
second season of the wire, you know,

151
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:32,770
like there was going to be some big cargo
tin with a bunch of dead hookers in it

152
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:35,230
in the back. But anyways,
that's none of my business.

153
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,370
I'm just here to get my windows
tinted on my fucking hybrid. So, uh,

154
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,540
I say to the guy,
a guide,

155
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,330
I want the back windows as dark
as I can possibly get them,

156
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:47,320
cause my dog rides back there and she's
always pen to beat the fucking band.

157
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,060
I'd like her to be cooler. And then up
front, you know, the darker side can get.

158
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,360
And then I was like, wait a minute,
wait, we're waiting. Might Go, you know,

159
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,820
my girl Kinda stinks it drive.

160
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,550
And so I don't want it so dark that she
can't see other cars. And he laughs,

161
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,210
you know, this fucking eastern
European black market fucking laugh.

162
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,610
And he goes, all right, we'll do the 35%
and then we'll do the UV rays up front.

163
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:17,110
And I'm like, great. So yeah, Yada a,

164
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,130
he does them enough. They, they,
they look fucking phenomenal.

165
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,820
Okay.

166
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,490
So I'm recovering the next fucking
two more days of this bullshit, right?

167
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,940
I finally come around yesterday and a,

168
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm feeling good and I know knee is
on the way home. So what do I do?

169
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,490
I fucking clean up the Goddamn House.

170
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,040
Yeah.

171
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,340
That's a big thing you have to do
when you fucking woman leaves town.

172
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,770
When she comes back,
the place has to look even fucking better.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,680
It has to look fucking great. And there's
got to be food in the fridge. Okay.

174
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,540
Why? Because out of
respect, no out of love.

175
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,403
No.

176
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,390
Okay.

177
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,560
The why would you do it, bill? I'll
tell you why. Because you can't fucking,

178
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,190
okay.

179
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,300
You can't give them that fucking power
that they feel like you're an absolute

180
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,440
fucking moron.

181
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,140
Okay.

182
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,470
If they're not there, you know, they
stuck feeling that after a while,

183
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:19,820
because you know, when you fucking
live with somebody, like a woman,

184
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:22,010
they basically decide
where everything goes.

185
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:26,960
That's like shit that you both use and
you're a guy and you don't give a fuck.

186
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,430
Right? So every fucking time you gotta
be like, yeah, where's the salad spool?

187
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,260
Where the fuck is this?
Where the fuck is that?

188
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:36,880
And then they get to be like the fucking
chick on a, on a sitcom. Right? Well,

189
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,260
my husband, he's a fucking moron, right?

190
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,210
So I didn't want to have her that I didn't
want her to have that fucking victory.

191
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,790
I vacuumed. I did have the, took
the trash out at everything.

192
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,650
Just looking fucking spotless.

193
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,810
Okay.

194
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,370
You going to come home?
Look at me like I'm a fucking moron.

195
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:57,620
Okay.

196
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,040
Well honey, the place looks great.
Yeah, I met you when I was 36.

197
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,380
I know how to make toast.
All right. Get over yourself.

198
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,490
I was actually cleaning
up so well was like,

199
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:13,040
she's gonna think I cheated on
her or something. This is like,

200
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,200
this is getting fucking ridiculous.

201
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,510
What'd you vacuum for you getting rid
of the fucking straight pubis is, uh,

202
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,060
this is the Monday morning
podcast. Everybody. Um,

203
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,710
now that would have been, that would
have said if I actually cheated on her,

204
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:31,670
what a fucking piece of shit, first of
all. And then second of all, like, um,

205
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,620
I would have a sex addiction if I actually
did that because of how fucking sick,

206
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,040
sick I was.
You know,

207
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,520
if I should bagged one of those fucking
eastern European horrors that I know

208
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:47,900
we're locked in the back of that
tinted out fucking place. Um, you know,

209
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,270
it's funny. It was, we, she gets
home. All right? And within,

210
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:56,210
within an hour we get where we were in
a fight because I told the story about

211
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:58,000
getting the windows
tinted like an asshole.

212
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,830
I wasn't even thinking and I mentioned
to the fact that I said she wasn't the

213
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:03,950
greatest driver and I heard her feelings.

214
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,220
Okay,

215
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,980
you said that you don't
think I'm a good driver.

216
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,600
Okay.

217
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,290
Oh Jesus Christ. And that's one of those
ones where you just got to be like, okay,

218
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,040
ah, Bill, you're an idiot. Why
did you say that? You know,

219
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,550
I'm still pissed that she
got pissed about that.

220
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:21,800
Okay.

221
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,460
You know,

222
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,460
that would be like if she told one of
her friends that I'm not a good dancer,

223
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:30,400
and then I was like, you told
her go to. Yeah, Bill, you suck.

224
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,420
Suck it dancing.
You know

225
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,720
Jesus fucking Christ.

226
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,790
Okay.

227
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,810
I was fucking kills me about
fucking women. It's like they, they,

228
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:46,320
even when they know they
stink at something, if you
say they stick at something,

229
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,330
they get,
they get all fucking offended.

230
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,490
You said the truth.
Well why?

231
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:58,430
Why would you say what's
actually happening? You know?

232
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,573
Okay.

233
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,710
Terrible fucking dancer.

234
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,650
I think maybe I could in another
life I could have been a good dancer,

235
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:08,910
but all like happy emotions were beaten
out of me by the time I was fucking four

236
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:11,370
years old. So, you know,
just dancing. I mean,

237
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,130
okay.

238
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,290
I can't, I don't, it's not even in me.

239
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,843
Okay.

240
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,560
That whole fucking whatever that
gift is, when, whenever that is,

241
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:23,140
whenever the dancing does
just fucking sprinkled on you.

242
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:27,960
That was not sprinkled on me in any
way, shape or fucking for, you know,

243
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,490
even the music lessons to angry music

except for Bruno Mars. Every once in a
while I got it. I got a little, I don't,

245
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,870

00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:33,220
why am I eventually actually
going to have like a whole, Nah,

290
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:37,160
I'm not going to do that.
Actually have like a, like a,

291
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,630
an official radio set up. You
know, I'm not going to do that.

292
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,090
Cause then you know what,
then I have in this somewhere.

293
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:48,590
I have to be this people I have to answer
to in all that fucking horse shit I'm

294
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:51,330
not doing,
I was watching this whole thing on um,

295
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,233
uh,

296
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,400
North Korea and how they made make this
promo video and it's basically about

297
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,490
them launching their own space. Shuttles
is North Korea and dude, I'm assuming,

298
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,510
right? And he's sitting there dreaming
and they had the instrumental of,

299
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,350
we are the world in the
background, right? We owe the womb.

300
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,730
We are the children.

301
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,480
This fucking North Korean
space shuttle is flying around,

302
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,820
you know, fried around the
globe. Korea is unified.

303
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,710
And,
um,

304
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,010
okay.

305
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,790
You know, and it ends with a
city that looks like New York,

306
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,170
which is on fire after some sort
of missile attack, you know?

307
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:38,040
But I guess they say, and it looks
like the evil doers did themselves in,

308
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,290
they don't take responsibility for doing
it, but I guess, you know, I don't know.

309
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,090
Evidently that was caused for big concern.
Not In my world though,

310
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,230
even though la I guess is one of
the first ones they want to attack.

311
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,190
I don't give a fuck.

312
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,790
Okay.

313
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,900
Is that going to make you happy?

314
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:00,500
They have fucking all fucking
fat face their fat face part too.

315
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,980
You know,
I could see why were annoying.

316
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,470
Okay.

317
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,710
I mean, we got in the middle of their
fight over there way back in the day.

318
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,660
Should a minded our own business,
let them Duke it out,

319
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,730
whoever wins wins.

320
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:23,290
But we didn't leave stuck a fucking noses
in over there and now they don't like

321
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:27,060
us old. What will we do
during the fucking, uh,

322
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,510
civil war if all of a sudden a
Korea came over here and was like,

323
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:35,140
Hey,
we side with these guys other side.

324
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,360
Why don't you settle down
after a while. Be like, hey,

325
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:38,920
why don't you guys get
the fuck out of here.

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,140
Let us solve our own fucking
problems. I get it. You know,

327
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,460
I just don't want her to
stand what North Korea has,

328
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,710
what their fascination is with
having a fat dictator. They, oh,

329
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,750
they like a real pudgy fucking,
uh,

330
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,250
like on medication, like bloated
face kind of fucking dictator.

331
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:04,210
That's their thing. I don't,
I'm not worried about it.

332
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,080
I would be more worried if they were
going to try and blow up San Francisco

333
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,120
because I'm in Los Angeles.
Okay.

334
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,270
If you're going to fucking shoot a
goddamn nuclear weapon at this country,

335
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:18,271
by all means do it at the city that I'm
in because I don't want to survive it.

336
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,420
All right? Best way you
want to be, by the way,

337
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,470
all these fucking people trying to come
up with these underground places to go,

338
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:27,550
that's not what you want to be.

339
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,840
You want to be right with a
fucking Kona that missile hits.

340
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,450
That's what you want to be. Just
get vaporized. You have no idea.

341
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:39,780
You don't even know what's coming.
Sitting there watching sports in a bad,

342
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,830
bad at it.
It over.

343
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,000
You know you don't want to
be on the outskirts like in
Scottsdale fucking Arizona

344
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,780
with one side of your fucking face melted
off and then walking around for four

345
00:20:56,841 --> 00:21:00,900
days
for wheat thins.

346
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,510
You want to do that. You have some
fucking agonizing like 18 day death.

347
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,270
Fuck that.
I want to be vaporized.

348
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,793
You know?

349
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,900
Why did you ever see a bunch of
bugs and he hit him with some raid.

350
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,950
That fucker one that takes the direct hit.
That thing is done in two seconds.

351
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,700
But the other ones that do when that
little fucking Angus young running on the

352
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:26,630
ground during a guitar solo fucking move.
Those are the ones you don't want to be

353
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,543
right.

354
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,030
I Dunno, I don't give a fuck about North
Korea and that worried about those guys.

355
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,080
All right. You want to fucking start
some shit? Go ahead. All right.

356
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,640
Start some fucking shit.

357
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,920
What are they going to do?

358
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,340
Like what, what exactly is that?
They're, they're fucking game plan.

359
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,090
You can update it. It's so like not even
a throw. Okay, you're going to, what?

360
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,660
You're going to take out two cities.

361
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,250
We have enough shit to fucking blow up
the entire world like 9 million times.

362
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:07,840
So you're going to take out Los Angeles,
right? And then, then you know what?

363
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:12,320
You're not going to have any movies
to watch. You ever think about that?

364
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:16,430
North Korea, God knows your dad loved
watching all our fucking movies.

365
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:18,710
You're going to have none of that shit,
right?

366
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,260
You're going to have half the
fucking divas that you're going to,

367
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,130
that you're going to hire to perform
at your fucking New Year's party.

368
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:27,920
Like Beyonce.
They're not going to be there.

369
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,750
Isn't Beyonce one of the ones that
perform for some fucking mass murdering

370
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:37,020
psychopath? Was it her? I had a fuck
enough. I'll throw her name out. You know,

371
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:41,480
I'll take her name off and
I'll say it was, uh, uh,

372
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,950
boost face there from the voice.
The one that likes to get dirty.

373
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,670
What's her name? Christina
Applegate gag. Yulara.

374
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,230
Yeah, you go. Was it
her? She's another one.

375
00:22:57,231 --> 00:23:01,470
She does that R and B singing
[inaudible] and fucking point everywhere.

376
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,510
Fucking voice is going.

377
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,860
Seems like she's sitting
on a giant vibrator. Um,

378
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,990
she's just said,
fuck it.

379
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,760
Okay.

380
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,800
You know what? I sat with her and
she just said to hell with it.

381
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,940
I don't give a fuck.

382
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,773
You know,

383
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,180
I'm just going to be almost in shape
and you guys can just fucking do.

384
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:28,410
I had a kid, I like having a glass
of wine around four in the afternoon.

385
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:32,790
Go Fuck Yourself. I'm an I like, I
really respect that she doesn't care.

386
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,460
You know?
Like if she was a dude,

387
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:39,750
she'd be one of those guys who couldn't
wear a tie because it, it just fucking,

388
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,340
she can't breathe at that point.

389
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:42,960
Okay.

390
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,720
She would she dress like
Dana White? Um, all right.

391
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:52,400
I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking
about here. Have you guys see that?

392
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,140
They get to have these
new smell of visions,

393
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,700
real smellovision TV
unveiled by Japanese team,

394
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,640
and it's not an April fool,
is what it says.

395
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,700
Tokyo team advent as
smelling screen that makes,

396
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:09,701
smells emanate from the spot on the
screen showing their corresponding object.

397
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,160
It works by feeding odors from

398
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,750
sublimating gel pallets

399
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,440
appellate's into air strikes.

400
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,530
It's sublimating.
That doesn't sound right.

401
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,270
Like I don't think I
pronounced that correctly.

402
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:34,271
Whatever gel pellets into air streams
that can be directed to specific spots on

403
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:38,480
the screen.
So what are you going to have?

404
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:39,860
Like a bunch of pellets.

405
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,380
Okay.

406
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,200
For every state that just, it's
not going to work. You know what?

407
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,440
The sad thing about this
stupid fucking thing is,

408
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,280
is this at the development promises to
make advertisement for fried chicken or

409
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:55,420
fresh coffee even more appealing. You know
who's going to get this fucking thing?

410
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:58,290
I swear to God,
Bobby Kelly [inaudible]

411
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,020
good. I got the new
smell of Asian kid, dude.

412
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,480
I'm watching the food network.
I was fucking drilling.

413
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:11,330
Did the guy's making a
fucking lobster souffle?

414
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,900
I could fucking smell
the fucking beach dude.

415
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,250
You know it.
He'll buy it right when it comes out.

416
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,500
So we can be the first guy
and is blocked the habit.

417
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,360
It'll cost him 15 grand and
then in like fucking four years,

418
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,520
they're going to be
selling for like 600 bucks.

419
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,120
Yeah,

420
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,391
that's,

421
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:35,050
that's the one of the things about being
at the forefront of technology when you

422
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:39,460
just have to be the first Douche
bag on your block. You know,

423
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,110
I gotta I have to have him on
this podcast because I really,

424
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,950
I really want to talk to him about
that. Like what, what is that?

425
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,380
Okay.

426
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,850
Cause I see it it like,
it like fills him up.

427
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,660
When I used to be in New York City
and he would get some new gadget,

428
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,650
he couldn't fucking wait
to come down to the cellar.

429
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,730
It stick of some phony reason
to pull out his new shiny thing.

430
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,580
Just dying for somebody to be like,

431
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,640
oh is that the new fucking shiny
fucking fuzzy 1000 and then either

432
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,410
they need a big N. Oh,
why? Yes. Yes it is.

433
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,540
Go check it. It charges my iPhone
bum. You opened this over here.

434
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,900
Flap.
I got all my dates Zoe.

435
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,090
That motherfucker has had
everything fucking everything.

436
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,740
I like 15 years ago when he's
still at his noodle hair,

437
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,320
he fucking had anything that
had a stylist at palm pilot.

438
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:48,300
He had everything he had that I lived
with them, he had that and he had bags.

439
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,480
He, those were the two things
that he was fucking into.

440
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,110
And you know what I was into eating
bland food and staring at the wall.

441
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,800
So who fucking one who wanted that one?
I would say Bobby.

442
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,450
Um, all right, let's
get to some fucking, uh,

443
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:09,810
some God damn questions for this
fucking week here. By the way,

444
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,600
I dunno if I brought this up yet cause
I've had it start this podcast a couple

445
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:16,330
of times because I had
a coughing fit. Uh, um,

446
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,290
obviously the fastest,

447
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:24,090
most Speedy's recovery possible
for Kevin Ware of the, uh,

448
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,270
of Louisville. Jesus
Christ. That was one of the,

449
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,170
that's one of the worst
things I've ever seen. And um,

450
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:33,650
okay.

451
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,900
Yeah.
And if you haven't seen it,

452
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,420
you know what just it's killing me is
I know there's going to be a bunch of

453
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:42,140
people upload that fucking
video and then Douche,

454
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,000
we'll have to make jokes
in that type of thing.

455
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:48,200
But what a tough mother fucker
Skype basically he broke,

456
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,900
I don't know if it was a
compound fracture. If it was,

457
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:54,170
if it was both bones or whatever,
but I know at least one of them,

458
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,503
you know,

459
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,560
was coming through the fucking skin
and he's still laying in there telling

460
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:04,130
everybody to win the fucking game.
Jesus Christ.

461
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,750
Okay.

462
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,740
That wouldn't have been me.

463
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,330
I would've been crying like a fucking
girl and saying, you know, games,

464
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:12,740
I would have used up all our time out.
Right.

465
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,220
Yeah.

466
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,490
And I could give a fuck about the game
at that point. I would be screaming.

467
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,260
I would've been like,
Nancy Kerrigan.

468
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,170
Why?

469
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,550
Why?

470
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,740
Oh, that's one of my favorite clips of
all time. Because you know what I love?

471
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,640
I love that she acted exactly
how I would have acted.

472
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,020
Everybody wants to act like they're going
to be the hey win one for the gipper.

473
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,610
And you know what?
Most of us got that Nancy Kerrigan gene,

474
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,200
you know, we're just going to
start crying and be like, why me?

475
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,573
MMM.

476
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,670
That really was, that was right
up there as far as like, you know,

477
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,310
she'd obviously never gotten
her ass kicked in her life.

478
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,740
The fact that she couldn't even
wrap her fucking head around,

479
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,730
you know, if she had gotten her ass
kicked a couple of times, she, at least,

480
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:19,990
what is she, why me would have been
downgraded to dude. What the fuck?

481
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,350
Oh my God.
Right?

482
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,660
Why?
Why?

483
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,060
Um, I don't even know where
the fuck I was going with that.

484
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,180
Oh, sorry guys. This fucking podcast
sucks this week. I, I'm, I'm,

485
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,120
I'm all right. I admit it. It this
week. I'm fucking, I'm still sick.

486
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,523
But you know,

487
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,480
yesterday's yesterday's fucking
last week's was a great one. Okay.

488
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:52,390
So give me a little bit of slack here.
Company a little slide for quite shit.

489
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:56,890
Can you do that? Um, right. Oh, by
the way, you know something, um,

490
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,600
a couple of weeks ago I mentioned to the
fact that, um, I don't get the, you know,

491
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:03,730
the Premiere League as far as their,

492
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:08,731
their soccer over there where
their jerseys can be just
so the colors is so dry,

493
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,480
a dramatically different.

494
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,620
Like you'll be watching a team and
they're red and white and then next week

495
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:18,250
they're wearing black and yellow. And
it's like, what the fuck? And, uh,

496
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:22,000
this guy wrote and he said, uh, in
the premier league colors Shange

497
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,030
uh,

498
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,310
for example, Arsenal play man
United, they both wear red and white.

499
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:33,660
So the way team changes colors. That's
why they changed the team cause I guess,

500
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,560
and it's kind of weird that they're in
the same league and guys can have the

501
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:42,330
same colors, you know, which is
starting to happen in American sports.

502
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,651
Like however,

503
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:47,160
the Toronto Maple leafs sued the Tampa
Bay lightning for their new fucking

504
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:49,380
jerseys, yet, you know,

505
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,910
they're slowly moving in on your fucking
territory and I don't know why you're

506
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:58,830
not saying anything. Um,
all right. Anyways, Bill,

507
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,780
your workout routine.
A bill,

508
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:05,070
I'd like 95% of Americans on your shows.

509
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:10,071
You look like what I think most people
would look like should look like in terms

510
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:12,780
of fitness. Uh, you see what he did there?

511
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:16,800
He gave me a nice big compliment as
he fucking trash. 95% of America.

512
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:21,090
It's not 95%.
It's a good fucking 65% of their kids.

513
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,260
Um, do you follow a specific
routine? Thanks. Um,

514
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,250
well, right now I'm fucking horrible
shape. I put them fucking 10 pounds.

515
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:37,470
But this is the thing, I never
let it get beyond this. You know,

516
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,950
I never let it get beyond
like a little bit of fucking

517
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,900
like 10 pounds and then I just take
it off. That's basically what I do.

518
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,290
I hike with my dog and um,
and I,

519
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:52,710
I use my own body weight.

520
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,640
I use my whole body weight because I
find that that that makes you more cut

521
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:02,360
rather than puffy.
If you fucking lift weights and Shit,

522
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,690
you get,
you just start over,

523
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:08,310
develop in like five different
groups of muscles and a,

524
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,390
you start walking around looking
like a midget bouncer. At least I do.

525
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,590
So I you a climbing rope.
I have a peg board and I have a,

526
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:19,340
a pull up and dip station.
Uh,

527
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:24,370
because I am a firm believer that you
need to be able to move your own body,

528
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,350
you know, and I used to do yoga
fucking years and years ago, but um,

529
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,450
I dunno, I just can't get
myself to go to the classes.

530
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,850
Those fucking mats are all dirty and shit.
Even if you bring your own mat,

531
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,500
that's just the level of and bare feet,
it's just fucking disgusting. And uh,

532
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,893
you know,

533
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,370
and then also the chicks and they're so
fucking ridiculous looking that at least

534
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:54,360
out here in la, um, you know,

535
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:57,240
the whole mental aspect of the thing
is out the fucking window cause he's

536
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:01,440
supposed to be like, you
know, also calming your mind
and I'm not calming my mind.

537
00:33:01,441 --> 00:33:02,910
My mind is fucking going.

538
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,700
So, um, yeah, that's what it is.

539
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,380
And I try not to eat like an asshole and
now that I'm ever advanced age can be

540
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:16,430
45 years old.

541
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:21,431
I try to eat a fucking giant salad
every day and a is while fighting that,

542
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:25,460
what are you a fig fucking
voice in my head. But um,

543
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,650
as much as people sit there and they say
that that's bird food and that type of

544
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:34,400
thing, eat a giant salad every
day and I'm telling you, yeah,

545
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:37,400
you're going to be right as rain.
All right.

546
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,203
I'm telling you,

547
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,540
if you don't eat a salad every day and
you read and fucking a bunch of meat and

548
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:44,374
that type of thing,

549
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,970
I swear to God trying to take
his shit is like fucking,

550
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,250
it's not a fun experience. You have a
giant salad every day. It's not a problem.

551
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,340
That's, you know what? That was true
but disgusting. But I don't give a fuck.

552
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,120
There you go. So that's
what I do. Um, all right.

553
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,600
Cooking Billy boy our day.

554
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,810
What are some of your favorite
things to cook in the kitchen?

555
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,310
I was never much of a cook until
I realized it's super easy.

556
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,470
Um, well you must have a gift
then. What do you mean super easy?

557
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:25,250
What are you making eggs over easy?
Yeah, that's easy. But he immune,

558
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,670
you're actually, you know, doing
some of that food network stuff.

559
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:30,270
I don't think it's super easy.
Second, you've got to have like a,

560
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,720
an ice bath bath to like
blanche some shit, you know.

561
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,590
Anyways. Uh, or caramelizing shit.

562
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:43,090
You just got to experiment and think
the basics through the food network

563
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:45,310
mentioned a website called my fridge,

564
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:49,210
food.com that tells you what you can
make with the ingredients in your house.

565
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,590
I accidentally learned how to make
teriyaki sauce and Pumpkin pie because of

566
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,200
what I've had, what I had in my
place. That's actually an interesting,

567
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,340
you mentioned once you made ribs.
Have you mastered anything?

568
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,910
What's your go to?
Um,

569
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,410
if I mastered anything,
uh, the fuck can I do? Uh,

570
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,570
I don't know. I don't know. I, I'm
one of those people every once,

571
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,280
once every eight months I throw down and
I cook and I make a fucking great meal.

572
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,703
MMM.

573
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:21,741
Through it.

574
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:25,280
I'll make you a spaghetti sauce if you
like a sweeter one that has some molasses

575
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:28,580
in it and it will literally make you
punch your fucking wife in the face

576
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,270
repeatedly.
Just fucking,

577
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:36,740
just drawn back with each shoe,
just areas. You bite down,

578
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,070
you're letting it fuck you. Let your
hands go. You know, you're free.

579
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,100
That's how good.
This just spaghetti sauces.

580
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:48,900
I can make you little lasagna
meat based of course. Uh,

581
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,090
to do that.
I can do all of that shit.

582
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,410
I can make you some fucking short
ribs there. Yeah, I can fucking cook.

583
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:59,550
If I gave a fuck if I really wanted to,
I could get really good at cooking.

584
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,710
I'm actually, I'm really good at
baking. I think I tell a nice story.

585
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,020
I don't like this shit.
I don't like being,

586
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,500
I don't like these two fucking questions
here where I'm talking positively about

587
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,550
myself. You know why? Because there's
absolutely no humor in it. All right,

588
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:16,170
let's get back to the
fucking grip strength.

589
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,370
You know why you need grip strength in
case you're ever in a fucking house fire

590
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,620
and you need to climb
down the Goddamn gutters.

591
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,150
All you need to go up to the roof and
then take a running leap to the house next

592
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,120
to it and you're gonna come up short and
you're going to fucking grab something

593
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,210
over there or maybe a fucking tree branch.
That's what you need.

594
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:35,130
Grip Strength Four.
All right.

595
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,810
I guess if you lift weights and you
ever get sucked into a sinkhole,

596
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:43,650
you can fucking lift your house.
Safia I dunno what, all right.

597
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,490
As far as cooking, I don't
think cooking, senna,

598
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,590
cooking, the whole thing is, is you
got to have all these, you know,

599
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,270
if you really want to throw down,
it's that initial startup costs.

600
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,190
It's like when you first
learned how to fix a car,

601
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,930
it's not going to be cheaper than taking
it to somewhere else because you're

602
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,970
going to have to fucking,
not only by the parts,

603
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,030
you're gonna have to buy all the tools.
Um,

604
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,860
so I dunno, have I mastered anything?
Yeah, I can make a fucking pie.

605
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,780
I can make cakes. I get big. I can
grill. I'm not the greatest griller.

606
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,420
I got to admit,
I get very impatient with growing.

607
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,200
I know I'm supposed to have like the
caveman shit and want to be standing out

608
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:28,040
there over the fucking fire.
I'm, I'm really not a into that.

609
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:33,041
I used to work in a restaurant and I
worked in the ski grill and they had the

610
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:36,440
big fucking chef hat and all that type
of shit and I made great burgers and

611
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:39,560
shrimp Rochelle and chicken sandwiches
and that shit. I know how to do it.

612
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,520
I can mock up the meat, I can
fucking cook. I just don't, I'm just,

613
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,770
I have to be into it and I get into it
and I'm psycho into it for like three

614
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:53,440
weeks and then I'm just not, I
don't give a fuck after awhile. Um,

615
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,700
cause I have fucking add,
you know,

616
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,230
basically standup comedy is the
only thing I ever stuck with.

617
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:04,370
So hence it's the only thing I remember
I'm really good at. I can play drums,

618
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:09,100
okay. Can play a little guitar, they
can make a couple of dishes and uh,

619
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,690
I can shoot the shit about the weather
at a party. And then pretty much that,

620
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,090
other than that, I'm done.
Um, underrated the Bible,

621
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:23,420
the Bible. All right. Uh,
well, Jesus, here we go.

622
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,070
That's the risk of pissing you off.

623
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,060
I'm writing to say that the Bible is
underrated. That doesn't piss me off.

624
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,830
I mean, it's a hell of
a story, you know? Uh,

625
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,320
really all religious texts are
underrated and I can't blame anyone for

626
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:42,310
underrating religion since
religion is a lot of, uh,

627
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,520
speculative crap. Um, no,

628
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:48,580
I think the basis of all religions
are the way you should live life.

629
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:53,050
Like the 10 commandments is like
common sense, the seven deadly sins.

630
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:57,500
I love that shit. It's that. It's that
once you start being like, you know, he,

631
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,660
he loves us best and you don't
believe what we're saying. So, uh,

632
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,700
you're infidels and now we have to kill
you or we have to have a crusade or we

633
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:12,391
have to torture you until you're into
what the fuck were into or were making so

634
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:16,270
much money off this horse shit. We
have to look the other way. Well,

635
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,280
some of us are fucking children.
You know that, that's where I, I, I,

636
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,080
I make my departure,

637
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,903
you know,

638
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,350
or you're constantly telling me that,

639
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:32,270
that this thing is fucking mad at me
because of flawed despite that's the way

640
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,850
you fucking made me.
Like that's never made sense to me.

641
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,353
MMM.

642
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,740
Or like if there's a god that, you know,
he makes somebody like a sociopath.

643
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,140
Okay.

644
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,780
It's sociopath is basically
a broken human being.

645
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,150
Like they didn't get all the parts

646
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,243
and

647
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,620
it's like, not even, it's not
even their fault that, that, that,

648
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,540
that they're born that way,
that they don't feel anything.

649
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,593
All right.

650
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,600
That's not that that person's going to
hell because they were born fucked up,

651
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,220
you know? Now I'm not saying
I have sympathy for sociopath.

652
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:17,250
I think they should be hunted down and
fucking shot in the street like rabid

653
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:21,200
dogs. But I'm just saying as far as the,
uh, are you going to have an a hell?

654
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,130
I mean, isn't that like
on, on the manufacturer?

655
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,470
I've always equated it to that. Like,
you know, it'd be like if you built,

656
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,960
built a piece of shit car,
like you fucked up,

657
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,590
you fucked it up when you built it and
then you get mad at it because it doesn't

658
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:42,700
run right. You know? So that,
that's my thing. So you know,

659
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,520
if humor into the Bible, I
don't give a fuck. Anyway.

660
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:50,080
I want to bring up the book of job.
Huh? Look at that. I said it right.

661
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:55,290
I didn't say job job rich reads as a
tale of cruelty because God and the devil

662
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,540
got together to put job through
the wringer. Do you know bad?

663
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:04,840
I would love to read the book of Job and
actually be able to read more than two

664
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:08,710
paragraphs without sitting there going,
what the fuck are they talking about?

665
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,570
Uh,

666
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:15,340
I think most people religious
and otherwise miss an
important point throughout

667
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:16,030
the text.

668
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:20,830
Job's friends went half cocked
saying that Joe must have,

669
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:24,730
must have done something to
deserve what was happening to him.

670
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,850
Sounds like the type of
thing a lady would say,

671
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,420
not at sounds a type of thing like
a religious nut would say to me. Uh,

672
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:38,530
at the end God became angry with job's
friends from making this assumption and

673
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:42,590
made them do sacrifices just
for being smart as shit heads.

674
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,360
Um,

675
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,450
so the Bible has all kinds
of moral concepts that have
barely survived into the

676
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:54,350
modern era. Probably thanks to
all the linguistic mangling well,

677
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:57,720
thank God you're there
to figure it all out. Uh,

678
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,090
job demonstrates that the burden
of proof falls upon the accuser.

679
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,760
It's even part of our justice system,

680
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:08,810
but nobody gives it the importance
it deserves. Especially Christians.

681
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,670
If there's a god, he definitely
pissed. He's definitely pissed at,

682
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:16,700
you know who? No, I don't.

683
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,340
I don't know. I was totally with you
until you put it all on the Christians.

684
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,940
But now I think that which we jury
the Jewish or Muslim or fucking,

685
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:27,550
okay.

686
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,590
I Dunno.
Is there something else?

687
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,010
Okay.

688
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,870
Who are those people who pray to the
trees? Hippies. Is that a religion?

689
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,770
Huh?
Dirty hippies?

690
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,103
Yeah.

691
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,003
Et cetera.
Religion.

692
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,220
Okay.

693
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,490
Hindu, not Hindu. Hari Krishna.

694
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,930
Hari Krishna is just dirty
hippies who shaved their heads

695
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,480
or am I thinking of that Charles
Manson movie for the Manson family?

696
00:42:57,481 --> 00:43:01,620
I'll shave their heads. I don't fucking
know. I don't know what your point was.

697
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:05,040
Surf. It made me want to read the book of
Joe, but I know what's going to happen.

698
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,660
I'll start to read it and then as B,

699
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:11,340
and then God said it thought to you with
the hallway and the the seventh son of

700
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:15,510
the fucking he BD Hamadie who? And
it's just like, all right. You know?

701
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,950
Okay.

702
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,140
Why don't they give a,
I'm sure there is.

703
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:23,640
I'm sure there's an updated version of it
where they actually write it in a more,

704
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:25,830
um,
modern English.

705
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,290
Yeah.

706
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,810
Like the band. All right. Bill wife left.

707
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,320
Okay,

708
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,601
Bill.

709
00:43:31,601 --> 00:43:35,820
So I got a text from my wife a couple of
weeks ago saying she had taken her dog

710
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,960
and her things left and
we're getting a divorce.

711
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,813
Wow.

712
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,910
She gave you a text message,
you know,

713
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,470
that's kind of the way to do it.

714
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,610
Okay.

715
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,130
In a selfish way,
you know.

716
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,510
Do you know,
I know somebody who did that.

717
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,830
I knew somebody who was in a
fucking relationship forever.

718
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:04,610
Yeah.

719
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,010
And I guess they just didn't
know how to get out of it.

720
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,220
So here's an option for people out there,
men and women.

721
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,000
And so this has nothing to do with you.
This just reminded me of this.

722
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,160
So this fucking guy,

723
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,880
okay.

724
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,350
Is uh,
is woman went on a cruise,

725
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:25,500
I went on to some sort of wine
tasting thing or whatever and

726
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,380
he, I guess he knew that
she was going on this trip.

727
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,320
So before she left,

728
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,420
he already found another apartment,

729
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,280
signed a lease and all that type of shit.

730
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,820
So she leaves, I mean she was
leaving for like two, three days.

731
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,110
He had another buddy of
mine went over there.

732
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,700
They packed up all his shit and
fucking moved it out to this new place.

733
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,113
And then,

734
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,840
you know, he just lived in that place
until the day she was coming back.

735
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,400
He came back to the apartment,

736
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,810
she comes home and immediately
sees half the shit is gone.

737
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,700
And he just dropped the bomb
like that and said, listen,

738
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,220
you know, we need to talk.
I'm not fucking happy.

739
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,800
And what I tell you,
this fucking woman flip the fuck out.

740
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,960
Flipped the fuck out.

741
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:39,910
Like what?
Absolutely fucking ballistic.

742
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,543
And,

743
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,910
and I always wanted to ask her why,

744
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,350
what was it that made you flip out?
Would you,

745
00:45:51,351 --> 00:45:53,450
would you have flipped out less?

746
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:54,970
Yeah,

747
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,630
cause she, she didn't even go
into the, the surprise of what,

748
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,330
Oh my God, crying, uh,

749
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:06,331
blood went immediately to anger and I
think it was because he was already out.

750
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,430
Yeah.

751
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:13,510
And there wasn't going to
be any sort of closure.

752
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,830
Slash I can torture you.
It'd be a total cunt to you.

753
00:46:17,831 --> 00:46:20,800
Like he sidestepped all of that.

754
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:25,690
It just made this clean ass fucking break.

755
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,150
You know Dennis Miller, that's
the news. And I am out of here.

756
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,220
That's what I thought what he did it.
And

757
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,890
I dunno why. I always smile when I
think, cause that's the thing, you know,

758
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:46,010
if you're going to break up a woman,
you just know. I mean, I mean,

759
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,600
I never had a breakup with
a girl I was living with.

760
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:51,290
I can't imagine that fucking
hell and this person.

761
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,910
I mean that, that's one way to do it. Um,

762
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:00,380
so if you are stuck in a relationship and
you don't know how to fucking bring it

763
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:04,280
up, you just don't know how to
do it. That's one way to do it.

764
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,530
Because when they come home
and you're sitting there,

765
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:11,360
but you all your shit isn't there. Uh,
that's, that's the conversation has been

766
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,233
God.

767
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,210
Fuck. Anyways, so getting
back to this poor bastard,

768
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:24,440
he goes, harass Chanel was that,
she always hated me. Oh my God.

769
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,890
Forget the eight instances of cheating,
three posts, marriages that I,

770
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:35,790
three post-marriage that I tolerated just
because is as good of a reason for her

771
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,350
to leave as any,
wait a minute back up here.

772
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,310
Wait a minute, dude. She
cheated on you ate fucking times

773
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:53,160
five times before he got married.
I mean to what? Come on man.

774
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:59,530
You didn't see this coming. All right,
I'm going to save judgment here. Uh,

775
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,260
he said forget about the
aids instances of cheating,

776
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:07,290
three post marriages that I tolerated
the he price and quote just because is as

777
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:11,860
good of reason for her to leave as any,

778
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,510
uh,
here's where you pummel me,

779
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,730
but she was my mom's,

780
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:22,340
but she was at my mom's
bedside with my mom

781
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:28,500
and I when my mom died.
Okay. I didn't realize,

782
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,390
dude, you didn't write this well. I
didn't realize to her that nothing,

783
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,760
I didn't realize to her
that was nothing but

784
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,330
her way in.

785
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,490
I didn't realize that to her. I don't
know. What did she went to that, that,

786
00:48:52,491 --> 00:48:55,070
that was her way into your life?
In my grief.

787
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,860
I didn't notice she went full Andy.

788
00:48:58,850 --> 00:48:59,570
Okay.

789
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:04,570
Do frame just chipping away at my
sense of self so she would fuck around.

790
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:12,600
So when she would fuck around, I
thought, well no person in the world.

791
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:17,070
We'll hang on to me. So this is better
than being alone. Fuck it. I'll do.

792
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:21,270
Come on man. She and I had
been together for nine years,

793
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,170
married three.

794
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:26,670
My problem is that as a 26 year
old birthday was yesterday,

795
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:31,710
none of my friends can relate.
And my thousand yard stare,

796
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
oh can relate.

797
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,290
And my thousand yard stare at
the bar just seems to be harsh.

798
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,830
Seems to harsh there.
Hipster PBR buzz. Dude,

799
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:47,790
this is the most difficult fucking
thing I've ever tried to read. Um,

800
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,530
dude, you're like 26 years old. Get the
fuck out of this thing. Go to the gym.

801
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,720
Is that your problem?
Huh?

802
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:00,150
You got a little dull around the
fucking middle that said to read up on

803
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:03,120
nutrition gets get some
fucking self esteem, man.

804
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:09,690
This is ridiculous. Is fucking
cunt. You know why she hated you?

805
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,480
She's probably one of the reasons she
hates she's cause you're not sticking up

806
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:17,040
for yourself. This fucking
dude. Yeah. You know what?

807
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,100
I'm not gonna yell at,

808
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,010
you've already been through the
fucking ringer with this one.

809
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:22,440
I'm sorry you ran into
something like this. I'm sorry.

810
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:23,670
I don't know who the fuck you are.

811
00:50:23,671 --> 00:50:26,910
Your male role model was when you were
growing up, didn't build you up more.

812
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,400
They obviously didn't fucking raise you.
Right? And now you've got to do it. Okay?

813
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:33,500
You got to build yourself
up, man. You can't fucking,

814
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,530
you can't fucking have
something like this going on.

815
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,460
You like William h Macy in
fucking a boogie nights.

816
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,820
You going eventually fucking
shoot her in the driveway,

817
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:46,220
fucking your friends and
then go blow your brains out.

818
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:49,790
You don't want to be that
guy. Fuck this woman. He goes,

819
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:53,750
I've tried to get back out there with
some people I know, but when they tried,

820
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,810
when they tell their stories from college,
all I think is,

821
00:50:56,811 --> 00:51:01,811
I wonder if John McCain gets this mad
when people his age tells stories about

822
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:04,160
Woodstock.

823
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,220
Okay.

824
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,930
All right.
Now where do we make the leap there?

825
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:11,770
What their pussy stories and you're
pissed because you missed out on that.

826
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,070
Uh,
I'm lost.

827
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,400
I'm optimistic as for the most part,

828
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:24,570
my life is much better by friends think
I'm exaggerating because they saw us

829
00:51:24,571 --> 00:51:29,370
together and my response is that people
saw Elizabeth smart out in public too

830
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:34,320
and she wasn't and she wasn't fine either.
What the hell do I do?

831
00:51:34,321 --> 00:51:38,820
The last time I was single, texting
didn't exist. I couldn't drink legally.

832
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:43,140
I've lived with my parents.
I lived with my parents. Uh,

833
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,470
you got the 0.3 examples ago,
but I keep typing.

834
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:52,050
I thought maybe as a comic
when you started going into
the road and didn't know

835
00:51:52,051 --> 00:51:55,950
people everywhere, it may have been a
similar vibe. Yeah, Dude. Like you're,

836
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,330
you're starting from ground zero.
You're totally beat down.

837
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,240
Okay.

838
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,010
You're 26 years old talking
about like you're 50, you know,

839
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,320
you're fine. All right. Oh wait. So you
went there for fucking, what'd you say?

840
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:14,090
Eight or nine years?
Let's do the math here.

841
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,013
Yeah.

842
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:22,970
Tastes my wife of Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. Eight instances.

843
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,610
I'll see you there for nine years.

844
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,410
So you got together with this girl when
he was 17. He was still, you were a baby.

845
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,290
All right. I get it, I get it.

846
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,770
And you stayed with this girl and you
never cheated on her. She cheated on you.

847
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,030
And all those years of college when
you should've got you game together,

848
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:44,840
how to talk to women, but blah
blah blah blah blah. Yeah,
dude, that's easy. You can,

849
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,640
you can make up ground real quickly
here. You're only 26 years old. Um,

850
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,280
you just gotta. You just gotta get
yourself out there now. I mean,

851
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:59,570
I wouldn't suggest just going out to
bars. Look, if you want to fuck a woman,

852
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:03,980
go out to a bar. Do that. If you want
to meet somebody nice, then I would,

853
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,990
I would be, I would definitely look
elsewhere. Uh, do you have any hobbies?

854
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,850
Do you like sports?
I would join some sort of a fucking,

855
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,500
what the fuck is the word?
What's the word?

856
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:21,710
When they lead guys and women
play together. You know,

857
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,590
I joined some shit like that.
Take a fucking cooking class.

858
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:30,480
It's just something, you know, something
where the, where the good girls go to,

859
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:36,420
you know, but you know, if you
just want to go out and get laid,

860
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,230
who gives a fuck? You, what you gotta
do is you got to get over being,

861
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:44,460
getting rejected. Just go out to a
bar, just talk some shit. You know,

862
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,540
don't go out and get plastered and
use that as your fucking courage.

863
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,660
Just go out there and just talk some shit,
you know,

864
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,920
and just go out there and just say, all
right, I'm going to die. I'm going to say,

865
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:59,910
what's up to 10 different women tonight?
All right? Or if that's too overwhelming,

866
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:04,200
make it five or four. All right?
No more, no less than four.

867
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:09,840
All right? All right. With no,
no pressure on the results.

868
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,220
Just go out there and just
fucking strike up a conversation.

869
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,030
See how long you can keep it going and,
and just,

870
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,280
you know, whatever, you're going to be
nervous, you're going to give a fuck.

871
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:27,630
But with each one, you're going to give a
shit less. And the less you give a fuck,

872
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:30,270
the more relaxed you are going to be.
The funny you're going to be,

873
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:33,630
the more you're going to attract them.
It's, it's literally when you give a fuck,

874
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,160
when you give a fuck, you
scaring them away. When you care,

875
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,990
you know you'll be fine,
all right? But it's,

876
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:49,190
you got to grow up and stop and brace
in this fucking this depressive shit

877
00:54:49,861 --> 00:54:53,190
because it's also gonna make you an angry
cunt and you're going to fucking hate

878
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:55,920
women and you're gonna push your
friends away in the end up being alone.

879
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,970
All right?
Unfortunately you fucking,

880
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:06,310
you wasted nine years of your life with
some cunt and he got fucking married,

881
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:10,800
okay? But it wasn't a waste because now
you know what you don't want. All right?

882
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,460
So that's it.
But for the love of God,

883
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,340
do not get into another
goddamn relationship.

884
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:21,510
You got to make a pact with yourself.
You're not going to go from a nine year,

885
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:25,320
one, three year marriage to fucking
jump in into something else.

886
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,200
You gotta stay single and figuring
out what the fuck you want.

887
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,221
You might not want it.

888
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:33,420
You might want to like not even go out
to fucking bars for awhile. You know,

889
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,380
let's go to the gym.
Hit it like a fucking mad man.

890
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:42,180
You know it.
Fucking figure out what you will,

891
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,810
what you're looking for and then
where it should be and then go in that

892
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:47,560
direction. Do that. All right?

893
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,790
Not Everybody's going to be the guy who
goes out and bags of fucking a hundred

894
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:54,270
women who gives a fuck. All
right. At the end of it,

895
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,230
if you find fucking love and you find
the person he's supposed to be with you,

896
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:02,010
one. Okay, so, uh, whatever,

897
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:06,600
there's my fucking 2 cents. Did I
say the F word enough? Um, alright.

898
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:11,160
From fucking Croatia,
which is in fucking Europe.

899
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,240
Look at this guy breaking my balls from
the other side of the planet. All right,

900
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,620
I'll get right to it. Recently, my luck
with the ladies changed for the better.

901
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,490
Good for you sir.

902
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,970
I realized how different men are from
women and it started using that to my

903
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:29,770
advantage. Both sir. The last person.
Please listen to this guy. Uh,

904
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:33,970
I'm 23 and in college I started
college three years older.

905
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:38,350
So I am in class with 19 to 20 year olds.
Pretty much.

906
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,660
They are all ladies. Not a single
one of them is, Eh, is annoying.

907
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,020
I get along with all of them.
But there is this one,

908
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:51,940
Christina who acts like she's
the only one with problems. Okay,

909
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,400
well there's always going to
be a bad one in there. Uh,

910
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:55,870
we talked a couple of times,

911
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,560
even when out on a date she seemed
interested but very distant.

912
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,410
Uh,
the date was very tense.

913
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:07,210
Unlike all the other dates I can handle.
Oh,

914
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,110
Jesus. You guys really killed me this
week. Unlike all the other dates,

915
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:14,680
I can handle someone
manly. At least I am. Cool.

916
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,250
So everything goes relatively smoothly.
I'm going to cut you some slack circus.

917
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:22,060
This is a fucking second language.
This is amazing. Um, this date was as,

918
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,650
as stiff as Jay Leno. I hated it. Uh,

919
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:31,000
so we didn't talk for a couple of
days after the Hora date. Uh, my dad,

920
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:35,410
my bad for not knowing, not talking
to her. I know. No it isn't.

921
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,770
He had a bad day. Don't call her
back. You didn't have good time.

922
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Why would you pursue it? Uh, anyways,

923
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:45,190
then we started talking again
and some vibes are going on,

924
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,830
but we only saw each other in class.

925
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:52,831
Then we started talking some deep shit
over Facebook as 20 year olds do and I

926
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:59,290
realize we don't get each other.
We just don't understand one another.

927
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,580
All right,
so walk away.

928
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,470
She has a little circle of friends
and a lot of guys come on to her,

929
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:10,780
but she's like very into ourself and shit.
Okay.

930
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,470
I know her self centered
feelings are natural or her age,

931
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:19,360
but I am a little bit older but she's
like, now no one understands me.

932
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:25,360
She's really a baby yet, dude, you
have this all figured out. He goes,

933
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:27,970
we don't understand each other at all.
It's like,

934
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,360
we mean the same thing but awkwardly
argue over the choice of the words we use.

935
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:37,540
Man, I really want a banger.
She smiled. I was going to say,

936
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:41,530
she has to be beautiful. He said
she's smoking hot. In the meantime,

937
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,560
I am all over the other ladies.
Uh,

938
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:47,590
but I'm really restless about this one.
I like her,

939
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:52,830
but she will break me if
I get too much into her.

940
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:58,180
Alica we started speaking like Ivan Drago.
Um,

941
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,240
so the gist of my pussy ass letter is
how do I bang her now after the shitty

942
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:08,590
date and awkward Facebook
arguments? Uh, God damn.

943
00:59:08,591 --> 00:59:11,650
I just realized she's cutting my
balls off when I talked to her.

944
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,890
I must get my shit together
if I want to fuck her,

945
00:59:14,891 --> 00:59:19,840
but I still don't really know
how to do it. Shit. Okay.

946
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:23,360
Uh, all right. What
are we going to do? Um,

947
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,290
yeah.

948
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,870
All right. How the fuck do we undo
what the fuck was already done?

949
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,190
What would I do? Uh, I would fucking,

950
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,793
you know what I would do?

951
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,300
I would just charm the shit out of her
and I would come in in a fucking great

952
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:43,760
mood. Even if you're not in a
great mood just coming to class,

953
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,143
you know,

954
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:46,360
is it,

955
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:51,360
I'm giving you the fucking demoed speech
from fast times at Ridgemont high get,

956
00:59:51,911 --> 00:59:54,760
Oh, you just kept walking in
like, your fucking life is great.

957
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,063
You know,

958
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:02,250
she's going to be like, oh my God.
He's like, I'm not like talking to him.

959
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:05,940
And he's like having a good time. Does
that like mean I'm not pretty anymore?

960
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:09,930
Like that'll fuck with her fucking the
world revolves around me that you can

961
01:00:09,931 --> 01:00:12,420
actually, now that you've
been sucked into her world,

962
01:00:12,421 --> 01:00:14,820
you could still actually
have a great fucking day.

963
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:16,150
Okay.

964
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,320
Without needing her fucking,
uh, attention or anything.

965
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:24,580
Yeah. Just walk in there like your life's
to shit and when you see or be really

966
01:00:24,581 --> 01:00:27,070
friendly, hey, why are you
giving her a nice big hug?

967
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:31,300
And that'd be fucking flirting with all
the other fucking women that'll make her

968
01:00:31,301 --> 01:00:33,400
fucking jealous. I mean, he's basically,

969
01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:36,250
you're going to have to play a fucking
gay with a fucking cunt like this,

970
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,770
which is really a lot of work.

971
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,360
MMM.

972
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,040
And it sounds like you,
you like,

973
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,640
you sound like you're kind of the
male version of her, you know,

974
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,410
she kinda didn't let you fucking hit it.

975
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,900
So now you're kind of getting
wrapped up in this fucking Twat.

976
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,810
You don't even want,
your ego wants it.

977
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:55,910
You want to fucking bag or you
know what you should do, sir.

978
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:58,850
It's just fucking walk away.
That's what you do.

979
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:03,710
Walk away and go bag something else.
And when she actually fucking cubs at,

980
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:07,550
you'd be like, why didn't
you call me anymore? Just be
like, Eh, no vibe between us.

981
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,343
There really isn't.

982
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,520
You know,
you're beautiful,

983
01:01:11,521 --> 01:01:15,690
but the conversations too awkward and
I find that you're just really self

984
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:20,070
centered. You're really into
yourself. And uh, I find it annoying,

985
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:21,121
you know,

986
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:24,390
if you tell him that you've probably
going to be closer to the fucking pussy

987
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:28,950
than you are going the other way.
Why don't you call me? Oh sorry,

988
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:33,180
I've been busy. You just act like
a fucking loser. Don't do that.

989
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,353
All right.

990
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:35,730
Okay.

991
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,440
You get this one by walking away
from this one. That's, that's,

992
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,860
that's my gut feeling. All right, sir.

993
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:45,490
You know what you do, you just walk
in class, you'd take your Dick out,

994
01:01:45,491 --> 01:01:48,430
you put it right on a fucking desk.
Could just go and, you know, really,

995
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:52,150
can we just stop already? And then
when the teacher's like, excuse me,

996
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,430
fucking the checklists, Avaya Ne,
whatever the fuck her name is.

997
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:02,500
All right, sick. I used to play
for the, uh, for the Lakers.

998
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:06,250
Who's fucking over there? Christ.
I'm sorry guys. This podcast stunk.

999
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,130
Just take your dick out and shake
it in her face. Cool. Listen,

1000
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:13,710
I want to show you something. You go
ahead. Right? Flopped in. Yeah, right.

1001
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:17,310
How would you do that there?
Can I tap out on that? Um,

1002
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,140
this has been the Monday morning podcast.
