1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,960
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:07,700
Just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast. And Ah,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,330
just checking in on you.
Hey Bill, what the fuck?

4
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:16,280
Why are you checking in on us? So
fucking late this week, dude. Ah,

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,370
what'd you have a fucking hernia?
Is that what happened? What did you,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,470
did you get hit by a car? Uh, no. I, I,

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,250
it's been the most difficult podcasts
I've ever had to record you guys.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,980
I need a startup for my
emotions. Um, honestly,

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,490
honestly, uh, uh, I don't
know what happened. I fucking,

10
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:46,491
I got real busy and then I recorded the
podcast and for some reason there was no

11
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:51,330
audio. I can't figure out what
the fuck I did to my Miksa. Oh,

12
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:56,220
I did something. All freckles did
something. So this is my second attempt.

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,860
The last attempt was,
believe it or not,

14
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:01,110
I believe it was on
Thursday hours on Wednesday.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,930
I swear to God the dog ate my homework.

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:08,370
That's literally what I'm telling you in
a podcasting way. Um, so I'm back to a,

17
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:11,280
one of my original mixers here.
Thank God I didn't throw it out.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,630
Thank God I'm a bit of
a pack rat you guys. No,

19
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,120
actually I didn't want to throw it out
because I was going to give it away to

20
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,600
somebody. What I wanted to do. That
was the thing I was going to be like.

21
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,051
Do you mind?

22
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:26,730
You realize the amount of times a semi
known comics said the word cunt into this

23
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:28,020
mixer, mixer, mixer.

24
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:32,370
And I thought it'd be worth something
to somebody that they would take it. Um,

25
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,140
but I never got around to doing that.
And thank God I had a backup mixer. Ah,

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,120
that's the level that
I'm bawling at right now.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
You got to mix it, buddy. I
got a mixer and a backup mixer.

28
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:47,540
What the fuck do you got? You know,
if they still had MTV cribs right now,

29
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,380
I would be on it would lifestyles
of the rich and famous.

30
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:56,060
They have one and a half mixes.
Um,

31
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,620
all right, it's Saturday,
Saturday. All right.

32
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,570
And Moe freckles has been,
uh,

33
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,390
alcohol free for nine miserable
fucking weeks. It's actually, you know,

34
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:10,370
something, I'm at the point
now, I don't even give a shit.

35
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:14,600
I don't think I think about
it occasionally, but now
when I think about it,

36
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,690
I think, but why would I
go back to that? Huh? Oh,

37
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:22,691
Billy booze face sitting back enjoying
himself after a long day of hard work of

38
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,270
performing words that other people wrote.
Do you guys realize,

39
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,290
realize how hard it is to be an actor
sometimes to just show up and say things

40
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,630
that people already said
for you on a piece of paper.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,170
Um, that's one of the reasons
why this week's a little crazy.

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,420
So I got a little acting gig
over the next, uh, week or so,

43
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,350
and a mon general hospital. Um, no,

44
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,830
and I'm not allowed to say everything.

45
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:54,440
You're not allowed to say now because
you've got all these fucking cops.

46
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,800
Everybody tries to figure out what
you're on and then they start,

47
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,880
I don't know what they do.

48
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:01,720
And then somehow they know what
you're doing before you even shoot it.

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,090
That's like the level of technology.
Okay.

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,290
If you actually say what you're acting
on and somebody's listening to you on a

51
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,650
podcast has a drone with
one of those Gopros,

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,700
somehow they will know what senior doing,
but the next day before you are,

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,780
before you do

54
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,803
okay,

55
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,280
speak in a drones.

56
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,490
Do you know that the next level of Uber,
the next level of lift,

57
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,820
the next level of fucking
is early to fucking,

58
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,040
there's only two of them
either take Lyft or waste.

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,520
It's like back in the day when there
was VHS or Beta and everybody chose VHS.

60
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,730
So think about that. The next time you're
going to get in a car with a stranger.

61
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,523
Huh?

62
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,620
Um, there's a bunch of weird movies
coming out now that I don't understand.

63
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:53,980
You know, this is a fucking
documentary right now in, in, in, uh,

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,530
in Sundance.

65
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,253
It's,

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,240
I can't, but I glanced at it quickly.
I think it said it was four hours long.

67
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,470
It can't be four hours long.

68
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,130
It's a documentary about two now
adults who said when they were kids,

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,050
they allegedly got molested by Michael
Jackson. Now I gotta ask you this,

70
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,980
why the fuck would I want
to sit down and watch that?

71
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,870
I'm going to sit there with a bucket of
popcorn and some fucking junior mints.

72
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,760
Alright, let me hear the worst
story that can happen to a kid.

73
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,580
You know, you know, some people
say, oh, they just do it for my,

74
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,860
I don't know what the fuck happened.
I wasn't there, but let's, you know,

75
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,460
true or untrue.
I don't want to listen to those stories.

76
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,440
What kind of a fucking person
wants to fucking sit down?

77
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,420
You go to the movies, you know
you're going to get something to eat

78
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,650
and you're sitting there at the cow.
Oh, what do you feel like indulging in?

79
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,480
Before we listened to this horror?

80
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,783
MMM.

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,500
I don't know. But when I go back to,
I think when I saw Schindler's list,

82
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:08,030
I believe I was eating popcorn.
I mean that this certain movies,

83
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,103
they should not,

84
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,940
you should not be sitting there
stuffing your face with food, right?

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,920
We now have a documentary about the
genocide in Rwanda and out of respect for

86
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:25,270
the victims than you fat Americans will
be allowed to eat over the next two

87
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,240
hours. Aw, everybody fucking groans.

88
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,430
Hashtag hypoglycemic. Um, anyways,

89
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,220
so they, they uh, getting
back to the drones,

90
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,060
the next level of Uber is that they're
actually going to have, I swear to God,

91
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:43,320
like unmanned

92
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,030
drones,

93
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,240
I guess none of them really mad right now
that you can get into like a life size

94
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,670
one,
like a human size one.

95
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:51,920
Okay.

96
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,670
And you get in this fucking thing
and you fly over the traffic

97
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,070
like

98
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,250
a,

99
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
like I do when I fly one of the Helio
type copters and I have to tell you this,

100
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,590
you are out of your fucking mind.

101
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,580
If you remember with Lasik eye
surgery when that first came out,

102
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:15,120
do you remember that? And that'd be a
couple of fucking people go, oh my God,

103
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:18,840
I can see it to the future. But like
one out of every 15, we'd be like, Mike,

104
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,470
what did you, I'll never see again. Yeah.

105
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:30,210
There's going to be the first week
of Lasik eye surgery version of that.

106
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,010
Okay?

107
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,010
I want to know how in the fuck the FAA
is going to fucking sign off on that one.

108
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:41,100
You know,
God damn well there's,

109
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,490
it was a glitch that hatch just blue.

110
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,780
You're going to have the Gus Grissom
fucking, something's going to happen.

111
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,070
You know it's bad enough that you're going
to have the person up there careening

112
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:59,490
down or falling down to their death.

113
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,780
You're going to be sitting there
fucking watching NFL Bup, bup, bup,

114
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,430
but a bad app in a fucking hipster.

115
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:09,550
It's going to fall through your
goddamned ceiling. Tight jeans and all.

116
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:10,970
Okay?

117
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,480
You know,

118
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,370
Hitler youth fucking fade with the A,

119
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:18,770
I know how to make shoes by by hand.

120
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,380
Beard that he thought he's going to have
is going to come fallen right through

121
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:23,420
your fucking ceiling.

122
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,750
I don't know. You know, you know,

123
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:33,950
you'd think if fucking people like Elon
Musk or trying to figure out a way to

124
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:38,951
drill through the God damn earth and
now they're going to have unmanned,

125
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,220
unmanned people, unmanned
people, unmanned devices,

126
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:48,140
flying people around up there. You
take it. Some people at some point,

127
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,500
Jesus Christ,
the kid speak,

128
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:52,220
somebody would addressed the
fucking population problem.

129
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,130
Okay.

130
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,400
Signs. You have too many people. Uh,

131
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,410
we're going to have unmanned drones flying
people over densely populated areas.

132
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,870
Hey everybody, you have cell
phones, you have laptops.

133
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,220
How many times?
What?

134
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,330
What's the longest they've consistently
worked before you had to refresh it

135
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,070
or shut it down or restart it or
take it over to the apple store.

136
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:27,840
So one of the geniuses get,
be like, oh, oh, I find the,

137
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,950
I found the problem.

138
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,583
Yeah.

139
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,560
People in aviation, you can't
hit a refresh button. Okay. Yeah.

140
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:40,300
They refresh. They refreshed by hosing
off wherever the fuck you crash landed.

141
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,930
Let's refresh this scorched earth.
Um,

142
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,750
and then it will be like,
well shit,

143
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:51,751
they installed like horror struck today
when to hipsters from several lake.

144
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:58,111
We're trying to get from silver lake out
to Santa Monica to go to a craft beer

145
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:03,360
tasting fucking festival, whatever
the, whatever the fuck it is they do

146
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,450
to go to a pocket watch convention yet.

147
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,730
And then love followed through
some fucking, you know,

148
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,923
yeah.

149
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,010
Not paid in a month.
Air traffic controllers.

150
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:19,790
Fucking a irony struck today.
Um,

151
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,913
I dunno audio,

152
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,350
you're out of your fucking mind and I
also got to think it's going to be at

153
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:28,290
least 300 bucks per trip.
That'll become some elite thing.

154
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:32,100
And then there'll be like, you know,
we have to have affordable on man.

155
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:36,210
Droned why you saying unmanned bill?
You know why?

156
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,720
Because man learned how to fly not women.

157
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,870
And I'm sure when Hollywood
does the fucking next bio
pic of Orville and Wilbur,

158
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,510
it will be like, well, why
can't it be Orval in Wilma?

159
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,380
And they'll make one of them a woman
and they'll make some sort of backstory

160
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:57,210
that one of them actually identified as
female just so they don't get yelled at

161
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:58,044
on Twitter.

162
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:58,990
Okay.

163
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,140
Or Villain Wilma.
We're very proud of this,

164
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:07,000
that the real story of fucking Devil's
island, whatever the fuck they call,

165
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,110
wherever they,
they actually,

166
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:11,170
where they learned how to fly is
like some devil's something or other.

167
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,730
Okay.

168
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,720
No, I'm sure there's some Jesus fucking
group out there. Jesus Freak Group.

169
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:20,560
We'll just talk. Okay. That's why you pay
you right now. Let's swap. Flight is evil.

170
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Ain't you ever read the story of Icarus
flew too close to the sun and his and

171
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:32,530
his winged is wing base caught on fire
and he went all the way back down to

172
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:37,531
earth and he continued to fall to earth
through the earth into the pits and the

173
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,370
flames of hail.

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,890
Yeah.

175
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,110
Um, I dunno what I'm talking
about and I don't give a shit.

176
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,980
I'm just contractually obligated here
to give you guys some sort of an effort

177
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,060
for 30 minutes. Okay. That's what
you get. Not to me. Oh, by the way,

178
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,820
speaking of efforts
Sunday, tomorrow, Sunday,

179
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:55,990
okay.

180
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,850
Whatever. Fucked. January
27 2019 this is the,

181
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:05,851
this is the soft open of a sports
world without football for the next six

182
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:07,990
months.
This is the one,

183
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,880
okay.

184
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,850
Yeah. Gift. Giphy can, you know, God
bless ESPN. God Bless Fox sports the way,

185
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,691
the way they're going to be.

186
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:20,691
Keep yammering on on Sunday
as if something sports wise
is actually happening in

187
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:22,691
football.
What?

188
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:27,000
Down here at the trade and
Kevin Rob Grad Caskey is,

189
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:31,710
is touching his left hand
to his right fucking clique.

190
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,211
Rob,

191
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:37,650
you find it harder to reach to the right
one with your left hand or the left one

192
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:40,590
with your right hand?
I'm sorry rob.

193
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:43,080
Gronkowski he's not answering
questions right now. I mean,

194
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,090
who the fuck is going to sit
around and watch that? All right.

195
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:47,430
They used to at least
have the goddamn pro bowl.

196
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,020
Okay.

197
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,710
They had something going on.
Um, but that's it. People.

198
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,470
There's only one more week of NFL
football and there's only two teams left.

199
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,800
All right,
one left.

200
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,110
So you have to ask yourself,

201
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,070
who are you inviting to
your Superbowl party?

202
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,973
Huh?

203
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,180
Are you going to have the balls

204
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,310
to fucking only invite sports fans?

205
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,570
I guess if your team isn't in it, why
do you give a shit? Why not be social?

206
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,770
You know what I mean?

207
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,700
Why not have a bunch of people
come over who don't give a fuck?

208
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,200
They're just there for the Burgers,
the Doritos, the fucking hot dogs,

209
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,480
the stupid dips, that fucking thing that
somebody made that nobody really likes.

210
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:39,870
But they bring it every
year and everybody's got to
take at least one fucking

211
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,020
bite out of the thing and be like,
ah,

212
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:45,780
it's even fucking better than last year.

213
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,170
I think. I'm thinking, I'm toying
with the idea of having people over.

214
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,500
It's going to be a select few.
All right.

215
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,250
And they will come in in unmanned drones
and hopefully not fall through the

216
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:04,860
fucking roof of my house.
That's what I'm hoping.

217
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,020
That's what I'm hoping happens.
Now,

218
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:13,320
why the fuck is this? This seems like
the sound is down low on this one.

219
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:16,350
At she says, Christ, who
knows who the fuck knows?

220
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:20,070
I just want to thank all the brave men
and women who make the mixers out there

221
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:24,030
who are fighting for my freedom and
defending this country against terrorism.

222
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,200
How's that dude? How much longer is
this government shutdown? Gonna lie.

223
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,500
This is like the most
fucking petty God damn like.

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,830
And I don't understand too why if
the government shuts down, okay.

225
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,430
Uh, air traffic controllers and
people like that. They don't get paid,

226
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:46,290
but politicians continue
to get fucking paid. I bet.

227
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,870
I'll tell. I'll go out
on a limb here. I'll bet.

228
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,710
Because there was some sort of
legislation that a fucking politician paid

229
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:57,711
somebody to come up with and they all
fucking agreed and they all agreed to be,

230
00:13:57,811 --> 00:14:02,811
I guess we will continue to get
paid those fucking filthy counts.

231
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,320
I still don't understand how somebody
could actually be a Democrat or Republican

232
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,370
when you watch behavior like this
feed actually just fucking sit there,

233
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,110
you know? I mean I don't know when I'm
going to sit here and I'm going to,

234
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,730
but I'm going to do now is do
what every fucking cunt does,

235
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:25,380
which is I'm going to state the
obvious without a solution, you know,

236
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,060
and act like I am above you. All right.
That's what I mean. I do that in general.

237
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,200
Just part of being a former
part of getting on stage,

238
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,120
part of being back and waiting for your
name to be called and feeling that rush

239
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:43,860
of excitement that can only be describe
to someone else who was taking the stage.

240
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,443
Um,

241
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,160
you know, when you speak into
a microphone, there's this,

242
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,710
you just feel like you know things.
All right?

243
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,060
And I apologize to all of you poor people
out there who never in your life where

244
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:04,061
you know the thrill of not reading
and simply turning on a device,

245
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,170
speaking into a microphone,
recording yourself. You know,

246
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,800
I felt bad for you. You know,
I respect all of you. You know,

247
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,560
you put your pants on one leg at a time.

248
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,670
You know Joe Sixpack Shuggie you get
through at least four beers before you

249
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:21,620
physically abused the woman in your life.

250
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,810
You know the regular joes out
their lunch pail, Larry, right?

251
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,630
Ham Hock Harry,
you know,

252
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,540
fucking Capri Sun,

253
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,390
Sandra Capri Sun. Where the fuck that I
pulled that out of that. I don't know.

254
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,690
I never, I never got into those
fucking juice is back in the day.

255
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,670
I'll add fucking weird shit.
People used to eight.

256
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,990
What were those things during lunchtime
30 fucking years ago in the cafeteria

257
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:51,560
I'd go to, it would literally be what
they call it, fruit rollups. Okay.

258
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,310
You said this shit, fruit roll ups
and I swear to God it looked like wax.

259
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,500
These people would just fucking just
be, I don't know what it was. It was,

260
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:04,501
it was some sort of fruit and fused
flavor with like a pound of sugar.

261
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,760
And then, uh, I dunno,

262
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,940
earwax from fucking workers in a
third world plant or some shit.

263
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:15,460
I don't know what it wasn't. Kids would
sit there and eat. I mean, you know what?

264
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:19,620
Nobody died. Nobody died. And, and,

265
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:22,600
and the world was actually was in
a lot of ways, was a better place.

266
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:26,970
I'm not saying we were as progressive
as we are today.

267
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:33,410
Some would argue overly progressive.
And when I say some,

268
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,660
I would say a lot of the
voices in my head would say,

269
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,900
I think we're going a little too
far with this shit. You know?

270
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,280
Okay,

271
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,380
well you start giving
actors shit for acting.

272
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,470
Okay.

273
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,150
Why are you pretending to be
something that you're not a,

274
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:52,080
because it's acting that that
is what acting is. Okay. If you,

275
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:56,670
if you take an acting job and you
just act what you already are,

276
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:57,900
that's not really acting,

277
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:02,901
which is why so many people have done
a decent job be and what they are on

278
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:07,300
sprayed and then everybody thinks
they can act. Oh, I can act.

279
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,490
Okay.

280
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,340
Acted z Z.
Remember when that chick from hall,

281
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,960
that crazy drug addicted chick from whole
played the crazy drug addicted chicken,

282
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:17,641
that fucking bitch,

283
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:20,500
she was unbelievable as it crate
that crazy drug addicted chick.

284
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,290
I couldn't leave out. Well, she
played a crazy drug addicted check,

285
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,900
let's say in every crazy drug addicted
woman can then go on screen and there is

286
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,720
a certain level of fucking towel,
but k,

287
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:34,000
but don't put yourself on the
same level that my left foot guy,

288
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,400
okay.

289
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,610
Guy Walks around acting like Abe Lincoln
for a fucking year before he's actually

290
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:39,391
a Blinken.
Okay.

291
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,210
Then you're going to just come in and
play heightened version of yourself.

292
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,520
What am I doing right now?
I am describing my acting career.

293
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,850
Um, anyways, how much time
is that? Oh Jesus Christ.

294
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,140
It's like fucking,
you know what's hilarious?

295
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:59,580
It's like five 50 in the morning
and I got up to go to the gym,

296
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,230
I got to, I got the acting
Gig also happens today. I
just have a later call time.

297
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:07,840
So I was like, I'm going to get up and
go to the gym. All right. Cause I'm uh,

298
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,910
trying to get myself back in shape here.
Right? So I remember the old gym song,

299
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,440
I go to the gym every day.

300
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,170
It's just become pop me life.

301
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,550
And if you don't want to be a fatty,
you go to the gym every day.

302
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:25,200
You can't have big body. I called them
every day. So I don't go every day.

303
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,790
I take one day off.
Right.

304
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,280
I figure even if the Lord needed to take
one day off when he was creating the

305
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,070
universe as I'm sculpting

306
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,533
this

307
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,390
flower covered colored body.

308
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,263
Okay.

309
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,070
Do you know how you know something?

310
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:50,270
All of these minorities out there
with their pigment bitch moaning and

311
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:53,660
complaining. I asked you this
as a privileged white male,

312
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,650
do you understand how difficult it
is to get shredded when you were as

313
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:00,200
transparent is me.
Okay.

314
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,430
I could be in just as good
as shape as some Hawaiian.

315
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,420
Okay.
But because I am so pasty,

316
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,700
the world is never going to know it.

317
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,380
And do you understand how difficult it
is for me when I walk out into the world

318
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,810
it's like, Hey, I have a couple of
abs too. You just can't see them.

319
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,193
[inaudible]

320
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I want to get that Janet Jackson stomach
makeup where you just said, you know,

321
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,520
get one of those people that you know
when you almost have abs and they just

322
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,380
spray paint them in.
I want to do that.

323
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,053
Right.

324
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,240
And then I'm going to do,

325
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,620
put on a half shirt and do my
dance cover of miss you much.

326
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,360
I miss you man.
Oh miss you much.

327
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,850
I really miss you much.
Um,

328
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,110
I remember I had a crush on her
when she was on different strokes.

329
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:58,330
I didn't like her when she was on
uh,

330
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,270
good times.
You know what I mean?

331
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,160
And not because she was younger
with baby fat and you know,

332
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:09,990
cause we're basically the same age.
Uh, it was because she was broke. Okay.

333
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,000
And I'm not, I'm not trying
to get with some, yeah,

334
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:17,490
she was living in the projects then I
liked her better when she was, you know,

335
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,950
on different strokes,
you know,

336
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,940
interacting with super rich white people
then then me as a little white kid

337
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:25,650
could relate like,
all right,

338
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,290
oh now the world dove move
to the beat of just one drum.

339
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,870
What might you may not be right for some.
Um,

340
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,140
all right.
That was inadvertently

341
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,330
one of the funnier things that
I've said on this podcast,

342
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:55,280
but I'm sure someone will take it in
the wrong way. What are you saying?

343
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:58,820
You can't fall in love with
someone because they live
in the projects, projects,

344
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:03,620
projects. That's exactly what I'm
saying. That is how privileged I am.

345
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,470
You know, if women can go into these
fucking single buys, these meat markets,

346
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:13,480
and one of their first questions they
ask you when you run into them is what do

347
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,980
you do for a living?
You know,

348
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,200
how much fucking cake are you putting on
the table? They're swinging Dick. Why?

349
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,150
Why can't I choose?

350
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,810
Why can't I choose my TV crushes?

351
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,673
Huh?

352
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,040
That's how I was. I was an elitist
with my TV crutches. Crushes,

353
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,550
you know,
fuck all those bitches on the Waltons.

354
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,750
But I would fuck anybody on Falcon
crest and cloning though, man.

355
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,140
Now they'll world doe boom to the beat.

356
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Just one drove a bunch of rich white
people throwing each other in the pool in

357
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,340
evening gowns.
I've never seen that one.

358
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,970
Is that when Joan Crawford in Morgan
Fairchild had their infamous cat fight,

359
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,023
you know?

360
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,270
Yeah.

361
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,140
That I think gets reenacted on floats
during the gay pride parade in every city.

362
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,740
Isn't that what they,

363
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,450
isn't that required that you have
to have one stereotypical thing.

364
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,840
All right. Gay People, gay men, let's,

365
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,590
let's do what straight
people think we're into,

366
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,750
which let's appease them so we can try
to be a little more mainstream this year.

367
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,790
Oh Man. That different strokes on when,
when it gets in your fucking head,

368
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,250
you just can't get it out,
you know? But it's enjoyable.

369
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,080
Everybody's dead.
Except the due to played Willis.

370
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,410
That's kind of sad. A guess. I died next.

371
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,250
I think I'm the same age as Willis Willis.
Drummer booboo boo.

372
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,380
What is covered? He's on the
only one left alive. Yes, he is.

373
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:53,140
Yeah, that's a, you know something.
That's what I do when I watch me TV.

374
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:55,450
I try to see like, who's
the only guy left? Oh,

375
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,190
that's a great fucking trivia thing.

376
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,020
Okay.

377
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Name TV shows where there's only
one series regular is still alive.

378
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,960
Different strokes. The
Beverly hillbillies. Wait,

379
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,370
[inaudible] the fucking, uh, the dude,

380
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,050
you know, that's how you, right now,
that's how that shows you right now.

381
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:19,680
How hard show businesses. You know
what I mean? Because in the real world,

382
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:23,010
women outlive the men.
All right?

383
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,860
But this business is so fucking difficult

384
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,333
that

385
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,560
I would say that doesn't make any
sense. Does it? Well, let's see. Well,

386
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,870
the one chick overdosed
and then the housekeeper,

387
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,170
she was like 93 when they started
shooting that she fucking crushed it.

388
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,300
She had a great act in career. You don't,
she had two shows that made syndication.

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,670
She was on a,

390
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,700
she was on, uh, the facts of life.
You take the good, you take the bad,

391
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:56,450
you take them both in there. You
have the facts of life, you know.

392
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,860
Do you know why that
song was at that tempo?

393
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,460
Because when you really just slow that
down, that doesn't make any sense.

394
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,790
You take the good,
you take the bed,

395
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,530
you take a both and there you have the
facts of life. It's like, wait, what?

396
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,210
That doesn't mean anything.
Okay, but you speed it up,

397
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:16,350
take the goods to take the bed.

398
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:18,810
You take a boat and there you had
the facts of life. Oh, that's catchy.

399
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:22,890
I don't feel like thinking
the facts of life. Um,

400
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,680
I know what you thinking. Hey
Bill, you're wife is black.

401
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:28,800
We ended today on that show.
No, I was not. I like Joe.

402
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,170
Joe The mechanic. I liked her riding
the dirt bike, the fucking tomboy.

403
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,630
I like Blair at first. You
know, at first I like Blair,

404
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:42,420
but there was just something
so fucking wholesome about her.

405
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:45,690
After awhile I was just
like, yeah, Jesus Christ.

406
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,140
Can you imagine the fucking look?
She be given me a weekend to this.

407
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:54,430
You like how I'm entertaining the fact
that a young freckled me could actually

408
00:24:54,431 --> 00:24:57,760
dated Blair from um

409
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,900
Oh is that fucking show. I just said
it. The facts of life. All right.

410
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,960
I don't have anything to talk about.
Something to tell you about my TV crushes.

411
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,360
All right. Back in the day. MMM.

412
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,210
I would occasionally watch Charlie's
angels because even back then I was so

413
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,110
sexist

414
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,790
that I couldn't get over the
fact that I was watching these,

415
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,010
these women all made up
running down the alleys,

416
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,370
tackling these fucking guys
into trash cans. You know,

417
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:36,220
having said that, I obviously
liked Farrah Fawcett, right?

418
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,410
But I was a Kate Jackson Fan. Okay.
She was sort of the first Demi Moore,

419
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,430
I feel,
you know,

420
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,450
the fucking Brunette with
the smokey fucking voice.

421
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:50,090
And then the best was when she was
on the rookies. Bad Outta Butoh too,

422
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,770
about that ad ad ad, ad, ad, ad ad.

423
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,170
You know what I would love to
have on the fucking podcast?

424
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I would love to have the trumpet player
from the 1970s who fucking just got in

425
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:08,200
with whatever studio and played
half of those themes, songs, dude,

426
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,860
if you were in a fucking horn section,

427
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,220
okay.

428
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,740
Living in La in the 70s.
Right. And you just,

429
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,471
you just fucking,

430
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:20,940
and then they had all those cop shows
you were working every fucking week.

431
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:22,470
You in that Bongo player,

432
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,800
the Bongo player was just crushed every
time you fucking chased the suspect down

433
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:31,170
a fucking alley. They always were playing
the congress of the bongos. Right.

434
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,650
And then whenever they had the theme
song for the show is the fucking horn

435
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:39,350
section. Uh, but um, uh, [inaudible]
uh, [inaudible] uh, trumpets. Yeah.

436
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,390
Dead Dead

437
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,220
fucking horn players crushing it.

438
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:52,923
Yeah.

439
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,830
Walking around with polyester shirts
with unbuttoned dowdy in Naval Yaggie

440
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,540
Medallian your little coke spode right.

441
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:07,000
Don't go to bed with a price on your head.
No,

442
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,870
don't do it. Um, all right, bill,

443
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:14,500
what are your predictions for
the Super Bowl? You know me,

444
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:18,460
I never think my team's going
to win. Okay. I hope they win,

445
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,920
but I'll tell you right now,

446
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,310
they're going to have their hands full.

447
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,970
Love these rabbis of Los Angeles that
I already make fun of those fucking,

448
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:33,100
those 30 something douchebags who
in the rams jerseys who were crying,

449
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,420
they were getting all
emotional and they're fucking
girlfriends were comforting

450
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:40,570
them. When the rams beat
the states, it's like,

451
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,520
what the fuck are you create such a
typical Foti fucking La Douche bag.

452
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,190
It's like the rams had
been back for three years.

453
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:51,430
They left in the 80s you're
fucking 30 years old.

454
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,280
You don't remember these fucking people.
Oh my God.

455
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,160
God had been waiting for is I
was trying to fix and now I'm 49

456
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,200
okay, now the world dope. Move
to the beat of just one drum.

457
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:10,680
Your team, Jess moved back.
Stop with the crocodile tears.

458
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:13,200
That's the wrong expression.
Stop with the a phony fucking tears.

459
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,850
Those were actors.

460
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,660
That's what they weren't in the
NFL of course has to show them,

461
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,110
look how happy we make people

462
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,140
and now let's take a veteran out of the
crowd and charged the marines money for

463
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:32,340
it lays gel. When Alibaba, a round
of applause for this hair, all that.

464
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:37,341
We're now charging the military a fee
for a cupbearer shall act a like way

465
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,473
support.

466
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Let's bring out the American
flag everybody and horror
out people's patriotism

467
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:47,100
so we can make more money.

468
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,770
Let's settle this class action
suit with former players.

469
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,370
That comes down to about $38 per player.

470
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,280
Um, oh Geez, I'm getting
cynical. 29 minutes a,

471
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,620
we made another one. You know what? I
got to read a little advertising here.

472
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,680
Um,
I can be broken my own mother fucker.

473
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,570
That's how I, I, I justify my crush,

474
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,690
my elitist crush on Janet Jackson.
All right,

475
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:29,300
here we go. He looks
everybody. Alex. Hey man,

476
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:32,450
you ever wake up in the
morning with a raging out? No.

477
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,210
You have a wake up in the morning
with regrets of what you'd done.

478
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:36,300
Okay.

479
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,280
Do you know what I did this morning?
I woke up this morning.

480
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:42,100
I had a dream that one of my

481
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,740
relatives was on a boat that sank

482
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,510
with like 200 fucking people
and they were all missing.

483
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:52,470
And somehow I was in the
ocean but still in my house.

484
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,480
And I found my loved one and they
picked her up and she was face down.

485
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,150
And when I turned her over,

486
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:03,990
she started crying and was
coughing and she was still alive.

487
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,820
And I came in,

488
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,120
okay.

489
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,350
And I think I talked shit, I talked to
the other rescuers, I said, beat that.

490
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,820
And then I realized she was
still alive and I started crying.

491
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:18,460
And then I really just started wailing,
crying.

492
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,020
Okay.

493
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,660
And I walked by my mother and
she just went, Jay says, Bill,

494
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,380
like I was crying too much.

495
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,430
I don't even get supported by drapes.

496
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,710
I'm replaying the terrible decisions you
made the previous night over and over

497
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:42,230
and over, the kicking, the sweating,

498
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:47,290
the yelling or whatever else you did to
piss everyone off to piss everyone in

499
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:49,670
the bedroom off. Well, guess what, Bud?

500
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,860
Depending deciding to sleep on a
shitty mattress is your choice.

501
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,450
I like how these people try to write
this dialogue like the way I talk.

502
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:02,810
So now I have to take my head away from
the microphone and read literally what

503
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:06,170
they wrote. But bill, buying
a mattress is so high.

504
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,850
Where would I ever begin?
Well, you're in luck buddy.

505
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,440
A lot of buds and buddy here. It's written
by Jeff Spicoli. What's your problem?

506
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,680
Bird. Because Helix, helix sleep. Um,

507
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:22,730

508
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:24,470
your life.

511
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,060
All the fun with none of the
next morning regrets in misery.

And right now you can get up

515

516
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,950
That helix sleep.com/burr for
up to $125 off your mattress.

517
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,020
They let you try that.
You got a hundred night free trial,

518
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,370
uh, uh, uh,

519
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:12,440
it doesn't feel right and we
all went out bag in my broad,

520
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:16,910
it just doesn't feel right in my cock,
you know.

521
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,460
Well what kind of balls do you have?
I got those medium size ones,

522
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:27,050
but for some reason they weigh down my
ball sack is if it's not a quality ball

523
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:30,320
sack, you know, like I feel like
if I had a quality ball sack,

524
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:33,230
the weight of my balls,
they wouldn't be mid thigh.

525
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,310
It actually makes me know,
do they end plastic surgery?

526
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:40,010
Am I going to see one of the
male Kardashians down there and

527
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,720
get a ball talk,
a ball sack Tuck,

528
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:43,843
you know,

529
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,420
do you have a wrinkly ball sack?
That is so 2018,

530
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:51,870
come on down and get botox,
Gabby a balls, botox.

531
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,360
Just listen to what
these women have to say.

532
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,970
I never used to lick my husband's balls,

533
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,790
but now that it's so smooth and not Harry,

534
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,140
I'm down there every night
taint. Um, all right.

535
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,810
That was my nod to David
Cross and Bob Odenkirk.

536
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,030
One of the hardest I've ever
laughed in a sketch show

537
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,530
is when they did that fucking sketchy
about the guy with the giant Tate in the

538
00:33:14,531 --> 00:33:19,360
porn industry and how they were,
it was, it was not that sketch.

539
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,130
I didn't even hear that sketch.

540
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:25,960
It's the way they went into that sketch
where they had like a Batman style fight.

541
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,540
I can't really remember what
happened, but like, you know,

542
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:33,100
they were doing the freeze frame on the,
on the, on the punches, they go pow bef,

543
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,160
you know, slam. And then the last one,

544
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:39,760
this dude looked like he kicked the guy
in the balls and it just said taint.

545
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,060
And I was fucking screaming,

546
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:46,870
laughing because Tate
was in the white world,

547
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,860
a very not known reference at that point,

548
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,630
if I remember correctly, that came
out of the African American community,

549
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,763
you know,

550
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,580
taint pussy tape balls.
It's the taint. Right.

551
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,420
And that was new to white
people and I was not ready for,

552
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:09,780
I think Patrice told me that
one and I wasn't ready, uh,

553
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:14,570
for that to be coming out of that
show. And I was screaming, laughing,

554
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,200
and my lady at the time who was Caucasian,

555
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,290
she didn't know what I was laughing at,
but I was left.

556
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,540
You know when somebody laughs so hard,
even if you don't get it,

557
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:26,110
you start laughing. That's basically
what happened. And you know what

558
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,070
just happened there? You just listened
to 34 minutes of my bullshit. I gotcha.

559
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:35,000
Again, motherfuckers. All
right. That's the podcast. Have
a great weekend. You can't,

560
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:36,200
there's got to be a little music

561
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,100
Telenor,
Lou here,

562
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:39,980
and then you're going to listen to
another 30 minutes of a greatest hits

563
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:42,320
Thursday afternoon.
Just before Friday,

564
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:45,050
Monday morning podcast
possibly released on Saturday.

565
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,290
They made a [inaudible] came out

566
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,840
or fucking eight minutes ago. I don't
know. I don't pick them. All right,

567
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,100
I'll see you on [inaudible]

568
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,210
Monday

569
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,340
morning. What's going
on? It's built birth.

570
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,740
It's the Monday morning
podcast for Monday,

571
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,700
January 24th,

572
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,390
2011 how the hell are you? How are
you doing? Did you have a good week?

573
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,090
Was the world nice to, yeah. Uh,
this is a big day for me. Everybody.

574
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:55,710
This is my 100th day.

575
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,470
And when I said I was knocking off the
booze because I was starting to have a

576
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:02,370
big bloated face, I was like, fuck
this. I gotta I gotta you know,

577
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:03,630
gotta get on the treadmill.

578
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,700
I got a knock off the booze and I was
trying to beat my previous record of going

579
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:13,630
75 days and this time I said, fuck it.
I'm going for an even hundred. And uh,

580
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,490
the goal has been a chief JF JF Javed.
Um,

581
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,340
I'm site,
I did it and a,

582
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:25,341
tonight I'm going to the Bruins la kings
game down at this stable feda the most

583
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,020
unfriendly fan fucking play
she'll ever go to. The haves,

584
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,410
the really haves and the have nots.

585
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,640
I broken it down for you before you got
all the corporate seats down low sit

586
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:43,290
next, Diane Cannon, Jack Nicholson
and fucking sissy space sick.

587
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,480
Whoever the fuck else is down there,

588
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,960
all those Douche bags sitting there
with their fucking faces yanked back.

589
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,850
You know, by the way, how long has
Jack Nicholson had going bald for?

590
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,530
It's just fucking unbelievable how
long it took for that guy to go bald.

591
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,640
He lost one hair a day since 1972

592
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,320
so do you have any notice
that there's certain people,

593
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:11,450
it just takes for fucking ever,

594
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,350
unless they seamlessly went into
a toupee pay, but he's bald. No,

595
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,310
but you know, being someone
who's balding myself, you know,

596
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:22,480
I pay attention to that type
of shit and I pay pet tension.

597
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,720
All these motherfuckers,

598
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,560
I see the receding hairline and all of
a sudden it's not there. The next movie,

599
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,750
and I was like,
day you go look at that guy.

600
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,260
He went out and he got himself sort of a
scalped in a user friendly way and then

601
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:39,890
they reseeded the front. I going
out like that. My goal in life,

602
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,200
I want to look like Clint Howard.

603
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,893
Okay.

604
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,510
Woo. It's not going to end good for
me. Uh, yes. I went a hundred days.

605
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,670
100 days.

606
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,170
100 days and yes,
and I don't know,

607
00:37:57,171 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm afraid I'm scared every one.

608
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,640
I'm afraid to start drinking
again because I noticed that I,

609
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,580
I just pick up where I left off.

610
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:11,510
Like I really learned about addiction
during these last hundred days.

611
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:16,430
I realized how much shit I was,
uh, you know, not addicted to,

612
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:20,240
to a level that it was like, you
know, I was coming home and slap it.

613
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:22,520
My girl around,
you know,

614
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,240
getting on all fours growling at my dog
is I peed on the Stereo and then the

615
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,460
next morning, like I didn't do what
he did. I don't remember that. Oh,

616
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,060
well maybe I wouldn't drink if
you weren't such a coat. You,

617
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,790
I wasn't doing stuff like that.
I was just out having a good fucking time.

618
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,250
I like beer the way I
like cake and cookies.

619
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,860
There's really no reason.
There's no reason to have cake or cookies.

620
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:50,200
It says no nourishment
that your body needs.

621
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,150
You don't need that much fucking sugar.
But a, I like it. I like the fucking rush,

622
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,570
you know, is sitting
there feeling gloomy, Eh,

623
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,960
I hate myself.
What am I doing?

624
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:08,570
Remember when I was young and I'd just
go out and play Frisbee and it was fun,

625
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:12,770
man. It was simple, right? You get older,

626
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:16,040
you got all this debt, he got all his
bullshit. Everybody's fucking nagging you.

627
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,890
You get the blues, see, go out, you get a
slice of cake, right? Feeling like shit.

628
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,720
Six bites of cake lady. You're
like, dude, I am fucking awesome.

629
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,970
Right? You got that sugar rush going.
So that's what I realized. I am a,

630
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:35,720
I have a number of addictions.
I am addicted to sugar.
Not In like a, you know,

631
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,690
I need an intervention,
but like I fucking crave it.

632
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,030
But if I lay off it for four days,

633
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,990
when if I don't eat any
sweets for four fucking days,

634
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:48,440
when I look at a doughnut or a
piece of cake, it's like laughable.

635
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,660
Like why the fuck would you eat that?
Look at it yet, that, that at, at, at,

636
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:56,150
at that data,
it doesn't even look like real food.

637
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,410
You know when you're off, when you're
fucking, when you've kicked sugar,

638
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,040
when you look at a glazed doughnut,
just sitting there all fucking sweaty.

639
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,440
It just let, it looks horrible. It's
like, why would you do that to you?

640
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,870
So you know,
you look at all the frosting on a cake,

641
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,670
you make that face like he just
sucked on a lemon like Jesus Christ.

642
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,530
Enough already and a fucking cunt
downstairs just slammed the door cause I'm

643
00:40:22,531 --> 00:40:26,550
being too loud. I don't care. Douchebag.

644
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,470
I fucking love old people,
but I hate that motherfucker downstairs.

645
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,160
I fucking hate that guy.
Hate that.

646
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:39,480
He's got that classic old person's
smell. He does it. He has a unique smell.

647
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:43,080
You know what he saw? He
smells like a, like a fucking,

648
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,600
if you lit a wet dog on
fire, okay, if you did that,

649
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,190
that's what he smells like.
Fucking miserable motherfucker.

650
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,880
This goddamn Docker's the original
Docker's fucking army navy store shop and

651
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,440
douchebag. Fucking miserable.
Cont giving me the stink eye.

652
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:07,980
Every time I walk up the fucking walk
can't stand the guy fucking hate them

653
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,180
there. I hate him. I don't give a shit
right. I die. I'll fucking, you know,

654
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,340
I'll argue that one in the afterlife.
I'll sit right there.

655
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,400
You know you drank it drove.
Yes, I did. Guilty as charged.

656
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,170
He treated a lot of women
like shit. You're absolutely
right. Guilty as charged.

657
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,510
And you had, you had a poor opinion
about the old man downstairs. Well,

658
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:33,800
let me tell you something. Jesus,
you try living above that cunt.

659
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,990
Go Talk to your dad. He made them, oh
my God. Shut up. You fucking hippie.

660
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,680
Oh Gee. Um, so anyways,

661
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,260
so tonight I am going to, um, I'm
going to go watch the best of the,

662
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,710
of the, of, of the four sports,

663
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,540
the four major sports hockey is the
best goddamn sport out there. All right?

664
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,380
And uh, I know a lot of you won't
realize that because you never played it.

665
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,550
You never went to a game, hence you
don't know what you're talking about.

666
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,410
You know, it'd be like me making fun
of line dancing. I've never done it.

667
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,040
You know,

668
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,030
I've never gone out and bought a pair of
wrangler jeans that were fucking $8 and

669
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,620
nine sizes too small for me.

670
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,620
So they cupped my fucking bowls and
got out there and stuck my hands in my

671
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:26,000
pockets and did this little
fucking, that little, oh my God,

672
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,800
that fucking line dancing.

673
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,450
Can there be a mass suicide
amongst line dancers?

674
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:36,230
Could that just fucking happen in the
middle of one of your fucking corn ball.

675
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,070
Stupid ass fucking sell country music.

676
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,440
It's country music is, I don't even know
what it's for. It's for like pod people.

677
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:51,050
There's absolutely no soul in it.
What's so it there? Is it all right?

678
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:53,210
They're angry.
Redneck listening to this,

679
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:57,710
punching the dashboard or your
Chevy s 10 all right. There isn't.

680
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:00,350
It fucking sucks.
And that line dancing.

681
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,150
We sit there with your fucking thumbs
in your book and pockets and you do that

682
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:08,420
little fuck I'm doing, I'm, I'm actually,
I'm in Dallas, Texas this week, so let's,

683
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:12,740
let's go for big air in this one. We
do that then you're fucking, I wish,

684
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:16,190
I wish this was a vodcast,
which I'm not doing by the way.

685
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:17,600
So stop fucking asking me.

686
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,780
The great thing about this thing is
you can listen to it while you're doing

687
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:22,130
other shit.
Right?

688
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,560
Are you or are you not doing other
shit right now? Well, all right then.

689
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,220
Are you or are you not pretending
to be working right now?

690
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,180
Looking at spreadsheets, right?
You want to fucking plane?

691
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,150
Huh?
What are your choices for food?

692
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,660
Aren't you doing that as you listen to
this when they quit your fucking pitching?

693
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,050
All right. So anyways, they do that
stupid thing where they banned,

694
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:47,330
they're fucking nice and the,

695
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,300
and I can't even think of the fucking
music by Ana [inaudible] the Gig, the Gig.

696
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,400
You right. There's none
of the music goes. And um,

697
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,340
and they do that little thing where they
just one of their, one of their feet,

698
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,530
right? The right foot,
we'll say the right foot.

699
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,570
It's just pivoting on the heel and the
toes of face forward and then to the side

700
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,190
and then back to the front.
Ah.

701
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,430
Then they do that little thing where
they bring their fucking foot up and they

702
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:13,730
spanked the bottom of their foot.
All of them.

703
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,050
You know what kills me about those
people is they actually think that Jesus

704
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:21,530
loves them. I got news for you. Rednecks.

705
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,290
Jesus is looking the other way.
He's embarrassed.

706
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,020
He's combing his fucking
hair into his face.

707
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:32,010
When he watches you people line dance.
He is looking that chicken the ring.

708
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,150
Um, yeah. So speaking of
which I'm going to be,

709
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:38,430
I completely forgot what the fuck
I was talking about. I know. Yeah.

710
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:41,610
I'm going to go into
the hockey game tonight.

711
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,020
La Kings verse the Boston Bruins,
the La Kings,

712
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,880
which who actually have a
really good team. I liked that.

713
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,050
I liked that Dude Simmons.

714
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:54,040
He's fucking fast as
health and a cold baton,

715
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,350
um, border. It's the
greatest fucking game.

716
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:01,140
And I've actually been playing
a hockey recently. Ice Hockey,

717
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,350
the real fucking deal. And I'm excited.
Guess what? I learned how to do this week,

718
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:07,080
42 years of age, not
married, no kids. I learned,

719
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:09,900
finally learned how to stop on both sides.

720
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:12,770
Okay.

721
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,770
But you know what's funny? I have, I
have to go buy some more hockey stuff.

722
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,780
You know, it's funny, out here in La,

723
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,210
I have to drive all the way down to like
Orange County just to find someplace,

724
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,230
stuff that we'll sell hockey
stuff. Uh, but I have to,

725
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,480
even though I suck at this sport,
I just,

726
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:30,560
I'm just an old man and like
it takes about four days.

727
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,090
That's how deep the bruises are.

728
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,900
After I'm done falling on the ice
and like four days after I play,

729
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:40,550
I look like I've been beaten
with a fucking bamboo cane.

730
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:46,870
I had a brutal one when I was in fucking
Atlantic city last weekend doing the

731
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,320
Miami Heat tour of comedy.
Um, by the way, um,

732
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,680
the Atlantic city was so successful.

733
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:59,830
I just got an email today for an offer
up in a fox woods for April 30th.

734
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,260
So I will let you know
as soon as I find out.

735
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,630
I might actually have an update right now.

736
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:09,890
Wouldn't that be amazing right here on
the fly as you listened to the Monday

737
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:13,060
morning po? Fuck, let's just keep
the flow of this podcast going.

738
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,810
I think this was good.
I think it's what it's going to.

739
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,100
It's going to be a good one. We're almost
11 minutes in. Things are going well.

740
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:23,150
For some reason. The voice seems
way too loud on this thing.

741
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:27,160
What's going on with
this anyways, uh, yeah,

742
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,690
so I fell on my fucking right ass,

743
00:46:29,691 --> 00:46:33,830
cheek and hip last time he played
before Atlantic city. And, uh,

744
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,920
it's one of those deals I
kept pushing on it going,

745
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,930
I can't believe that didn't bruise.
It's, it hurts when I touch it.

746
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:43,430
When I push my thumb into my little
fucking right. Buttcheek it hurts. Right.

747
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,500
And then like four days later,

748
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:50,450
I'm in Atlantic city and I'm showering
and I looked out and it looked like

749
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,620
somebody threw a can of grape soda.

750
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,953
Yeah.

751
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,650
Uh, so I will be getting
all, all of the hockey stuff,

752
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,440
which I really didn't want to do because,
um,

753
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:08,570
I don't want to put it out there that I
think I know how to play hockey because

754
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:12,350
I don't, I just enjoy it. It's
fucking fun. It's a fast game.

755
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,330
The only equipment I wear is I wear a
helmet for my big fucking head and I wear

756
00:47:17,331 --> 00:47:22,250
the full cage in the front because, uh,
I don't need any hockey scars, you know,

757
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:25,370
with the sticks and all that shit. Why
would I do that to myself? You know,

758
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:30,070
like I'm going to win a cup. I need
to sacrifice. Oh, speaking of which,

759
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:34,480
I should probably wear a cup
too, right? No lifting. Um,

760
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,400
hang on a second. We're
going to the inbox. Did I get
anything? Did I get anything?

761
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:44,830
Nothing. You motherfucker.
So anyways, yeah, so this,

762
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:48,070
so tonight actually tech,
technically I can start boozing.

763
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:52,000
This is the 100th day, but I gotta be
honest with you, I'm not going to do it.

764
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:55,930
I think I'm going to try to see
how long I can go with this.

765
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:57,210
I'm going to wait until there is,

766
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,400
there is a specific event where
boozing makes sense and uh,

767
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,670
then I'm going to knock it off. Then I'm
going to boost, make people, what am I,

768
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,660
what am I going to do?
Honestly,

769
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:13,120
I might never going to have a
beer for the rest of my life.

770
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,360
I don't know how those people in Aa do it.
That's like,

771
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:19,840
I have a weird sort of like
respect for people in Aa.

772
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,840
And I also have a,
uh,

773
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,150
a disdain for them because,
uh,

774
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,470
I went to a couple of Aa
meetings, uh, not by choice. Um,

775
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:35,500
the judge told me I had to go,
that's part of your sentence.

776
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:40,840
Um, and I went there and
uh, I didn't like it.

777
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,190
I kind of liked it. I liked sort
of the room, but kind of like, uh,

778
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,390
the only aspect of church that I like,

779
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:49,720
I like going to church because it reminds
me not to be a complete piece of shit.

780
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:53,560
But other than that, all that stuff
about hippies walking on water,

781
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:58,030
talking to bushes, it just
sounds like an acid trip. And uh,

782
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,210
it just, it's just stupid and
there's always a fucking leper.

783
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:07,050
How many fucking lepers were there
back then Jesus Christ get tell me you

784
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:12,400
wouldn't have a fucking giant stick
back in the day. Just for the lepers,

785
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,930
you know,
ugh.

786
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,250
Jesus Christ had fucking
smash them. Right? And if you
get the fuck away from me,

787
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,640
he fucking leper.
What would Jesus do?

788
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,380
He has the ability to cure
himself. I don't. All right.

789
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:33,360
Don't you think that that maybe that's
why he was such a good shit because he's

790
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:37,890
the son of God. He knows he's going to
heaven course he's doing the right thing.

791
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,980
It's so fucking easy to be a good shit
when you can walk on water and touch

792
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:46,680
something and it gets cured. Of course
he's going up and shaking your head,

793
00:49:46,681 --> 00:49:51,510
your fucking freak. Get away from
me. I can't do that. You're a leper.

794
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,310
Fuck off Dow.
Go cry to the son of God.

795
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,900
Um,
so anyways,

796
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,200
yeah. So I would go to these, these,
these meetings, these meetings and uh,

797
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:07,034
you know,

798
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,890
yeah,

799
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,670
I dunno. I, I believe in addiction.
And then other times I just think,

800
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,950
I don't think all of those people addicts,
I think some of them,

801
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,970
they're just weak. I can't stop
myself. It's like you don't have

802
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,770
like your brain tells you arm to move
and pick up something and put it to your

803
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,670
lips.
Right.

804
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,640
Did you guys like alcoholics?
You guys become like such an alcoholic,

805
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:33,560
like the bottles actually talking to you.

806
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,160
I had a fucking buy into that shit.
You know,

807
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,090
God damn fucking pussy alcoholics.
All right,

808
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,070
go drink a case of beer. I understand
it. Puke it up. All right. And then take,

809
00:50:53,071 --> 00:50:57,220
you know, a week or two off.
You don't do it every night.

810
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:00,940
You know, actually, I'm full of Shit. I,

811
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:05,770
I 100% believe in that addiction thing
and I actually believe a, I actually now,

812
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,330
I now understand after watching
the biggest loser every season,

813
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,110
I now realize yeah it is.
It is an addiction.

814
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:20,220
Because every one of those people has
some sort of psychological reason as to

815
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:24,040
why they do it. But wait
a minute, I'm not fat,

816
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,630
but I'm out of my fucking mind.

817
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,003
Yeah,

818
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:32,110
yeah. So fuck him. Yeah. Right. All
right. Sorry. I had to work that out.

819
00:51:32,111 --> 00:51:34,210
Fuck those fat fucks.
Hey fuck them.

820
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,260
I get sad and then I eat 24 cakes.
Well,

821
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,060
how come nobody gets
sad and they do sit ups.

822
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,380
What's the deal?

823
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,660
Actually some people do that and that's
one of the last shows they'll do a Jim

824
00:51:51,661 --> 00:51:54,030
addictions.
You know,

825
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,350
they'll do something like that cause I
think they're out of boring jobs to try

826
00:51:58,351 --> 00:51:59,730
and make exciting.
Have you seen that?

827
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:03,900
They actually have a show out there
right now about people mining for gold,

828
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,010
you know, I mean mining for
gold, obviously they still do it,

829
00:52:08,011 --> 00:52:09,270
but it's like big business now.

830
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:13,740
They have these sophisticated machines
that cut the tops off of mountains and

831
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:17,280
then they grind them down like you did
with your number two pencil and second

832
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:21,690
grade trying to get down to the array,
right.

833
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:23,721
Okay.

834
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:28,550
But nobody with a big bushy beard is
squatting down like a Chinese gambler next

835
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:32,510
to a fucking river with the God damn
dinner plate trying to find gold.

836
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:36,170
But Lo and behold,
they found 10 douchebags who are doing it.

837
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,240
And they decided to make it a show and
they decided to fucking have what film

838
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:45,500
these guys arguing each other and play
this something dangerous is happening.

839
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:50,180
Music underneath it. And I'm sick of it.
All right? Fuck minors. Fuck people who,

840
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,080
uh,

841
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,420
make cakes for a living did fuck
those God damn crab fishermen.

842
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,830
You know, nobody is making
you go on that Goddamn boat.

843
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,460
Fucking idiots going out.
They have risking your lives.
Have a flounder. You know,

844
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,580
just say what you do
out loud for a living.

845
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:16,780
Just say it out loud a couple of times
to yourself. I go on a fucking tugboat.

846
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:22,890
Okay. And I, I, I risked my life

847
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:29,400
to get a, to get king crabs. So rich
people have something crunchy to eat.

848
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,940
Go Fuck Yourself, JP Morgan, you
want crab? Go get it yourself.

849
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,810
What are your fucking options? Actually,
you know some, I'll make it fun.

850
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:45,600
I actually respect those guys
cause I have a tremendous,

851
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,910
tremendous fear of the ocean.

852
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,050
A huge fear of people who go
out and swim in the ocean.

853
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,790
You're out of your fucking minds.
You're out of your fucking minds.

854
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,420
I know I've said this before in
the podcast, but you know what?

855
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:04,950
I'm going to say it again. I
don't give a shit. I'm edgy.

856
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,210
I'm crazy. They should make a show about
me and my podcast and the dangers of it,

857
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:14,250
you know, then me and Neil
will have fake arguments. Um,

858
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,150
you know, we'll have shit like plugs
or something will go wrong. You know,

859
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,600
I don't know. I don't have what
we're with my Olympic SLS, ted. Oh,

860
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:27,980
I thought you were going to have it.
Then they'll cut to me. You know?

861
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:32,450
So I went to go do the podcast
and I couldn't find the Olympics.

862
00:54:32,451 --> 00:54:33,284
Ellos 10

863
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,593
ditto.

864
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,600
I mean, I, I gotta get this
podcast done by Monday,

865
00:54:37,601 --> 00:54:40,420
or I don't know what the fuck's
going to happen. If you notice that,

866
00:54:40,421 --> 00:54:42,460
like I think the,
at Orange County choppers,

867
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:47,790
they basically created the template
for all those reality shows.

868
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,980
And now everybody does that shit.

869
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,330
The exact same thing that would happen
on that fucking motorcycle show,

870
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,130
uh, with where the sun would be like,
eh. And then we had a problem. The, uh,

871
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:04,100
the carburetor didn't fit
for the carburetor, wasn't
here. And then the bar, like,

872
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,280
then the dad comes,
shit,

873
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,680
Yo, what's going on? The
carburetor isn't here.

874
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:17,890
Then he gets on their show. Mike,
he's fucking scary. Well, no, could,

875
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,590
how fucking jacked is
the dad on that show?

876
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,750
He could please my entire family to
death if he got excited enough. Um,

877
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:32,370
so now they do that shit. Like it makes
sense on the chocolate for Shell, right?

878
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:36,600
Bunch of mechanics. They're, yeah,
they're wearing their greasy Dickies.

879
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:38,700
They got butt cracks hanging out death.

880
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:41,250
They're going to yell and
scream at each other. Right.

881
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:46,700
But the fucking idiots making cakes.
So we get a job.

882
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:49,250
Uh,
we have to make a cake for the firehouse.

883
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:53,630
And I decided to do a cake that
was shaped like a fire hydrant.

884
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,660
I wanted to do a fire hydrant motif with
the little a Dalmatian know peeing on

885
00:55:59,601 --> 00:56:01,850
the fire hydrant.
But Michael was like,

886
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,120
I don't think that we should bring urine
into something that's going to be in

887
00:56:05,121 --> 00:56:09,230
your mouth. They was typical Michael
just shitting on my creative process.

888
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:15,340
Oh, kill yourself. Nobody cares. Nobody
cares about you and your fucking cakes.

889
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:19,570
And I like cakes. Yeah. Do you guys didn't
know that about me? Did you? Let's see.

890
00:56:19,571 --> 00:56:21,310
How will you at 20 minutes in here,

891
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:25,080
20 minutes into the podcast.

892
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,890
Um,
should I do it?

893
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,490
Should I do it?
I'm going to be a class act here.

894
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,500
My condolences to the Chicago bears
fans and the fans in New York jets.

895
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:43,720
Uh, the true fans, the true sports
fans, the ones that don't talk shit.

896
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,720
The ones who are cool.
The ones who, you know,

897
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,960
you can actually have a conversation
about football with my condolences.

898
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:54,190
Go out to you. Uh, believe me as a fan
of Boston teams for my entire life.

899
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:58,390
I know what it feels like to be that
fucking clothes and they get kicked in the

900
00:56:58,391 --> 00:56:59,950
seeds against some my condolences.

901
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:04,450
Congratulations to the Steelers
and the Green Bay packers.

902
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,410
And uh,
I would like to open this dialogue.

903
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:13,860
This is something that bugs
me about a NFL football is,

904
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:15,663
is this,

905
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,230
I don't get why in every
other fucking major sport.

906
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,210
They count championships from
100 years ago. Like, well,

907
00:57:25,211 --> 00:57:26,410
let's look at the red sox.

908
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:31,840
They won the championship and like 1908
or something. When they had crazy legs,

909
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:36,460
Magee was playing fucking third base with
his giant Ebeneezer fucking mustache.

910
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,860
They count those,

911
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,040
the red socks count five world series
titles that we went from 1918 and before

912
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,990
fucking Montreal Canadians.

913
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:50,980
They Count Stanley cups that they
won during that time too. All right.

914
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,451
The Yankees,

915
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:55,660
they count all their pre depression
era during the depression or whatever.

916
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:57,910
That's right when they started,
when they count all of those,

917
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,780
the fucking Celtics
count this from the 60s.

918
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:05,620
The fucking Lakers count
their championships,

919
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,060
their first two or three,
it wasn't even the NBA.

920
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:15,070
Those are BB eight championships. Their
first four out of five championships.

921
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:20,020
We're one before the 24 second shot
clock even existed when you could win a

922
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:25,021
basketball game like 17
to 12 they count those.

923
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,230
So my question for spots
for sports fans is this,

924
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,710
why don't they count Nfl Championships?

925
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,840
Why do they only count Superbowls?

926
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,040
Because when you just count Superbowls,

927
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:43,060
the Pittsburgh Steelers are the Yankees
that Canadians are the Celtics of

928
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:47,020
football.
But as bullshit,

929
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:52,980
it's fucking bullshit because the Greenbay
packers have won like 12 or 13 NFL

930
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:57,010
titles and Superbowls.

931
00:58:57,011 --> 00:59:00,790
They won three super bowls in like
another eight or nine NFL titles that for

932
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,170
some reason they don't count.

933
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:07,570
The Pittsburgh Steelers were in the NFL
when Green Bay was winning all those

934
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:10,600
titles. So they had a shot
at winning them. You know,

935
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:12,790
it's as much as I give
the Canadian shit going,

936
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,970
I you dominated a 16 league,

937
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:17,980
which isn't really true.

938
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:22,850
They were going tit for tat with the maple
leafs until 60 but the Bruins were in

939
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,180
that original six.
So we should have dominated and we didn't.

940
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:29,630
So that's why I shut the fuck up
when it comes to that conversation.

941
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:33,890
So can anybody out there tell me
why don't they count NFL titles

942
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,050
like I, I don't, I don't get that.
I don't get it. That would be,

943
00:59:40,051 --> 00:59:43,410
if you didn't count that in baseball,
you would have missed out on Babe Ruth,

944
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:48,510
Mickey Mantle, Joe Dimaggio, none
of that. None of that would count.

945
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:54,300
Bill Russell wouldn't count. It's
fucked up. I think it's bullshit.

946
00:59:54,301 --> 00:59:57,060
And I think it's, I think the,
I like, I want to go to what?

947
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,470
Like I love sports history.

948
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:03,620
I want to go to an eagles game and I want
to see 1960 NFL champions and I'm not

949
01:00:04,321 --> 01:00:06,900
giving an eagles fan shit. I'm just,
they should have that up there.

950
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,270
The Cleveland browns won it and like,
uh,

951
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,710
I don't like 63 or 64 with Jim Brown.

952
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,770
The bears won one with Mike. Uh,
Mike Ditka and uh, what's his face?

953
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:23,630
They're a Dick Butkus
right. They want it. Uh,

954
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,840
the Green Bay packers won a few.
Then the cults with Johnny Unitas,

955
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,720
you know the ones that they won the
greatest game ever fucking plague.

956
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:35,460
Yankee stadium giants first, the colts,
1958 the overtime fucking victory, right?

957
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:41,210
They don't count any of that shit.
It's,

958
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:44,450
it's disrespectful to
the athletes that played.

959
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,410
Those were the best of the best,
at least white guys

960
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,740
for, for most of those
years. But seriously,

961
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,480
there was only one professional league.
So the talent pool was even greater than,

962
01:00:56,481 --> 01:01:01,160
and they don't, they don't count it.
And I think it's fucking bullshit.

963
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:06,161
And I'm hoping that somebody talks
about that considering you have the most

964
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:12,050
successful teams since the Super Bowl
era and then you have playing the most

965
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:15,470
successful team in NFL history.

966
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,400
They have one in every era except for
the seventies and eighties I guess they

967
01:01:23,271 --> 01:01:25,100
didn't want a championship
and the 2008 but they,

968
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:29,960
but they've been competitive or whatever,
you know, I dunno. Speaking of which,

969
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,450
you know, do you guys realize
that right now Brett Farve

970
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:36,830
is getting sued some of this shit.

971
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,020
This is how fucked up
the world is right now.

972
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:44,210
Brett Farve is getting sued by the,

973
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,860
uh, by two [inaudible]
because he tried to get, uh,

974
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,520
some sort of sexual favors
afterwards and they're, they're,

975
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,420
they're suing for that.

976
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:55,240
Okay.

977
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,510
Do you understand that? Well, let
me say that just one more time.

978
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,660
Brett Farve is getting sued
by a [inaudible] tumor.

979
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:06,400
Susis does that how you said my sue says,
um,

980
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:11,220
mousses um,
tomosynthesis for,

981
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,540
for asking basically to, to, uh, you know,

982
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:18,040
to bang them at the end of it,
they're suing him.

983
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:19,840
Okay.

984
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:19,990
Could

985
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,960
you fuck a believer? I just,
it's just fucking bus that will,

986
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,010
you know what that's like?

987
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:28,210
That's like me showing a comedy
club because I got heckled.

988
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:34,390
It comes with the job.
There is not any machine,

989
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,800
any female Masoud out there
that listens to this podcast.

990
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,580
Are you honestly going to tell me that,

991
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:46,660
that you've been rubbing guys bags and
their legs and the chest and all that and

992
01:02:47,171 --> 01:02:51,220
you've, no one has ever asked you for
a fucking hand job at the end of it.

993
01:02:51,221 --> 01:02:53,260
It fucking comes with the territory.

994
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,920
That's like being a cop and suing
the city cause you got shot at all.

995
01:02:59,030 --> 01:02:59,863
Right.

996
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:06,050
You fucking put hot oil all over a guy's
body and you rub everything but their

997
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:11,280
dick. I mean, give me a fucking break.
You goddamn cock tease is, yeah.

998
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:14,190
People are going to ask you to rub
one out. Okay. And if you had a shred,

999
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:18,540
a fucking decency, you'd do it. You'd
complete the Goddamn job. All right?

1000
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,920
Because you're sign says
full body massage. All right,

1001
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,190
last I saw my dick is still part of my
body. All right. You know what, they'll,

1002
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,230
you know what Miss Susan is a like,

1003
01:03:29,231 --> 01:03:33,540
they like the fucking quarterback
who can't get it done, you know,

1004
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,940
just always comes up a little bit short.

1005
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:37,740
They should fucking interview
them afterwards. So, you know,

1006
01:03:37,741 --> 01:03:40,770
like what happened in there?
Uh, you know, and I just didn't,

1007
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:42,670
just didn't get it done. You
know, it's like right there.

1008
01:03:42,671 --> 01:03:46,890
All I do is just reach out and
grab it. And I just, uh, you know,

1009
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:51,600
we didn't want it. We didn't want
it as much as they wanted it. Um,

1010
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,940
that's just like, just, that's such
a classic, uh, piggyback lawsuit.

1011
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:01,400
It's like once that first stupid whore,
um,

1012
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:04,940
you know,
gave Brett Farve Shit,

1013
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:09,280
this is very interesting that
I've noticed about horse.

1014
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,500
Once one comes out of the woodwork,

1015
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:14,620
then all of a sudden 20 come
out of the woodwork, you know,

1016
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:18,640
and then they always try to paint it as
well. We were too scared. We were scared.

1017
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:19,474
Fuck you.

1018
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,800
You were you trying to make money and
you're trying to build on the momentum of

1019
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:27,880
the other case. That's the female
version of pulling a train on somebody.

1020
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,530
You know, the guy version is,
you know, you and 80 of friends,

1021
01:04:32,531 --> 01:04:35,970
bang the same girl. The
female version is, you know,

1022
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:40,980
you're a fucking whore and you're just
waiting for a whore to sue a guy that you

1023
01:04:41,261 --> 01:04:45,760
fucking banked and then you fucking, you,
you draft in right behind their lawsuit.

1024
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:50,530
Okay? Like one of those fucking fairies
that rides in that bike race out there.

1025
01:04:50,531 --> 01:04:51,730
And uh,
in uh,

1026
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:55,830
in France that just piss
some people off actions.

1027
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,580
You realize that the level of cardio
that you need to compete in that sport is

1028
01:05:00,581 --> 01:05:03,490
10 times that of a
professional hockey player.

1029
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,290
That's when you know you're watching a
sport that no one gives a shit about.

1030
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:10,630
When you have to really start
bringing up like science,

1031
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,590
they did a study,

1032
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:19,750
the heart rate of the highlight
player of go fuck yourself.

1033
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:23,680
Why don't you take that highlight
thing? It just fucking cup. You're nuts.

1034
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:26,590
You're taint and your asshole
and carry yourself outta here.

1035
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:29,290
Why don't you do that?
Did that make sense?

1036
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,850
Is that what they do with
the highlight sticks?

1037
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:32,500
Okay.

1038
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,280
Or is it shaped that way?
It's sort of a, a, you know,

1039
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,730
a user friendly bike seats that
you can rock up and down on.

1040
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,900
You know what? I think it's time to
read some questions for this week.

1041
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,280
I'm going to say I've, I've exhausted
all improv skills at this point. Oh,

1042
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,630
first thing I want to tell you guys,

1043
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:56,030
can you guys do me a huge favor
if you're on Facebook? Um,

1044
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,250
there's some douchebag
pretending to be me on Facebook.

1045
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,960
It just don't add the guy.
He has a Celtics logo. I
don't know what he's doing.

1046
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,970
He's not doing anything malicious.

1047
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:11,650
He's just pretending to be me and
it's really weirding me out. Um,

1048
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,410
I mean, I don't know what
he thinks he's good. I mean,

1049
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,660
I can't get laid off of Facebook
so I don't know what this,

1050
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:20,380
well maybe he's got better at
typing game than I do, you know,

1051
01:06:20,381 --> 01:06:24,070
but I just don't want that shit to be
added to my file down there in Houston,

1052
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:29,320
you know? All right. There's a
lot of question out there about,

1053
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:33,070
you know, things that happen within
society specially, you know, this,

1054
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:36,520
this is something that I think a lot of
white people need because not because

1055
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:40,440
we're more racist than anybody else,
we just get just the,

1056
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:45,441
the consequences of us fucking up is so
much harsher than other people because,

1057
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:49,930
uh, you know, we, we are the gold
standard when it comes to racism.

1058
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:53,130
Yeah.

1059
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,990
We are in the driver's seat right now.

1060
01:06:54,991 --> 01:06:57,750
We have been in the driver's
seat for awhile. Basically.

1061
01:06:57,751 --> 01:07:00,240
Meaning that if we are ignorant assholes,
it,

1062
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,450
it has way more effect than
when other people are, you know,

1063
01:07:03,451 --> 01:07:07,140
back in the day when other people
will run shit, that's the thing.

1064
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:11,430
Whoever's on top, if you're
thinking ignorant, uh, that's
what, that's why, you know,

1065
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,550
if you're on top and you're
thinking ignorant shit,

1066
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,240
you have to be called on it because,
uh,

1067
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,660
just cause he cause the effect that
you can have. You know what I mean?

1068
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,220
Okay.

1069
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:27,030
Like if somebody from Bangladesh fucking
hates me, that's such a stupid example.

1070
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,373
Okay.

1071
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:28,970
Okay.

1072
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:30,380
That,
that's not a race of people.

1073
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,380
I don't even know where Bangladesh's
and I gotta be honest with you.

1074
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:35,060
I don't even know if
that's a city or a country.

1075
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:39,980
Bangladesh have ever seen
that on the prices, right?

1076
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:42,140
Yeah.

1077
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:46,840
I want to showcase showdown where selling
yet a Bangladesh and some white trash

1078
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:49,540
person like myself.
So sit with a confused look on their face.

1079
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:53,500
Like I don't know where that is.
Is that where the terrorists are?

1080
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:57,910
I don't want to go there, whatever,
like a Filipino people fucking hate me.

1081
01:07:57,911 --> 01:08:00,250
That doesn't affect my life.
It doesn't,

1082
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:04,240
I'm not going to go and do a
job interview at, at, you know,

1083
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:09,590
Walmart is not run by Filipinos.
You know what I mean? You know,

1084
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,270
not saying there's anything wrong
with Filipinos. Alright. See,

1085
01:08:12,271 --> 01:08:13,690
we'll see what I have to
do with those white person.

1086
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:17,360
Let's say I'm saying I do bad Filipino
cause we clear here later on, I,

1087
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:21,110
I've never had issues. I go have a lab of
Catherine. Well, fucking all that shit.

1088
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:25,040
You got to go to the Jerry Lewis
voice there lady. Um, so yeah,

1089
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,930
people have questions.
So here we go.

1090
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:30,890
And I think all races to chime
in the questions that you have,

1091
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:33,580
if you have feelings about a different
race of people and you just think about

1092
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:36,980
your thinking, something funny, there's
nothing malicious, but is this offensive?

1093
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:39,920
Is it racist? This is, this
is the new topic. Okay.

1094
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:44,780
And if you feel that I answered these
questions like the ignorant white man that

1095
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:49,780
I am, uh, call me out on it. I'm here.
So here we go. This first one, uh,

1096
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:53,060
Bill,
is it racist to call Indians?

1097
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:58,790
Dibble dabbles.
And I'm talking about the Asian ones,

1098
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:02,240
not native Americans. Um, I'm
guessing by Dib and DAB was,

1099
01:09:02,241 --> 01:09:05,140
you mean Duba Dabu though.
But the movement, the bud,

1100
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:08,870
you're saying like that debit Dabu um,

1101
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,750
is it racist?
Probably,

1102
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,880
but it's fucking funny.
So that knocks it down a little bit.

1103
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,310
This is what I feel that makes
something like racist. It's like,

1104
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,980
like the reason why,
uh,

1105
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:29,330
that one isn't as offensive
is because we haven't,

1106
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,130
we never enslaved them.

1107
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:36,350
That's the reason why white and black
shit is so sensitive is because of the

1108
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:40,430
shit that we did to him. But we haven't
really fuck with those people, you know?

1109
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,860
So if the black version
of that was, is it,

1110
01:09:44,861 --> 01:09:49,650
is it offensive to black people?
Hey man, mother fucker or whatever.

1111
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:50,340
Yes.

1112
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:54,930
That would be offensive if you did some
sort of mocking of the way they spoke.

1113
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:55,950
Yes.
That would be,

1114
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,740
that would be offensive if some CEO was
giving a speech and I was driving a,

1115
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:06,741
actually I was having someone else drive
my town car and we drove by a group of

1116
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:12,060
a young mother fuckers and uh,
they proceeded to walk forwards again,

1117
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:13,860
you'd have to apologize. So I guess, yeah,

1118
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:17,040
I guess technically Duma
Dapa like that would be,

1119
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,980
that would be offensive. Is it racist? Um,

1120
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,980
this is what I, I really, I really,
it's hard for me to say because it had,

1121
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:33,900
it's what's in your heart, you
know, cause I make fuck I really,

1122
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:37,800
I make fun of, of everybody, you know,
I mean I play a game out here. Uh,

1123
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:41,550
when someone is make, let me ask you, I've
got a question for you. Is this racist?

1124
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,710
I have a game out here when I ride around
with Nia and she does not approve of

1125
01:10:46,711 --> 01:10:49,920
this to keep her in the clear.
She does not approve this.

1126
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:55,020
When somebody makes a more ronic
move in front of me, you know,

1127
01:10:55,021 --> 01:10:59,130
driving, you know, just makes
a fucking horrific move.

1128
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,100
I play a game called old or Asian

1129
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,600
and you have to guess when,

1130
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:08,520
cause I'm going to pass the person
cause I got to see what they look like.

1131
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,460
You know, whenever somebody
does something fucked up,

1132
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:13,020
some comedians do a great joke about,

1133
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:17,400
you just want to see what the fuck they
look like. Right. Uh, that's the game.

1134
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:22,260
Older Asian. So as I speed up my little
hybrid to try to pull parallel to them,

1135
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:25,020
I always say, what he's saying to you,
what are you going with all the ration?

1136
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,530
What'd he got? Older Asian. She goes,
I'm not playing this game. That's mean,

1137
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,730
and then I was gone, I'm going to
go with old and then I pull up, oh,

1138
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:36,530
it's fucking Asian, you know, or Oh, I
nailed it. It was an old guy. So, um,

1139
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:40,140
is that racist?
I'm sure it's offensive,

1140
01:11:40,141 --> 01:11:43,050
but within the context of my own car,
you know,

1141
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:47,280
I'm not yelling at anybody
and I got to admit, you know,

1142
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:50,220
there's a lot of truth in the
fucking game. Yeah. Jesus,

1143
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:54,790
I'm gonna have to apologize next week on
the podcast. So I would say that, uh, uh,

1144
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:58,380
Indian people, why don't you
chime in? I would say that, yeah.

1145
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:02,970
That they would find that they
would find that offensive. Um,

1146
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:05,190
is it racist?

1147
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:06,940
Okay,

1148
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:11,700
let me see if I can use it
in a sentence here. Hey, uh,

1149
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:14,910
you know, I called up customer
service and, uh, you know,

1150
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:18,630
one of those Buba dog was answered and
tried to tell me that his name was Steve

1151
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:22,100
and act like he was in Kentucky.
But I,

1152
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:24,980
I know that he was actually an India,
cause what he talked to,

1153
01:12:24,981 --> 01:12:29,630
he was going [inaudible]
woods, how can I help you? Um,

1154
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,570
is it racist?
Probably.

1155
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:41,970
You know what, something bad has to
happen between white culture and, uh, or,

1156
01:12:41,971 --> 01:12:46,400
or western culture in Indians.
So, you know what I mean?

1157
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:50,870
It's like a, it's like you're playing
a team and there's no rivalry.

1158
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:57,110
Like patriots verse jets this
year was like a whites and blacks.

1159
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:59,960
It was bad. It was a
lot of hate, you know,

1160
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,910
but like patriots verse,
like the Fucking Lions,

1161
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,710
you know? Yeah. There's to be some
shit targets. It's knocked out,

1162
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:15,350
but it still hurts if somebody
says something mean. I don't,

1163
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,390
I really don't. What the fuck
I'm talking about? All right,

1164
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:18,440
let's move to the next one.

1165
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:23,710
The next one on the new controversial
topic on the Monday morning podcast.

1166
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:28,700
Is it racist? All right, here we go. Um,

1167
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:34,070
Bill, I had an interesting experience
today apparently involving me as a racist.

1168
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:39,080
I was walking with two of my coworkers
who are both black Oji. Here we go.

1169
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:42,110
Um,
we were going to go get some lunch.

1170
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:46,980
One of my coworkers who are
most of friends with, uh,

1171
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:53,020
did a little high five fist bump shuffle
with one of the female sex security

1172
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:55,760
guards at the front desk.

1173
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,880
Knowing both of them and how
they interact with one another.

1174
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,740
I kind of made a in passing
comment to the tune of man,

1175
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:07,940
you guys in your handshakes
while obviously laughing,

1176
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,250
laughing while obviously
laughing at just choreographed.

1177
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,390
It was in more or less picturing
them in a studio or something.

1178
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:20,890
Working out the logistics to get the
fucking handshake. Perfect. Anyways,

1179
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:25,690
we all laughed and moved on and
we got our lunch. All right,

1180
01:14:25,691 --> 01:14:28,120
so nothing wrong yet.
So you're cool with these people.

1181
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,080
You made a joke and everybody laughed.
No problems,

1182
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:37,330
no problems so far. Um, however,
after coming back through secure,

1183
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,950
uh,
back through security,

1184
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:43,780
I noticed the security guard stopped
me and Kinda had a scowl on her face.

1185
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,700
I thought she was mad at me for something,

1186
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:50,701
but it turned out she was mad at this
other lady who was black because she

1187
01:14:51,671 --> 01:14:55,060
overheard my comment and was telling,
uh,

1188
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,440
that security guard that she couldn't
believe I had the nerve to say something

1189
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:04,360
like that and I should be ashamed
all to the point where she could,

1190
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:05,283
um,

1191
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:09,250
almost to the point where she could
actually go complain to the human resource

1192
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,050
people because she was
offended, um, et Cetera,

1193
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,400
without even considering that.

1194
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,960
Maybe just maybe I was talking about the
security guard and my coworker and not

1195
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:21,880
all black people now.

1196
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:26,080
It being corporate America in all I'm
sure rather than even face the pos

1197
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:27,940
possibility of any bad press,

1198
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:32,200
they'd rather just sweep me out the
door and completely ruined my re any

1199
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:36,730
reputation I may or may not hold at the
company just to save their own asses.

1200
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,560
I feel I did nothing wrong and they had
no intentions of ever doing anything

1201
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:42,640
wrong.
Anything wrong.

1202
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:46,660
I'm not going to go on and on about
how I kiss black babies and trying to

1203
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:49,300
rehabilitate inner city
schools because I don't,

1204
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,480
but I'm certainly not some corn fed rebel
flag waving ignorant product of what

1205
01:15:55,211 --> 01:15:56,380
might be incest.

1206
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:00,790
I guess my question is do we really have
to walk on eggshells when we are just

1207
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:05,791
making casual conversation that just
any that just any cunt can pick apart,

1208
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:12,790
select the context that they might think
it is in and then start crying foul.

1209
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:13,630
Basically.

1210
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:17,170
I would have liked to call that woman
a cunt and told her to go fuck herself,

1211
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:20,860
but let's just say I was already
kind of worried about my job.

1212
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:26,890
All right. See, um, yeah, I think this is,

1213
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,920
this is the classic one where you were
fucking around the other two people knew

1214
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:33,491
you were fucking round,

1215
01:16:33,491 --> 01:16:37,960
but then one person decides to get
offended and then you have to go on TV and

1216
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:38,651
apologize.

1217
01:16:38,651 --> 01:16:43,651
Which personally I think is the wrong
move because when you apologize now it's

1218
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:49,120
like you're, you're admitting
that you meant it in a bad
way. I mean, the apology,

1219
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:50,230
I would do that say, look, you know,

1220
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,810
I'm sorry that you didn't
understand that I was joking,

1221
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,420
but I'm not going to sit here
and apologize like I have any,

1222
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:00,250
any sort of ill will come in your way,
you know,

1223
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:05,020
but I, but just to avoid
the problem in the future,

1224
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,741
uh,

1225
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:10,370
white people do not use the
expression you guys or you people

1226
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:15,620
when talking about black people, that's
just it. It's just not going to, you're,

1227
01:17:15,621 --> 01:17:20,500
you're setting yourself up for
someone to get offended. And, um,

1228
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:25,890
there's a weird sort of a push
pull going on with that whole, uh,

1229
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,250
you guys and you people think where,
um,

1230
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:36,370
with somebody white says that
there becomes this concern of,

1231
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:41,540
um, that you're separating.
You're separating like, yeah,

1232
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:46,520
you know, you people over there with how
you live your lives and where over here,

1233
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,790
black people have that weird relationship
with white people where they're like,

1234
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:54,330
you know, can you stop stealing our
fucking music and our culture? Uh,

1235
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:59,320
but then like, if something,
you know, hey, let's pay
the streets, you know, well,

1236
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:02,000
make sure you do it in our neighborhood.
We're all in this together, right.

1237
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,300
All of us together.
You know what I mean?

1238
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:09,530
So it's that weird sort of fucking
push pull thing going on. So yeah,

1239
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:14,510
just avoid, uh, avoid the whole fucking,

1240
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:19,550
um, yeah, you fucked up.
You didn't fuck up, but you,

1241
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,790
you left yourself open for a
sucker punch by saying you guys,

1242
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,030
you know, uh, that's, I guess that, that's
what it is. I don't know. That's, that's,

1243
01:18:28,031 --> 01:18:32,530
that's my, I basically a white guy
telling a white guy how he fucked up.

1244
01:18:32,531 --> 01:18:36,910
So black people feel listening
to this. Think, uh, please,
please help me out here.

1245
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:39,400
Did I basically get it right?
Is that essentially at,

1246
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:43,660
and I know most people wouldn't
get offended. Uh, but that,

1247
01:18:43,661 --> 01:18:46,330
that's one of those things like that
girl getting offended and then you got to

1248
01:18:46,331 --> 01:18:47,740
worry that you're going to lose your job.

1249
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:52,890
It's like those fucking piggy back
horse who massage guys for a living.

1250
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,340
Okay.

1251
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:55,600
You know, some of those
myths, sutures date,

1252
01:18:55,630 --> 01:19:00,100
they'll actually come to your house and
give you a full body rubbed down with

1253
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:02,110
oil.
Okay.

1254
01:19:02,111 --> 01:19:06,520
And then have the fucking nerve to get
upset that you tried to get a hand job at

1255
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:10,470
the end of it. You know,
give me a fucking break.

1256
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:16,310
Why don't you fucking pursues broads man
the fuck up and start rubbing one out?

1257
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:20,520
Is it that God damn hard,
no pun intended.

1258
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,200
Is it that fucking difficult
to just fucking,

1259
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:29,750
you know, it's like your
revenue motorcycle. That's it.

1260
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:34,400
That's all you gotta do. Up and down,
up and down with that dead fucking oil.

1261
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:38,990
You in and out. You want that
house on the hill, sweetheart?

1262
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,790
There's a price to pay.
All right?

1263
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:46,210
And when a quarterback who owns
every fucking record, good and bad,

1264
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:49,610
and the Goddamn universe asked
you to rub one out, God damn it.

1265
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:50,710
You fucking rub one out.

1266
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:51,940
Okay,

1267
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,340
well maybe you don't blog in this
business sister. That's right.

1268
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,590
Stare at your fucking manicured toes.

1269
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,850
Pedicured whatever the fuck
you supposed to say. Um,

1270
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:04,030
Jesus Christ mean spirited. All right,
so there you go. That's the new,

1271
01:20:04,031 --> 01:20:07,830
that's the new topic. Is it
racist? And I would to hear,

1272
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:13,500
um, some honest comments from a non
white people about their thoughts.

1273
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:19,020
You know the fucked up ones too. Okay.

1274
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,490
Cause I've watched enough spike Lee movies
to think that evidently it's just us.

1275
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:27,180
But I've hung around enough people from
different races to realize, oh yeah,

1276
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:32,010
everybody's like this. Everybody
has their little fucked up thoughts.

1277
01:20:32,011 --> 01:20:34,860
You guys ever see that Broadway
play, they got that song. Everybody,

1278
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:38,790
everyone's a little bit racist.
What does that the alphabet city one,

1279
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:42,690
whenever the fuck it's called actually
enjoyed that actually went to a Broadway

1280
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:46,080
musical and there was puppets in it
and I had a great time. How about that?

1281
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:50,670
What does that say about me? Um,
all right, let's get on with advice.

1282
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,040
Advice for this week.
All right, advice. Spill.

1283
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:56,980
Let me set this one up for you cause it
gets a little complicated over there. Um,

1284
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:01,440
I went to a New Year's Eve party with
my best friend of 13 years. Oh Jesus.

1285
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:04,440
Oh by the way,
this guy uses so many fucking names.

1286
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:08,610
I'm just going to use the names. All
right. I know I don't name names,

1287
01:21:08,611 --> 01:21:09,480
but fuck this guy.

1288
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:12,780
There's like 15 fucking names and
then he goes back to the first name,

1289
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:17,040
back to the seventh name. So fuck it. I'm
naming names. All right, so here we go.

1290
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:21,990
I'm suspending that role much like
they suspended the salary cap and NFL

1291
01:21:21,991 --> 01:21:25,710
football this year. Same Way.
All right. All right, Bill.

1292
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:29,610
I went to a New Year's Eve party
with my best friend of 13 years mark.

1293
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:35,370
I got really drunk and hooked up
with my friend John's ex girlfriend,

1294
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:39,300
Anna.
John and Anna had dated for two years.

1295
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:44,510
John broke up with Anna back in September
rather harshly and immediately started

1296
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:49,460
banging other girls. Anna and
I also work together. Oh Gee.

1297
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:54,540
And we've become good friends. Here we
go. So hooking up seemed inevitable.

1298
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,200
Our friends have even joked about it.
Hey,

1299
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:03,120
if you guys like fucked each other yet,
you guys want to get wings.

1300
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,730
Um,
anyway,

1301
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:09,210
I had been dating this
girl Sarah since October.

1302
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:14,010
We never got too serious and we kind of
agreed to take a break when she left to

1303
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:15,960
go to London for spring semester.

1304
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:21,530
Mark's girlfriend who happened to be
a cunt is best friends with Sarah.

1305
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,240
All right. Are you like
me? Are you already lost?

1306
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,790
Are there too many fucking names here?
Let's go back to the beginning.

1307
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:29,670
Mark and I got really drunk.

1308
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:35,130
I went to a newsy part
of my best friend mark.

1309
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:38,160
I got really drunk and
hooked up with okay. Marks.

1310
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:40,920
His friend John has the ex girlfriend.
All right.

1311
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,540
It was like a fucking mini series they
had to show you clips from last week. Um,

1312
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,070
so anyways, he's taking some cut named
Sarah. They agreed to take a break

1313
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:56,220
and the girl you taking a break with
his best friends with your friend's

1314
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,160
girlfriend mark. Okay, I got it.
All right. I'm up to speed here.

1315
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:04,140
So at this party and an eye,
this is John's ex and,

1316
01:23:04,141 --> 01:23:06,600
and I get pretty drunk
and start making up.

1317
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:10,450
None of our friends were
there except for mark.

1318
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:16,110
Mark saw it and got upset you
fucking pussy and just had to leave.

1319
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:20,440
Oh my God.
Really?

1320
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,160
Like some 15 year old girl.
Exactly.

1321
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,330
Anna and I went to her place
and proceeded to do some stuff.

1322
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:34,280
We didn't bang that night, but oral sex
and whatnot was traded and we passed out.

1323
01:23:34,281 --> 01:23:37,700
We both agreed that nobody
needed to know what happened.

1324
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,870
I went to Mark's house later,

1325
01:23:40,871 --> 01:23:45,100
New Year's day and said nothing
happened with Anna and I,

1326
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:47,890
[inaudible] and I, and by
the way, we just made out.

1327
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,650
I figured that was enough for him to know,
not to tell anyone,

1328
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,750
especially his fucking girlfriend.

1329
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:57,160
Neither of US brought it up for the next
four days and it seemed like everything

1330
01:23:57,161 --> 01:24:01,720
was fine.
A couple of days passed out of nowhere.

1331
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:06,810
Mk asked me if I was going to tell
John that Anna and I made out.

1332
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,960
I was sort of taken aback
as you should have been

1333
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:16,180
sorta taken aback by the question,
but I told him I hadn't planned on it.

1334
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:21,520
He said he wouldn't tell John if I
didn't because he didn't want to be a bad

1335
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:22,810
friend. All right, good man.

1336
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,800
I told him that it wasn't a big deal
that we just made out and he was being a

1337
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:29,650
huge bitch.
That was a bad move on your part.

1338
01:24:29,651 --> 01:24:32,590
Even though he was being a huge bitch.
He shouldn't have said that. All right.

1339
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:37,270
Because he's acting like a fucking chick
right here and hell has no fury like a

1340
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:41,080
woman scorned and you just scored that
fucking bitch man right there. All right,

1341
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,080
so you can guess what the
fuck this is going. Okay.

1342
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:49,980
And then asked him if he
told his girlfriend about it
and of course he said yes.

1343
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,980
When I asked him why the fuck he did that,
he said,

1344
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:59,190
because I needed to know if I
should tell John Jesus Christ.

1345
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:02,980
I proceeded to column a bitch.

1346
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:07,420
Good man and let them know how much
of a bitch move it was to tell his

1347
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:11,620
girlfriend. Especially since he acted
like everything was fine for four days.

1348
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:15,760
Yeah, this guy is beyond a pussy. This
is the kind of guy who like, you know,

1349
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,430
does he like Bake Brownies?

1350
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:23,050
See One of those guys who like doesn't
mind going shopping with his fucking

1351
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:25,390
girlfriend. Yeah. That's funny
that I just said that. I actually,

1352
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,050
I'll bake brownies in a fucking second.
I'm such a fucking hypocrite. All right,

1353
01:25:29,051 --> 01:25:30,190
let's, let's finish this. All right.

1354
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:34,810
Nobody needed to know about what happened
and now he told his girlfriend, Sarah,

1355
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,990
uh Oh, this isn't my fault. Once
again, he fucked up to sentence.

1356
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,530
Nobody needs to know about what happened
and now he told his girlfriend Sara

1357
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:48,340
would definitely find out.
I knew Sarah wouldn't care about me.

1358
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:51,880
Drunkenly hooking up with Anna, but it's
still something she didn't need to know.

1359
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,950
Oh, Sarah is the fucking
Twat and went to Europe.

1360
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:58,120
Somehow I was able to leave mocks house
without beating the shit out of him.

1361
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:02,320
I called John who was spending winter
break in El Paso and told them what's,

1362
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:03,213
what happened.

1363
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:07,880
He said he didn't really give a shit and
agreed it was fucked up for mark to say

1364
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:10,940
anyone, anything to anyone,
especially as girlfriend.

1365
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:15,941
When I told mark he could have asked
anyone else about whether or not his bitch

1366
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:17,930
ass should tell John what happened.

1367
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:23,000
He said he asked his girlfriend so he
could get a serious opinion as if being

1368
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:26,240
told to keep your fucking mouth shut.
You little girl from either one of you,

1369
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:28,250
either one of our tenants.

1370
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:32,690
So close guy friends wouldn't have
been a serious enough opinion anyways,

1371
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:36,080
I just needed your validation of how
much of a bitch mark was about the whole

1372
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:37,010
thing.
Also,

1373
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:41,420
Anna and I decided to start
sneaking around and are
banging each other. No harm,

1374
01:26:41,421 --> 01:26:45,840
no foul.
Feel free to add on to the story of,

1375
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:48,770
I mean you read any podcast.
Yeah, Dude. Yeah, that's, yeah,

1376
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:53,540
that guy right there at that guy. You
need to cut out of the loop. Okay.

1377
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:56,870
That is, um, that's it. You,

1378
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,860
you forfeited your fucking guy card.
It's over.

1379
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:06,170
You can't be trusted. You think
like a woman, which is fine.

1380
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:09,110
There's nothing wrong with
thinking like a woman,

1381
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:13,430
but just go hang out with a
bunch of women now what a fucking

1382
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:20,420
do the amount of shit that has
gone down that I have fucking,

1383
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:22,940
I am so buried in me that
I don't even remember it.

1384
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,520
The amount of fucking shit

1385
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:33,020
is ridiculous and I don't even bring it
up when it's me and just the other dude

1386
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:38,150
who did the, the dirty shit.
I'll fucking bury it in a second.

1387
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:39,590
I know exactly how to do it.

1388
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,350
When I meet your fucking wife or
your girlfriend. I'll fuck yeah,

1389
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:48,440
fucking look you right in the eye. Hey
Sweetie, how are you? You look great.

1390
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:52,130
You've been going to the gym. That's
fantastic. I'll tell you your guy.

1391
01:27:52,131 --> 01:27:53,810
He's such a sweetheart.
God Damn it.

1392
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:56,330
The other day there was a cat stuck
in a tree. He's the first guy up.

1393
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,950
He didn't even wait for a letter.

1394
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:01,760
A just started climbing
up there when a swell guy,

1395
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:06,170
even if it's a dick,
even if it's a fucking Dick,

1396
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:08,690
what I'll then do is I'll
just avoid his girlfriend,

1397
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:10,430
but I'm not fucking bringing up dude.

1398
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:15,320
That guy really needs to go get
his fucking tubes tied. What a fag.

1399
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:17,260
All right.
Youtube,

1400
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:23,750
youtube videos of the week. You tobe. Um,

1401
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:26,840
all right.
This one is fucking absolutely insane.

1402
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,300
And if this was made by white people,

1403
01:28:29,301 --> 01:28:33,350
this would actually be considered racist
on some level, but it was actually made,

1404
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:37,640
I don't know if it's Japanese, Chinese
people, whatever the name of the video is,

1405
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:38,474
how to poop.

1406
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:46,370
And it is an animated cartoon
teaching children how to uh,

1407
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,380
go poopy in the toilet.

1408
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,560
And it is fucking insane.

1409
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,800
It's fucking insane.
It's great.

1410
01:28:55,430 --> 01:29:00,430
If you really have a problem in your life
that is just weighing on you and it's

1411
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:04,470
sucking the out of you and you just need
to clear every thought from your brain,

1412
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:06,330
please watch how to poop.

1413
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:09,080
Just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com
we've got all these videos, this,

1414
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:13,770
that's the official fence side of
the Monday morning podcast. Uh,

1415
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:18,870
just please go and watch this thing.
It's fucking awesome. We got really good,

1416
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:22,730
I got three really good youtube
videos this week. The next one is, uh,

1417
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:28,350
this guy made a federal reserve
music video that you have to see.

1418
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:33,000
It's a, he's doing basically
a song parody of the police's,

1419
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,180
a song. Every breath you
take, it's fucking great.

1420
01:29:36,181 --> 01:29:39,150
The guy actually has a really good voice.
This is fucking funny as hell.

1421
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:43,560
Now the great one. And
then the last one is, uh,

1422
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,920
it's just a highlight video of Jim Brown
and there's so many fans that say Jim

1423
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:54,420
Brown is overrated and he
couldn't play in today's NFL.

1424
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:57,480
You just look at this highlight reel,

1425
01:29:57,510 --> 01:30:02,490
the balance and the power
that this guy has is,

1426
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:07,410
it's unfucking. He, he's like
running sideways half the
time or running backwards,

1427
01:30:07,411 --> 01:30:11,790
just plowing over people. The
combination of balance of power is like,

1428
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:15,390
it's,
it's foreshadowing to Earl Campbell,

1429
01:30:15,391 --> 01:30:17,940
Earl Campbell's the only guy I've
seen with like runs like this.

1430
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:22,830
And for everyone who thinks Jim
Brown couldn't play, now you're,

1431
01:30:22,831 --> 01:30:26,490
you're 100% wrong and I know
what you're going to do.

1432
01:30:26,491 --> 01:30:29,340
Are you going to look at how tall he
was and how much he weighed and say he

1433
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:33,510
would get crushed in today's NFL?
That's the wrong way to look at it.

1434
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:36,450
If you took Jim Brown and you
put him in the modern era,

1435
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:41,670
which you have to do is also give them
all the modern trade, uh, nutrition,

1436
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:44,880
all the modern sports
science and all of that.

1437
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:49,740
So he would look like today's NFL
football with his, with his skills,

1438
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:52,710
his God given strength and balance.

1439
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:56,580
And he would fucking tear up the
goddamn league. Go Fuck Yourself.

1440
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:58,140
I don't want to hear another argument.

1441
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,480
I'm sick of people bringing
up fucking guys from,

1442
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:04,790
from nowadays where they're taking
fucking horse, tranquil tranquilizers.

1443
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:09,630
You could tell he would have dominated
in 1950 I would have dominated in 1950

1444
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:13,260
somebody 50 years from now
could dominate the NFL.

1445
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:16,410
Right fucking now beget
it's called advancement.

1446
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,830
Jesus fucking Christ.
Morons. Alright. Overrated.

1447
01:31:22,831 --> 01:31:25,170
Underrated for this week.
Overrated.

1448
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:30,200
Every minority and woman in commercials
playing the straight man to the dumb

1449
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:35,460
white guy. I'm not racist or
misogynistic in the least bit,

1450
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,630
but enough is enough. Uh,
dude, that's fucking hilarious.

1451
01:31:39,631 --> 01:31:41,910
And that's another thing that uh,

1452
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:44,820
that's not minorities a women's fault.

1453
01:31:44,821 --> 01:31:48,180
That's because of all the fucked up
shit white people have done and we don't

1454
01:31:48,181 --> 01:31:50,370
want to get sued.
That's why they're doing it.

1455
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:54,420
Not because they're trying to be
sensitive to other sexes or other races.

1456
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:58,140
They just make the white guy be the
stooge it all these fucking commercials

1457
01:31:58,141 --> 01:32:02,260
cause they don't want to get sued. But
yeah, it's starting to get annoying.

1458
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:06,410
There's always like the black guy
shaking his head as the fucking white guy

1459
01:32:06,411 --> 01:32:09,100
slamming himself in the face
with like a fucking rake.

1460
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:14,470
That's not the way you do it. Um,
that was actually a, a man woman one,

1461
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:17,560
remember that one with a woman's sit
there at the computer and that their

1462
01:32:17,561 --> 01:32:22,180
husband is outside fucking, he's
got to go. There's a beehive,

1463
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:26,830
any stake taking like a broom handle and
he's shoving it up the fucking beehive.

1464
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:30,340
And then he gets stung and she's
sitting there rolling her eyes like, ah,

1465
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:33,980
my husband, he's a fucking retard. Uh,

1466
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:38,830
and they do that between men and
women and race and the fucking, uh,

1467
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:43,240
the white dude always has to be the moron.
But I mean, you know, it is what it is,

1468
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:47,860
but you know, you should be happy
white person who wrote that,

1469
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:52,330
that they had that. That's the
way they balance it out. You know,

1470
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,900
you're still winning, so quit
your fucking crying. All right.

1471
01:32:55,930 --> 01:33:00,930
Also overrated in real life and not what
I see on TV is the female carpenter or

1472
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:05,110
construction worker I get,

1473
01:33:05,111 --> 01:33:10,111
I get that you've got to make up and
try harder for all the bullshit you deal

1474
01:33:10,421 --> 01:33:14,260
with. For Fuck's sake. Crack
a smile for once in your life.

1475
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:16,150
I really don't know what
he's bitching about.

1476
01:33:16,151 --> 01:33:20,650
Their female construction workers
don't smile enough. Um, alright.

1477
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,970
Underrated the PJ's Eddie Murphy was
brilliant and the claymation was the shit

1478
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:27,160
back in the day.
Why the fuck don't,

1479
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:31,990
why the fuck that show isn't on
DVD is a crime to all comedy.

1480
01:33:31,991 --> 01:33:36,991
One of the few shows that is actually
better with closed caption on a number two

1481
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:39,070
real musicians.

1482
01:33:39,130 --> 01:33:43,360
Anybody remember these people that
naturally play actually play their

1483
01:33:43,361 --> 01:33:46,110
instruments and none of
that fucking auto tuners,

1484
01:33:46,111 --> 01:33:50,890
sampling machine and turntables,
all of those are not fucking instruments.

1485
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:55,450
Um, well I mean, you know,

1486
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:57,820
I've actually come to a place where I can,

1487
01:33:57,821 --> 01:34:01,450
I can understand the brilliance
of being able to take pieces of,

1488
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:06,190
so I think the way that the Beastie
boys did it on Paul's Boutique where you

1489
01:34:06,191 --> 01:34:09,970
took like 10 or 12 different samples,

1490
01:34:09,971 --> 01:34:13,240
looped them together and
created a new song. I mean,

1491
01:34:13,241 --> 01:34:18,190
there is there that is a
talent, you know, turntables,

1492
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:21,040
that's just, I don't get that shit. That's
just, I don't, I don't understand that.

1493
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,920
Um, I'm too fucking old to get that
and I don't get, I don't get mashups.

1494
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,510
I bitched about that before.

1495
01:34:28,511 --> 01:34:32,530
Mashups are the emperor's
new clothes of music.

1496
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:38,200
Okay. All you have to do is pick
two songs that are the same temple.

1497
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,660
Okay.
Same beats per minute.

1498
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:44,710
Then the lyrics will
fit on that other one.

1499
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:49,370
Then all you have to do is just one that
where the lyrics fit the mood of the,

1500
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,410
the new music you're putting it over.
That's not that fucking difficult.

1501
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:56,080
If he got sad sorta music,

1502
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:01,160
pick another sad fucking song and just
stick that music under those sad lyrics.

1503
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:05,360
As long as the tempo was the same.
Yeah, it's going to work out.

1504
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:11,810
Dude. He took jingle bells and blended
it with Santa Claus is coming to town.

1505
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:13,983
MMM.

1506
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,100
What else do we got?
A road trip.

1507
01:35:17,101 --> 01:35:20,460
Road trips with your fucking bug
buddies never gets old. That's,

1508
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,270
that's absolutely true. That's why the
hangover was such a great fucking movie.

1509
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:26,370
A real lemonade.

1510
01:35:26,371 --> 01:35:31,320
Not that coke and Pepsi package garbage
but real shit with fucking pulp and

1511
01:35:31,321 --> 01:35:34,950
flavor. I like this guy. This
guy's into old shit. You know.

1512
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,330
A pen and paper,
not this fucking laptop horse shit.

1513
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:44,700
I don't remember my laptop ever crash and
I've actually said that. Um, all right,

1514
01:35:44,701 --> 01:35:46,950
that's it. That's the podcast
for this week. Everybody.

1515
01:35:46,951 --> 01:35:50,430
I hope you had a great
week. Um, and once again,

1516
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,070
good forward to the uh,

1517
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:56,510
the Steelers Greenbay
championships and do me a favor,

1518
01:35:56,511 --> 01:35:58,490
bring up all Green Bay's NFL titles.

1519
01:35:58,491 --> 01:36:02,300
I would really like to try to start an
underground debate about that because I

1520
01:36:02,301 --> 01:36:07,301
want them to start counting NFL titles
and I want to see NFL franchises fly

1521
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:11,720
those NFL championship
flags. You want it, you know,

1522
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:16,220
I didn't think the AFL one should fly
those flags. It's part of the history.

1523
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:20,630
If you're a fucking nerd like me,
I like that type of shit.

1524
01:36:20,631 --> 01:36:23,900
I'm actually reading a book
right now called the greatest
game by Richard Bailey.

1525
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:27,830
Uh,
somebody gave me this book and uh,

1526
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,930
it's actually about
the Bucky Dent Red Sox,

1527
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,490
that one one day play off game.
And you know,

1528
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:37,740
that's a great thing about the red
sox finally winning a world series and

1529
01:36:37,741 --> 01:36:38,574
they're wedding.
Another one.

1530
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:42,790
I can actually sit back and
read this book and it is a,

1531
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:44,140
okay.

1532
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:48,490
It's a fucking great read to great read.
I recommend it. All right. That's it.

1533
01:36:48,491 --> 01:36:51,040
That's a podcast for this week.
Everybody have a great week.

1534
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:56,080
I'm at the Improv and Addison,
Addison, Texas this week. And,

1535
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:57,160
um,

1536
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:58,560
okay.

1537
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:03,180
What else do I got coming up? Let's go
on my website. Uh, hang on one second.

1538
01:37:03,181 --> 01:37:07,620
Come on guys. Hagen that don't shut it
off just yet. Don't shut it off just yet.

1539
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:12,360
All right. Um, then I'm going to be at
the count Basie theater in Red Bank,

1540
01:37:12,361 --> 01:37:14,820
New Jersey on February 18th,

1541
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:17,790
and I'm going to be at the new

1542
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:19,720
okay.

1543
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:24,720
Of Jesus Christ to Tarrytown
musical on the 17th of February,

1544
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:29,410
Miami beach. We have a new theater.
Um, they had me booked in another one,

1545
01:37:29,411 --> 01:37:31,960
but they had already booked another
act there, so they had to switch it up.

1546
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:37,150
I'm actually going to be at the new World
Symphony Theater, uh, on 17th Street,

1547
01:37:37,151 --> 01:37:41,260
Miami Beach, Florida, or
the, the 4th of March,

1548
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:44,180
the tower theater in Philadelphia.
Look,

1549
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:45,760
I got a bunch of new dates on the website,

1550
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:50,920
tower theater in Philadelphia
on April 9th. And,

1551
01:37:50,921 --> 01:37:54,480
um,
this is the last one here.

1552
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:59,070
I'm going to be at the paps. Fuck
Jesus Christ, the linkedin work.

1553
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:03,840
I would be at the, you know, I was having
such a great podcast too. On April 22nd,

1554
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:08,670
I'm going to be at the PAPP's
theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Um,

1555
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:09,900
and right off the bat,
I just want to tell you,

1556
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:13,100
I'm blown away about how many
tickets sold the first day. Uh,

1557
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:17,400
Milwaukee was one of those cities where
I was like, you know, I dunno. I Dunno.

1558
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:22,830
I Dunno if I'm gonna sell tickets
there. You know, it's not like New York.

1559
01:38:22,831 --> 01:38:27,750
It's not Chicago, it's not La, you know,
so it's not one of those kinds of cities,

1560
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:32,130
but I don't, it doesn't strike me
as a gator dad kind of city either.

1561
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:34,000
It's one of those middle ground once.

1562
01:38:34,001 --> 01:38:35,670
So I don't know where the
fuck I'm going to fit in it.

1563
01:38:35,671 --> 01:38:39,540
So I want to thank everybody in Wisconsin
who went out and bought tickets.

1564
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:40,883
MMM.

1565
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:43,510
Especially, Oh, you know what?

1566
01:38:43,511 --> 01:38:47,950
Somebody sent me a fucking email if I
can just from Escanaba Michigan saying

1567
01:38:47,951 --> 01:38:51,010
they were coming all the way down
because they remembered back in the day.

1568
01:38:51,011 --> 01:38:55,690
I played a college up there and the upper
peninsula of Michigan and they said,

1569
01:38:55,691 --> 01:38:56,580
um,

1570
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:02,700
I went up in front of 17 people in
a cafeteria and evidently I killed.

1571
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,640
So the fact that actually put
on a show in front of 17 people,

1572
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:11,380
see how it see all that new comedians.
If you're listening to this podcast,

1573
01:39:11,381 --> 01:39:14,830
those fucking shows matter.
Years later,

1574
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:20,490
they'll actually show up if you give
him hell in front of 11 people doing a

1575
01:39:20,801 --> 01:39:24,190
nooner or the upper peninsula, Michigan.
I actually fucking remember that Gig.

1576
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:27,450
I did a couple of gigs up there though.

1577
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,500
That's an amazing group of
people who live up there.

1578
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:33,130
I like how they embrace winter.
They really have no choice,

1579
01:39:33,131 --> 01:39:38,080
but they actually get real fucking a
snow storms. You know where you come out,

1580
01:39:38,081 --> 01:39:40,150
you open your door,
you know,

1581
01:39:40,151 --> 01:39:43,090
and you get buried by like
nine feet of fucking snow.

1582
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:46,810
You walking down the street on your
snow shoes and you're stepping over like

1583
01:39:46,811 --> 01:39:51,310
frozen elk, right? You know, and
they just stay. Just stay. Embrace it

1584
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,610
as opposed to all the pussies down here.

1585
01:39:54,611 --> 01:39:56,300
Every time there's four
inch is a fucking snore.

1586
01:39:56,301 --> 01:39:59,770
Every god damn fatty is running down
to the fucking supermarket like they're

1587
01:39:59,771 --> 01:40:03,580
going to starve to death.
I just want one news guy.

1588
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:08,590
During all that insanity,
we're going to get six to eight inches.

1589
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:09,911
It's like,

1590
01:40:09,911 --> 01:40:14,410
do you realize six to eight inches of
snow it that would barely reach the

1591
01:40:14,411 --> 01:40:19,411
average person's up to their cath and
considering you can last about 35 days

1592
01:40:20,621 --> 01:40:24,880
without food as long he had, as
long as you have water. Okay?

1593
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:28,810
And Snow is water. Stick it in your
mouth. See what happens. All right,

1594
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:33,250
you've gotta be fucking fine.
All right, so sit tight.

1595
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:34,613
Okay.

1596
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:39,230
All right. Their sport. That's
what I wanted to say. I want to,

1597
01:40:39,231 --> 01:40:42,600
I want them to just fucking sit there
and watch the weatherman losing his

1598
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:43,434
fucking mind.

1599
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:48,650
All excited that he's the focus this
week on the God damn fucking newscast,

1600
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:52,230
right? Well that night of the newscast
and then when they go back to the anchor,

1601
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,570
who's fucking the co-anchor cause
he's the god Damn Alpha male.

1602
01:40:55,810 --> 01:41:00,810
I want them to dress down that
fucking that goddamn a weatherman.

1603
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:07,060
Four inches of snow. Jesus Christ.
I could stick my dick in that.

1604
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:11,410
You could still see the shaft. The fuck
are you talking about? Go Fuck Yourself.

1605
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:12,840
All right, that's it. That's a park

1606
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:15,930
cast for this week. You guys have a
great weekend. Yeah, go fuck yourselves.

1607
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:17,940
Don't take any shit.
