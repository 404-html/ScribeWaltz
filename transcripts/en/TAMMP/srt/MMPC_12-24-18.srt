1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,440
Hey,

2
00:00:01,441 --> 00:00:06,441
It's Bill Burger and it's time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,190
December 24th,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,190
2018 oh it's the most
wonderful time of the year.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,900
You went to your last fucking Christmas
party and you stopped your fat face and

6
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,821
now your wife is going to drag you
to midnight mass God for fucking bid.

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,880
You like me? God for fucking
bid. You just stay home one day,

8
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:43,050
24 hours.
Just fucking stay awake up.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,940
You get fucking go down and get some
breakfast. You scratch your balls, right?

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,810
Then you Mosey on into
the fucking living room.

11
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:57,811
You turn on the heat
10 and build the right.

12
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,720
Nice toasty fucking house
God for fucking bid.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,200
Okay.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,200
God forbid you laze about two when fuck
off as they say across the fucking way

15
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,040
they're right God for fucking pit now.

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,110
There's always has to be some fucking
social event you have to go to.

17
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,380
It's unfucking believable. I'm literally
telling her go and like listen to,

18
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,040
this is my time off.
This is,

19
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,070
this is my time off and then it's
just getting immediately January,

20
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,350
second, third, whatever the
fuck it is. I'm on a plane.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,070
The fly to the other side of the fucking
world to essentially do two shows a

22
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:40,100
night for 10 straight fucking
day. So freckles here. Hey,

23
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:44,420
no spring chicken anymore.
Can I fucking just,

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,430
just can I just stay
here for fucking one day,

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,740
one fucking tank fucking
at one fucking day.

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,770
I thought it would be nice.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,470
Yeah.

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,770
You know what it is due at the end
of the day. They don't give a fuck.

29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,280
And if they're not slowly killing you,
you're not still married.

30
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,210
That's what it is.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,260
And all these broads out there bitch
moaning and complaining specifically the

32
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:11,000
white ladies about how difficult it is.
You know the number one stat,

33
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,250
how long you live.
You went in that one.

34
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:17,330
So go fuck yourself
with your fucking being,

35
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:22,040
counting whatever the hell they're doing
and show some ridiculous tweet there.

36
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,480
The other day they were talking about the
top 10 fucking gross and comedians and

37
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:30,020
this other comedian rights,
all male. And it's just like,

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,090
how is that guys fault?

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,500
How the fuck are you going to put that on
guys? You know, if you look at a census,

40
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,300
there's more women than there are guys.
So I mean, I don't know what to tell Ya.

41
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,590
I just don't know what to fucking tell
you. You know, write a better act.

42
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,170
You know,
ladies,

43
00:02:55,171 --> 00:03:00,171
get out there and go see some female
comics supported better than you support

44
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,590
the wn Ba.
You know what I mean?

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,860
Fucking sitting there
yelling at us all the time.

46
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,180
You guys are not exactly team
players out there. Yeah. All right,

47
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,770
so why don't you look in your holiday
mirror? Takeoff is stupid antlers. Jesus.

48
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,410
What the fuck? It's just,
everything is just become that.

49
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,600
Why does it this like wide switch work?
A white male?

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,613
Yeah.

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,260
Um,
anyways,

52
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,810
this is the boohoo
generation. Um, anyways,

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,550
happy holidays, everybody. I thought
I would, this was guy was like, man,

54
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,390
this is fucking new you. This is
Christmas Eve. I don't have shit to do.

55
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,350
And there's just,
there's just always going to be something.

56
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,570
Just every fucking gets like,
how was there always something?

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,630
Even God,

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,950
every fucking six days he had one
fucking day or he didn't do shit and he

59
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:57,420
created the universe.

60
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,870
I'm a fucking aunt.
Oh No.

61
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,260
On a fucking the a universe
on top of a fucking pin,

62
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:09,070
whatever those fucking potheads say.

63
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,933
Okay,

64
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,820
there's a line I'm going to use to my
wife. Just out of curiosity, how do,

65
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,400
how am I working harder than the creator?

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,670
The creator of the universe gets
more days off a year than I do.

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,530
How the fuck does that work?
I think you're being a little dramatic.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,750
I don't think I am.
Take out a calendar.

69
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,403
Okay.

70
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,650
Oh boy. This is what I do now. I
just, I just go out to the garage.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,310
It's soundproof now cause it
got my drum kit hair and I just,

72
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:49,270
I lose my shit and then I come out and
I just fucking put a smile on my face.

73
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,790
Like fucking chuck Woolery.
That's what I do.

74
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,560
And I laugh and I rubbed my brow like,
Oh God, you're killing me though. That's,

75
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,730
that's fucking incredible.

76
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,580
Okay.

77
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,290
You know what I want. You don't
want, I want in the new year,

78
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,790
I want one day off a week. Okay. If God
needs a fucking one day, I should have to,

79
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,420
maybe that's why we only work
a five day work week, right?

80
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,360
Yeah.

81
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,110
Visit. We only took one day off. Then we
would say that we were on God's level.

82
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,130
Do you realize the amount of days off
that I don't have puts me that I'm

83
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:27,101
actually working harder than God and a
couple of hundred years ago or 26 years

84
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,950
ago in the south,
I would actually be killed for this.

85
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,890
What I would be doing was B could be
considered sack religious that I was

86
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:39,350
putting myself on a higher plane,

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,090
that I could actually sit down with God
and be like, Oh, what'd you do? Oh yeah.

88
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,260
Well that's pretty impressive there
a almighty maker of everything,

89
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,550
but let me ask you this.

90
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,120
What's that big goose egg on
on day number seven on Sunday.

91
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:57,460
What were you doing then?
Ah, yeah. You put your big
fucking creative feed up then.

92
00:05:57,461 --> 00:05:58,294
Yeah.

93
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:58,760
Yeah.

94
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,000
You got your holy Hammock over there.
It didn't check. Well, guess what?

95
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:02,834
I kept going,

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,630
oh
look what happened to your creation.

97
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:11,851
You know,

98
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:15,090
you think if God could come down and
he'd have enough time to fucking bang a

99
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:15,751
virgin,
you know,

100
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,870
he could maybe fucking yell down my
chimney every once in a while and be like,

101
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:23,310
hey, hey sweetheart, ease
up. You know, ease up on it.

102
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:25,740
Maybe they could do that to all the
fucking married women out there.

103
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:28,440
How about you guys? How about you do
that in the fucking New Year, ladies?

104
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,560
I know we have all this
fucking work to do. God knows.

105
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:36,561
I've seen enough award shows this year
of women giving me lectures on how to be

106
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:38,700
a fucking man.
How funny is that?

107
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,330
Well, I get very good man, but you're a
bad man in the bad man. Shit did good.

108
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,560
Shut the fuck up and get your trophy.

109
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,930
Jesus fucking Christ the fucking lectures
and all these fucking guys with their

110
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:56,810
balls tucked behind there. PNID exercise
just sitting there in the crowd.

111
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,230
That Tuxedo. I don't want to
get in trouble. I'm telling you,

112
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,200
somebody's got to do it out here in
Hollywood. What are these award shows?

113
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,590
Somebody has to throw a dinner
roll. Just has to happen. I mean,

114
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:11,300
if it's happened to me, I
why? I mean equal rights.
Oh, righto. Ready? All right.

115
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,070
Anyways, you wouldn't know
this, but I was actually,

116
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:20,330
I was actually in a good mood 10 minutes
ago until I realized there was yet

117
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:24,560
another fucking thing. I got everything
done. Okay. The fucking trees decorated.

118
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,680
The fucking lights are up.
All the gifts are wrapped.

119
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,150
The last fucking gift that I was
getting my wife to the Cherry on top.

120
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,160
The Cherry Cherry on top.
All right.

121
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,760
You know, I just fucking, I, I, well,
let me just finish that thought.

122
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,840
I finally got that gift. I have
it. There it is. Here it is.

123
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,000
This is what you made to me.
All right.

124
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,990
Now can I have a 24 hour period period,

125
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,450
but I just stay in the house.

126
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,270
Okay.

127
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,240
I stay in the house.

128
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,220
Nobody's coming over.
Nobody's fixing anything.

129
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:07,950
I don't have to get in the car and
go down and go fucking get something.

130
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,720
I stay right here.
I don't read.

131
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,850
I watch TV. I fucking relax. I put,

132
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,760
I put,
I put my feet up

133
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,570
and for one day

134
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,380
I'm treated like a king is as a,
is that asking too much?

135
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,110
This is like one of those stupid topics.
So one of those fucking lady shows,

136
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,920
ladies, do we need to treat our
men like kings occasionally.

137
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,760
Yeah.

138
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,540
I'm not saying you're not a
queen and that saved the deputy.

139
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,870
Um, anyways, what are you
guys doing for Christmas?

140
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,530
I'm still in know this is my last podcast
holding my headphone Jack here. Like,

141
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,870
like a terrorist.
You don't want my thumb over the top.

142
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,813
MMM.

143
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,210
And uh, I dunno. Then I
guess my life gets easier.

144
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm really playing the victim on
all this. I should just be like, no,

145
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:17,330
I'm not doing that. And
you know, it's funny.

146
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,500
My wife would have no problem with it.
So what does that go back to now?

147
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,410
Of course, back to the childhood.
That's what it goes back to.

148
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,250
I grew up with the sit
down and shut the fuck up.

149
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,570
Okay.

150
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,960
We had that carved into wood
and hung up on the wall.

151
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,670
Sit down and shut the fuck up.
But now I get it. Now I get it.

152
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,631
You gotta get,

153
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:47,100
you gotta get married and you have to have
a kid to truly understand your father.

154
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,200
Then you get it. It's like,
oh, I totally get them. No,

155
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,570
I totally get the guy I
know. Just coming home. What?

156
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,050
I don't know. Just Ah, get outta here.

157
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,283
Yeah.

158
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,203
MMM.

159
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,240
Anyway, speaking of broad,
Jessica Curson, everybody,

160
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,003
you know,

161
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,240
you want to talk about somebody who
you ladies should be out there fucking

162
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,190
supporting.

163
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,510
So there's not more people whining about
the tour money that people are getting

164
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:25,830
honestly out there. Um, Jessica Carson,

165
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,180
man or woman,

166
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,950
this is one of the fucking
funniest comedians out there
for a long fucking time.

167
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,420
All things comedy.

168
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:38,421
We're doing a special with our taping
January 11th at the highline ballroom in

169
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:42,520
New York City. I'm so
excited for this, uh,

170
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,860
telling you you watch or we're doing an
all things Cardi. Paul Versey special,

171
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:50,250
by the way,
streaming again on comedy central.

172
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:54,120
It's broken all their records
for streaming online and
it was named one of the

173
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:59,121
top 10 specials on Interrobang Bang of
2018 that's a congratulations to the

174
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:05,460
pride at Trenton, New Jersey,
Paul Versey. Uh, and then we got,

175
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,840
we got Ian Edwards coming out. We get
Jessica cursor with the, until we got,

176
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm telling you, telling
you, uh, we got some fucking,

177
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,230
we got some, we got some, we got
some good specials coming up. Um,

178
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,820
in 2019. Can you believe
that's the end of this decade?

179
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,450
These last two decades have flown by
because they haven't really named him.

180
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,390
You know, where was the 60s? It was the
70s. It was the 80s. It was the 90s.

181
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:34,360
And then it was just nothing. It was
all about, oh my God. Y Two K is, is,

182
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,630
is my fucking flip
phone not going to work.

183
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,720
How will my refrigerator work
at one second past 12:00 AM?

184
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,173
Huh?

185
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,081
We'll uh,

186
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:51,430
we're gonna party like it's 1999
still be playing on my stereo.

187
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,630
That's what we worried about.

188
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,890
And then all of a sudden
nothing really fucking happened.

189
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,080
There was no arm. Again, I think
a couple people's like little, uh,

190
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:02,690
well,

191
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,540
those little handheld things with the
stylist that everybody loved to have him

192
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,660
back in the, I think a few of those
crashed, but everything else was fine.

193
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,940
Everything else was fine
and we were so relieved.

194
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,330
Okay,

195
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,250
dad. Uh, we never named the decade
and we just started invaded people.

196
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,290
Yeah.

197
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,710
I Dunno what Trump is doing right now,
but I love bringing troops back.

198
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,190
I'm all for that. You know,
considering all these fucking wars,

199
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:31,940
if effectively bankrupted this
company, company, this country. Well,

200
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:34,970
it's just a big corporation now, isn't
it? Yeah. We're gonna bring 'em all back.

201
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,070
Bring them all back. Legalize
weed, put up some solar panels,

202
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:44,720
put the Middle East dot of business.
Export the fucking we'd get everybody.

203
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:48,960
Hi Right. Pay off the debt.
Everybody thinks what? Shell again.

204
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,550
Okay.

205
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,140
That's what I would do.
All right?

206
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,380
In any country that still
has a problem with us.

207
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,850
We'll send up some free tee shirts,
couple of sex dolls, and it'll be all,

208
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,140
but whatever the fucking Trump did.

209
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:03,480
But that fucking fatty
over there in North Korea,

210
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,680
whatever the fuck he did with them,
they went over there, they sat down,

211
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,090
you know, they had some Jalapeno
poppers, right? He got hurt. He got,

212
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,250
he brought over a couple
of fucking blonde hair,

213
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,670
blue eyed who was okay.

214
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,920
They gave him the old sweet
and sour chicken there.

215
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,830
That's a hooker move. Um, anyways,

216
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,210
I don't know what to tell you.

217
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:33,500
I don't know what's going on in the world
of politics. Adult pretend to paint,

218
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,630
touch it. I just, you know, uh,

219
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,520
I'm a man of the people who doesn't
want to see the people. That's who I am.

220
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,340
I'm the man of people who just wants
to stay at home and his fucking house.

221
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,590
All right. That's all I want to do.
Do you know I like the regular people.

222
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:54,540
I like the regular guy in any country
just walking down the street and he's

223
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,940
excited because he has that
little moment to himself. Hey,

224
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,710
maybe I'll go into the pub here.

225
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,510
Have a quick little fucking
beer and a shot. All right?

226
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,440
Come on with this stupid look on my face.
My wife's talking to me.

227
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm not listening.
I'll just kiss her on the forehead.

228
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,920
Pinch your cheek and face
plant under the couch.

229
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:17,130
Anybody who's doing that in any
culture, any race, any continent,

230
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,180
you're all right with me. I really
isn't that what most people are doing?

231
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,060
I'm most people you know
you've got a family. You just
want to fucking feel okay.

232
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,003
You know?

233
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,120
You know it'd be great if all the people
of the world just looked at the world

234
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:33,570
leaders and just said, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, relax,

235
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,050
relax,
settle down.

236
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,120
Everything's going to be fine. Okay.
You get when you're in a palace,

237
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,800
you were in a big White House. Okay?
Everything's fine. You have plenty.

238
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,580
You have your own jet.
Okay, fucking relax.

239
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,090
If you buddy, take it down a few, right?

240
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,430
Well that'd be nice if he could
just get everybody on the same page,

241
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:58,161
but you can't.
You can't.

242
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:01,450
You put up a fucking youtube video without
everybody's screaming and yelling at

243
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:03,890
each other.
Um,

244
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,350
I missed most of that Kansas City,
Seattle Seahawks game,

245
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,370
but I'm going to talk
about it nonetheless. All
right, I'll tie right down.

246
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,700
I would be a good start if I was a fan
of these kids are city chiefs from Kansas

247
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,570
City,
Missouri.

248
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,610
Okay.

249
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,010
That Kansas City, Kansas,
Kansas City, Missouri.

250
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,020
I would be very concerned.
Okay.

251
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:31,270
Cause Andy Reid is a great coach,

252
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,730
but when he goes up against
other great coaches,

253
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,090
he's got to come out of there with a win.

254
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,330
Andy Reid up against, so sneaky
Pete Carroll. Oh pistol Pete boom.

255
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,550
Out of USC. Right as the wolf was
at the door, ran out the back door.

256
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,780
Right up to Seattle.

257
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,680
Oh

258
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,930
sneaky Pete.
Do you know Pete Carroll?

259
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,700
How good that Guy Looks? You know he's
a year older than bill Bellacheck.

260
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,010
You wouldn't know
be Carol.

261
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:08,600
Looks like he's about 55.
The man's pushing 70.

262
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,130
Okay,

263
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,310
great shape. Full head of hair. You know,

264
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,700
not a line on his face.

265
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,470
Yeah.

266
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,260
Across the way.
You got Andy Reid,

267
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,190
the every man cause like he
drives a fucking snow plow.

268
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,080
Okay.

269
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,430
You know when you just knew,

270
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,020
you just knew Pete Carroll was going
to figure out a way to get it though.

271
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,860
You know what? Everybody is
slipping out about Patrick Mahoney.

272
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,610
You forgetting about Russell Wilson.
You know,

273
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:38,500
you just taking the guy
for fucking granted.

274
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,100
I would say that the Seattle
Seahawks or the seven seven and one,

275
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,280
whatever the fuck they record his dad
there, that team, nobody wants to play

276
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,760
a Jesus.

277
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,540
Who the fuck is that know I
know who the fuck that is.

278
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,410
I don't know some somebody over in Asia,

279
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:58,270
I've got my fucking cell
phone number and every day,

280
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,100
you know I don't pick it up.

281
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,400
And then I listened to the voicemail and
I hear this lady's voice just going now

282
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:08,900
your car man,
you got the bag for one 805 a pop up papa,

283
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:12,250
papa up like some sort of fucking,
I dunno what it is for,

284
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,970
but no idea. Maybe it's, it's Kim Jong,

285
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,720
US fucking secretary and the second
may making fun of him on the podcast.

286
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:22,870
What would you do with that guy called
in? You know, fucking scared. I would be,

287
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,570
even though he's in the other and then
the whole other fucking part of the world

288
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,810
to have a dictator call you up.

289
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,420
I think about the first syllable. That
word Dick, right? Telling me right now,

290
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,590
there's a reason why that guy's a dick.
Maybe that came from dictator. Did it?

291
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:44,450
Should I look that up? Would
that interest you? Um, anyways,

292
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,570
I missed most of that game, but
she just, you just fucking do.

293
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,660
You knew Pete Carroll wasn't going to
sit around and get his fucking ass fired

294
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,260
in Seattle.
No matter how many people he lost.

295
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,690
And I gotta commend that
owner for sticking with them.

296
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,320
They know what they got up there. Pete
Carroll's he's going to coach for like,

297
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,940
what do you think?
Another 10 years,

298
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,620
he's obviously hitting the elliptical
every day is eating the steam vegetables.

299
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,700
The guy's a beast.

300
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,360
What do you guys put him in
the coaching? Um, history.

301
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,850
I mean like you got to put them
in. I know he's got one. Oh,

302
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:23,190
we needed that second one. Oh. Oh, we
need to, you need that second ring,

303
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,490
you know, to get in the
conversation. Um, anyways,

304
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:30,181
you know something else.

305
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:34,350
I'm getting sick of this fucking Miami
dolphins every fucking year with this

306
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:39,351
undefeated thing in the 72 dolphins
still go on hit 1970 fucking toe.

307
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,350
Okay.

308
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,350
What are we going to quit glorify in that
they went undefeated in 1972 with two

309
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:53,650
white running backs so fucking long ago.
That was Jesus Christ.

310
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,830
1972 they barely invented the Frisbee.

311
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,150
The frisbee was like a decade old
and you haven't done shit since then.

312
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,080
Sort of the dolphins fans talking
shit about that. That's literally,

313
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:09,090
it would be like listening to them.
A Knicks fan or they,

314
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,430
that'd be ridiculous if they,
if they've started talking some shit they,

315
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:16,330
they have, I wanted since 73
they got a fucking year on you.

316
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,400
Um, anyways. Uh,

317
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,430
okay.

318
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,790
I don't think my patriots, I
don't know man. I don't know.

319
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,870
And then that dude we got from the Brown's
poor guy relapsed and now do you know,

320
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:32,250
you just hope he goes and he gets

321
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:33,820
okay.

322
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,220
You know, self taking care of their, um,
I hope they don't suspend them for good.

323
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,030
I'm hoping that guy has a full recovery
comes back and fucking has the career he

324
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,400
should have had.
But uh,

325
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,840
okay.

326
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,780
I Dunno. I Dunno. I'm looking at the
Patriots now that we have home field.

327
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:53,770
I figure we can win one.
I don't know about another one,

328
00:19:53,771 --> 00:19:57,120
but you never know with Tom Brady
and bill Bellacheck. But uh,

329
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,080
if we're not going to win,

330
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,760
I want us to lose in the first round so
I could enjoy all these other teams that

331
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:08,680
I really want to see do. Well. I would
love to see Kansas city or a San Diego.

332
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,080
How about the Cleveland Browns?
How great would it see it?

333
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,200
Can they make the playoffs?
Like I said, I got the kid now,

334
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:17,650
so I watch as much as I can.
Um,

335
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,660
I saw Baker Mayfield staring
down his old fucking coach.

336
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,870
Bit of a classless fucking move,
you know,

337
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:28,260
to be in the prime of your physical life,
to be staring down somebody.

338
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,250
It looks like they take Geritol.
Um,

339
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,030
but you also got to love somebody dead.

340
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:39,090
Plays for the browns at the quarterback
position. Having a little bit of swagger.

341
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,600
Okay.

342
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,433
Um,

343
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,670
seeing happy Brown fans
see Brown fans with hope.

344
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,890
Okay.

345
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,723
You know

346
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,220
that late in the game. I mean, I haven't
seen that. I want to say since the 1980s

347
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,643
mmm.

348
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,490
When they played in municipal stadium,
so that's great to see.

349
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,450
I love seeing the Texans doing well
even though they lost to the eagles.

350
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:06,720
That was weird yesterday
having to root for the eagles.

351
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:09,090
I can't remember last time I was in a
position where it had to root for the

352
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:09,924
eagles.

353
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,820
I got to feel what it felt like to be
a fucking eagles fan yesterday. Uh,

354
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:18,690
no thanks. I'll pass on that fucking
cons. Can you just put somebody away?

355
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,063
MMM.

356
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,390
What else did I see?
And I think that was it.

357
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:25,830
I saw a little bit of that Steelers game.

358
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:29,100
I watched a little bit of the Bruins
play in the Hartford way. Liz,

359
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,780
did we lose that game by the way? We were
up like two to one and then, you know,

360
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,400
my kid woke up from her nap

361
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,270
Brolin's verse hurricanes.

362
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,240
Okay.

363
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,640
We lose that game. Ah, fuck me.

364
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,053
Yeah.

365
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,120
Oh,
we got smoked.

366
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,690
Okay.

367
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,600
And the second period,
three goals to one,

368
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,650
so that put them up four to three
and then they scored another one.

369
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,290
A you sons of bitches.
I love that they played the,

370
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,510
what was it called?
The brass something or other.

371
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:05,680
Okay.

372
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,910
They played that, uh, the old whale or
someone that they used to score a, yeah.

373
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,020
Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa, Papa.

374
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,381
Bye.

375
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:18,381
You guys remember that whalers goal
song was there was a brass something or

376
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:23,610
other brass bonanza.
They'd score a goal. Right.

377
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,510
And then they'd play this song
right here if I can unmute it.

378
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,140
That's, hold on. That's how old I am.

379
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:44,923
Okay.

380
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,180
The song was played in
national hockey league.

381
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,113
Yeah.

382
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,840
Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Papa.

383
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,450
And it was at the pro level.

384
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,140
I'll tell you was weird. I just
realized this. I tweeted about it.

385
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:05,141
Do you know the Hartford whalers have
been the Carolina hurricanes for one year

386
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:10,160
longer than they were ever? The
Hartford whalers? How sad is that?

387
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,150
Okay.

388
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,600
They were the Hartford whalers for a,

389
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,210
from 1979 to 1997.

390
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,120
So what is that? How many years is that?
That's 70 years. 17 years. 18 seasons.

391
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,390
And from 1997 on,

392
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,610
they've been the fucking,

393
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,900
the fucking Carolina hurricanes are y'all
kills me is I never went to a Hartford

394
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:42,620
whalers game. It was right down the
street. I could've got there in like,

395
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,210
I don't know how long, but it just
seems so far away to me back then.

396
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,720
Let's live in just outside of Boston.

397
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:51,780
I could've got there no traffic
in like 45 minutes, an hour.

398
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,060
And I never went. One time my buddy
had tickets and he's like, oh,

399
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,240
but I already asked this other guy and
then the other guy said he wanted to go

400
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:03,900
and I'm like, God, no worries. And it
was a Bruins verse. Hartford whalers,

401
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,420
the Hartford whalers.
Beh Beh Beh Beh Beh.

402
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,860
Um,
what about the Houston Oilers fight song?

403
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,990
Houston Oilers,
Houston Oilers,

404
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,730
Houston Oilers. Now
Bob Won. Remember then?

405
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,233
Good.

406
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,363
Okay.

407
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,320
How much work did horn
players get back in the day?

408
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,130
Nah, that's not really true.
You've yet to win a Superbowl.

409
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,140
Oh wait,

410
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,493
here it is.

411
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,340
We're
the,

412
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,610
yeah,
there you go.

413
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,060
There you go. I was watching this
whole thing on fucking Earl Campbell.

414
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,200
I was like, I remember that song
and so easy it was back then.

415
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,840
That'd be songs started to say,
wait [inaudible] I get gap.

416
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,880
And then there's some horns came in and
then some guy in a tube was just going

417
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,750
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
That's it. Then now, you know,

418
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,200
cause these fucking Djs,
they stripped all of that away.

419
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:35,360
And now all we're left with is
just the Tuba baseline. Basically.

420
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,020
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom Bob.

421
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,400
And then the Trump, it comes in by, by my

422
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,090
$2 trillion of national debt. Um, anyway,

423
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,610
I don't want, I'm talking about
here. Everybody that felt good,

424
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:56,310
the top of the podcast. It might've,
I might've came, came in a little hot,

425
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:59,580
but it felt good to get that out of me.

426
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,973
You know,

427
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,030
I'm going to fucking work out and
eat well. I haven't drank in 30 days.

428
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:13,440
That might be another part of the
problem. 30 fucking days. Three trees,

429
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,274
zero.

430
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,200
So Christmas tomorrow is going to
be a 31 and official, you know,

431
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,910
month. No Busan. And all I gotta do is
just get through that day. You know,

432
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,300
my wife is trying to convince me to
have a, you know, front of ours guy,

433
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:32,610
this does really nice bottle of
wine, but I'm just going to say no.

434
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,490
I'll be like, Yay, let's
drink it on Valentine's Day.

435
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,420
I'm just going to keep pushing it, pushing
it, pushing it, pushing the cause. Uh,

436
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:41,790
you know, I'm an old dad and
I got to fucking grow up.

437
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:44,260
I got a lot of growing up to do and a
lot of the yelling that I did and all the

438
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:46,570
bullshit I did at the top of the
podcast, you know, something, you know,

439
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,120
something that had more to
do with me than anybody else.

440
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,490

learn to express what it is that I want,

441
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,570
what it is that I need. And I got to stop

Can I come up a little bit short?
Um,

546
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,250
Houston or alerts, Houston
Oilers, number one,

547
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,330
my ticket prices would have been higher,
but men came in and made him lower.

548
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,640
That's why I'm not on that list.

549
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,180
I would have played a bigger venue,

550
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,340
but men came and chased the crowd away.
That's sexism.

551
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,390
Uh,
name checked in a rap song,

552
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,050
a Billy goat gruff.

553
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,640

mentioned by name and a new song iron

554
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:31,820
claw by czar face,
uh,

inspected deck from the Wu Tang Wu
Tang clan and seven l an esoteric from

556
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:42,350
Boston.
Ghost face killer is on the track,

557
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:47,351
but unfortunately the mention of got
the filter of bill burr obviously comes

558
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:51,470
from the white dude from Boston.
Well, what's wrong with that?

559
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,720
What are you ashamed to be in a crack?
Uh,

have better luck next time. Oh, Jesus.

skin that's gotten him his fucking

563
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,330
townhouse. Uh Huh. What's the matter?

564
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,440
Are you guilty with all your privilege?
You should go on tour of a deli.

565
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:16,880
You'll make more money than
the broads out there. Um,

566
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:17,871
I like,

567
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:22,871
are you totally just fucking completely
disregarded this guy as a musician just

568
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,780
because he was white. I mean, what?

569
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,590
I don't understand what's going
on in the world right now. Okay.

570
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,980
Can we just fucking, you know, if
somebody is good, just say they're good.

571
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:35,390
Can we do that? Can we stop
with the fucking bean count
and that shit. You know,

572
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,290
I love that. You know, this business
was like completely racist and sexist,

573
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,060
homophobic and all of that type of shit.
And now to correct it,

574
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,960
they now they're going to go the
other fucking direction and just,

575
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:50,170
it's just like they don't
know how to do it. It's like,

576
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:55,030
it's not about an algorithm. It's not
a formula. Just whoever's the best.

577
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,730
Just give it to them. Whoever
makes your heart sing. Hiram,

578
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:05,260
that's it. Um, named name. Okay.
Where am I in boys versus girls?

579
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:10,040
Dear Billy, wrong balls. Oh

581
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,160
An accessory to the crime. Uh, you
mentioned a few times out. Glad.

582
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,360
Okay.

583
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,130
Uh, how you're glad you
have a girl versus a boy.

584
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,110
I have one of each and I can tell you
for sure that is that it's not the case.

585
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,320
All right? So basically what
you're going to do is what I did.

586
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:34,020
I based the whole world on my
wonderful daughter severed,

587
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,290
evidently you don't have a good daughter.
So now my daughter's going to be bad.

588
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,650
Uh, not that boys are better,
they're just different.

589
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:44,760
Girls are very emotional and their
attitude is way more defiant in different

590
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:49,530
ways. Ironically, misuse
of the word parenthesis.

591
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,060
My four best friends all have one of each,
eh as well.

592
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,620
And we have had this talk a
bunch of times. All right,
now he has numbers on me.

593
00:36:58,621 --> 00:36:59,700
All right,
now I'm losing.

594
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay.

595
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,330
All right.

596
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:04,720
We're all different people and parents
and have different ethnic backgrounds.

597
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,050
He's got a great algorithm going here.

598
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,440
And one conclusion we came to
quickly was that it's a trade off.

599
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,480
Some things are way easier with boys.
Uh,

600
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:17,950
you're a man who's been around.

601
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:22,300
So you know that there are
major differences in the
ways boys and girls and men

602
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:27,130
and women process things do. Can you
just let me enjoy when she's a kid?

603
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,710
I don't need to know that she's
going to hate me when she's eight.

604
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,900
My daughter is very kind and very polite,
but at times she can be a bit,

605
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,930
how do I say, intense. Once again,

606
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:40,120
I'm not trying to convince
you that boys are better.

607
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:44,440
Just that you'll see when
girls can be a handful. No,

608
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:46,150
I didn't think it was
going to be an easy ride.

609
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,390
I'm just saying that boys are animals.

610
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,620
They're lunatics like the first 10 years
of their life. There are eight, seven,

611
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:57,620
eight years of their, they're,
they're, they're lunatics.
Can you give me that sir?

612
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,560
Now I've got to respect you because
you're further down the road than I am.

613
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,960
So you get the experience on me.
I'm still a rookie here.

614
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,750
I'm about ready to start the
sophomore jinx year number two. Uh,

615
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,530
oh no, I'm, I'm, I'm already two
years in, uh, next month. Again,

616
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:15,860
not a blanket statement. I'm sure your
daughter will continue to be an angel,

617
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,730
but she has yours and knee is

618
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,410
okay.

619
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:24,090
Spitfire jeans and she will surely show
it in a few years if she hasn't already

620
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:27,410
know. She has. She has. Um,

621
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,590
I'm happy you're glad you had a
daughter and not trying to convince you

622
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:36,250
otherwise. So No, call me a cunt. I
just think you're being a bit naive.

623
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:37,630
Go Fuck Yourself.

624
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,550
I hate just fucking call me naive.

625
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,800
You argue like a broad, what you, you've
see, this literally said, you know,

626
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,790
I'm going to tell you something,

627
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,860
but you have to promise
you're not going to get mad,

628
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,430
not trying to convince you otherwise.
So don't call me a cunt.

629
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,210
But now I'm going to call
you naive a food for thought.

630
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,490
Um, oh, go fuck yourself.
That whole fucking thing,
nick. I can go fuck himself.

631
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,160
Hey, not trying to be this,
not trying to be there,

632
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:08,130
just saying your way fucking wrong.
I'm not trying to convince you otherwise.

633
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:11,370
Just saying you fucking, you
know, you're a bit fucking naive.

634
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,970
That's some food for thought.
Hey, you some food for thought.

635
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:19,600
Why don't you go fuck yourself. All
right. Um, you are not me and I'm not.

636
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:20,450
You and I,
I'm,

637
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:24,490
I'm very happy for you and your United
Benetton colors of fucking friends that

638
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:28,300
you have. Do you guys can all
go fuck yourself. All right.

639
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,320
Okay.

640
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,430
Jesus fucking Christ. I mean,
I gotta be honest with you.

641
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:34,790
You didn't really tell me anything
that I didn't already know.

642
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,470
Women are more emotional. Gee, thank
you for that, Jim. I never noticed.

643
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,710
I never noticed that men and
women process things differently.

644
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,670
Now you know something. Now I'm going
to be a client. Let's go back to this.

645
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,920
I have one of each. Not that they're
better. They're just different.

646
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,960
You had like your hands up the whole time.

647
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,150
You know you fucking gun belt
around your ankle, so then you do,

648
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:01,960
you took a giant shit. All Lag.
Yeah. You made a really bugs me.

649
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,840
I like it better when people go,
hey bill, you don't know. You don't,

650
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,690
what the fuck you talking about?
All right,

651
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,600
this then at least I know where you stand.
Grain and I'll still get upset.

652
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,130
All right.
Shitty new bosses

653
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,980
I already know I'm going to handle
when my daughter gets upset with me.

654
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:21,430
I'll just be like, hey, oh
right. Oh right. I get it.

655
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:22,970
Yeah,

656
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,990
they'll talk to you mother. I
don't understand these things. Um,

657
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,330
hey there. Hey there. Billy no boss.

658
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,590
My company just got bought out by
have a boss. I worked for Netflix.

659
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,483
F is for family.

660
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,880
My company just got bought out and this
job I love will be majorly affected by

661
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:43,340
this corporate shit house.

662
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,130
I've had a lot of freedom to
be creative and innovative,

663
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:49,470
but that's all going to go away. Yes
it is. Kick comes the algorithms.

664
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,900
BOMP bomp Buh, Buh, Buh Buh Buh.
Don't have fun. The fuck each other.

665
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:58,280
We're a fucking cooperation for this shit.
And the drinking water,

666
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,790
who cares? It babies
had birth defects. Um,

667
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:05,090
I've been told that there will be a set
of guidelines put in place that it will

668
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:07,700
essentially rob me from all the joy I had.

669
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,480
It's really heartbreaking because I just
reached the point where I am able to

670
00:41:11,481 --> 00:41:12,314
make good money.

671
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,670
The new bosses came in and started
talking to us like they were exists.

672
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,220
There were existing problems
that needed to be fixed.

673
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,190
This is of course ridiculous
because they bought

674
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,453
mmm.

675
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,110
They bought us because of how well we
were running out innovative. We've been,

676
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,770
should I just quit now so I don't have
to deal with everything that is to come.

677
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,040
I saved a lot of money,

678
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:37,820
but it's a unique job and I'm not sure
I'll be able to find anything like it in

679
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,440
the near future.
Well then I wouldn't quit it.

680
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,483
MMM.

681
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,930
I, uh, you know something,

682
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,950
God bless anybody in the corporate world
that deals with stuff like that and you

683
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:51,200
don't, don't could be like,
like when they come in,

684
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:53,060
you can't tell him to shut the fuck up.

685
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,510
Okay.

686
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,790
Cause what's going to happen is
they're going to ruin the company.

687
00:41:56,791 --> 00:42:00,300
They're going to make it worse and no
one's ever going to step to them and say

688
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:00,781
that,
you know,

689
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:05,370
you guys took a great thing and you
made it less great slash fuck the whole

690
00:42:05,371 --> 00:42:06,060
thing up.

691
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,450
No one ever tells him that because all
they do is look at the bottom line. Um,

692
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,220
I have to, you know,
I don't know. I, I've,

693
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:19,610
I've watched enough fucking documentaries
and shit and listened to enough people

694
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:24,611
like they have to just like corporations
the way they do business needs to be

695
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:25,634
fixed.

696
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,683
MMM.

697
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,960
Cause it's just a fucking runaway train.

698
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,270
It affects our foreign policy.
It affects people's quality of life.

699
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,010
Um, everything from how much money
they make to like the environment.

700
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,390
How polluted or not polluted it
is. And uh, until you get to,

701
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,560
I dunno because politicians have their
money pouring out of their pockets.

702
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:53,220
Like they've just fucking are treasonous.

703
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,520
Okay.

704
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,970
People that just, yeah, they exist without
fucking borders. That they're the worst.

705
00:42:57,971 --> 00:42:58,930
They're the fucking worst.

706
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:01,270
We can agree on that boy's
first girls who gives a fuck?

707
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:04,960
Just the corporate mindset.
It's just fucking insane.

708
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:10,120
A Merry Christmas. Everybody. Uh,
my girlfriend, the aspiring model,

709
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,110
dear bill, same shit. Different toilet.
I'll rush through the generic intro,

710
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,440
updating the girl of my dreams.
You've been exclusive for three months,

711
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,770
but I've been dating for a total
of eight months. She's gorgeous.

712
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:24,490
She beauty has no boundaries. I've been
in other serious relationships before,

713
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,850
but none quite like this.
I'm truly in love with my best friend.

714
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,060
Like something Nicholas Sparks shit up.

715
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:32,390
Okay,

716
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,500
well who the fuck is that now? I gotta
look that up. He says Yada, Yada, Yada.

717
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:40,460
You get the gist. Who the fuck is
Nicholas Sparks that he shits out? Models.

718
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,170
All right, I gotta look
this up. You Stan. Oh,

719
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,660
alors Nicholas Sparks.

720
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:50,643
Yeah.

721
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:55,880
Bad movies. You fucking cunt. Oh God.

722
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:59,030
I fucking,
I fucking hate apple fucking cancer.

723
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,480
You want to talk about a corporation
that just infiltrated my whole life now?

724
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:05,840
Everything I have is
like run by those cons.

725
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,330
This stupid round building.

726
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:11,880
Okay.

727
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,990
He's a novelist.

728
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,280
What have I didn't want? I wouldn't have,
well, no wonder I didn't know who it was.

729
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,910
The guy writes books. All
right, hang on a second.

730
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,150
Merry Christmas to all my
friends and readers are crazy.

731
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,980
[inaudible] he writes books.
Nicholas Sparks,

732
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,670
one of the world's most
beloved storytellers.

733
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:37,470
All his books have been New York Times
best sellers. Jesus Christ. And I don't,

734
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:42,260
I back in the day I knew who the, okay,
I would know about a guy like this.

735
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,530
There's just no more bookstores.
Ah,

736
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,900
he's got a sweater over
a button down shirt.

737
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:50,780
These leaning up against
the fucking pole on a dock.

738
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:52,520
I mean this guy is a quality human being.

739
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,450
Nicholas Sparks is one of the
world's most beloved storytellers.

740
00:44:56,451 --> 00:45:01,451
All of his books have been New York
Times bestsellers with over 105 million

741
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:05,270
copies sold worldwide and
more than 50 languages,

742
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,780
including 75 million in the
United States alone. Okay.

743
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Sparks wrote one also a male sparks
wrote one of his best known stories.

744
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,790
The notebook. Oh, Jesus. Oh,
I get what you're saying.

745
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:25,790
You're like living a chick flick.
Okay. I get it though. All right. Um,

746
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,030
something. Nicholas Sparks
shit up. Okay. So I guess he,

747
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,940
he puts out a lot of product.
Anyway,

748
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,830
she's an aspiring model and
pretty good at her craft.

749
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,210
Her and the camera get along great.
Anyway, her lack of experience has,

750
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:44,870
there's still getting offers from unknown
photographers in particular, a guy,

751
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:46,790
she's done a few shoots within the past.

752
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,620
This time he wants to shoot nude
with and without pay. Fuck No.

753
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,790
Obviously you have a problem with this.
I want it. She doesn't need to be naked.

754
00:45:55,791 --> 00:46:00,200
Don't do that. I want, I want
her to pursue her passion.
But this in particular,

755
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:03,860
does it sit right with me? I've never met
this guy. He's not paying her to shoot.

756
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,190
And what's her reasoning for
wanting naked pictures of my girl.

757
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,120
I've watched enough Jerry Springer
and forensic files not to trust it.

758
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:15,650
Definitely. She talked to me wanting
my blessing, which makes me feel worse.

759
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,540
I told her my unease about it,

760
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:21,350
but in the end I trust her and
we'll be okay if she goes ahead.

761
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,500
She wants to model so I'll have
to get over things like this. No,

762
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:27,530
you doubt the right now it's
a tough pill to swallow.

763
00:46:27,531 --> 00:46:30,890
Any advice or comic relief you could
provide would be appreciated. Thanks.

764
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:33,860
And Go fuck yourself. No.
Fuck this piece of shit.

765
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:35,950
And then he's going to sell these fleas,

766
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:40,430
naked photos of her when she fucking gets
somewhere. This guy's a piece of shit.

767
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:45,140
He's not even given a cab
fare to get over there. No.

768
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,700
Fuck.
This guy with his artistic nude shots.

769
00:46:49,701 --> 00:46:53,750
This guy's a fucking creep.
He's going over to her apartment.

770
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:58,070
That guy is a fucking creep,
so fucking creep.

771
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,680
He's gonna jerk off to the pictures.
Okay.

772
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:05,680
Any first year fucking cop
would tell you that. All right,

773
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,390
you got to go. Worst case scenario
here to fuck this guy all day long,

774
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,490
you'd have to tell you your, your, your,

775
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:17,660
your girlfriend that you know,
being a,

776
00:47:17,661 --> 00:47:21,920
being a model doesn't mean getting naked.
You don't have to do that shit.

777
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:23,780
That's just fucking creepy shit.

778
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,610
There's no fucking reason ever
for them to do that shit ever.

779
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,270
Give me a scenario why they would have
to be naked there. A fucking model.

780
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,040
You're modeling clothes. You standing
next to her refrigerator being like, wow,

781
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:40,100
I'd lean, oh wait, what?

782
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,210
I really liked that refrigerator now
because that woman is so beautiful.

783
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,030
You don't have to fucking sit there
with your tits and your clam out.

784
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,740
What the fuck is that for?
Why?

785
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,453
Yeah.

786
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,500
Why does she have to be naked?
Jesus Christ.

787
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:59,590
A fucking two piece bathing suits
going to show pretty much everything.

788
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,840
No,
I would say no.

789
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:07,230
I would say I got a bad feeling
that this is going to come back.

790
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,670
I want you to have a great career.

791
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,710
This is going to come back and bite you
in the ass. Your bare ass. All right.

792
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,220
Did you go on over to
this guy's apartment?

793
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,840
He's not paying you and you have to get
naked and he's taking photos and this is

794
00:48:21,841 --> 00:48:23,430
somehow going to further your career.

795
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,980
He's going to send these
fucking photos around.

796
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,460
Your parents are going to see him.
This is a bad fucking move.

797
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,380
Say what I just said, but about the
anchors in the f word. All right.

798
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:38,200
Worst dessert. Dear Billy Baker balls. Uh,

799
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,030
my aunt makes a peppermint cake every
year and every year I look at it like,

800
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:45,690
why would anyone want a cake
that tastes like toothpaste?

801
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,890
Was wondering if you had strong feelings
about any desserts that have crossed

802
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:54,720
your holiday table. Merry Christmas
to you and your two angels. Uh,

803
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:59,010
let's see here.
I don't like coffee,

804
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:02,910
so I don't like anything coffee flavored.
Um,

805
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,410
I don't like marshmallow.
I don't like smores.

806
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:13,650
Uh, yeah, I don't like anything
with marshmallows. I don't like, uh,

807
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:19,550
I don't like candy and my cookies like
m and m cookies or snicker bar crunches.

808
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:24,240
Like that's just this unholy
fuck. It's like, yeah,

809
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:26,820
you're already eating a cookie.
Do you got to jam a fucking,

810
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:30,540
I don't like any of that. I don't
like ice scoop ice cream with a co.

811
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,550
I mean they're gonna have ice cream.
We're gonna have a fucking cookie.

812
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,940
I'm really not going to have any of that
shit anymore cause I kind of got sugar

813
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:38,190
on in my life. Although the
holidays has come back a little bit.

814
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:40,510
And the first time you have something
with sugar after you haven't been eating,

815
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,590
you're like, dude, what the fuck is this?
It's terrible. It's terrible for you. Um,

816
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,340
okay.

817
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,630
But I,
I like pie.

818
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,430
I don't mind a little whipped cream
on my pi or remain an Allah mode,

819
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,860
you know, I don't mind shit like that.
Fuck. My wife told me to make a pie.

820
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,610
Yeah. Christ never ends. Does it?

821
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,310
When will it ever,

822
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:09,660
and when will it ever end?
Who,

823
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:13,740
who's at the Kingston?
Where have all the flowers gone?

824
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,310
Long time passing number that we have.
Oh,

825
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:22,560
there's something going on a long,
long time ago.

826
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,300
The Kingston trio. Yeah.
I'm not into marshmallows.

827
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:31,370
I'm not into fucking coffee flavor
in anything and I don't like,

828
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:35,880
I love the way cop if he smells
so, uh, and I don't like, uh,

829
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,060
okay.

830
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,480
Yeah, I don't, I don't like
incest. You was desserts

831
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,180
where the fucking cookie fucks the candy
and the candy gets inside the cookies.

832
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:51,370
It's just, I mean that's just for
super, super, super fat people. Uh,

833
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,750
that's like this speed ball.

834
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,130
Like it's not enough to do
heroin and just to coke you got,

835
00:50:55,131 --> 00:51:00,130
if you've got to fucking do a speed
ball, you know, um, speaking of which,

836
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:04,270
how about that Aerosmith song
combination? Huh? Isn't that a great song?

837
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:09,290
Walk into Gucci wherein he seva raw,

838
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,700
barely stay on Carla Sam.
So God Damn God,

839
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:17,440
a dollar Shave Club, dollar shave club
has already talked about this, right?

840
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:22,480
Did I? I think I did. Yeah.
My book, he already did the,
I did both. The reads well.

841
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:25,840
That's right. I was doing the,
a shitty new boss. What are you,

842
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:26,980
what a way to start the year.

843
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,080
Yeah.

844
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:34,060
Where's dessert? Oh, that's
it. My done. I can't be done.

845
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,460
That's only, oh, 51 50 while,
but it was almost 51 50.

846
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,110
Um,
anyways.

847
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:47,140
You know what sucks is we didn't do
our holiday card until late this year.

848
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:51,610
You got to do it right on thanksgiving.
That's what my buddy told me last night.

849
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:56,480
The Great Al Madrigal. Let me know
that man does everything right. Um,

850
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:57,870
yeah.

851
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:00,460
All right. Let's see what I can bullshit
about for the next few minutes here.

852
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:01,840
Yeah.

853
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,690
Oh God. Yeah. I was at this
fucking party last night.

854
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,910
I can't say the comedian's name.

855
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,380
Yeah.

856
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,110
Oh, I'll tell it someday on
his podcast. So I'm at this,

857
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,100
I'm at this holiday party last night.
Last night was a great party by the way.

858
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,240
Um, I had a fucking awesome time
at that, you know, to the point.

859
00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:22,840
I was one of the last
people to go. And, um,

860
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,853
okay.

861
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:30,030
Uh, there was a comic there and he had
lost like 20 pounds and he was already

862
00:52:30,031 --> 00:52:33,120
skinny. So he's like, yeah, I lost
20 pounds and fucking site. Right.

863
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,510
And he's one of those people that he
then keeps tabs on everybody else.

864
00:52:36,511 --> 00:52:40,680
So he sees me go over to the buffet and
I got like four shrimp and I got a bunch

865
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:42,390
of lettuce.
It's like salad or whatever.

866
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,550
And he's looking at me cause
that's all you're eating.

867
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,210
And I knew it was fucking with him
because he's one of those people,

868
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,270
like in order for him to feel
good about being in shape,

869
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,840
other people have to be a little out
of shape. You know, he's got to, I got,

870
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,930
I wish he would be laughing, right. I'm
not being addictive and he loves his shit,

871
00:52:57,931 --> 00:53:00,440
right? So he goes, that's all
you're eating. And that was,

872
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,430
I knew what the fuck he was
doing. I was just like, yeah man,

873
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:07,140
I can't eat that other stuff, man. I'll
have to take a nap. So long story short,

874
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:11,370
we're there for like four hours and I
get fucking hungry. So my wife, you know,

875
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:16,080
fixed herself a nice plate and I saw
she had a slider. I'm like, Oh God,

876
00:53:16,081 --> 00:53:19,970
I'd love one of those. So I
fucking go up and I go to the, uh,

877
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,990
this is like fucking two,

878
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:26,070
two and a half hours after I talked to
him about eating the lettuce and the

879
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:30,320
shrimp, right? And I grab a slider
and I'm reaching for a case of Dhea,

880
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:31,920
like a little triangle,
a case of dia.

881
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:35,010
And I just see this guy way
off across the room. Hey,

882
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,660
go day it go far. There you
go. Right. And I know it's him.

883
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,960
So I'm like, this mother
Fucker, this guy, right?

884
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,400
So I deliberately ignored him because I
wanted to see how fucking important it

885
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:51,840
was for him to rub it in that I was
eating bad and there was a bunch of people

886
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:52,740
talking and it was loud.

887
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:56,220
So I deliberately turned and walked
towards him and I was looking down at the

888
00:53:56,221 --> 00:54:00,110
plate and he's going loud. They
had gall, there you go, party.

889
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:02,790
They had cow like that.

890
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:07,560
And I fucking looked up and I put my
hand on his shoulder. And I was like,

891
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:09,600
dude,
I heard you the first time.

892
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:14,190
I just wanted to see how
much joy you would get into
it. He was crying, laughing.

893
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,130
I was like,
what the fuck is wrong?

894
00:54:17,131 --> 00:54:19,650
We had the funniest fucking
exchange last night, right?

895
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,010
I was talking to him and I said something,

896
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,900
he totally made this face,
he's cause whack.

897
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,720
And he kind of stepped towards me
when he said it and I said, dude,

898
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:32,830
don't get my fucking face.
And stuck it in argumentative.

899
00:54:32,831 --> 00:54:37,290
I'm just making a fucking statement.
Get cont right. And then he goes,

900
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,180
I wasn't getting in your face or
whatever. Right? And then like,

901
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:43,500
it took me a half hour to
process and I was like, oh wait,

902
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,910
this guy's been to a zillion concerts.
He plays guitar. His hearing his shot.

903
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,240
And I walked over and I started
laughing. I was like, dude,

904
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:53,280
I didn't realize you were
a little harder hearing.

905
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:54,420
I thought you were being a dick.

906
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:58,270
And we were just laughing our asses off
that he was so fucking old that did.

907
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,990
Now he goes, why? When people talk to him.

908
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:04,860
And then I'm such a fucking defensive
con that I got in his grill,

909
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:08,730
like he was being an asshole to me. I'm
not even drinking. And that happened.

910
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:15,000
Oh my God, that made my night
day ago. They a golfer, they go,

911
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,500
hey, it goes stuff your face. So I
can feel good about being in shape.

912
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,070
Uh, I'll say if there's one
thing that I love in life,

913
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:25,770
it's a miserable concert and this guy is,
he's right.

914
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:29,370
He probably figured out who it is at
this point. Miserable Con Plays Guitar,

915
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:35,160
um, uh, is happy when
someone else's failing.

916
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,290
I might as well say his name at this point
and he's one of my favorite people in

917
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:44,100
this business. Um, anyways, uh,

918
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:46,960
l as I threatened,
as I threatened I,

919
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:49,830
I've been feeling like going
back to church and, uh,

920
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:54,300
I'm going to church today or
this evening, I should say, uh,

921
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:55,890
this is one of the things
I have to do today.

922
00:55:55,891 --> 00:55:58,440
Then I'm actually looking forward to,
um,

923
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:02,340
I actually really enjoy going to church
with my whole family because that's

924
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:06,550
something I did when I was growing up.
I don't believe a lot of it, but the,

925
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,000
the underlying message before it goes,

926
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:14,130
takes a left turn and we have to go kill
some people is all religion seems to

927
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:19,131
lead to God loves you and you love him
and he just wants to love you and be

928
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:24,260
happy and these other
people we need to kill. Um,

929
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,780
I take it, just dislike the a, it just,

930
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,380
it's a nice reminder to be a
good person and I would like to,

931
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,940
I would like to start going again.

932
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,940
I'm trying to turn the
fucking ship around.

933
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,440
I lived a is it hedonistic?
I Dunno what the fuck it was,

934
00:56:40,441 --> 00:56:44,910
but I am boozed way too much over
the last, through my forties.

935
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,910
And I said I was going
to slow down to my fit.

936
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,530
I was going to go stay in my
fifties. All right. You remember B?

937
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,150
What I'm doing,

938
00:56:54,151 --> 00:56:58,290
Yoga pod yields a Bali,

939
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,710
a Navy did down dog lot left.

940
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,560
I want to fucking eat better and I
just want to stop fucking Bosun. Yeah.

941
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,473
Okay.

942
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:12,900
Oh God. Am I going to do that thing?
Am I going to be now that I'm a dad,

943
00:57:12,901 --> 00:57:16,820
am I going to start pretending to
be who are, you know who I'm not.

944
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:18,903
Okay.

945
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:22,680
Oh, am I going to send an example?
I'm not going to lie to my kid.

946
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:28,860
God knows I can't get plenty of
fucking podcast to listen to dad.

947
00:57:28,861 --> 00:57:33,310
Did you drink? Oh yeah.
Oh yeah. Oh yes I did.

948
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,530
Yes, yes, yes I did.

949
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,630
And I did it too much and I wish I didn't,
it was a mistake.

950
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,750
Uh, anyways, having said that, how long
has this booze, no booze run going to go?

951
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,340
If I get through tomorrow,

952
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,970
I feel like I can get through all of
January and then I'll be getting ready to

953
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:57,830
do with special somewhere. I got to figure
out where I'm going to tape it and um,

954
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,680
they didn't, won't drink. So I'll
probably go like to April and that'd be,

955
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:08,970
that'd be a good thing. Get my liver a
nice fucking break. You know what I mean?

956
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:14,000
Like what's his face? Urban Meyer. So
my livers, like every couple of years

957
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,410
it's going to take a break,
you know, for health reasons,

958
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,780
I'm actually go into the last game. That
legend is going to be coaching, man.

959
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:29,340
That's something else. Where do you
put him in the lexicon of Greg College?

960
00:58:29,341 --> 00:58:30,690
Coaches of all time,
man.

961
00:58:30,691 --> 00:58:33,360
You got to put that guy up there and
the fact that he was dealing with that

962
00:58:33,361 --> 00:58:35,440
fucking cyst in his head there,

963
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:37,890
the point he had to like bend
over at the waist you like,

964
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:40,200
is that guy going to die?
And he plowed through that.

965
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,240
Can you imagine how much
shit his wife was giving him?

966
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:48,160
I just don't think he should coach
anymore. That's all I'm trying to say.

967
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:49,720
You're making it worse.

968
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:51,923
Okay.

969
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,940
Um,
anyways.

970
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,010
Okay,

971
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:04,330
so what are your goals? I've had
the same goal for fucking 30 years.

972
00:59:04,331 --> 00:59:07,570
One of the goals, a drumming
goal and I'm fucking sick of it.

973
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:12,840
Am I ever going to be able to
play good times, bad times?
I'm once again trying. I,

974
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:13,481
I,
you know what it is.

975
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:17,620
I don't have this sticktuitiveness
even I keep playing drums.

976
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,200
I keep doing what the Fuck
I love playing them by,

977
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:23,190
just can't focus on anything
to get anything up to speed.

978
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:26,250
I get everything up to like 80%.
I could play good times,

979
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:30,990
bad times about 75 bps.
I'm fucking 25 fucking btms away.

980
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,660
Beads permitted for all, you know,
drum is out. Well, let's see.

981
00:59:33,661 --> 00:59:35,370
I might be big fucking
find out what this is.

982
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,280
Okay.

983
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,430
I should promise you guys,
I'm going to do a drum cover.

984
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,800
That song dressed as John Bonam.

985
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,670
I'll put it on my patrion page when I
finally get it down. Let me see here.

986
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,640
Uh,

987
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,970
good times.

988
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,600
You cut bad times p m beats per minute.

989
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:04,650
BPM. Good Times, bad times, bpm.
What do you got? What do you got?

990
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,850
What do you say that,
what do you say?

991
01:00:05,851 --> 01:00:10,050
They're clicky 94.

992
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:14,070
Oh fuck.
I am 19 bpms away.

993
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,790
I'm just going to keep playing
it at 75 until 75 is a joke.

994
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,760
And if I have to move up to 76 BPM,

995
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,130
if I just have to fucking
inch my way up like that,

996
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:24,330
that's what the fuck I'm going to do.

997
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:26,363
MMM

998
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,280
cause that,
that shoot little

999
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:35,420
kid there who played at this
year. I was just like, what
the, the, the, the, you know,

1000
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:41,000
it's just that kid, that belief, that
kid, we should have what kills me too.

1001
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:44,810
It's two minutes and 46 seconds long.
The Bass Drum Lick than I'm,

1002
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,210
I that I want to play is literally,
you know,

1003
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,220
I mean, what does that take?
A second and and a half.

1004
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,540
Then at the end of the song,
it's Bumble,

1005
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,270
but rob Robert Battle wrap
a rope bat. Bat Ball. Bob.

1006
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,340
Bob Get right. What does that
four seconds, five seconds.

1007
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:10,090
That is fucking help me
up for 30 goddamn years.

1008
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:14,180
Um,
that's it.

1009
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,790
I'm going to do a daily fucking
report, a weekly report. Make,

1010
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:21,670
make sure I stick to this where I'm
at, but you know, suck somebody.

1011
01:01:21,671 --> 01:01:24,700
Get up to maybe 76 BP
fucking [inaudible] right?

1012
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:28,990
And then I'm going to do this 10 fucking
day running Europe by a comeback.

1013
01:01:28,991 --> 01:01:33,580
My foot's going to feel like some old
lady. All right. That's it. Everybody.

1014
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:38,530
Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah.
Happy Kwanzaa. God bless all IA.

1015
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:42,190
IOP had a great year.
I hope next year is even better for you.

1016
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:45,740
I hope you go after what you want in life
because you only live once. God dammit.

1017
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,470
So what do you give a shit if you bomb,

1018
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:51,400
these are going to be an old man saying
I wanted to do it and I tried it in a

1019
01:01:51,401 --> 01:01:53,440
life. Kicked me in the
nuts. Bowling's died.

1020
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,270
Turn my scrotum into a speed bag,
but I kept coming back.

1021
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,780
That'll be me someday on youtube.

1022
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:06,830
90 year old finally gets good times,
bad times down.

1023
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:11,690
Then I cry and Keel over and die.
All right, go fuck yourselves.

1024
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,570
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Ho Ho Ho.
