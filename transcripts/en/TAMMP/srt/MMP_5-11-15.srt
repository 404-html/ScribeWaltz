1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:01,640
Okay.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,420
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn is
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,430
May 11th, 2015. What's going on out?

4
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,110
Why? Yeah. Um,

5
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:17,111
I'm out here in Boston and
I am for shows into my,

6
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:22,910
uh, 19 show run here at the Wilbur
theater. Uh, having a good time so far,

7
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:26,930
running into a bunch of people I went to
high school with, worked with. I had a,

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,100
I had a math teacher from ninth grade.
He showed up,

9
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,240
you know, Algebra, Algebra,
my Algebra teacher,

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,160
you know, and I remember that year
you was supposed to get a, uh,

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:40,860
okay,

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,460
well shit, you needed a 70. That's what
you needed. You needed a fucking 70,

13
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:49,461
just like my helicopter tests needed a
70 to pass in order to go on to geometry,

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,530
more math that I was never going to use
in my life because I was not going to be

15
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:59,850
an engineer. I had no idea what
geometry was when I took it.

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,590
Nobody ever told me they just fucking,
you just showed up and they just started,

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,710
you know, you had to memorize
paragraphs about shapes.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,480
The puck Phi Fag. Urie I'm theorem
or some shit like that, right.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,390
Opposite angles are congruent number,
all of that number of,

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,070
I don't even know if it's like
that for you youngsters out there,

21
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:21,910
you fucking youngsters.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,513
Okay.

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,110
But the way that they go into math,

24
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,280
and you can tell right now
that I didn't get the seven,

25
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,183
um,

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,590
the way that they go into
math in fucking high school,

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,330
it's absolutely ridiculous
because up until then, you know,

28
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:47,750
it's one plus one is two,
two times two is four.

29
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,790
Four divided by two is toe.
It's all fucking numbers, right?

30
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,450
And then all of a sudden you get
to your, your fresh release. I did,

31
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,800
I got to my freshman year. Um, you
know, sure. If you're from Asia,

32
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,230
you got to this and the fourth grade.
But I'm a white guy.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,020
I got to it in the ninth grade.
Okay.

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,680
I got a regular road,
fucking meat and potatoes,

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,910
little stewed carrot fucking
brain. I can't help it. All right.

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,830
My ancestors boiled the food. There was
no nutrients in it. And as the result,

37
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,540
I'm five years behind an entire continent.
Evidently

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,641
everything.

39
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:29,880
How great it is that we have nuclear
weapons so we can actually bullied people

40
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:33,780
into actually thinking that we're an
intellectual factor. You know what I mean?

41
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,970
I mean, seriously, if we actually, if
the world was like a fucking sat test,

42
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:43,260
we really would not be doing well.
Oh yeah.

43
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm dragging my whole country
down with my stupidity.

44
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,330
That's how fucking arrogant I am.
It can't just be like, hey bill,

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,840
you ever think that maybe you're a fucking
moron who should've hit the books a

46
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:54,530
little bit harder? No, no. I
don't think that. I think I'll,

47
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:57,420
I think I'll blame my whole country.
I'll blame the whole school system.

48
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,270
That's what you do, right? That's
what you do as a parent. Now,

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,080
when you have a little cunty kid who
needs a swift kick in his little Oshkosh,

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,580
but gosh, fucking stupid. Oh,
aren't those adorable overalls? Oh,

51
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,430
the overalls are adorable.
That little fucking monster in them.

52
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,210
You know who's never been told he's wrong
his entire life. And then he's special,

53
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,290
right?
That fucker right there.

54
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,790
And he's the pacifier slapped out
of his fucking face and sorry,

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,450
losing my voice already. Hey, I'm
losing my voice already. You know,

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,620
I got another fucking
20 shoes to do. Um, as,

57
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,240
it'd be funny thing to say to
some parent, excuse me, Miss,

58
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,740
if you don't get that kid under control,

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,210
I'm going to slap the past if right out
of his mouth is not illegal to say that.

60
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,890
That's what's funny.
It's just not,

61
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:45,250
everybody has like a cell phone camera
and then they would fill you like fill

62
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,810
your film you while you did it,

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,890
and then they would do the provocative
to try to get you to watch the video.

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,640
I was sitting on a park bench having a
great time with my toddler and I never

65
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:01,660
expected that. Or then you won't
believe what happened next.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
Then they would just cut to me a lady,
if you don't shut that kid up,

67
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm going to slap the pacifier out of his
mouth and then everybody would come me,

68
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,990
right. They come at me like I was
the next Mussolini, you know, never,

69
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,850
never once, just going
like, Hey, wait a minute.

70
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,290
The video kind of started with
him threatening that child.

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,280
You know what I mean? Threatening
the mother, uh, you know,

72
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,070
to do fucking violence to the kid.
That's where it started.

73
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,850
Like what happened before that,
you know, that's what they never,

74
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:34,750
they never had that part in the video.
They never had what happened before.

75
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,130
It's always escalate.

76
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:40,600
Just starts with somebody slapping
a pacifier out of somebody's mouth,

77
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,920
you know, and admitted like I watched
those videos and I go, hey, come on man.

78
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,310
You know, at least wait til
the kids like four. Right.

79
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,200
But these fucking videos,
it's always starts like right there.

80
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:54,120
It's like what happened right before that,

81
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,303
you know,

82
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,110
for all you know,

83
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,520
that's like a video shoot and the
person's read enough like a cute card. Oh,

84
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:03,420
you hear that hammering?

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,730
I've been hearing that since
seven in the fucking morning. Yup.

86
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,760
I mean you go, cause I'm fucking stay
in with the beautiful mind right now.

87
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,120
Fucking add out to fucking up
to God damn trees. You know,

88
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,010
there's one thing that's funny. People
really talk about that fucking Bang, Bang,

89
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:26,250
Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. I've been
hearing that since seven in the morning.

90
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah.
That fucking

91
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,260
just laying here seven in
the morning and I'm fucking

92
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,620
okay

93
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,890
as well here. Bang, Bang, Bang,
Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Right.

94
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,580
And it's making me have all these fucking
weird dreams. I had this one dream,

95
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,313
you know,

96
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,400
because that hammering
that fucking hammer rag

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,900
woke me up at seven in the morning.
My first words,

98
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,930
my first words today,
where are you?

99
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,840
Are you fucking serious?
That's how I woke up.

100
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:07,000
Now you know it's going to be a raw taste.
Gonna be a rough one.

101
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,480
That's the first fucking
thing. And I just, you know,

102
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,100
I was going to wait till the fucking,
you know,

103
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,970
you know the newspapers on the
fucking deck would done and you know,

104
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:18,700
reading it and trying to figure it out.
But I figured, you know, fuck that.

105
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,340
I'm just going to do the podcast
while the hammer is going on.

106
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:25,630
I got other shit to do fucking so I got
a deal with it means you got to deal

107
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:29,680
with it. They get that one in. I'll go
ahead now he's got to go cut another one.

108
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:34,670
So we've got a nice fucking
10. Oh No, there it is.

109
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:37,910
Bap, bap, bap, bap,
bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

110
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,053
Um,

111
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,270
Jesus fucking Christ you fucking times.
You got to hit it before Ted.

112
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,500
Um,
anyways,

113
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,590
so it was causing me to have
all these fucked up dreams.

114
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,450
I had this fucking dream
that me and Nia split up.

115
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,960
I didn't realize it in the dream.
I knew I,

116
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,210
I dunno when I was out drinking with some
other comics who I don't even know who

117
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:10,720
they are and the dream and I woke
up the next day, they like, dude,

118
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,440
what? You know what the fuck happened
to you last night? And I was like,

119
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:17,140
what do you mean what do you mean is like
you were doing the chicken dance with

120
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:20,550
that check? And I was
like, uh, I don't remember.

121
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,900
I vaguely remember doing
it and I was embarrassed.

122
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,220
I don't know what the
chicken dance is either.

123
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:25,720
That's the weird part about this dream.

124
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,640
And then all of a sudden I was just in
this relationship with this fucking woman

125
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,810
who I didn't want to be with and she had
this weird look on her face and she was

126
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:39,100
walking weird. Okay. She
had like blonde hair.

127
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,850
She had a weird look on her face and
it was like she was walking the whole

128
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,040
fucking thing. I was going
to, what am I? What did I do?

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,070
I broke up with me and I got what?
This,

130
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,200
she's walking weird and we're
doing the chicken dance.

131
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:53,400
I want to get out of here now all of
that came from that fucking hammering.

132
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,110
I had that thing and
then I had another dream.

133
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,730
I was pulling up to some department
store in the hood for some fucking reason

134
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,750
cause I wanted to shop right.
And these guys going, hey man,

135
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,460
why don't you just park right here?
Why don't you park?

136
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,890
You know I parked in the spot and
then they came up, they said all this,

137
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,270
this spots for our church. Why don't you
go park down the street? Oh, we'll do it.

138
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,900
We'll pocket. I was like, dude, I'm not
giving you my keys. And the next thing,

139
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:21,700
no one of them was in the car and I
was outside the car, my cake, you know,

140
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,030
give me the fucking keys back. Right. So
I go into this Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam,

141
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:31,440
Bam, Bam. So then I fucking
go into the department store.

142
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,030
No, Jesus Christ. It's the same
fucking nail. That's what kills me.

143
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,630
Funny if I go down there and he's
banging his head against the wall,

144
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,700
trying to get all the voices out
of there. Um, so I fucking, uh,

145
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,320
I go into the department store and it's
just a shitty ass place and just like

146
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,970
washers and dryers and stuff.

147
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:55,910
And then all of a sudden like five
of them come in and they go, uh,

148
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,300
a, you know, you know,

149
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:02,510
we've got to move your car
or something like that, but
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

150
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,330
You know, gimme the keys and I'll go,
I'm not giving you the keys. And they go,

151
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:12,200
why? I go, cause I'm not the white guy
from def jam. Like, Oh, okay, here you go.

152
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:15,290
Here's my fucking keys. Go move. The
car, I'm not moving the fucking car.

153
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,650
And then I saw this whole part of the
store that, and then they go though,

154
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,210
you didn't have to buy anything here.
And I go,

155
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:22,280
and these are all good and
all this fucking stores sucks.

156
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,710
And then they showed the bar,
all the good clothes where I was,

157
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,500
I call it shows up.
This fucking store is actually good.

158
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,510
I know it's a fucked up dream,

159
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:32,420
but I got hammered in my head is just
as I'm sure I've done dreaming here.

160
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,330
So I ended up going out and my car's gone.

161
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,090
I walked down the street to where it
is and they'd fucked up the fender.

162
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:43,080
Now I'm driving away. No, I got in
it and somebody came up with a gun,

163
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,550
was trying to rob me.
I remember I just said,

164
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:48,510
go fuck yourself.

165
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,900
And now when I was walking away
and there was like this Asian cop,

166
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,220
I swear to God would like the Baltimore
riots playing on a TV or something.

167
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,570
I don't know why I had this dream.
Right.

168
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:02,430
I'm fucking walking out and this Asian
cop, I'm going, you see these guys,

169
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,170
when you going to,
they're going to fucking shoot me.

170
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:08,670
And he said something even like this fish
sandwich. And it was just like, yeah,

171
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:11,430
you know I can't fucking help Ya.
Ya know, we had the white shirt on,

172
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:14,520
you know the fucking police chief.
He was just like, yeah, you know,

173
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:15,241
I can't help you out.

174
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,430
And then they were saying they were
going to follow me and I said, I,

175
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:21,810
I said that I didn't give a fuck.
Go Fuck Yourself.

176
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:26,811
And then I was on sunset boulevard and
I drove home to a different house and

177
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,230
then I walked up,

178
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,290
I woke up and I had a fantasy about
having ridiculous security and I popped up

179
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,620
on that gps screen and all their fucking
phones as they were pulling up the

180
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:41,790
street. And I just yelled at
him with his goats head on set.

181
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,770
I was in the Illuminati and they got
scared and they left. That's my morning.

182
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,450
This is what happens when
you wake up to hammering.

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,210
I don't know what any of that means,
but I got to tell you,

184
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:57,210
it's fucked up as a second.
Dream was the first one was scarier.

185
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,150
Okay.

186
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,380
Jesus Christ.
Even in my dream.

187
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,760
Why don't I just say, Hey, you know,

188
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:07,490
I'm sure you're a lovely person
to somebody else, but not to me.

189
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:08,660
I don't want to be in this anymore.

190
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,350
Okay.

191
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,150
All right. It is you and it's me.
That's my new one. Instead it,

192
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,600
it's not you. It's me. It's not me. It's
you. It is me. And it's you. All right?

193
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,230
It's fucking everybody. Thanks to
you. It's not working for all of us.

194
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,000
The ununited way. Um, so anyways, um,

195
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:29,620
you know,

196
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,850
I'm thinking about this fucking add shit
coming from a family where everybody

197
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:37,210
sort of has it a little bit to
different degrees, you know what I mean?

198
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,220
Which just causes you to constantly be
going in a different direction every five

199
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:45,550
seconds and all that type of stuff. I've
actually made peace with it and I don't,

200
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,990
I don't think it's really a big deal.

201
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,600
Okay.

202
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,680
I just really sat down and I
thought about it, you know,

203
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,490
as they're trying to put you on medication
in my wife one time I was just going

204
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,650
like, you know, they got stuff, you
know, kind of takes the edge off,

205
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,470
fucking chills you out a little
bit. And I was like, Hey,

206
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,850
you want to your fucking mind,
I'm not taking that stuff. The,

207
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,970
the fucking FDA doesn't
even exist anymore.

208
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:06,940
It's full of a bunch of people who
used to work for drug companies.

209
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:08,390
You've got the nuts run in the nuthouse.

210
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,890
I'm not sticking anything in my
fucking body other than aspirin.

211
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,160
Anything that wasn't made pre 1960s,

212
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,950
I'm not sticking it in that
unless I have a terminal disease.

213
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:19,960
And at that point who gives a fuck?
I'll try anything.

214
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,100
Um,
so

215
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,300
I actually had this
conversation with them go.

216
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,150
Do you ever think that having
add is actually natural? I mean,

217
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,880
I was born that way.
You know,

218
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:37,090
for you to sit there and like they have
the way that they demonize that. Oh,

219
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,550
people, they have problems focusing
and they can't do well in school.

220
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,180
Who gives a fuck? I didn't do well in
school. I did great in life though.

221
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,740
You know what I mean?

222
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,210
The with the fucking schools in most
jobs is what they want you to do.

223
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:52,360
They want you to not be thinking,
don't be fucking going all over the place.

224
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,230
And they were like, oh focus on this job.
Focus. Focus on what job is. Mind numbing.

225
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:59,380
Fucking horseshit. That's not
fulfilling me on any God damn level

226
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,420
stack of spreadsheets.

227
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:05,930
Do you think I fucking laid in bed as
a child and that's what I thought about

228
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,890
when I dreamed someday. Oh, some
day. What are you going to be Billy?

229
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:12,530
He's going to be an astronaut.
You want to play baseball?

230
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,500
No,
no.

231
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,400
I want, I want to stack of
spreadsheets and here's the thing.

232
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,180
There's some people that are fucking
into that and it gets their juices going.

233
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,190
Those are the people
should be doing that job.

234
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,930
I got to meet with this
fucking pilot shit.

235
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,060
I had no idea how much I was into reading
charts and graphs and stuff and like

236
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,210
the temperature dewpoint and that
whole fucking formula rights,

237
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:38,560
subtract attempt that do point from the
temperature divide by Paul 4.4 and then

238
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:42,460
multiplied by a thousand I thought I'd
hate that shit. I fucking loved it.

239
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,940
Once I got it down and I started getting
the right answers and I really started

240
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,380
thinking about the genius of the House,

241
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:50,830
somebody actually came up with that got
my fucking brain going and I loved it.

242
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,630
You know what I mean? Which brings me
back to fucking math and high school,

243
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,003
right?

244
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,430
Math in high school, how all of
that shit is fucking unbelievable.

245
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,790
They basically beginning to make you,

246
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,560
the math that you learned in high school,

247
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,150
at least in my fucking country is they're
making you like a junior member of the

248
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:12,984
free masons.

249
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:18,650
You know you're starting to learn the
secrets of the universe with that math.

250
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,240
Now, if they fucking said that to start
it out and you know, fucking motivated,

251
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:27,160
I would have been
this,

252
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,510
this math that you're now
going to embark on that shit.

253
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,730
Then we fucking taught IA for the first
eight years. Okay. That's just, you know,

254
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,730
that's just when you go down the street,
you buy a loaf of bread,

255
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,340
you make sure they give you the
right amount of change. Okay.

256
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:47,020
Now this shit I should have been up there
wearing like some fucking, you know,

257
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,920
secret society robe dimming the lights
with a flashlight under his chin.

258
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,780
Right?
Just to kick it off

259
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,170
and just be like these,

260
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,660
these formulas we about
to show you showing like a
video of like the fucking big

261
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:09,950
bang and the solar system and all that
shit be in made the math you'll about to

262
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:14,000
embark on all the mysteries of
the world up until this point,

263
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,330
the mysteries that we have unraveled the
answers to all of these mysteries will

264
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:24,590
now be at your fingertips.
It'll be in your mind.

265
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,750
They, oh yeah, you're so right. I
would've fucking ace that class.

266
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,210
He just fucking walk in day one and
you write the name on the board and you

267
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:38,750
start throwing the alphabet in
words and with numbers, you know?

268
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,020
Oh freckles in the back of the
class. I just shut down. I was like,

269
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:46,400
I won't put the fuck is this, what is
this? I don't get this. I feel stupid.

270
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,720
I know I'm going to make the people
around me laugh. So I needed as a 70,

271
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,590
I needed to 70 to get through
this motherfucker. Right.

272
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,600
And I ended up getting like a 68 and I
was a Douche to the teacher all year.

273
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,740
Bad move,

274
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,400
bad move when I'm coming up there with
my lack of a hat in my freckled hands and

275
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,860
uh,
I'd like to 68 or 69.

276
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:12,220
I was right there and he
didn't give it to me and uh,

277
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,530
and I went to summer school
and I was just like, Oh man,

278
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:16,370
this summer it's going to suck.

279
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,670
I had two weeks off and then immediately
I was fucking back in, into, uh,

280
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,380
into summer school.

281
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,340
And then I got to summer school and
immediately it was the best time I have a

282
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:30,341
fucking had in my life because summer
school is filled with a bunch of class

283
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:34,010
clowns, musicians, artistic people,

284
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:37,940
people with fucking add and people
who fucking hate authority. It was,

285
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,630
it was one of the great
classes I had ever been in.

286
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,190
They did this. I'm at, you
know, I thought I was funny.

287
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,550
I got to those classes. I was, I
wasn't even, I kept my mouth shut.

288
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,610
I couldn't even keep up with the level
of funny that was in those fucking

289
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,860
classes.
And uh,

290
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:59,750
and then just the balls that the kids
had truly found kids that didn't give a

291
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:03,210
fuck. It's probably the bad
crowd, but you know something if,

292
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,580
if you take what you learn
in that with that attitude,

293
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:12,470
if you apply it to the right areas of
life, um, it actually can work for you.

294
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,790
Be apply it to the wrong areas.
He ended up in jail. So you know,

295
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,440
you got to kind of navigate
those fucking waters, you know,

296
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,640
if you know, if your natural
reaction to somebody coming in going,

297
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:28,280
can I can settle down, can I
have your attention? Please.

298
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,110
If you're natural reaction is fuck this
guy. That's not exactly a bad thing.

299
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,020
You know what I mean?
It's not actually a good thing either.

300
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:40,340
You just got to know when you got to
know when to say, fuck this guy. Oh,

301
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:42,590
who is this guy?
Or Why am I listening to this guy?

302
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:45,020
I think you should always think,
why am I listening to this person?

303
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,780
Unless you know you're on some hike
through the forest and you with some God

304
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:53,010
damn ranger and there's a grizzly bear.
And he turns around and it'd be like,

305
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:57,570
okay, listen, this is really critical.
You know? Then you listen. You know,

306
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:00,330
it'd be like,
who the fuck are you to tell me

307
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,760
Dude? I know it's a fucking bear. Um,

308
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,660
so anyways, that fucking a Dee
Dee shit. If you have a date date,

309
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,710
don't let him put you on fucking
medicine. I'm really going like, goes,

310
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,260
it's Suzanne Somers that got in trouble.
It was one of those Blondie's.

311
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,920
It was the chick from the
MTV thing, right. She said
a bunch of stuff where she,

312
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:26,970
you know, didn't really do her
homework. Um, what was it on? Um, um,

313
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,520
autistic kids. All right. Oh, is it
Tom Cruise talking about psychology?

314
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:35,520
I think I'm doing this right now.
You know what's that?

315
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,490
The phone ringing a Jesus.

316
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:42,130
There's the phone phones ring
and once the hammer and stopped,

317
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,900
then the phone goes
thousand one one, 1002,

318
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:51,220
1003 1000 rings. Come on,
give me four over under,

319
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:52,870
I say six before it's picked up.

320
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,023
Come on.
Five.

321
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,080
It's five. It comes to
push ties. Loose ties lose.

322
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,920
It's six, seven for the wind.
Come on. Seven. Come on you seven.

323
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,250
Yeah,
we got a winner.

324
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,630
I'm gonna wait till this is done.
This,

325
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,430
there's somebody downstairs sitting
right next to the phone too.

326
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,150
That's the funny thing. Anyways. Um,

327
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,863
yeah.

328
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,190
Oh, fucking add thing where
it's just like, all right.

329
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,500
You gotta look you gotta you know,
you need to calm down.

330
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,550
We need to focus maybe a year of,
you're a different kind of person.

331
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,640
You don't need two years of a fucking
language and go through all of that

332
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:41,630
bullshit. Hammer, Hammer,
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer,

333
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:48,320
fucking Christ. Unbelievable.
Unfucking believable.

334
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,900
Constantly fucking places
under construction.

335
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:53,210
I don't think I've ever been here
where it's not under construction.

336
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,400
It's a beautiful mind and
it needs to be occupied.

337
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,990
Let me go build some shit.
Hello. Do you know me? Sure.

338
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:07,550
We all do on that person. Hammering in
fucking [inaudible] seven in the morning.

339
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,640
Not a fuck do I get out of this?
Sorry. Hold on a second. Close,

340
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,040
close and save.
Close and discard.

341
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,670
Just fucking apple products. They always
got all these questions. All right,

342
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:24,290
let's read a couple of ads here for this
week. Oh my God. Here we go. Me undies,

343
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:29,090
me undies. No more sweaty
balls. Me undies. Mandy's.

344
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,830
Pull them down in a bathroom stall.
Take a dump and maybe a pice.

345
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,790
Look what you're doing or you're gonna
Miss, but it's not your fucking toilets.

346
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,910
Somebody else got to clean it up. Oh
yeah, but you fucking balls feel good.

347
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,280
Fuck them if you didn't want to do it.

348
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:50,710
You showed us studied in
class so you didn't have to
clean up the fucking toilet.

349
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:50,981
All right,

350
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:55,570
90% that's the percent of your life
that you're in your underwear there and

351
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,070
underwear.
It gets old fast.

352
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,190
You know that feeling of
putting on old saggy underwear,

353
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,180
you need to know the feeling of great
fitting underwear that is two times softer

354
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:08,230
than cotton. You need to know
about me, undies, me undies,

355
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,960

a bad way.

356
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,210
Me undies is the most
comfortable underwear you will
ever wear and it's insane

357
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,560
how good they make you feel.

358
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,950
I'm wearing some right now
and I'm slightly aroused
and I'm not thinking about

359
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,170
anything sexual.
They fit perfectly.

360
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:25,960
They don't ride up on you and
they literally pull moisture.

361
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,440
Rouse away from your skin sees stay cool.

362
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,910
I have mine on right now and I'm floating.
They have a cool style.

363
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,940
They have cool styles and both men
and women and they all look great.

364
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,030
Check out the photos for yourself.
You fucking perverts it.

here we go. The old favorite.

373
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:13,330
He had dollar shave club there.

374
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,760
You've heard me talking about Dell Dollar
Shave club.com having you the company

375
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,580
that delivers amazing razors,
razors for a few bucks.

376
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,720
I know a razor that costs a
few bucks delivering what?

377
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,150
A razor that costs a few bucks.
Delivering a great shape.

378
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,950
Seems too good to be true, right? God,
this is going to be bad this week,

379
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,690
but you really have to try the razors.
I'm going to go slower.

380
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,720
The dollar shave club.com raise our kids
made the most amazing shape I've had in

381
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:45,490
years. Don't pay triple
the price. Everybody.

382
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,390
When you can get a fantastic shave
delivered for just a couple of dollars,

383
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,390
you'd have to be an idiot to
keep overpaying. By the way,

384
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:55,540
I always say everybody when I feel like
I'm fucking gonna fuck something up.

385
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,960
Helps me slow down.
I'm a massive celebrity everybody,

386
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,970
and I'm constantly getting my
picture taken by the Papa Rizo. No,

387
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm not actually,
or I'm on some TV show in high definition.

388
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,000
I can't be seen with Nixon
cuts all over my face.

389
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,170
I have to shave with a high quality razor.

390
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,210
Don't be fooled by the price.
Everybody.

391
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,910
These razors are legit
and you'll never go back.

392
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,850
Plus the dash got me confused there.

393
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,630
Plus they've got doctor Avizia see shade

394
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,920
fucking boner.
It's phenomenal.

395
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,150
If you're still using old fashioned
shave foam, you're a loser.

396
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,570
And I actually feel bad for you. I'm
sorry, my voice is going to go this week.

397
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:43,870
Everybody. Two shows a night. Hey, I'll

Two down, two to go. I liked it.

401
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:02,870
I like a little cemetery.

406
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,300

about something and I'm talking about

00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:44,770
bank bank. Oh God. Oh my God.

411
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,860
Anyways,
if you'd like to do that,

412
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,100
that's what she can do.
All right. And then, um,

413
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,560
the fuck else was I talking about? Where
the hell was I going with this? Oh yeah,

414
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,760
one of the Thursday afternoon
podcast, money, money
podcasts just before Thursday.

415
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,610
Um,
I was ranting about the Tom Brady thing,

416
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,320
which I cannot believe
they're actually going to,

417
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,440
the rumor is he's going to get suspended
for two games for, for pure speculation.

418
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,320
I love all you guys too,
that show those text messages,

419
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:16,850
like it's damning information.

420
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,540
I can't tell what they're talking
about definitively and neither can you.

421
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,200
All of this would be laughed out of court.
But the thing is, this isn't a court,

422
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,420
it's a corporation.
And what they really,

423
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:31,421
what corporations really give a shit
about is the opinion of the base level.

424
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,770
Mouth Breathe and fucking moron.

425
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,190
Because that's the guy you get
the most fucking money out of.

426
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,790
That's the dope that shows up to the game,
dressed,

427
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:45,530
wearing everything but helmets and cleats
goes down to the pro shop and buys all

428
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:48,500
this stuff and paints his fucking face.
Moron.

429
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,990
Fucking mole. New booger. Biggest
Fan. Oh look at me. I'm a fireman.

430
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,530
Put me on your shoulders. Even eat fucking
woke up. Even he woke up after a while.

431
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:01,790
So this is fucking stupid. It's not
worth it. But those are the people.

432
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,360
Those are the same people that call
in sports talk radio and all that.

433
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,430
The fucking NFL is going to base.
Maybe he could have probably,

434
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,200
but we can't prove it.

435
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:16,070
Report is they're going to base the
suspension on the crowd's reaction,

436
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,450
the base level, mouth breathe, moron.

437
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,680
So basically if you make
enough fucking noise,

438
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,480
they're going to suspend this guy
for absolutely fucking nothing.

439
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,220
You know, I don't know if he knew.
I don't know if he didn't know.

440
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,910
And that's to say, everybody can say
the same thing, but I can tell you this,

441
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,240
he what he, what he did, if he
even fucking know is, is the,

442
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,980
it's the equivalent of fucking,

443
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,010
he played with a hockey stick with too
big a curve on it for about a period and

444
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:44,844
a half.

445
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,140
And then after that with the regulation
stick scored 50 fucking goals.

446
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,590
But you're going to be like, oh
no, now fuck his whole career.

447
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,460
And all that comes down to is you
fucking cunts hate the Patriots.

448
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:59,940
And you hate the fact that they're fucking
winning. It's the dumbest shit ever.

449
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,720
And I'll tell you this though, but at,
this is what you're gonna do. If this,

450
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,040
if this is the standard that you
want, okay, I will go with it.

451
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,800
And you can call Brady had
cheater in the Patriots to cheer,

452
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,170
but then we're going to go
through the whole fucking league.

453
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,410
And this is just the shit that I know
cause I've got shift from some fucking

454
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:18,960
Steeler fan. Right. And I'm like really?

455
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,460
Well if we're just going to go
on circumstantial evidence, uh,

456
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,870
you have a sex offender at,

457
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:28,871
at the QB precision two times sex offender
that we know of at the QB position

458
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,990
and also Terry Bradshaw admitted to doing
steroids along with a bunch of other

459
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:38,460
Steelers in the 70s. So you're no longer
six Berg, you're fucking two time,

460
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:42,420
two t two times sex offender,
two time super bowl champion Berg.

461
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,183
You want that?

462
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,200
What about Jerry Rice who admitted after
his career that he used to stick them?

463
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,640
That wasn't quite legal. It wasn't
fucking legal. So they had gone,

464
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:57,510
what did he went three titles with the
40 niners though is the route and the 40

465
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:01,440
niners are all cheaters. You can
go around the fucking league. This,

466
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:06,150
this shit in the league that you don't
even fucking, there's been no evidence.

467
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,310
You know why there's no evidence
is because the other team,

468
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,690
that loss was never such a fucking pussy
like Jim or say that they launched an

469
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,680
investigation.

470
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,670
Do you think that you can't do this
to every fucking team on every game?

471
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:20,430
If you looked under every fucking jock
strap, you wouldn't find something.

472
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,660
Let's look at the Dallas cowboys in
the early nineties their head coach was

473
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,780
Jimmy Johnson Bank Bank,
bank bank, bank bank,

474
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,300
Jimmy Johnson from the University
of fucking Miami. Okay.

475
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,780
Basically a low security
federal fucking prison.

476
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,750
That's what their football program
was when he was running it.

477
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,050
Then he goes to dad,
The Dallas Cowboys,

478
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,220
Aka a coq 10 slash whorehouse
of a fucking franchise.

479
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,850
Their owner has a face
lift. His face, his ally,

480
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,150
his face is cheating right out of
the gate. The first thing you fuck,

481
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,710
you're telling me if he didn't look under
a couple of those cheerleaders skirts,

482
00:28:57,711 --> 00:29:01,300
you wouldn't have found something. Give
me a fucking break. I'll tell you right.

483
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,000
If this guy gets fucking suspended,

484
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:08,210
this is an absolute God damn fucking
travesty that you're going to do this tar

485
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:09,421
and feather,

486
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:12,840
one of the greatest quarterbacks of
all time and arguably the greatest head

487
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:17,760
coach of all time with this country
fucking pussy. Shit. I, I can't,

488
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:21,390
I, I, I don't even, I think I
won't watch professional football.

489
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:25,650
I'm just going to watch college football
this year. If this is what happens if,

490
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:28,880
because of a bunch of fucking
sore losers and mouth breathing,

491
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,490
fucking morons complain enough.
I swear to God,

492
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:36,930
I really think it's because all that
ray rice shit, you know what I mean?

493
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:38,790
Or they didn't get a rug.
We've got to get it right.

494
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,000
Ray Rice knocks out his fiance and the
guy I two two games, two game suspension.

495
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:46,720
Why don't you cool it out there? Uh,
you know, uh, you know, come on man,

496
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,040
we can't have this. We can't, you know,

497
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:51,850
they fucking talk to him like Henry
Hill when he had his Goumarre, you know,

498
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,340
they came over it. Come on, you've
got to go back to your wife. Okay.

499
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:56,320
We can't have this. This is
ridiculous. All right, come on.

500
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,870
You can't be standing over here.
He got to go back to Karen.

501
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:00,010
That's how they treated them,
right?

502
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,040
Then all of a sudden the video came out
and they were like, oh, wait a minute. We,

503
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:06,640
uh, we met. Uh, we don't
tolerate that and, uh,

504
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:11,560
get out of the league, get
out of the league because
we're so fucking pure, right?

505
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,790
It's all fucking bullshit. It's all
bullshit. Right? And then fucking, uh,

506
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:20,860
then what happens is God damn fiance,
who should have left the guy,

507
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,400
you know, that's probably it. That's
probably grounds to be like, you know,

508
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,160
this really isn't what I'm looking
for in a relationship. She goes,

509
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,740
but she forgives the guy.
Why did she forgive him?

510
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,420
Because he gave the apology or the fucking
university because he makes a zillion

511
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,330
dollars a fucking year. Do you think of
Ray Rice was working at Midas Muffler?

512
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:41,440
The forgive this happens. I
don't think it does. Coming home.

513
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:46,180
Everyday smell and like fucking exhaust.
I don't think it does. It's all bullshit.

514
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,420
That stupid pink shit that they
make an a zillion dollars off of.

515
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:54,240
You guys go out and buy that fucking
those Pink Jersey and you seem to think

516
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:57,210
you're helping out cause your grandmother
died a fucking breast cancer and you

517
00:30:57,211 --> 00:31:01,200
find that like one half of one half of
one fucking percent actually goes to the

518
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:04,800
cause to raise awareness,
not even to fight the disease.

519
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,410
And the rest goes into these
fucking owner's pockets.

520
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,410
Do you see that shit about the troops?
Whenever the advertise with the fucking,

521
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,150
uh, the flag and all that you thinking,
wow. The NFL supporting the troops.

522
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,920
The military's got to pay for that.

523
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,330
You guys are talking about a
container out of a fucking ball.

524
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,030
So we said this weekend
said if he actually did it,

525
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:26,580
he should have just said
like, yeah man, I like that.

526
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,670
That's what the fuck I like him at.
Gives me a little better field, you know?

527
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:31,810
Okay.

528
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,190
I didn't think it was that big a deal.

529
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,450
And then you combine that with the fact
that ESPN did the study and showed it

530
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:38,950
was actually a disadvantage.

531
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,310
And you combine it with the fact that
when he had the regulation fucking ball,

532
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,350
he scored each keep fucking killed
him even worse. So fucking witch hunt,

533
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:51,680
you tar and feather on this guy and you
know what? Go ahead and fucking do it.

534
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,070
Cause that's what sports fans do.
It's like New York sports fans,

535
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,400
New York sports fans, you know, all they
bring up when they talked to Boston fans,

536
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,090
uh, the two giant victories over the
patriots so you couldn't beat the giants.

537
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:04,670
Doe Cook does still bringing that
shit up. You know, it's like,

538
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:09,290
I don't even bring up the fucking oh four
Yankees. Do I do that? Do I bring up, uh,

539
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:12,620
you know, oh the fucking Celtics
got 17 championships. Do I fucking,

540
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,370
the only time I ever do that is
if a Knicks fan comes up to me.

541
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:16,490
It gives me fucking shit.

542
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,870
Fucking New York fence
sitting there ignoring,

543
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,040
hanging their hats on to fucking wins in
fucking ignoring the absolute carnage,

544
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,420
the roadkill, this sports roadkill
of the other fucking eight teams,

545
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:39,290
the other 18 in your fucking state
roadkill fucking roadkill to the point.

546
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,440
They shouldn't even be
there in a fucking league.

547
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:44,880
Okay.

548
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,620
Horrific. Absolutely fucking
horrific. And even your crown jewel,

549
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,620
the Yankees, they blew a three
games to none leagues. Even.

550
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:57,390
They've got a fucking big sploosh of
mud in their face. Fucking unreal.

551
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,501
I'm fucking real.

552
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:01,150
I got to listen to oversee all fucking
week this week talking about how to tell

553
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:05,400
him Boston fans, how the fucking giants
beat the fucking patriots. It's just like,

554
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:09,170
it really, I've always still talking
about the fucking whatever. Hey,

555
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,710
you know what good for you.
Good on you.

556
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,800
Did you went to what we want for
while winning three world series,

557
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:17,070
a Stanley Cup in an NBA championship
with four teams. I will take that.

558
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:22,050
I'll take those two losses all fucking
day long. All Day long. But anyways,

559
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:23,130
so this past Thursday,

560
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:27,360
so I was fucking rag and about this
Brady shit as I just as I just did and I

561
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:28,980
don't want to hear anybody
giving me any shit about that.

562
00:33:28,981 --> 00:33:30,940
It continued to talk about
this cause you cause, uh,

563
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,860
continuing to talk about it on the other
side. Tar and feather in my fucking guy.

564
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:37,890
So I'm going to stick up for
him here. Um, so anyways,

565
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,370
other than the Brady thing,
last Thursday,

566
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,620
the fucking lightning were up three
games to none against the Canadians.

567
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,790
And the fucking capital's were up
three games to one against the New York

568
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,710
rangers and all I was thinking as well,

569
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:54,410
at least before that was thinking all
right, well if the rangers, Canadians,

570
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:57,140
when they play each other,
so they're gonna knock one of them out.

571
00:33:57,141 --> 00:34:00,980
So now I'm down to just one. Um, you know,

572
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:03,620
and then hopefully the ducks are the
Blackhawks. We'll finish them off, right?

573
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,430
But all of a sudden it looked like Tampa
Bay was going to win and the capital's

574
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:08,540
we're going to fucking win.

575
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,040
Okay.

576
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,720
You know, and, and they will, they,

577
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,630
they were going to get done
away with in the sammies. Oh,

578
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,450
I don't want it made me feel great.
And then what happens?

579
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,850
Canadians win game four.
Alright, did the Canadian,

580
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,790
so you got that fucking pride
that got that tradition.

581
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,640
You think you're going to sweep us? Go
Fuck Yourself. All right, come on Tampa.

582
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,260
Finish them off from five.
They fucking win game five.

583
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,340
Well they have to game six right now.
So Games six is tonight game six,

584
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,470
six tonight. And I'm going
to tell you right now, Tampa,

585
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,370
yeah,

586
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,280
I swear to God. Eisenman's gotta be
down there. He's got to go down there.

587
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,910
He's got to give him a speech because
if they lose, this one is fucking over.

588
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,430
You can never say it's over,
but it is fucking over.

589
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,333
MMM.

590
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,410
And I actually think, I think
I'm rooting for the capitals,

591
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:57,880
but I think the range of series is over.

592
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,260
I think it's fucking over the
fucking goddamn capital's man.

593
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:05,440
They just can't get over the hump. You
know? You know what's funny? It was,

594
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:08,080
I really agreed when they got
rid of their fucking coach there.

595
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,500
I didn't think he was the right
guy. Uh, I can't remember his name.

596
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:14,590
It gives a B now he's with the
ducks. Guess I was wrong. Huh?

597
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,160
They're looking like the
favorites. So anyways, it's,
it's actually going to be a,

598
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,160
I think we're probably going to be
looking at to games seven. Um, you know,

599
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:26,350
as much as I root against the
fucking Canadians in the rangers,

600
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:29,680
it's actually exciting to watch a
team come back like that. And uh,

601
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:31,360
and then also it's fucking extra hockey.

602
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,450
Okay.

603
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,160
You know,
so it was kind of a win win.

604
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:37,290
They either fucking dispose
of them quickly or I get to
watch more playoff games,

605
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,760
you know, God knows I got
the time. It's a Bruins fan.

606
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,690
God knows I got the fucking time.
Um,

607
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,000
so anyways, uh, I'm in the middle
of this run here in Boston,

608
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,550
which is really a fucking amazing thing
and I want to thank everybody who has

609
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:58,530
come out so far. I'm, I'm
really not taking this, uh,
this week lately. You know,

610
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,970
this means a lot to me that all these
shows were added and everybody comes out

611
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,760
and uh, and it's really
cool. Then I basically,

612
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:08,940
I started my career 23 years
ago right across the street,

613
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,940
or actually right across the
street now as the w hotel,

614
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:15,650
but he used to be an
empty parking lot and uh,

615
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,380
you could actually see Nick's comedy
stop. It was great. They had this,

616
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,280
they still have the sign and it lights up.
It's just blocked by the hotel now.

617
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,760
See, can't fucking see it. And they're
actually down to only two shows a week,

618
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:28,620
which kind of makes me sad,
but I got to tell you,

619
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:32,550
I'm like one of the few guys I know
that the original place where I started,

620
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,820
um, actually, uh,

621
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,640
still exists and is doing comedy. That's
pretty good. 23 years. And, and uh,

622
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,360
I tell you, I did so much stand up
in this fucking state, you know,

623
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:49,620
it was mother's Day yesterday, happy
mother's Day to all the mothers and uh,

624
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,030
took my mom out to brunch and all that
and mixed up my other relatives and stuff.

625
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,780
We all met at this restaurant and I
went in there and I was just like,

626
00:36:57,781 --> 00:37:02,490
Jesus Christ, I did stand up in this,
this space. It wasn't this restaurant,

627
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:06,600
but it was something else
like fucking 20 years ago.

628
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,920
And then the place right next to it
used to be like a ground round or a

629
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:12,900
Spaghetti Freddy's or something like that.

630
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:16,260
And I used to do stand up
in the basement of that. Um,

631
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:21,180
all these fucking memories
coming back. Um, you know,

632
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,890
great memories. Some sad, you know,

633
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,590
I always think about Patrice when I
come back here. He still, he's fucking,

634
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,370
I used to swing by, uh, you know,

635
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,850
I'd go blue hill lab and I would
turn, he lived down on, uh,

636
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,110
where did they live?
On Seaver street in West Roxbury.

637
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:43,020
I used to go down there and I pick
them up. We drive over. No did,

638
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:43,681
I used to pick him now.

639
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:46,920
He used to go into the clubs and then
I'd meet him in at the clubs and at night

640
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:49,230
I'd give him a ride home. And, uh,

641
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:54,090
so just thinking about all
of that shit and all the
fucking, uh, I don't know, man.

642
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:54,401
It's been,

643
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:56,850
it's been one of those things and not
just a bunch of people that I went to high

644
00:37:56,851 --> 00:38:01,530
school with and, uh, I've been showing
up, which is always great, you know?

645
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,770
And, uh, fortunately I had a really,
you know, some people, you know,

646
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,170
due to the high school, it hit
him with fucking great. I didn't,

647
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,160
I loved high school, I hated the
academic part, but I came a really good,

648
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:11,994
cool grade.

649
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,480
And fortunately everybody I've run into
is doing really well and they're happy.

650
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,270
And what's really cool too
is they seen the exact same,

651
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,660
I ran into a couple of kids the
other night, not even kids now. Shit,

652
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:25,770
we're fucking mid forties and uh,
it's crazy.

653
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,520
Everyone I run into for my grade, it was
just like, you know, 25, 27 years in,

654
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,830
some cases have gone by.
He just pick up,

655
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:35,160
right where you left off talking
about is hey, you know, they got kids,

656
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:35,991
whatever they're doing,

657
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:38,810
and then you just start talking
about all the dumb shit that we did.

658
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,490
Had a couple buddies of mine

659
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,260
come in last night and I'm not going
to name the name of the school.

660
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,343
Uh,

661
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,390
he was, he had this, I'll tell you the
quick version of the story. All right?

662
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:57,560
It's the late eighties. Appetite
for destruction is just catching on.

663
00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:59,570
People are playing the
fucking cassette tape.

664
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,600
We're at this party to
have my psycho friends.

665
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:06,700
One of them's gone now rest his soul.
They go to go upstairs, you know,

666
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,900
to go to a different party,
all right?

667
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,530
They both leave fucking 10
minutes later they come back.

668
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:15,620
One of them had a flat top.
He had a fucking gash going,

669
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:19,010
like almost like someone tried to
parties hair by splitting the scalpel.

670
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:23,480
He's got this fucking four inch Gash on
top of his head and the other guy's got

671
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:26,450
a separated shoulder and a fat lip.
And we're like, what the fuck happened?

672
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:29,270
They're like, oh, you know, we just
walked into this party. We said, hey,

673
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:32,180
is this a party? And they just
started beating us up, right?

674
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,800
So this fucking mob goes
up the Goddamn stairs,

675
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:42,470
right? And uh, we, you know, we're
going up the stairs, all drunk,

676
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,850
and we hear the party and the biggest
psycho out of all of us knocked on the

677
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:51,080
door. And, and the person who knows how it
goes, hello? And he goes, hey, excuse me,

678
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,280
say a party in here.

679
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,150
And the fucking dude opened the door
and then it just fucking bedlam.

680
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,150
I'll never forget the sound of that.
Cause it was all hardwood floors.

681
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,990
It was like fucking what
appeared to be 20 on 20.

682
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:06,020
Everybody throwing fucking haymakers
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

683
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,040
Long story short,

684
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:11,480
the fucking smoke clears and I'm kind
of looking over at the people we were

685
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:15,890
fighting and it's like six guys and six
women and there's a board game that's

686
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,630
fucking all over the place. Uh,
we went to the wrong part, right?

687
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,320
They were in there playing like risk or
something. And then 20 drugs came in,

688
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,930
just wasn't 20. It was like, I dunno,
it was like eight of us. And uh,

689
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,820
I dunno, the real party was upstairs.
It was funny. It was the kids upstairs,

690
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,410
they actually sued my friends cause
what they said happened didn't really

691
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:46,540
fucking happen.
So we would talk in about

692
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,540
just all of those days,

693
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,310
there's so many funny details of some
of my friends and I don't want to share

694
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:56,990
them all with you because I'm afraid
someone else is going to steal it and put

695
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:59,810
it in a script. Cause there's a couple
of details from these guys. First,

696
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,720
he's always like, dude,
that's fucking hilarious.

697
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,240
You've got to put that
in something. But, uh,

698
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,850
so we were just talking about
all those old days and uh,

699
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,601
oh my God,

700
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,420
that guy got mad at the other guy and
he threw a keg right through his fucking

701
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:14,254
windshield.

702
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,740
I got arrested for drinking and driving
because I was trying to get home to the

703
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,480
fucking patriots rams game.

704
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,110
That was when I got pulled over and I
remember the cop pulled me over and he

705
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:27,730
said, where you coming from? And I
said, ah, fuck in Boston. He goes,

706
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:30,460
fucking Boston.
You want to get out of the car please?

707
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:33,470
And I play with what a shit
show I ever want to have.

708
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:35,450
Fucking was trying to
put my finger to my nose.

709
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:40,451
It from fucking eight to 12 went
good as far as the arm movement.

710
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,290
But when I went 12 to six,

711
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,850
it felt like somebody else's hand just
came down and slap me in the head and he

712
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:47,001
goes,

713
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:49,910
you want to turn around and face the car
and put your arms out and try to stand

714
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:51,710
on one that he was just trying
to get me to end the position.

715
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:54,590
He just fucking cuff me. Uh, it was bad.

716
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,370
It was bad at a one nine,
you know,

717
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,480
thought they had the two thought I
had the two. All right, let's do this.

Burr, right? Mercifully,

762
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:42,060
the reading out loud portion
of the program is over. Um,

763
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:48,390
oh for fuck's sakes, what
happened? I, I, you know something,

764
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,010
I absolutely fucking 100% hate computers.
I had all my questions.

765
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:56,700
What happened? What does it mean when
you click on it now? There it is.

766
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,430
There it is. I like, I was just
going to ask you that. Like,

767
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:04,230
you could answer me on a
recording. Alright. Fed Up. Hey,

768
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:06,990
bill saw a great documentary called,
fed up.

769
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,950
A few things they talked about sounded
like stuff you'd mentioned on the podcast.

770
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:12,090
I was wondering if you've seen it.

771
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:16,800
It focuses on the dangers of sugar and
the addiction that most Americans have.

772
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,130
Definitely check it out if you
haven't. Um, no, I've read enough on,

773
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,520
I read, I even rent, I
mean read a little bit,

774
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,310
but I'm mostly watched a bunch
of documentaries and, uh,

775
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,390
I've pretty much found
that there they are. Uh,

776
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,030
they're right on. They're
very active. I tell you,

777
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:38,031
it's very difficult to try to eat food
now that has not been tampered with on

778
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,770
some level. And, uh,

779
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,820
I try to be empathetic to the people
that grow the food. Thinking like, well,

780
00:45:44,821 --> 00:45:48,900
you know, if you got to feed 7
billion Goddamn people or whatever,

781
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:52,380
300 whatever there is in
this country though, 300
something million, 400 million,

782
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,620
you know,
you're gonna need some pesticides.

783
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,980
Um, but, um, you know,

784
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,150
I'm trying not to talk on my cell
phone anymore with it up to my head.

785
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,080
I don't go through that airport security
with a fucking use that, you know,

786
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:15,420
x Ray light thing that they're using. I
don't go through that thing. Um, I just,

787
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:16,830
I don't fuck with any of that stuff.

788
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:21,860
I tried to avoid that as much as I can
while all the time drinking way too much

789
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,770
and occasionally smoking a cigar.
So I'm the typical fucking hypocrite.

790
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,030
We're in this room.

791
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,570
I am talking holier than now and then
in the other room I'm a fucking devil.

792
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:34,380
So I dunno, I, I recommend
that people watch that stuff.

793
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,360
You just take what you can from it.
Uh,

794
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,380
maybe you think it's total bullshit and
he keep on eating Twix bars and fucking,

795
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:44,910
you know, whatever the fuck else you
want to eat. Um, you know, have at it,

796
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,280
whatever it, she'll body folding
it, whatever you want to do.

797
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:49,620
But I'm not going to be that
person wagging your finger going,

798
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,300
we need to stop these people. They're
poisoning fucking people. You know,

799
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,530
I let somebody else do that.

800
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:58,570
Somebody else wants to fucking lead
the march down the Goddamn road. I'll,

801
00:46:58,571 --> 00:47:03,210
I'll be there. Will I? I don't
know. I have no idea. Oh God.

802
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,030
Henry Jackson would fucking slapped
me in the face with this powdered wig.

803
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,620
All right girl with no
name. Hey, big balls. Billy.

804
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:13,920
I was in New Orleans for
jazz fest last weekend, man.

805
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:17,640
And I met an absolutely gorgeous girl.
Wow, that's already a great story.

806
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,290
Went to a music festival in of
one of the great music cities,

807
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,670
probably the best music city in the
goddamn country. Relaxed Nashville.

808
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,290
Um, and you met a beautiful woman.
That's awesome. I like this already.

809
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,380
This is a movie I'm watching.
The first 10 pages I'm in. Uh,

810
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:36,890
we immediately hit it off last Saturday
and had a phenomenal night together in

811
00:47:36,891 --> 00:47:39,480
the French quarter.
The next day we didn't get,

812
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,730
we exchanged numbers and said our goodbyes
as she lives in California and I'm in

813
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:47,540
Florida. Oh, this entire,
this entire last week.

814
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:51,440
We've been texting nonstop to each
other and I'm beginning to fall into the

815
00:47:51,441 --> 00:47:55,400
first stages of love with the scale. The
problem is I did not remember her name,

816
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:59,630
but she has used mine
repeatedly. Ah, fuck dude.

817
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:02,330
We both enjoyed jobs where we have

818
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,610
where we traveled quite a bit,

819
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,970
so we are planning on having a
George Clooney slash vera Farmiga.

820
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,720
I Dunno.
In up in the air type relationship.

821
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,320
We were planning on meeting up in
New York, our memorial day week.

822
00:48:19,321 --> 00:48:22,620
My problem is I don't know the best
way to figure out what her name is.

823
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:27,120
I feel like straight up asking her name
at this point would make me come across

824
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:30,120
as a total douche bag and risk
jeopardizing the relationship.

825
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,910
Dude at that means that some
point in the French quarter,

826
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:37,320
you've already forgotten her
fucking name. Oh God. Fucking,

827
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,890
oh my God. This is making
me feel nervous. Also,

828
00:48:40,891 --> 00:48:45,390
I am afraid that continuing using pronouns
as I have them will get me in trouble

829
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:49,110
sooner than later.
When this happened in the past,

830
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:53,640
I would just tell the girl to add me
on Facebook to get her name that way.

831
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:54,474
However,

832
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:59,040
I was forced to delete my Facebook
account in my previous relationship,

833
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,720
a move. I am regretting more and more
each day and any help on a suave way,

834
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:07,710
I can attain this girl's name without
coming across as a chauvinist asshole.

835
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,010
Wouldn't be much appreciated as always.
Go Fuck Yourself.

836
00:49:11,011 --> 00:49:14,820
Well there's nothing chauvinist.
Stick above forgetting the name. Um,

837
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:19,400
and why did you have to delete
your account? What happened?

838
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,390
Hell hath no fury.
What did you do that you do something?

839
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,800
Because I would just say, well why don't
you just add your account back up again?

840
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,580
This is what you should do you have any,
I already talked about it on Facebook.

841
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:35,980
Yeah.

842
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:40,450
Just text her and say, oh no. Yeah,

843
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:43,490
I can't say where. Where's your
account? She'd be, it's under my name.

844
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:50,360
MMM.
This is what I would do.

845
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:54,970
Oh Jesus.
I would add,

846
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,830
this is why this isn't what you
fucking do. This is what you do.

847
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,160
Just create an account
under a different name,

848
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,170
like your nickname or something stupid,
you know, and you can just say like,

849
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,741
ah,
you know,

850
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:12,160
I just think sometimes he's social
network things are a little invasion,

851
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,890
an invasion of privacy and just,
ah,

852
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:21,760
man, I don't know. This is tricky. She'd
be like, well, just add me sound my name.

853
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,740
Do you know what my fucking
name is? Uh, boy. Um,

854
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,010
all right guys,

855
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,880
we're going to need some fucking help on
this one because I'm failing miserably.

856
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:33,280
You only thing I can think of
is get back on fucking Facebook.

857
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,263
MMM.

858
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,430
But when you get back on Facebook,
she's gonna be like, well,

859
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:38,990
why didn't you just go
over and fucking add me?

860
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,540
Is she on Twitter?
Ask her what a Twitter handle this.

861
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,630
There's gotta be a way to
do it through social media.

862
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:52,990
Okay.

863
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,990
I really feel at this point that I don't
know that you can fucking ask her what

864
00:50:55,991 --> 00:50:59,470
her name was. It's too fucking long at
this point to ask her what her name is.

865
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:02,380
And also to be honest with you,
the fact that he had delete your account,

866
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,470
you know,
and you've done this before in the past.

867
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,840
You sound to me like you kind
of out there crushing it.

868
00:51:07,841 --> 00:51:11,080
So I really don't feel
too, too bad for you. Um,

869
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,710
and also you probably just from
a couple of details in that,

870
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,240
whatever the fuck you did.

871
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,070
Um,
I dunno dude.

872
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:25,080
I mean, who the fuck did you date
Glenn? Close in fucking, uh, you know,

873
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,570
you got cheese and you've knows
whatever the fucking movies called.

874
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,310
Okay.

875
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,530
The attraction. Fatal attraction, right?

876
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,913
MMM.

877
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,090
Who's getting Whoa, dude, you
fucked around. And the other girl,

878
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,220
and then she just was saying
you were cheating piece of shit.

879
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,890
That's what I'm guessing.
And then you had to get off Facebook.

880
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:46,100
That's what I'm guessing.
Right? So you did that.

881
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:47,160
You fucked her friend.

882
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:48,520
Yeah,

883
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,410
Dude. Fuck this other
girl. What did you do?

884
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:54,130
I want to know I wanna I want
the second installment of this.

885
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:58,120
What did you do to get kicked off of
Facebook now that you had to take off your

886
00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:00,550
account because of a
previous relationship?

887
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,493
Huh?

888
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,120
I can tell you right now, dude,
I dunno what the fuck you did,

889
00:52:06,121 --> 00:52:08,850
but you're never going to be able to run
for political office until you address

890
00:52:08,851 --> 00:52:12,270
this part of your life right now, sir.
All right. Uh, but other than that,

891
00:52:12,271 --> 00:52:16,500
I would try to maybe somehow
through fucking Jesus Christ.

892
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:21,240
How do you do it?
It'd be fucking drunk.

893
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:23,670
Rummaging through her purse when
she goes into use the bathroom.

894
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,260
Okay.

895
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,500
Oh God. You know, I, I would judge you
if I hadn't done all of that, you know.

896
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,040
All right. Best athletes, Billy boy,

897
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:36,870
I tried that boxing workout that
you talked about on the show.

898
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,500
A run for three minutes.
Then rest for a minute. Oh,

899
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:42,370
now run for three minutes.

900
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:45,640
I said skip rope for three minutes
and rest for a minute for 12 rounds.

901
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:48,790
Kicked my ass. Thanks for
the tip. Uh, in your opinion,

902
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,370
what sport has the best
all around athletes?

903
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,013
MMM,

904
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,760
best all around athletes.

905
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,160
Okay.

906
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,530
Uh, you know, I don't know. I think
they're all fucking on me. I'll tell you.

907
00:52:59,531 --> 00:53:00,970
As far as physical condition.

908
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,823
MMM.

909
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:06,120
I W hockey players that are,
have you ever seen,

910
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:08,700
we were talking about that comics
come home. I forget who said it.

911
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:12,480
I want to give it the comic credit.
I've can't remember what it was,

912
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,141
but it wasn't me.

913
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:17,040
It was another comic who said that says
you never see a fat hockey player and

914
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:20,670
it's fucking true. And if you've
ever played the sport, you know why?

915
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,373
MMM.

916
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,420
You just don't, it's just, it's
of those sports where it's just,

917
00:53:26,421 --> 00:53:28,100
you just burn so much calories.

918
00:53:28,101 --> 00:53:32,780
You have to be in such unbelievable
physical condition that you,

919
00:53:32,781 --> 00:53:37,160
uh, what does that sound?
Um, was that a bird?

920
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,580
It was a fucking bird outside
making this weird noise.

921
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:45,010
Every time I inhaled I thought I
had a problem with my chest. No,

922
00:53:45,011 --> 00:53:46,210
I hear that again.
What is that?

923
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,320
Okay.

924
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,130
Is it the bed? Are you guys
hearing it? Is it in my head?

925
00:53:51,131 --> 00:53:54,380
But what am I losing my mind anyways?
The,

926
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,230
I dunno, those UFC guys are fucking
unbelievable. Boxes are unreal.

927
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,790
I have no idea.
Jesus Christ.

928
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:07,700
What a shit show that fucking
Pacquiao Mayweather fight was, huh?

929
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,160
Everybody's flipping the fuck out about
that thing for as he's convinced it's

930
00:54:13,161 --> 00:54:17,660
fixed. Listen to the verse he effect this
week. He sits there going like, dude,

931
00:54:17,661 --> 00:54:20,270
you could see it like when
packy I'll puts his head down.

932
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,291
I'm sitting there going,

933
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,900
well you don't think he put his head
down during the press conference because

934
00:54:23,901 --> 00:54:25,360
everyone was bitching that they,

935
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,220
they got fucked over on the
fight and he was embarrassed.

936
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:31,070
I don't think that automatically
means that there was fixed, but hey,

937
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,780
I like a conspiracy like
anybody. So anyways. All right.

938
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:36,980
How the fuck do I get out of this?

939
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:40,010
Let's just fucking go on to the next
God damn question. I'll read this thing.

940
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:44,030
I swear to God, I think I'm making that
noise when I breathe in. All right.

941
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,630
In love with the lesbian. Oh,
you fucking romantic full.

942
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,573
Um,

943
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,050
hey bill saw your show in Memphis and I
just wanted to say you fucking killed it.

944
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:54,884
Thank you.

945
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,710
I drove all the way from Arkansas
and was stoked to meet you and get an

946
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,920
autographed poster. Uh,
well thank you. Anyways,

947
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:03,650
I just wanted to get your
take on of my weird situation.

948
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,070
There's this girl I've liked since I
started Grad school and we've known each

949
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:11,330
other for four years. She's
fun, intelligent, kind in
my eyes at least. Beautiful.

950
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:16,250
Well, why'd you have to fucking
qualify it? Their thing is,

951
00:55:16,251 --> 00:55:18,860
I found out early on she
didn't play for the team.

952
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,220
I thought she didn't play for the team.
I thought she did. I was devastated.

953
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,990
Soon after that,

954
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:28,991
the woman she loved died and
she's still case taking care of,

955
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:34,010
said woman's kids from a previous
relationship. Since then, I've moved away.

956
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,640
I've tried a bunch of things to try
and get over, you know the usual shit.

957
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:41,750
Jim Bury yourself and work.
Go after other ladies.

958
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,320
I visited her intermittently
in the past four years.

959
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:48,880
Well that's not good for you and I
can't seem to stop caring for her.

960
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,950
Would love to hear what you would
do if you were in my situation.

961
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,780
Thanks again and go fuck yourself.
Um,

962
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:56,360
I think you just have to deal with the
fact that you're in love with someone

963
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:00,620
that's not going to love you and you
need to move on and just keep doing what

964
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:03,320
you're doing. Keep going to the
gym, bury yourself in your work.

965
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:05,660
I wouldn't bury yourself in work.
Who the fuck wants to work all the time.

966
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:08,660
But yeah,
instead of going after other ladies,

967
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:11,180
why don't you try to go find one that
you have something in common with.

968
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,600
All right. Thank you. If you
had to make a list right now,

969
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:17,630
somebody you would looking for to
spend the rest of your life with,

970
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:22,010
I don't think being a lesbian would be
on that list because she's not going to

971
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:26,090
get with you unless a, I dunno if
she feels like living a lie. Right.

972
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:30,620
Wrote at some point. You know what I
mean? She's going to go get her hair done.

973
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,170
Uh,
what would I would do?

974
00:56:36,171 --> 00:56:39,110
I would have faced in the fact that
you're the right person is going to come

975
00:56:39,111 --> 00:56:42,540
into your life. Ah, I would stop with
the visits because that's just, you know,

976
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:45,080
that's like going back and
hitting the crack pipe. You know,

977
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,630
you're fucking Charlie Brown
tried to kick the football again.

978
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,860
You fucking land on your back
and you get back up. And what do,

979
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:53,420
what are you doing? You
know, I would just, uh,

980
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,950
you know, I think if you want
to fucking meet somebody nice,

981
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,340
you have to start living a nice life
yourself. You know what I mean? Like,

982
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:06,060
what's funny is, you know, you see
these dance clubs, Baby B, B, B, B, B,

983
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,380
B. Nobody meets their wife or
husband in there, you know,

984
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,890
fucking roofie central,
you know,

985
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,410
everybody on fucking drugs
and glow sticks. I mean,

986
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:19,330
you just got a bunch of fucking,
you know, either immature,

987
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:23,250
a damaged people in there. You
don't put a baby in that. Well,

988
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:28,300
you don't accept somebody fucking
Goddamn baby batter us disgusting.

989
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,480
Uh, you just, yeah, get the fuck out of
there. Okay. You don't meet your wife,

990
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,950
you know,
and black light.

991
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:37,470
Yeah,

992
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:40,590
I would. Um, I don't know.

993
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:43,440
There's a lot of stuff that you can do
in your 20s to actually meet a great

994
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:45,750
person that you never really think of
doing it because you think you've got to

995
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:47,970
go out and you want to go out to bars.
You want to do all that crazy shit,

996
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:51,510
get it out of your fucking system. But
if you actually, you know, I dunno,

997
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:56,660
join like some sort of league play sports
or do some volunteer work or something

998
00:57:56,671 --> 00:58:00,780
like that, you're going to meet a great
person, you know, or a fun person.

999
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,150
Stay out of those stupid ass
fucking clubs that every guy,

1000
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,580
every mouth brie that goes to,

1001
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,330
you know the kind of people that are
going to get Brady a two game suspension

1002
00:58:09,331 --> 00:58:12,930
for a cunt hair of a fucker.
Unbelievable. Who the fuck ways the balls.

1003
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,860
Can you guys just set aside
your hatred for the Patriots?

1004
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,230
Can you just set a set aside
and then just sit there and,

1005
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,670
and on any fucking level as a fucking man,

1006
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,650
admit to what?

1007
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:29,130
The level of crybaby
horse shit that that is.

1008
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,510
Okay.

1009
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,780
Unfucking believable.
Unfucking believable.

1010
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,610
I'm trying to think of anybody that
throws a ball that doesn't doctorate every

1011
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:42,790
fucking pitcher does. Every
quarterback does. They scuffed them up.

1012
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,030
They do all kinds of fucking shit
to get them where they like it.

1013
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,700
A little fucking little
English on the Goddamn Ball.

1014
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:52,760
They all fucking do it every goddamn
one of them. He's got a fucking ritual.

1015
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,160
How they like their football.

1016
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:58,870
Do you honestly think that the reason
why you didn't make it to the NFL was

1017
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:02,470
because the ball was
in fully inflated day.

1018
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,970
The next time you play a pickup game,

1019
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:06,710
why don't you let a little bit of air
out of the ball and all of a sudden it

1020
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:09,730
will magically go everywhere
where you fucking wanted to go?

1021
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:14,620
You'd be throwing like Tom Brady.
It doesn't even fucking make any sense.

1022
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,770
Okay.

1023
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:21,220
Jesus fucking Christ.
Oh my God,

1024
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,170
this will make you guys non
patriots fans fun. Happy. Yeah.

1025
00:59:26,171 --> 00:59:30,280
I will never get over this if they fucking
tar and feather him over this fucking

1026
00:59:30,281 --> 00:59:31,114
horse shit.

1027
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:36,570
And then I want all the you who support
it rather than being pussies on the

1028
00:59:36,641 --> 00:59:37,391
fucking Internet.

1029
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:40,060
Come out to my show or what are you
gonna have to go to the shelf just

1030
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:40,820
afterwards.

1031
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:45,820
I really want you to look me in the eye
and present your argument as to why you

1032
00:59:47,371 --> 00:59:50,250
really fucking field that.
That like gave him an advantage.

1033
00:59:50,251 --> 00:59:53,130
I really want to fucking know why.
Like what fucking advantage.

1034
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,160
And you'd be going against an impartial
scientists because ESPN hired the person

1035
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,770
and God knows ESPN is in
the game of sensationalism.

1036
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,610
They didn't want that guy to fucking come
up with a study that said it wasn't an

1037
01:00:05,611 --> 01:00:09,660
advantage. Um, they wanted it
to say it wasn't advantage.

1038
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,750
And you know why I know that is because
they're completely ignoring the fact

1039
01:00:12,751 --> 01:00:15,450
that they had that study done
on their own fucking network.

1040
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:16,970
Okay.

1041
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:21,480
Hello? I'll tell you, it bugs me,
you know, all right. Dilemma. Um,

1042
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,100
your podcasts and none
of them. Uh, all right.

1043
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:30,140
So here's the dilemma for you. Uh, would
you rather spend a year in jail? No.

1044
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,240
Yeah.

1045
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,240
Having to sleep in the same cell cell
with the gay fellow named Mandingo Jones.

1046
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:42,100
Oh, Jesus. Is that the most
hackiest fucking thing ever? Um,

1047
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,791
well,
I tell you,

1048
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:47,300
I'd rather have a gay cellmate than a
fucking angry straight one that wants to

1049
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:50,630
fucking,
you know,

1050
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:53,300
you just feel like the gay guy would
be a little more gentle. You know,

1051
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,430
he's been there before. He's got
some technique gross. All right?

1052
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:00,170
Or would you rather become
a piece of shit banker?

1053
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,840
Okay,

1054
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,270
do, that's not it. It's not a dilemma.

1055
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,550
I for fucking become a banker.

1056
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:11,900
Then I'd be a mole and I'd fucking Rad
everybody out. Even then I couldn't,

1057
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:15,290
I couldn't fucking rat people out.
I'd just be going like guys, you know,

1058
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:18,410
remember that day you remember
David spades bit when he used,

1059
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,960
when he was imitating Michael J.
Fox and a,

1060
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:22,570
okay,

1061
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,810
come on,
let's not rape this girl in Vietnam.

1062
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,780
Whatever the fucking movie was
called. Was it guys? You know,

1063
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,030
what are we doing here sarge? Like
that's what I would be that guy. I mean,

1064
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:37,200
although this is a part of me that would
like to be sitting in on those meetings

1065
01:01:37,201 --> 01:01:40,890
just to hear what the fucking, just to
hear what they said. You know what I mean?

1066
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:41,820
How they present.

1067
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:45,750
Do they literally present it like let's
do something illegal or do they use

1068
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:49,440
other words where everybody just realizes
what they're presenting is not exactly

1069
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:54,441
within the boundaries and a little
game and ship gamesmanship and banking.

1070
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:00,340
I want to how they feel it feel like,
you know, although I got to tell you, um,

1071
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,370
2008 was definitely spygate
when it was fucking, uh,

1072
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:10,650
you know, when it was fucking, you
know, whatever the fuck they did. They,

1073
01:02:10,651 --> 01:02:14,310
when they oh artificially over
inflated the prices of the House,

1074
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:19,440
this $40,000 house is worth
fucking 90 grand and you what?

1075
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:22,830
You make $9 a month and
you're qualified for a loan.

1076
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:30,270
Um, anyways, whatever
Patriot anti Patriot fans,

1077
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:31,950
you want to fucking give
a shit for spy gate.

1078
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:33,960
I'll take that all day long and
they shouldn't have done it. It was,

1079
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:36,610
it was cheating. They should
not have done that. All right.

1080
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:39,600
There's a league wide memo telling
everybody to stop doing it in the arrogant

1081
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:43,380
cunt continued to do it.
I think he was guilty of arrogance.

1082
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:44,550
I think if he was actually cheating,

1083
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:48,390
I think he would have used something a
little smaller than some giant news TV

1084
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:51,360
thing fucking standing right
there on the goddamn sideline.

1085
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:54,060
But if you want to say it's
that, then you know, fine.

1086
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:57,960
If you fucking guys want to act like
your team does not do stuff to get a

1087
01:02:57,961 --> 01:02:59,460
competitive fucking edge.

1088
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,910
Think about all the guys who
are barely in the fucking NFL,

1089
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,470
barely in the fucking NFL.
And if they fucking get cut,

1090
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:12,240
they're going to go to bag and God damn
groceries that a fucking Gelson's you

1091
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:17,220
know, or even worse of
violence or a roach brothers,

1092
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:21,600
right? Or, or you know,

1093
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,430
they could maybe do a little something.
Maybe Grab Jersey here.

1094
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,540
Maybe put a little sticky
stuff on the gloves. Little,

1095
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:31,320
I'm not talking about roids here.
Not Talking about Roy.

1096
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:37,170
All right. Brady got busted for doing
steroids. Fine. Yes, you're cheating.

1097
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:42,010
All right. Absolutely. But if
you're talking about little land,

1098
01:03:42,011 --> 01:03:46,860
a little fucking a, let's do a little
this too little that each fucking play.

1099
01:03:46,861 --> 01:03:49,240
If you're gonna fucking call that
cheating, I mean, you're really going to,

1100
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,990
you kind of fun. You're going to
fucking kill everybody in the league.

1101
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,900
I would say that's what I would say.
I know you fucking sick of it.

1102
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:57,990
You think I'm a patriots fan? I am,
and I'm definitely fucking bias,

1103
01:03:57,991 --> 01:04:01,110
but I think I'm right as to you.
So what are we going to toe here?

1104
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:03,360
Agree to disagree?
Go fuck yourselves.

1105
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:06,120
Have a wonderful week and I'll
check in on you on Thursday. There.
