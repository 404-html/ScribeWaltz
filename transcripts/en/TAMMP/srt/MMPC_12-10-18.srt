1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,901
Hey,

2
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:05,190
what's going on is bill burn his time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,090
December 10th,
2019 what's going on?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,960
Ah,
Wa,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,080
you know,

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,570
how are you doing? You doing good? That's
good. I'm not my hope you are. I'm not,

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:20,711
you know,

8
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:23,770
I was going to try to tough my way through
this podcast and smile and act like

9
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:25,090
everything's fucking Rosie.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,053
MMM.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,140
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,380
Okay.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,490
It just never fucking ends. It never
ends. It never fucking ends the work.

14
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:38,790
Never fucking ads. Um, and on top of that,

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,480
I sat down and watch some sports this
weekend. Let's get it out of the way.

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,630
Oh,

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,560
how many you dolphin fans
left the sports by be honest.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,090
How many went out into the kitchen and
heard your one loyal friends still in

19
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:56,320
front of the TV going,
oh my God. Oh my God.

20
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,980
And then you ran back in like,
what happened? What happened?

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,220
Jesus fucking Christ.

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,090
Yeah.

23
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,020
That last play of that game, that live,
you know what that highlight looked like?

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,150
Not the first guy caught it.

25
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:17,370
The set or the guy latter lid to that
literally look like, you know when you,

26
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:21,100
you see an NFL, great. And then you look
at one of his high school highlights,

27
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,130
specifically the running
backs you ever notice.

28
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:28,180
It's like this 20 people on the other
team, it seems all standing around.

29
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:30,640
He just runs past all of them.
And you're like,

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,320
well why didn't they just tackle them?

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,140
Oh cause he's an NFL guy playing
against high school football players.

32
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,980
That happened against my team.

33
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,020
I felt bad for Gronk.

34
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,930
He was obviously in there because they
thought they were going to throw a hail

35
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:48,840
Mary rather than like a fucking 15,
20 yard pass.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,110
Congratulations to the dolphins.

37
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,050
You fucking own us in Miami
patriots now nine and four.

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,510
Okay.

39
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,811
Uh,

40
00:01:56,811 --> 00:02:01,530
I think it's a foregone conclusion that
the road to the circle of balls now go

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,500
stroke care. Um, it's
going to be a fun play off.

42
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,420
Um, not for patriots fans,
not the way I fucking defense
was playing, uh, yesterday.

43
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:15,230
Geez, Tom Brady. Once again,
once again, his dilemma,

44
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:17,450
how many fucking points
do I have to score?

45
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,790
How many times do I got
to put on the white hat,

46
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,480
gallop in town and fucking save
all the damsels in distress?

47
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:25,790
How many times he looks
fucking unbelievable,

48
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,720
absolutely shredded the dolphins' defense.

49
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,060
And once again comes away with the loss.

50
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,090
I would love to see he has to have the
record all time record for passing yards

51
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:42,260
in a loss. 500 yards,
300 yards, 400 yards.

52
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:46,340
It's fucking it. Four touchdowns, five,
five, three touchdown, five touchdowns.

53
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:51,020
It doesn't make a difference.
And this age of no fucking difference.

54
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,970
Um,
I'll tell ya,

55
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,380
de France is so bad that they
got drunk playing safety. Um

56
00:02:59,530 --> 00:02:59,830
hmm.

57
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,760
Jesus Christ.

58
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,760
There was so many times in that game
where we could have put them away and we

59
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,190
didn't. So, uh, but you know, it is,

60
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,010
it's a transitional year.

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,810
We lost our best running back to wide
receivers, a left tackle in a corner back.

62
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:19,640
And you know, it takes awhile for
people all to get on the same page.

63
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:24,310
You Never Deli there now, at least on
the last play of the game. Jesus Christ.

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,740
How do those guys even look at Tom Brady?

65
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,910
You know when you fucking do something
like that. Gronk was probably the,

66
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,460
hey, not for nothing. I did
catch one for you today, Tom.

67
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,570
Tom Just fucking glares at him.
Right? He puts on his legs. Um,

68
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,630
yeah.

69
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,210
Fucking brutal. Um, Brian's went
back to back. Huh? How about that?

70
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:50,820
Fucking a, that guy up there, Hyman.

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,110
Okay.

72
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,890
Hitting Charlie Mcavoy,
Mr. Game.

73
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:57,760
Cause I've been on going to these fucking
Christmas parties and shit out here.

74
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:58,750
Still ever drank.

75
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,530
Still have not drank fucking 15
days and feel good about myself.

76
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,130
Uh,
fuck it.

77
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,100
Thousand 1002. Oh, I mean Mcavoy, I
think that was his first game back.

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,690
But uh, either way, we're, uh,

79
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,750
we're winning games when it games with
the new coach and all that and uh,

80
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,850
I'm open.
I'm going to actually get some time.

81
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,280
I follow them on Twitter or whatever.

82
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:23,050
I watched the highlights and shit so
I know what's going on and beat Ottawa

83
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,010
tonight to one and over time.

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,433
MMM.

85
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,270
I Dunno. I'm just trying to spend
time with the family, baggies g, uh,

86
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,150
but having a great time.
Uh,

87
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,400
okay.

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,810
What am I relative spot this
motorized car for my daughter.

89
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,560
And she liked it the first day and
then I don't know what happened.

90
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,110
I think she pushed the button and
it ran over a little foot, you know,

91
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:48,610
and then she's kind of like,
what's with this thing?

92
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,870
So she kind of stayed away from it.

93
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:54,790
So finally tonight I just got on the
thing at the risk of breaking it and I was

94
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,500
just going up and down the hallway going

95
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,560
and then finally she wanted to get on it.

96
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,630
And uh,

97
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,250
then all of a sudden then now
she doesn't want to get off it.

98
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,340
It was pretty awesome.

99
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,460
Um, she doesn't get steering or
stopping yet, but I just sort of a

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,130
okay.

102
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,460
You know, I just sort of run
along with the, you know,

103
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,000
bent at the waist for maximum fucking up,
have my dad back.

104
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,150
You know what I mean? I'm
telling you, your dad,

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,700
you got to get one of those
foam rollers every night.

106
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:33,600
And every morning I'm just on the
floor rolling out my back. It's great.

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,480
It's great sometimes in
the middle of the day,

108
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:38,850
but I must have for like 40 minutes

109
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,800
running around like fucking
Igor and Frankenstein,

110
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:48,801
like literally a 90 degrees bent at the
waist to try and running behind her,

111
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,640
trying to steer this thing so she wouldn't
drive it to chairs and countertops

112
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,483
and all of this shit.

113
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,320
Okay.

114
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,340
Then when she was done,
I went to stand

115
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,970
up on it.
Just did the AH,

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,780
but it was worth it cause that's
my buddy. Um, I also watched, um,

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,190
liver Liverpool verse born Mouth,

118
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,900
B. O. U. R N e m. O. U. T. H, uh,

119
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,010
told you I was going to start
watching them. Uh, Jesus Christ,

120
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:26,210
most Salah four goals.
Does that ever happen?

121
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,930
I felt like I was watching some Wayne
Gretzky shit every time I watched that guy

122
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,400
other than the World Cup didn't
go so well for Egypt Air.

123
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,740
But he scored a bunch of goals and I
really enjoyed it and I got to tell you,

124
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,270
it's raining out once again.

125
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,620
And I had this ridiculous urge to start
drinking some Guinness was some fucking

126
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,980
shots of Jameson and I'm just
like a, you know, it's weird.

127
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:50,870
Everything about Great Britain,
Ireland, anything over there

128
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,870
just makes me want to drink.

129
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,320
Okay.

130
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,430
Cause I think those are the movies
that I see. You know, bakey blinders.

131
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,610
Don't know nothing about no robbery.
Right.

132
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,120
All they do is booze on that show and
they're not throwing their little sharp

133
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:09,510
hats at people. Uh, you know,

134
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,840
Ireland is fucking Ireland,
Scotland, you know,

135
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:16,920
they're up there drinking that fucking
pine tar looking beer. Just, you know,

136
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,500
it's always raining. What do you want
to do on your terrain and out? You know,

137
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,370
you want to start boozing but a really
shit fucking defense in that game or I

138
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:27,091
didn't I be naughty.

139
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:30,180
I finally understood that I'm starting
understand offsides a little bit more.

140
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:33,750
I guess I get it because
the goal is so big.

141
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:37,140
You can't have people just running
all around. Be fucking great.

142
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:42,010
If he could though. I think what the,
the, the thing that I would adjust.

143
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,540
Okay.

144
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,620
On,
um,

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,233
yeah,

146
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
if, if I was, if I was to buy into
a soccer league here in America,

147
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,090
I would make the goal smaller and then
I would just have a blue line in hockey.

148
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,900
And once she got into the zone,

149
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:02,710
whoever was the fastest motherfucker
to get out front, you know,

150
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,810
he just make the goal a little bit
smaller. Somewhere between shocker size,

151
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:11,170
goal in highlight, you
know, somewhere in there.

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
Bigger than an NHL goal.
Obviously it's a giant fucking ball.

153
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,600
Good.

154
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,520
Sorry I'm recording this late at night.

155
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,790
I gotta I gotta be up with
the kid tomorrow morning.
Second. I do this, but uh,

156
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,230
I really enjoyed it. Now what's the
next game? What's the next game we have

157
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,510
out there in fucking a premier
league? Let's see here. Uh,

158
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,250
liver Liverpool.
You can't Liverpool

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,310
sure.

160
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,140
Ball

161
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,720
shed. You'll come on,
come on. There we go.

162
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,160
Bump up Blah dude.
And I thought they had another guy.

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,980
Oh this one's at 1219.
I need 1218

164
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,583
yeah,

165
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,780
definitely want to see that man.
United game.

166
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,610
Cause I know they're like
the fucking Yankees. Oh,

167
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:04,500
we Liverpool versus Napoli is going to
be another one of these these football

168
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,240
clubs with the really small stadiums.

169
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,260
It makes me feel guilty for Rutan for
Liverpool to see somebody with one of

170
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:13,320
those cute little stadiums are like,
well damn I gotta root for these guys.

171
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,810
It was like the Kansas city royals
or the fucking premiere league.

172
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,650
Then they got man United. Then they, then
they are up against wolves. Does not.

173
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,690
I don't,
that does not ring a bell.

174
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,260
Okay.

175
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,040
Is that one of those
little last stadium clubs,

176
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,280
was that going to be one of those
fucking Illuminati Freemason fucking,

177
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,850
it's Kinda creepy logo and kind of
like it Newcastle's new castle. Right.

178
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:40,300
That's a bigger place. Arsenals arsenal.
I know. Those are the bigger ones. Right?

179
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,000
I think it's some big games,
man. United in ourself.

180
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,060
I recognize them 1216 and 1229
I'll be watching those games,

181
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:52,340
you know, if I'm allowed to
from allowed to, you know,

182
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,470
you know it was a guy you don't call the
fucking shot still. Yeah. No you do not.

183
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,720
You know. Ah Jeez. What a fucking
weird mass. On a weird week.

184
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:03,460
It's just sort of a normal week now.
You know,

185
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:05,560
people dig it back into people's tweets.
Yeah.

186
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:09,700
You fucking said them when you said this
back on you that you were this person

187
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:13,240
that you no longer our member when you
fucking did that and then somebody else

188
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:14,800
comes along or what about these people?

189
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,020
They fucking did that and then
the whole world it's like,

190
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:21,700
well they have vaginas so it doesn't
count. I saw this fucking lady,

191
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:26,701
the lady former Miss Kentucky said
naked pictures to a 15 year old student.

192
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,570
Yeah, you watched the slap
on the wrist. She gets, um,

193
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,230
so it works.
That's the world we live in.

194
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,470
They have victims and they never get
punished for some reason I just don't

195
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,570
understand it. And I thought we
were going for a quality here.

196
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,400
It's like if you fuck
up, you fuck up. Right.

197
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:46,510
Everybody gets fucking the same
fucking pound of flesh taken. No,

198
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,700
cause that now works.
I Dunno how it works.

199
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,300
Okay.

200
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,520
All I know is now is I'm
feeling like this is like,

201
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,940
it's going to become a world where
it's just like, ah, you know,

202
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:01,050
I'll kind of do that job, but I don't
want to be the guy doing the job job.

203
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,190
I'll be on the outskirts of the guy doing
the job cause I'm, I'm not going to,

204
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,024
you know,

205
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,110
okay.

206
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,490
You know,
people just,

207
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,420
I don't know this whole fucking
world now where like people are just,

208
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,730
Oh that guy's successful
or she's successful level,

209
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:18,840
let's go back and let's just try to
fucking ruin whatever they're doing.

210
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,010
I think if you fucking do that,
someone should go back into your life,

211
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,790
interview a bunch of people and let's
see if you're a good fucking person.

212
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,680
Because if you're not, I mean,
what the fuck's going on?

213
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,120
Then you just bring in a cunt.

214
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,450
He just upset because somebody
else has something that you don't,

215
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:38,800
is that what it is? I Dunno. Anyways, so

216
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,260
today I went to this awesome birthday
party. It was a friend of ours.

217
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,930
So we go over there, my lovely life
and my beautiful daughter. Right.

218
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,750
And

219
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,660
it's like a two year old birthday.
So we fucking go over there and uh,

220
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,360
we're having a great time.
And then there's one big kid there,

221
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:04,450
she's like six years old. She's like the
oldest sister or somebody or whatever.

222
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,790
And she's got like this giant like
not like doll house. It's like a,

223
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,950
I got tree fort but it's on the ground.
You know,

224
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,390
it's like a doll house that
a kid can go into the fuck.

225
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:18,460
Do you call that clubhouse? I
don't know what it is. Right.

226
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,980
So she's in there in the, in the dude
like whose daughter was hooked it up,

227
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,370
had like a doorbell and had a sign with,

228
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:30,371
with the six year old girl's name on it
in a little phone jack thing in there.

229
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,080
I mean this thing was,
was awesome.

230
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,030
So she was in there and she was like
preparing breakfast or whatever and oh my

231
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:40,300
God,
did I bomb in front of this six year old?

232
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,450
Every time I went left I should have
went right, right. It was hilarious.

233
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,470
Like I sat down,

234
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,270
I was standing like watching my daughter
going in and out of the doors, right.

235
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,850
And then she announces,
she goes,

236
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:54,820
I made pine cones for breakfast.

237
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,460
So I see this little seat that you sit
outside almost like a for a serving

238
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:04,240
windows. So I sat down,
I said, oh, I go, thank,

239
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,170
thank you very much for making
me a pine cone. She goes,

240
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,650
I didn't give it to you yet.
And I went, Oh shit. Sorry.

241
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,050
So then she hands it to me and I go,
thank you. I go, how much is that?

242
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,570
And she goes, it's not for sale.
She goes, they're not for sale.

243
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,430
And I was like, oh, all right, sorry.

244
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,920
I thought it just struck me as like a
little lemonade stand. I'm thinking,

245
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:30,550
it's like, all right. And then she
looks at me and she goes, it's 1250.

246
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,530
So then I pretend to count out
$12 and 50 cents. And she goes,

247
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,950
now that's not what it costs.
She goes, that's what time it is.

248
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,280
Like, Alrighty then I'm
going to leave. Cause, uh,

249
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,650
evidently I have the intellect of a three
year old because you're destroying me.

250
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,750
She got me three times in a row. Thank
you for making me, uh, for the pine cone.

251
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,920
She goes, I didn't give it to
you yet. How much do I owe you?

252
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,540
It's not for sale. It's
1250. Here's your 1250.

253
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,080
That's not the price. It's the
time. I was just like, wow,

254
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,530
this takes me back to when I was in
school. Whatever I said was just,

255
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:19,380
was just, it just, I don't know.
But anyways, I still had a,

256
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:22,180
a a great time,
you know,

257
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,700
daughter figuring out some stuff,
you know,

258
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:28,090
how to go down the slide and
all of that stuff. And um,

259
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,630
you know, kids, they kind of go to
this thing, we're in the beginning,

260
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,820
they're like really outgoing.
At least my daughter was.

261
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,650
And then they get shy and then, you
know, we got her to be outgoing against.

262
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:39,550
So it's kind of cool watching
him do that. And I was, you know,

263
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,010
it's kind of cool cause I was like in the,

264
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,930
I was in the valley area kind of
out by Van Nuys Airport and um,

265
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,170
just the way the wind was blowing,
you know,

266
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,890
the planes would an off to like I guess,
I don't know if it was the north,

267
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:57,050
but sort of not towards lax.

268
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:00,710
They were headed the other way and
they'll kind of going over the house,

269
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,060
which I thought was awesome.

270
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,750
And then I looked in the alley and
there was a guy with like this one floor

271
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:10,100
house, any heat. He had a
wind sock on top of his,

272
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:14,720
a on top of his roof. Um,
and I'm thinking like,

273
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,810
is that guy like a pilot?
Like what?

274
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:18,740
Like who the fuck could
see that from the air?

275
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,140
But in a way it was kind of
cool that he was doing it.

276
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,450
Maybe he's a pilot and he
goes out and he'd just,

277
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:26,090
cause he takes off from there and just
kind of a straight shot down to the

278
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,410
airport.
He just sort of looks at it,

279
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,630
but then he could just listen to the
fucking 80 said anyways to know which way

280
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,240
he's going to take off.
I Dunno,

281
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,710
I just never seen a wind sock on top of
anything other than a skyscraper or at

282
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,610
least someone with like a Helo pad
on it. For those of you, you know,

283
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,680
don't want to talk about it just basically
shows which way the wind's blowing.

284
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:45,920
And you always take off
and land into the wind, um,

285
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,810
for optimal performance.
Um,

286
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,320
and the last thing you do is you
don't want to have it at your back.

287
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,970
That's not a good thing. Um, anyways.

288
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,620
Uh, but we were driving up
there and it's just like,

289
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,280
I always knew people drove crazy or I
don't like driving on the highway with my

290
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:05,390
kid. I just don't people out here, if
anybody out here is listening in La,

291
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:06,741
you know,

292
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:09,020
I know this isn't going
to make a difference cause
there's so many of you guys

293
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:13,520
out here, but like that fucking shit will
you pass people on the right hand side.

294
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,730
You really gotta be key. You're going
to fucking kill somebody. You know,

295
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,440
you passed somebody on the left,
the further left you go,

296
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,170
the faster you go.
All Right,

297
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,000
the furthest left that you can go.
That's the people driving the fastest.

298
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,180
You don't drive that fast
in the first fucking lane.

299
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,900
Somebody is trying to get off the highway.
They're making their way over.

300
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,220
Now all of a sudden they got to be going
like 80 miles an hour to get off the

301
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:46,760
fucking highway. What are you doing? Um,

302
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,160
I just think it's because this,

303
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,810
there's so many lanes late til like six
lanes out here on either side that I

304
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,180
think all the rules,
it just becomes,

305
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,340
I don't know what it is and
there's so much traffic.

306
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:01,310
I just feel like people are just
like, oh my God, an open fucking lane.

307
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,660
I can go a quarter of a mile and not
have to hit the brakes. And they just,

308
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,590
they just fucking
slammed the gas down.

309
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:14,060
Whatever the hell it is they're
doing. But um, it's really unsettling.

310
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:14,930
And then I'm sitting there with any,

311
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:18,740
I don't want to fucking snap and I can't
kiss my kids in the car cause I don't

312
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:22,160
want to fucking be that guy.
Um,

313
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,170
I dunno dude. But anyways, I'm doing
some benefits out here this week. Uh,

314
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,910
I believe Thursday night I'm going
to be up at the ice house and on a,

315
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,050
then I'm also doing one at the,
uh,

316
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,490
the Fonda theater for, um, for, uh,

317
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,160
who the hell is it for the comedy store?

318
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,160
So that's what I'm doing this week. I've
got a couple of those things. I mean,

319
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,020
I gotta be doing my,
try

320
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,620
to take some time off
before I go to Europe,

321
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:54,320
but I also have to be on my
game when I go to Europe.

322
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,020
So it's sort of a slippery slope,

323
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,560
but I got a bunch of new shit
that I want to talk about.

324
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:04,880
I can't wait to talk about
it. Uh, get on stage here. Um,

325
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,080
tomorrow night I think I'm going to head
out somewhere here in La and tried to

326
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:11,930
get on some stage to get some stage time,
I should say.

327
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:15,410
And I still have not fixed
my headphone Jack here,

328
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,600
but I am done flipping
out about it because

329
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:18,700
yeah,

330
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,150
I'm trying to be a
better man. Um, anyways,

331
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:26,800
so when somebody gets, so when some
woman gives a speech at an awards show,

332
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,720
I could sit there nodding like, yes,
I did the work. I've done the work.

333
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,490
I understand now. Uh, simply safe.

334
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,340
Everybody makes sure nothing becomes,

335
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,800
make sure nothing comes between you and
protecting your family this holiday and

336
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:49,690
save hundreds of dollars while you're
at it with simply safe home security.

337
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,700
Uh, if a storm takes out your
power, simply safe is ready.

338
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,750
If an intruder cuts your phone line,
simply safe is ready.

339
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,830
Say They destroy your
keypad or siren simply.

340
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,520
Staples still get you the help you need.
These guys are like the terminator.

341
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,520
Nothing stops them.
Maybe it's overkill.

342
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,220
Maybe it's the last thing you
want to think about this holiday.

343
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:17,200
But with simply safe, you're always ready.
Simply safe believes nothing should be,

344
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,140
should get between you and
protecting your family.

345
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,590
That's why they only charge
you what's fair, what's right.

346
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,580
1499 a month, no contracts, no markups.

347
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,110

349
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,870
hundreds of dollars on that protection.

350
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:40,050
If you go to simply safe burg.com that's
simply safe bird.com but hurry this

it out there, put it out there. Overbuild.

358
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,020
Make more than what is needed.

359
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,353
MMM.

360
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,430
I mean out here in La, I swear to
God, it's like every other block.

361
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:25,020
They're just knocking shit down and then
putting up a luxury high rise apartment.

362
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,230
Um, and they're forced
to and like, you know,

363

364
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:35,880

like seems to me that's like for the,

365
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,220
the upper 10% of people.

366
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,750
And it's 100% of the buildings that
seem to be getting built out here.

367
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,523
MMM.

368
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,830
I Dunno what the fuck.
I know I'm just a goddamn comedian,

369
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,950
but I would invest in simply safe because
there's going to be a bunch of fucking

homeless people trying to
break into the house. Uh Oh.

Okay.

Um, what do you have on your holiday
list? And I still have this fucking head,

406
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:07,840
phone, Phone Jack, whatever the fuck
you call it. When I learned what it is,

407
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:09,640
then I feel like I can order it,
you know,

408
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,600
as opposed to just ordering a bunch of
shit that sort of looks like it. Um,

409
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,550
is it a jack?
Is it an adapter?

410
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,410
Yeah.

411
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,080
Um, I don't know what it is. Uh,
what else do I have on my list?

412
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,820
Okay.

413
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,200
I Dunno. I really don't know what
the final, I know I have something

414
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,230
we wish you a merry Christmas
cause it's called outside baby.

415
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:39,700
It's cold outside.

416
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,080
Okay.

417
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,080
What do I have for, what is my wish
for Christmas? I wished it all.

418
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:47,880
Or do you guys have a very merry Christmas
and that they tried and tried to take

419
00:23:47,881 --> 00:23:49,170
any music away from you.

420
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,343
You know,

421
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,400
they're going to start with that song
and I figured about three months they're

422
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:58,180
going to go after Aerosmith
for walk this way. You know,

423
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,330
she could walk out
whatever way she wants to.

424
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,173
MMM.

425
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,480
Maybe a couple of books.
I'm reading a book right now,

426
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:13,500
Bob Cousy and Bill Russell
that I'm really enjoyed. Uh,

427
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,480
I'm telling me to get back to books.

428
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:19,380
I keep threatening that I'm going to go
back to church and start reading books

429
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:20,490
that are going to go back to church.

430
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:23,850
Then I'm gonna start burning the books
that I'm reading and then I'm going to go

431
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:26,490
to a remote island and get
shot with bows and arrows.

432
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,600
That's how I'm going to go out. That's
my, that's on my Christmas list anyways.

433
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,630
How many errands do you have to run a,
I got a couple more.

434
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,160
How is stamps.com helping you save
time this holiday season? Well,

435
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:40,830
once I buy this shit,
I don't have to go to the post office.

436
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:44,850

445
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,040
[inaudible] that stamps.com enter bar.

446
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,200
You know,
I really wonder how the fuck these guys,

447
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,170
I don't know.

448
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,100
We will be screaming and yelling about
shit that's in people's Twitter feeds.

449
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,173
And meanwhile,

450
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,240
the bankers are about ready to fuck fuck
over another generation of retirees.

451
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,320
And once again, they will not go
to jail. You know what I mean?

452
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:42,740
And I got to fucking sit here and
listen about gender neutral bathrooms.

453
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,610
You know? Do you know what are you guys
have in your house or your apartment?

454
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,650
You know what you're already have.
You have a gender neutral,

455
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,310
a fucking bathroom.

456
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,330
As long as you got to sit down toilet.
I mean,

457
00:25:58,331 --> 00:26:03,331
that pretty much covers the
entire spectrum of way a
human being can go to the

458
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,830
bathroom,
you know?

459
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,980
But I want to find that
half my fellow at on it

460
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,980
me, while they're building another luxury
high rise apartment with fucking old

461
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:18,610
people's money, our money and our will
live long enough to fucking get out of it.

462
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,600
I don't know what the fuck
we're doing need to do, man,

463
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:26,460
is we need to legalize weed at a federal
level and we need to export it and we

464
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,780
need to get the world high.

465
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:30,660
So they like us again and
then we take all that money.

466
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,640
We pay for this never ending war.

467
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,630
And then meanwhile we get onto some sort
of fucking electrical and solar power

468
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,420
even though at the end of the
day it's probably not cleaner.

469
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,990
But what it will do is put all these
fucking people out of business because

470
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,040
won't have any oil money. They'll
pay the Turks they want to go is up.

471
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,430
Why don't we do that?

472
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,580
And everybody will be having
a Holly jolly Christmas.

473
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,360
It's the best time of the year.
Buba to beat [inaudible].

474
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,880
I don't know if they'll be snow.
I'm gonna see you guys some carols,

475
00:27:04,881 --> 00:27:09,200
but have a cup capa. Cheer.
All right. I been dealt with,

476
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:10,850
we got some good emails this week.

477
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,753
MMM.

478
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,420
I have no idea. Oh, oh, I want to
thank rich eyes. And by the way,

479
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:21,080
for having me on his show, I had a
great time, man. He's such a good dude.

480
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,980
Just a really good fucking person.
And uh,

481
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,253
you know,

482
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,930
all the people that are over,
they're hilarious.

483
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,730
I had such a fun time on that show. You
know, they were saying how Peter was,

484
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,370
you know, it was raining
crazy that day. And, and,

485
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,230
and I guess they got some sort of
warning where they were saying, you know,

486
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:39,820
Peter was saying,
you know,

487
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:43,810
you shouldn't say it's raining cats and
dogs any more because if they actually

488
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,980
were falling out of the sky
from a rain cloud, they get
hurt. It's just like, yeah,

489
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,370
well we understand gravity, but
that's never happened. Okay.

490
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,990
So of course I went in there.

491
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,320
Okay,

492
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,680
how do you not, you know,
it's like Jesus Christ,

493
00:27:57,681 --> 00:28:00,140
it's raining cats and dogs out there.
It's a frog.

494
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:04,900
Strang you could drown a fucking moose
out there. Um, and I love animals.

495
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,670
You know, I love animals as
much as I hate pushy cunts.

496
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,470
Uh, yeah. Pushy fucking cunt. All
right. Wikipedia searching. Hey,

497
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:19,471

499
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,790
If you use Firefox or chrome,
there's a setting in the

I'm not going into help.
I've done that too many times.

535
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,620
I fucking ask a question and it never
answers the question that I fucking asked.

536
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,360
You know, I've just been hurt too
many times. Do you know what I mean?

537
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,290

Be a nub cause you won't get water.
Then you go out in the trash.

542
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,870

Tan and bomb. Oh, Christmas
tree. How lovely are there?

555
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,480
I don't know what a bow is.
I don't want to tan it. Bomb.

556
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:55,320
That's like a rich person's last name.

the holidays when you know what all his

560
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:10,000

563
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,103
Okay.

564
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:17,680
Oh,

565
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,680
bomb is a German Christmas song based
on a traditional fast and what I want

566
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:27,880
Wikipedia you fucking
intrusive. Cons. Oh Tana Boggis.

569
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,130
I guess all that means is all
that means tree in, Oh shit.

570
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,200
When I go to Germany next month,

571
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:47,220
I'm gonna have to sing that to all those
fucking crowding and sons of bitches

572
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,270
over there.
Oh,

573
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,530
old Tynan bomb. [inaudible] bomb, um,

574
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,130
is a German Christmas song based
on a traditional folk song.

575
00:32:56,131 --> 00:33:01,131
It became associated with the traditional
Christmas tree by the early 1920s and

576
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:03,360
sung as a Christmas Carol.

577
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,960
The modern lyrics were written in 1824
by leaps zig by the leap Sig organists

578
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,820
teacher and composer Ernst options.
Shush.

579
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,570
A Tannenbaum is a fir tree.

580
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,700
The lyrics do not exactly actually
referred to Christmas tree or describe a

581
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:24,930
decorate Christmas tree.

582
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,140
Instead they refer to the first evergreen
quality as a symbol of constancy in

583
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:32,430
faithfulness. Oh, I see.

584
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:38,160
This guy was alone in the woods, started
having fucking failings about a tree.

585
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,020
You know what I mean?

586
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,430
Yet we still complain in this country
crisis. People in Germany, right?

587
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:49,650
And songs about trees. Well, I
guess we have tree huggers here.

588
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,160
You know,
eventually whoever the pita is for trees,

589
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:59,640
who's at fucking Greenpeace,
you know,

590
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,720
they're not going to like the expression
tree hugger because the tree has no say

591
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,490
in that physical contact.
So in a way it's a form of assault.

592
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,410
Um, all right. The first known
decorated Christmas tree, dear Billy,

593
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,250
ghost of Christmas past. I really
do look like that though. I did.

594
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:20,760
You know that on your tour of Europe
you'll be stopping in the city where the

595
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:25,500
oldest recorded decorating of a Christmas
tree went down. I didn't know that.

596
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,530
Ragga or Riga,
Latvia.

597
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,460
That almost sounds like two
characters on fucking taxi.

598
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,640
Riga and Laca Riga,
Latvia.

599
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,820
Heard a friend talking about it
and immediately thought of you.

600
00:34:38,821 --> 00:34:41,880
What's your favorite way to
decorate a tree? I quickly,

601
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,980
uh, without my wife in the room
telling me I'm doing it wrong.

602
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,960
Um, what else? Um, I dunno, I, I,

603
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:55,380
my favorite way to decorate tree
would be a, with my lovely wife,

604
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,940
with some Eggnog, with some Christmas
music on a little booze in the egg.

605
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:04,410
Nog We do a little slow dance.
I kiss her under a missile toe,

606
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,633
you know,

607
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,260
one of the last year she can do that
because that's a major crisis for white

608
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:15,000
women that you know, that there's
mistletoe out there, I guess. You know,

609
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:17,700
they really have a lot of problems and
that's like one of the ones right on the

610
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:18,960
top of the list.
You know,

611
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,220
I mean forget about climate change and
that swirl a trash in the Pacific Ocean.

612
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,263
Can't even say it.

613
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,050
I think what we need to get down to first
off is what's the deal with mistletoe.

614
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,890
Um, okay. Anyways, I, uh,

615
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,350
when you have camel toe
during the hozzle holidays,

616
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:47,940
is that called mistletoe reverse?
Mistletoe upside down. Inverted mistletoe.

617
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,280
I Dunno. Uh, when I was a kid we made
ornaments in school with macaroni. Yeah.

618
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:55,110
Then you'd spray painted gold.

619
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,460
Okay.

620
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,020
Uh, macaroni glitter and
white glue and shit like that.

621
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,610
I doubt that they do that anymore.

622
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:04,750
Thanks and love to you and
the family and the mom,

623
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,540
Photoshop guy who lets me see
you and all your imaginary glory.

624
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,660
Uh, yeah, we use those used
to be a thing like, um,

625
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,550
I made, you know, yeah, you still make
ornaments. I remember there was one,

626
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,890
it's like it took a coffee cup.

627
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,490
Okay.

628
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,340
And then some, one of those
pipe cleaner things, you know,

629
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,420
you cut a hole in the bottom of the cup
and yet I know somehow you ran a piece

630
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,660
of macaroni and it's supposed to look
like a bell and the top of the pipe

631
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,340
cleaner coming through was the handle.

632
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,820
Then they,

633
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,760
then they would make a cardboard cutout
of a little or a paper cut out of a, uh,

634
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,410
a Christmas tree. Then you put a bunch
of macaroni on it for whatever reason,

635
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:49,580
macaroni was a big deal.

636
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:53,570
You'd glue it to the paper and then you'd
spray painted gold and then he'd give

637
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:55,040
it to your mother.
And she looked at it like,

638
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:57,050
that is the ugliest fucking
thing I've ever seen.

639
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:58,910
But my kid made it and I loved my kids.

640
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:01,640
So that will now go on
the fucking front door

641
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,860
until you're 47.
Um,

642
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,910
yeah, I dunno, I'm not,
you know, I like ornaments.

643
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,300
I wish we had a lot more of them,

644
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:17,490
but like I don't like
those Christmas tree shops.

645
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:21,390
They creep me out and like really

646
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,180
people that, that go in there are
weird in a way that I'm not weird.

647
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,620
And what however are weird is it
just fucks with my weird and I get,

648
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:35,690
I get all weirded out man. And I just
fucking, I just leave. I can't do that.

649
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,270
You know,

650
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,370
I'm trying to get to the point where I'm
not saying that there were a bunch of

651
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,040
fucking Weirdos in there
cause I know I'm weird. Right.

652
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,710
But I go in there and it's like a,

653
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:49,690
you know, plus I don't like
clutter. I don't like a bunch
of shit around my house,

654
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,883
you know what I mean?

655
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:52,770
Yeah.

656
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,240
It's like those people that like,
you know,

657
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:59,490
he'd go buy somebody's house and
every year they have like, you know,

658
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:03,360
those figurines and shit that
they put in the front yard.

659
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,660
And every year you see the same
ones and then they add a few more.

660
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,390
Okay.

661
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:14,160
Yeah. Have you ever thought about like
where the fuck do they put those things?

662
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,870
The other 11 months of the year.

663
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:22,320
Like how much of that of the garage is
that taking? Like it's the middle of July.

664
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,660
It's hot as shit.
You going in there,

665
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:28,260
you're trying to find the cooler and
then you're walking by like reindeer and

666
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:32,010
snow men and all that. That's just, that's
just, that's too fucking weird for me.

667
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,900
You know, I don't want to step
over that shit. Right. I just,

668
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,743
we just have like,

669
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,780
we just had the Christmas tree lights and
then we just put the bulbs on it and I

670
00:38:45,081 --> 00:38:48,140
put them on the tree and my
wife's stands back and she, uh,

671
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,030
well this year she did it that way. You
know, she always decorated in other years.

672
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,190
This year we've got the kids,

673
00:38:55,191 --> 00:38:59,840
so she was just kind of holding her and
telling me there's too many blue ones

674
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:03,200
there. You need a little more red
and then put some green over there.

675
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,670
And uh, you know, so there was that.

676
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,120
I probably would enjoyed that more if I
was boozing. I'm not going to lie to you,

677
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,840
but, um, but I didn't, I wasn't,

678
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,150
I've been drinking my eggnog straight
this year with the little shot of nutmeg.

679
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,420
Okay.

680
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,840
And, um, if I sound bored shitless, I am.

681
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,400
Yeah.

682
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,010
It's this time of night, it's nine 10
at night. This is the time of night.

683
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:32,480
We'll usually, you know, I'm having
a good time and I just don't anymore.

684
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,060
But I will tell you in the morning's
the best thing about being sobers the

685
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,710
fucking morning, you know, you wake up,

686
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:41,090
you feel like a fucking
million bucks and um,

687
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,980
okay.

688
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,460
Yeah, I dunno. Anyways, it's
always a weird time of year.

689
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:49,760
I love the holidays and
it's also depressing that
another fucking year went by.

690
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,640
But then the second is January 1st
and like, it's all ahead of me.

691
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,350
I'm going to make those changes.
How many to become a better person?

692
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,650
Uh,
if air,

693
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,000
okay,

694
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,290
if air,
why not buy,

695
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:04,700
see a dear Billy frisbee frown.

696
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,050
I don't even know what that means.
I don't want to know about that means.

697
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:12,140
I don't know. I don't know that. I don't
need to know that. My frown is weird too.

698
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,040
I already have enough physical
fucking hangups. Frisbee frown.

699
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm bill.
I'm a,

700
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm a little behind on the podcast since
I watched my one year old girl fulltime.

701
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,760
Oh yeah.
But you hit the lottery.

702
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,320
They're the best and have to censor
what I play in my house now. Yeah,

703
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,530
yeah. I understand that. Um,

704
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:39,190
he says a little while ago you were
explaining that you choose not to go into

705
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:45,251
the ocean saying that it's an unnecessary
risk and basically that we don't

706
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:49,100
belong in there compared to the
other animals that do belong.

707
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,300
I don't disagree with you.
Okay.

708
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,750
But I am just wondering by that logic
how you justify going after your pilot's

709
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:04,241
license license or whatever it takes
to fly your worldly birds and the like.

710
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,300
I was hoping you would compare this
while you were talking about it,

711
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:09,890
but I don't think you ever did.

712
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,910
Obviously as humans we take a
lot of crazy risks every day.

713
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,230
Like just getting in a car and going
70 miles per hour. Yeah, I know.

714
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:22,360
And doing that in the left hand lane and
all it takes is one fucking asshole and

715
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:27,320
the other side you ever see that shit or
where the t the the fucking 18 wheeler

716
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,690
jack knives and comes
over on the other side.

717
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,200
Okay.

718
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,740
You know, I got the kid in the car now
so I try to stay in the right lane,

719
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:38,510
but everybody's doing 90 miles an hour
out here on it. I'll try. It's crazy.

720
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,860
Anyways,
but I would like,

721
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,240
I would think the pilot thing would
fall under the same category is taking a

722
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:48,170
swim on the beach.
Thanks as always for the great podcast.

723
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:51,830
My wife always knows if I have you on
my headphones by the stupid grin on my

724
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:56,780
face, go fuck yourself. Um,
great question sir. Um, well,

725
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,810
the reason why I got a pilot's license
was because I read up on the banking

726
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:05,510
system and realized that it
was a giant Ponzi scheme.

727
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,440
And I was afraid because of how
dysfunctional the city that I live in is,

728
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,790
you know, you can barely get out of it
when everybody, when it's all working,

729
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:20,910
forget about if the shit hit the fan,
how would I get Outta here?

730
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,970
And the only way I could think was

731
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,360
okay

732
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,870
to learn how to fly a helicopter,
get up and get out.

733
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,340
Now I did the first part of the plan.

734
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Now the major part of the plan is to
actually have access to a helicopter close

735
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:39,934
by.

736
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,593
MMM.

737
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,840
You know, that's why I did it.
And uh, but I will tell you,

738
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,170
it is a, a, you know, there
is an element of danger to it.

739
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:56,110
But now that I have my kid,
I don't solo that much.

740
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,610
Every once in a while I do just to, you
know, just to know that I can do it.

741
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,740
But for the most part I just,

742
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,120
I'll fly with an instructor and,
you know, I don't do anything crazy.

743
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:11,020
You don't fly and like,
you know, you know,

744
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,240
wins beyond a certain amount of knots.
And I also will tell you though, it's way,

745
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:18,430
way, way, way,

746
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,570
way safer than getting in a
car and going on the highway.

747
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,310
And I have experienced both and
I can tell you like, you know,

748
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:31,000
there's nobody up there. I mean
there is, but you know what I mean.

749
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:36,001
But there is it and it's like
we're talking to each other,

750
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,160
we're in the same airspace
and we're announcing our
position and where we're at.

751
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,320
Okay. And if we don't see each
other, then you take offensive moves,

752
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,820
I guess a defensive move,

753
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,470
your proactive like at the guys at the
same altitude. You just tell them, well,

754
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,130
okay, I'm going to ascend 200 feet
or whatever the fuck you need to do.

755
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,340
And then even if you don't see
each other till the last second,

756
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:04,430
you literally like hundreds of feet
above or below him and it's fine. Um,

757
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:09,190
there's no radio contract contact on the
highway and you are basically flying in

758
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:13,540
formation with people who are on meds.
They're texting,

759
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:17,470
they didn't get enough sleep.
They suck at driving. They don't,

760
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,180
maybe they're really good at driving,
so they're driving like a fucking lunatic.

761
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:25,120
Like everybody else is as good as they
are. Those people are probably more,

762
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:29,500
even more dangerous than someone just
sucks it driving and drive slow. Um,

763
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,470
and there's a lot of
times that I've, you know,

764
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,730
finished flying,

765
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:43,410
flying solo and landed and got in my car
and within two miles of going down the

766
00:44:46,971 --> 00:44:50,150
street, I watched somebody just
fucking t-bones somebody else,

767
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,590
somebody go flying off a fucking scooter
and land on my side of the fucking road

768
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,230
and slide on their face. So we just
driving in the left lane and didn't,

769
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,050
for whatever reason, just veers
into the fucking, they were texting,

770
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,220
weren't paying attention, literally
slammed into the median between, you know,

771
00:45:07,221 --> 00:45:08,600
both sides of the highway.

772
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,020
Fortunately stayed on this side of
the highway so they didn't, you know,

773
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,980
go up and over and kill somebody
and literally just went spinning.

774
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,240
Okay.

775
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,220
Three 63 63 it's like five,

776
00:45:19,221 --> 00:45:23,310
three sixties across six
lanes of traffic before slam.

777
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:26,840
Like a stock car accident.
MMM.

778
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:31,100
Nobody near the guy. Just fucking
did. I see that all of the time,

779
00:45:31,101 --> 00:45:34,660
so I understand what you're saying. And
I have to be honest with you, like, um,

780
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:39,490
it is an unnecessary
risk. Um, but I find it,

781
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:44,610
I most of what I say about the oceans
because they have such a tremendous fear

782
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:49,270
of it and I just can't get over
that. All of this shit is, you know,

783
00:45:49,271 --> 00:45:53,510
I'm treading water with my head
above it, you know what I mean? And,

784
00:45:53,511 --> 00:45:56,220
and everything else is like,
I don't know,

785
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,400
did you ever go into a pit of poisonous
snakes and then bury your head in the

786
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:04,330
sand is they're all just sort
of fucking slither and pasture?

787
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,590
Um, uh, yeah. And just things can go down.

788
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,180
This things down there. They can literally
swallow you whole or bite you in half.

789
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,520
And they are, you know what,

790
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:23,900
a thousand times faster than you.
Um,

791
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,950
yeah, I mean say what you want
about flying. Like I, you know,

792
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,850
the altitude I fly at like I
don't, I can, I can still breathe.

793
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:36,610
I don't need any assisted or pressurized
cabin or anything like that. This, it's,

794
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,180
it's, you know, you don't, you pick
your poison, but I'll tell you like, uh,

795
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,680
there's a couple of things that
I watch that just, you know,

796
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,150
literally make my palm sweat.
One of them is cave diving.

797
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:55,180
And if you ever want
to just just, you know,

798
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,820
hear the most unbelievable story ever.
I,

799
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:03,730
I forget that that fighter's name. He's
actually one of my favorite UFC fighters.

800
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,460
Um,
what is his name?

801
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,090
Cowboys something. Um, okay.

802
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,080
Is it from like New Mexico or whatever?

803
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,750
He's just like the one of the
baddest dudes ever. He never, um, he,

804
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:27,310
he caved dies and he was on
the Joe Rogan experience. Uh,

805
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:30,140
just look up Joe Rogan
experience, uh, cave

806
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,630
diving and just listened
to that fucking story.

807
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,733
MMM.

808
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,470
And you're literally listening to the
guy they went through at sea, you know,

809
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,450
somehow he lives, but still, you're like,
I was literally sitting there, you know,

810
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:45,130
when you do that thing,

811
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:50,130
when you put your hands like over your
nose and your mouth to sit in there and

812
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,400
you're cute,
your index fingers or between your eyes.

813
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:54,560
I was just sitting there like
they just covering my mouth,

814
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,770
just listening to this fucking story.

815
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:04,460
The guy literally said that they have a
rule down there that when someone gets

816
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:08,360
in trouble in a cave dive, you just
leave them because someone's going home,

817
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,960
someone's going to make it home because,

818
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,100
okay.

819
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:17,240
It's so fucked up down there that if
you try to help that person than both of

820
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:18,080
you are going to die.

821
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,393
MMM.

822
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,950
That's kind of how it starts. And
then it goes from there. So anyways,

823
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,843
uh,

824
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,013
okay.

825
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,780
Yeah, cave diving. And then, um,

826
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:38,270
those people who do that free climbing
up skyscrapers in every time you think

827
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:38,661
they're up to,

828
00:48:38,661 --> 00:48:43,100
they make those fucking videos and every
time you think they went up is high.

829
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:48,101
They're literally on the fucking radio
tower and they just keep going up and up

830
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:53,870
and up and up and up. And it's just
like, I just sit there like, oh,

831
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,390
right, I don't know how the fuck
anybody can do some shit like that.

832
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,400
So maybe that's why I
said most of what I say,

833
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:02,830
I saw jaws at a certain age and I just
never got over it. I just never got over.

834
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:06,260
I'm like, I'm all fucking set on that.
It's so crazy to me. Like, you know

835
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,423
that

836
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,850
would you ever go in,
you know, into the g?

837
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,880
Whatever's left to the jungle in Africa
with is just wild fucking hyenas and

838
00:49:19,201 --> 00:49:24,201
tigers and lions and fucking hyenas and
any God knows fucking what out there.

839
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,450
Would you ever go out there
without a damn weapon?

840
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,370
Okay.

841
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:33,420
Okay.
And then you go into the fucking ocean.

842
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,730
No guns worked down there.

843
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,060
Okay.

844
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,130
As far as I know.
Yeah.

845
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:43,120
But you can have is that stupid little
fucking bow and Arrow contraption.

846
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,010
Alright, now I gotta look up underwater
gun. Is there an underwater guy?

847
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:48,630
And you can possibly fucking half

848
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:57,010
sorta fucking list. This is going to put
me on underwater firearm. God dammit.

849
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:57,950
I'll tell you something.

850
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,660
Human beings don't ever want to be
where they can't fucking kill something.

851
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,140
Are you fucking kidding me?
Look at this thing.

852
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:07,980
Okay.

853
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,600
Slow motion. Underwater guns. Shark ammo.

854
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,680
Oh God.

855
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,100
Okay.

856
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,210
Jesus Christ.

857
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,650
That's all you need is some fucking
people from Texas going there.

858
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,100
I swear to God, man. One
fucking shark looks at me.

859
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,150
One motherfucker looks at me. I'm
going to fucking, it's God damn

860
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,800
fucking fish brain out.

861
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:35,850
God made us in his image and he were
asked to us to go forth and multiply and

862
00:50:36,341 --> 00:50:40,380
blast the fucking hammer head
riding his fucking head. Um,

863
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:45,250
I have to see this now. Slow
motion. Underwater guns. Shark ammo.

864
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:51,890
All right, you can skip this
ad in three, two, one. Bam.

865
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,370
Here we go. Hey, I'm
a fucking youtube guy.

866
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:59,200
I'm going to fucking tell you
about shark shit. All right.

867
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,980
This guy's all right.

868
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:04,080
He's trying out some of them bad ass
gun so you could ever fucking half he

869
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:06,560
shooting watermelon. Good for
him. Not Shooting any people.

870
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:12,310
Is the breakdown here. What movies like
sharp NATO, your guns and change, right?

871
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,153
Just get to the,

872
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:14,940
yeah.

873
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,650
All right. Some happen. I fucking my,

874
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,980
my recorder got full.

875
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,700
I was talking about shooting sharks
in the fucking God damn face, man.

876
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:28,480
I'll fucking you ani. I'll, I'll give
you another fucking breathing hole.

877
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:32,970
You fucking whale face mother fucker.
They actually figured out how to do it.

878
00:51:32,971 --> 00:51:35,730
They got like a fucking AK 47.

879
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,063
Okay.

880
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:38,921
Believe in then.

881
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:42,280
Do you think you're going to be able
to whip that thing out fast enough?

882
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,420
Ah, Jesus Christ. You know what
I mean? What, what are we doing

883
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,790
the fuck are we doing?
We're underwater shooting fucking guns.

884
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,440
It's sharks.

885
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,323
I Dunno.

886
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,690
I mean, see sir, you know,

887
00:52:00,691 --> 00:52:05,691
I got to tell you something is fucking
nuts as flying is when you go flying,

888
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,050
you don't have to go up there with a
fucking gun cause something's going to eat

889
00:52:10,051 --> 00:52:13,170
you out of the Goddamn sky.
Uh,

890
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,460
there's no fucking bird of prey
that's going to grab onto your, uh,

891
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,250
whatever the fuck you're flying.

892
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,293
MMM.

893
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,600
Anyways, uh, but thank you for
listening to the podcast, but you know,

894
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:29,430
you are right though. I am a bit
of a hypocrite, but like I said,

895
00:52:29,431 --> 00:52:32,830
most of it is just me being
afraid of the ocean. Uh,

896
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,700
gift list,
pressure bill.

897
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:39,390
My wife gets mad that I don't tell her
what I want for Christmas or birthdays.

898
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:42,690
Yeah, well it's a pain in the ass
because then she has to guess anyways,

899
00:52:42,691 --> 00:52:45,090
obviously now the issue is Christmas.

900
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,270
I told her I have everything
I need and like you,

901
00:52:48,271 --> 00:52:50,220
I'm trying to thin out all my junk.

902
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,720
It actually stresses me out because I'm
being led to feel bad for not wanting to,

903
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,160
okay.

904
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,990
Two gifted, something to be gifted.
Something. Just ask her for an experience.

905
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,890
Just ask her, you want to go to a
car show or something like that.

906
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:09,300
Something we could do together. Just do
that. So she has something. All right.

907
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,510
Uh, we both make a lot of
money and buy whatever we want.

908
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:16,050
She doesn't need anything either, but
gave me a cute idea of something small.

909
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,830
I guess. She's not a total
bitch and just Jesus, she's big.

910
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,780
She's not even remotely a bitch.

911
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,380
Okay.

912
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,370
Does is complete the,

913
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:27,040
I would throw this and fucking
bitch court if you even every,

914
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,370
why are we or why did you
waste my time with this?

915
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,710
I guess she's not a total bitch. I
just, and just wants to make me happy.

916
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,950
But in a roundabout way,
it ruins the fun of it sometimes.

917
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,280
How do you deal with this? Um, yeah,

918
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:44,200
I usually just ask for a

919
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:45,800
okay.

920
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,730
Inexperienced. It's usually some
place I want to go to. Like, uh, my,

921
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,980
I'm a big fan of a,

922
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,900
yeah.

923
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,710
You know, hamburgers stands like
greasy spoon type places. I don't like,

924
00:53:57,711 --> 00:54:00,940
I'm not a big fan of fancy fucking
restaurants. I mean, I like going there,

925
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:04,550
whatever, but like, I
love going to like, uh,

926
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,130
you know, there's a couple of places, a
place on bill's Burgers I wanted to go to.

927
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:13,190
Ironically enough, although I heard
the guy doesn't work there anymore,

928
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:18,020
but the burgers are still tasty.
Um, I love a great taco truck,

929
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,450
food trucks.
Um,

930
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,600
I like doing Jack Shit like that and
like going to car shows and you know,

931
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:28,290
I went to a Christmas party at
this custom motorcycle, um, uh,

932
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,910
shop,
uh,

933
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:34,670
the one that Keanu Reeves bought into
and went down and just like, I mean

934
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,720
to me as an adult,
that was like Christmas.

935
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:43,220
I went down there and they were talking
about how are they make the parts by

936
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:48,221
hand and how like a 1200 pound slab of
like aluminum will come in in from that,

937
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,000
like ice sculptors except
it use it with the aluminum.

938
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,590
They make parts for these absolutely
gorgeous motorcycles, arch a r,

939
00:54:57,591 --> 00:55:00,920
c h motorcycles.
And um,

940
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,700
okay.

941
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,890
I Dunno,
like,

942
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:09,190
I think because I became like a closet
gearhead out here where I don't know how

943
00:55:09,591 --> 00:55:14,150
to do any of that shit, but I could
literally watch somebody work on a car.

944
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:19,130
Describe how they, Eric the car
guy. I'm a huge fan of his. I, uh,

945
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,300
you know, I love that shit. So
whatever the hell you're into.

946
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,830
She loves you. Just gay. She wants to
give you something. Jesus Christ. Um,

947
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,350
it's like she's going to
buy a desk. Um, anyways,

948
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:37,760
you got a bottle of booze. You're
like, I dunno. Boxing. Hey,

949
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:39,290
Billy bank shot the third.

950
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,490
I recently been getting fitter thanks
to training sessions at a boxing gym.

951
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,440
Good for you.
Uh,

952
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:50,420
in wanting to test myself and try some low
level legal, of course, amateur boxing.

953
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,290
Dude,

954
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:56,290
there's no fucking reason to get your
bell rung for no fucking money when you're

955
00:55:56,961 --> 00:56:00,950
not going to try to pursue it as a
profession, then be careful now. She goes,

956
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:05,780
my girlfriend won't allow it. Good for
her. She likens me trying it out to her,

957
00:56:05,781 --> 00:56:08,360
trying outstripping in front of a crowd.

958
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:13,490
And how against the idea and
how against that idea I'd be,

959
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,820
can't say she's wrong.
Uh, do you recognize,

960
00:56:16,821 --> 00:56:20,870
should try a couple of fights just to
see if I like it and not tell her or do I

961
00:56:20,871 --> 00:56:24,840
respect your wishes and leave it as a,
that doesn't need to be answered.

962
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:29,550
Um, sir, I would never tell you
not to pursue your dreams, but uh,

963
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:33,540
I wouldn't do it sneaking around.
I would.

964
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,503
MMM.

965
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,600
Bet the very least tell her that
you're going to do one fight.

966
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,773
MMM.

967
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:42,850
But you know,
what are you going to,

968
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:45,650
what if you go when you get your fucking
nose broken and then he got to show up

969
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:49,910
and try to be like Luca.
All right. My name is Luca.

970
00:56:49,911 --> 00:56:53,510
I live on the second floor. I walked
into a fucking door. You don't have to,

971
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,870
you don't have to do that. Right. Um,

972
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,110
I dunno. I, I, yeah,

973
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:06,660
communication is always the way to go
with the woman is what I've learned and

974
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:08,340
I've learned and I keep learning.

975
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,800
And you communicate with them and
through the communication, they'll win.

976
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:17,220
They'll end up telling you how it's going
to go down because it always goes down

977
00:57:17,221 --> 00:57:20,070
the way they want it to go down.
And that's basically it.

978
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,473
MMM.

979
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,390
And that's basically a dude,
what they say goes.

980
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:30,340
If you want to stay with them and
it's brutally not fucking fair,

981
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,980
but you're a guy and nobody gives a shit.

982
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,010
So what I would do if you're going
to go ahead and do with it anyways,

983
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,540
I would just,

984
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,823
mmm.

985
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,260
I would just tell her that
you're going to do it.

986
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,200
It's something that you
need to do something.

987
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:49,130
You need to prove to yourself or
whatever the fuck it is. And, uh,

988
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:54,890
you know, other than that, keep
moving your head there, buddy. Uh,

989
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,140
overrated living in major cities.

990
00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:00,950
Is there anything worse than a bunch of
losers thinking that if they live where

991
00:58:00,951 --> 00:58:04,370
it's cool to live, that
they're cool too. Ah Dude,

992
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:05,660
you're preaching to the choir here.

993
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:09,050
That's what I've done my entire
adult life and I am not cool.

994
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:13,370
They completely deny the fact that living
on top of one another is frustrating

995
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:17,480
and unnatural. New York smells
like shit. La is overcrowded.

996
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,570
I New York does it smell like
shit areas of it does. New York,

997
00:58:20,571 --> 00:58:23,150
Manhattan is like a giant
bed bath and beyond.

998
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:25,640
Now La is definitely overcrowded.

999
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,643
MMM,

1000
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:31,650
absolutely. But I gotta be
honest with you though. Um,

1001
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:35,400
so where are you suggesting to live?

1002
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,340
Cause if you get to rural then then
it deck just gets too fucking boring.

1003
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:43,823
MMM.

1004
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:48,150
Your food options, a lot
of options. You know,

1005
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,340
you want to go see a band and they're
not going to come anywhere near yet.

1006
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,550
Now you gotta jump in a
car for four fucking hours.

1007
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:58,950
I definitely envy people who live in
wide open spaces and shit like that.

1008
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:03,240
Uh, I think it's really cool and I got a
lot of respect for people that live out

1009
00:59:03,241 --> 00:59:08,010
there. Like that, but just
living where I've lived, uh,

1010
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:11,070
I don't know how long I could do it.
I go a little fucking stir crazy,

1011
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,700
although there's a lot of people
here in la that, you know,

1012
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,970
have that second home and
fucking Wyoming or whatever.

1013
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,030
Um, but my wife isn't
going to, it would never go

1014
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:26,520
for that self. And she makes
the decisions, um, underrated,

1015
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,160
uh, living in midsize cities.
Oh, here's his answer.

1016
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,730
There's nothing better than a city
that's not really a city. I, you know,

1017
00:59:33,731 --> 00:59:38,230
I'd go with that and I have my favorite
ones. Uh, and these are all cities.

1018
00:59:38,231 --> 00:59:42,970
I wouldn't say they're not cities, but
like, uh, I'm a big fan of Milwaukee,

1019
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,030
uh, Chattanooga. Um,

1020
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,550
what else comes to mind?

1021
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,400
Uh,
those are two of my favorites.

1022
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:03,190
Is that it? I think so. I mean,

1023
01:00:03,191 --> 01:00:06,580
I enjoyed when I was up
in Idaho and Montana.

1024
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,223
MMM.

1025
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,150
It just seems like nobody
really fucks with the up there,

1026
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:15,840
but then they had like a massive math
problem. So there's always something.

1027
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,300
There's always something,
you know what I mean?

1028
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:20,123
MMM.

1029
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:24,180
I just switched with all the
fucking global warming like that.

1030
01:00:24,181 --> 01:00:24,941
I just wish that there,

1031
01:00:24,941 --> 01:00:29,140
those people could still enjoy the
climates that they moved there for. Um,

1032
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:33,280
cause, you know, just growing up on the
east coast and everything, I think it's,

1033
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:36,940
you know, I missed the four
seasons and shit. And, uh,

1034
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:41,290
I also think it's really cool to kind of
live out in places like that. You know,

1035
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:45,250
having said that, you know, the
experiences that I've gotten living in La,

1036
01:00:45,251 --> 01:00:46,780
this is one of my favorite cities.

1037
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,110
And I also love New York as much as
I make fun of both of these cities.

1038
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,673
MMM.

1039
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:56,250
Where else? You know, I, you
know, living in a sports town,

1040
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:59,210
I'll tell you what's under rated two
FTE move away is going back and live in

1041
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:02,340
your fucking home state again.
You know,

1042
01:01:02,341 --> 01:01:04,680
when you don't have to get by
all the fucking sports packages,

1043
01:01:04,681 --> 01:01:08,970
just to watch a regular season, game me
a team as pretty fucking overrated too.

1044
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:14,220
Um, all right. That's the podcast
for this week. A Merry Christmas.

1045
01:01:14,221 --> 01:01:17,250
Happy Hanukkah. Oh, Hanukkah is going
on right now. Happy Hanukkah, everybody.

1046
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:19,350
And uh,

1047
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,920
go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on you on Thursday.
