1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,790
Hey, what's going on? Spill burden.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:09,320
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast. And I'll just checking in on,

3
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:12,080
do you,
how was your week going?

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,750
Is that the way you planned it?

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,490
Is 28 t turning out to be
the year you wanted it to be?

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,220
Um, I'll be getting my,
my transformation of my,

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,130
my fucking wardrobe bill.
You new clothes. Uh,

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,450
you know something I never
took seriously with socks.

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,060
I'd go down to the fucking foot block
and I just grab a pair of, you know,

10
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:41,390
a package of those things and I
would wear them for like three years.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,580
I don't own any white
socks. They're all gray. Um,

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,220
I dunno. It's just something I've never
been into. And then for Christmas,

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,700
somebody actually got me some
new socks and they were great,

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,340
but they weren't like a, you know,
like dress socks or some shit.

15
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,090
Like,
oh great,

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,210
I gotta wait till somebody dies and
gets married before I wear these fucking

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,880
things. They were just like, you know,

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,510
they weren't athletic socks,
they would just sort of socks.

19
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:16,900
You could still wear it with sneakers.
They were a little thicker, you know,

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,550
I'm an old man. I was like, keys
show real comfy on my feet. So,

21
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:24,740
uh, that was it. I, I, you know,

22
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:28,780
and then I had him sitting in my sock
drawer next to all these sad grey socks

23
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,460
that had been loyal for all these years
and all the old socks were looking at me

24
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:38,050
like, Bill, you, you're not going to
move the company to another country.

25
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:40,900
Are you a man?
You're not going to break up the union.

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:42,690
Okay.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,500
We been there for you for a long time,
man. I was like, you will get nothing.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,450
I owe the public nothing. Whose quote
was that? I owe the public nothing.

29
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,830
It's one of those robber baron guys back
in the day. And who even knows if they,

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,400
if they robbed anybody, maybe they were
just better at business. And most people,

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,780
maybe they had it in him to tell some
old lady to hit the bricks you would done

32
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:06,240
with them.
Let me see something who said,

33
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,440
was it Andrew Carnegie or
Carnegie is a say in Pittsburgh.

34
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,360
Um,
I owe the public

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,560
nothing over

36
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,670
j p Morgan. Oh, JP JP, the original heal,

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,740
how great would he have been? You know,
I bet if he lived right now, he'd be,

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,790
he'd be working for Vince Mcmahon,
crushing it on the mic.

39
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,950
I owe the public nothing

40
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,780
that is so fucking mean,
so wrong and so right.

41
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:48,210
All at the same time.
I've never quite felt,

42
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:52,530
I never really felt one way
or another about that one.

43
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:55,200
At first I was like, what
a fucking Dick. You know?

44
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,610
And then what happens is you start doing
a little well in life and then all of a

45
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:05,060
sudden some douche bag and your life
starts giving you shit about it and want

46
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:09,040
you to give them fucking money
just for being there, you know?

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,210
And you start going, well, I,

48
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:15,040
I guess I kind of understand what
JP Morgan was saying. Granted,

49
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,551
you know what I mean?

50
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,030
I didn't fucking create the
Federal Reserve system that
enslaves fucking people,

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,220
you know, taken away from this.
I want to get that. I don't know.

52
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,570
I don't want to go down that rabbit hole.
You know?

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,740
This is always been my rule as
far as helping people out. Okay.

54
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,230
If you laying in a ditch
and you're reaching up,

55
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,300
I'll reach down and try to pull you out.
All right.

56
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,040
But if you face down in the ditch,
digging a deeper every day. Yeah.

57
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,130
I'm not throwing money in that.

58
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,770
Get your shit together. Okay.
Get a little streak going.

59
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,450
A little street. Go on of doing
the right fucking thing that, uh,

60
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:55,420
you'll be surprised how much the world,
we'll help you out, I would think.

61
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,900
But what do I know?
I'm a privileged white male.

62
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,160
I remember what I was born and
I was on my dad's yacht by,

63
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,200
and we were talking to the next seven
presidential candidates and, uh,

64
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,410
they were letting me decide who was
going to be present. It's, it's,

65
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,431
if you're not white,

66
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,070
I'm sorry to let you in on this
unbelievable level of privilege,

67
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,490
but that's basically what my
childhood was like. It was incredible.

68
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,070
I remember when I, um, when I turned 14, I
was given my first shot. I remember that,

69
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,170
you know, and I was in a bad mood
because my chauffeur was just,

70
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:32,500
I dunno if I wanted to get fucking ice
cream and he wouldn't take me there.

71
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,390
And I was very upset. Um, and
I was like, you work for me,

72
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,360
you work for me. And he just
ignored me that day. And I was like,

73
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,910
I'm going to tell daddy and
you're going to be fired.

74
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,470
And a while I didn't realize is was he
was under instructions from my father to

75
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,600
take me down to the, the, uh,

76
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,480
the wharf at than sound like
a good rich word. The, uh,

77
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:59,190
the doc that President Roosevelt gave
them, my great grandfather. And, uh,

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,060
they gave me my first shot and I
was like, oh, I feel so foolish. Um,

79
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,270
but my dad's still fired my
show for just for upsetting me,

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,110
even though it was his idea.
What,

81
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,750
we'll revisit my privileged
childhood later on in this podcast,

82
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:17,470
but let's get back to, well, let's get
back to what went down this fucking week.

83
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:22,270
Damn God. Damn. Motherfuckers, Alabama,

84
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:26,800
Crimson,
Tad one yet another fucking championship.

85
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,630
Uh, God dammit. Georgia had a
bad, I'm on the fucking ropes.

86
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,140
And then the second half
came along and what happened?

87
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:40,040
Georgia goes right out there
and blocks a punt and I don't,

88
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,210
I can somebody tell me how that guy was?
Offsites.

89
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,810
Can somebody tell me why a bigger deal
was not made other than on the mad dog

90
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,464
show?

91
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,610
They blew too brutal fucking calls when
Alabama was making a great comeback.

92
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,623
Okay,

93
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,740
great coaching decision by Nick Saban to
put that freshman kidded a quarterback

94
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:09,150
and just stick with them.
And I bought the, uh,

95
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,000
the start and not being a cunt about it.
That was all great.

96
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,840
And then they had that running back that
came in and they started using in many

97
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:19,320
ways in the second half, Alabama. And he
was just killing Georgia. But however,

98
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:23,730
I don't, I don't use that fucking guy
was not offsites. They blocked the punt.

99
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,510
You looking at at least three
points on that drive. Granted,

100
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,680
people can miss field goals.

101
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,890
God knows Alabama knows about
that come the end of the game.

102
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Then they miss the facemask call and they
call a ticky tack pass interference on

103
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:40,170
third night.
Um,

104
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,550
those are the games when you're rooting
for you and your team's getting fucked

105
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:48,330
you, you literally sit there going
like, this is literally, it's just a t,

106
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:53,280
it's a TV show. He can't have one team
just beat the shit out of the other team.

107
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:57,360
Everybody's going to turn the channel.
Is that a real,

108
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,440
that football game was like watching an
episode of the Super French back in the

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,370
day, right. Every fucking episode was the
exact same with the super friends. Okay.

110
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,890
Something would happen and then all of
a sudden it just looked like, you know,

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,490
whatever.
Superman had kryptonite around his neck,

112
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,260
a Batman and Robin would tied together
and not like they think like they cared,

113
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:19,681
but you know,

114
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:22,890
time down on the heading towards a
bud saw and all that type of shit.

115
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,900
And then something would happen.

116
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,310
That stupid fucking monkey from the
wonder twins would do something.

117
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,520
And the second they
played that song right.

118
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,763
And then

119
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,720
I remember I would get a sense of relief
every time I was watching that cartoon.

120
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:45,290
I'm like, Oh fuck, is this the episode
Superman dies? I mean, I was young,

121
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,620
I didn't know any better. And the second
they would start playing that song,

122
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:50,750
I knew that they will,
they were going to make that come back.

123
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,010
That's what the Alabama fucking band
should have been playing when they,

124
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,650
when Alabama came running out
in the fucking second half.

125
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,150
Oh, maybe when they called
off sides in that block pond,

126
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,650
you got to give it up to Alabama.
Even though I'm kind of being a cunt,

127
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:10,910
bring in those things up. But Hey, I
mean that did happen. That was bullshit.

128
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,930
The guy didn't even fucking
move. I Dunno. Maybe.

129
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:19,040
Maybe the referee had a better
angle. I don't know. I don't,

130
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,270
I don't get how you miss a face mask
when it was done to the guy carry in the

131
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:25,940
football. I mean the whole fucking
stadium is looking at the guy.

132
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,830
His head turns around, Eh, we
didn't say it. We didn't say it.

133
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,990
Um, here's what I want to know.
Who's more hateable bill bell,

134
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:39,380
a check or a Nick Saban.
And secondly,

135
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:43,850
why do you hate them? Like everyone
says, Nick Saban is the devil.

136
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,640
Why is he the devil?
Because he's so good at what he does.

137
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,220
You know,
I dunno.

138
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,470
I think the media fucking hates bill
Bellacheck cause he makes that job so

139
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:58,830
fucking because he knows
that if he opens his mouth,

140
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,610
the media is going to make his job more
difficult by exaggerating anything that

141
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:06,540
he said given the other team.
Bolton board material. Um,

142
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,710
masterful. The way he handles
the press, he gives them nothing.

143
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,040
He looks at them and he's like,
you people are not my fucking friends.

144
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,790
I am required by the NFL to stand
here and answer your questions,

145
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,720
but I am not required to give you anything
more than two fucking syllables per

146
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:22,554
question.

147
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,590
All right.
I love it.

148
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,390
I wish more coaches would do that.
More players would do that. You know,

149
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,510
Shaq used to do it. You have a
seat shack like when I, when he,

150
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,620
but he's still in like on TBS or whatever.
T and t, whoever does the fucking NBA,

151
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,870
just total nice guy.
Affable brick area stair.

152
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,030
I say right now.
But when he would do like a,

153
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:48,970
he's talking joking around
animated and all that.

154
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:51,160
And then what we used to do those,
those interviews at the end of the game,

155
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:54,250
he just be like Colbert
getting rid of the ball

156
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,270
to year. He just went into like power. Uh,

157
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,380
you see on any other show,
it seems like a completely different guy.

158
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,750
That's what you learn after you get burned
by those fucking nonathletic fat fuck

159
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,030
concepts that are in the sports media.
You know,

160
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,110
and this is what I can't stand about
them is they choose themselves,

161
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:23,970
their own self preservation over any
sort of loyalty towards the home team.

162
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,863
You know,

163
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,480
the local Boston sports media sitting
there fanning the flames of that fucking

164
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:35,470
horse shit about Tom
Brady's personal assistant,

165
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,520
whatever. Not Personal assistant
is fucking personal trainer.

166
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,120
Can you fucking believe they tried that?
That's all they could get.

167
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,480
And then they were like, well whatever
man, we got a spark blow on it.

168
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,330
Yeah.

169
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,050
And what kills me is fucking patriots
fans will continue to listen to those

170
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:58,000
sports shows at second. I hear that and
go fuck these guys. Well Bell, I mean,

171
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:02,410
when it had the media and isn't star
eight, we have to address that. Yeah.

172
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,400
Um, do you just have to say
what everybody else is saying?

173
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:09,520
Is that what you're required to bill?
What happened?

174
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,730
You started off in such a good mood.
Um,

175
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,940
Nick Saban now has, uh, he
has six championships. Never.

176
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:22,990
He was doing, he has six championships.
He's 66 years old. Six, six, six.

177
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:27,790
He's the devil. Well then he just turned
into the devil. What was he when it was,

178
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,730
you know,
five championships and he was 65.

179
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,390
What's two to fives?
What does that mean?

180
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,950
You're going to go play
that on a scratch card?

181
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,373
MMM.

182
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,450
I don't think either one
of them and the devil.

183
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,930
I just think they're really good at what
they do. And a, at the end of the day,

184
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:50,010
the game is 60 minutes long.
You've got to keep coaching and uh,

185
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,750
you know what's funny?
Nowhere? No, no. In the,

186
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,150
all the top four can force sports.
All right.

187
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,070
Nothing hurts you more than playing,
not to lose in football.

188
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,970
I've seen more goddamn games,
more fucking games lost that way.

189
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,210
I feel like Oklahoma lost the
rose bowl because of that.

190
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:13,080
They stopped going no huddle. You
know, if you want to be a Douche,

191
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:15,600
she could say maybe Georgia,
you know,

192
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,540
Kinda took the foot off the gas
a little bit there. I Dunno.

193
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,860
Once you start thinking about
how to chew up the clock,

194
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,640
it fucks up everybody's rhythm.
I don't know.

195
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,000
Or maybe I just love when Alabama lose.

196
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:33,720
It's like my favorite part of that
Gabe was fucking Nick Saban's face at

197
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:38,040
halftime. I don't want
you to do that. Fucking

198
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,470
what are you going to do that interview,
that stupid fucking interview.

199
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,980
Why they stopped those poor bastards
of the most important game of their God

200
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,230
career and they got to sit there and
talk to fucking Susie sweet shoes.

201
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,910
Is it before they go in there?
Hey,

202
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:56,460
you know why I fucking
really liked on Alabama?

203
00:12:56,461 --> 00:13:00,000
Was that number 14 guys a fucking maniac.

204
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,340
He was all over the
field breaking up passes.

205
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,720
Anytime there was a sweet pea come
out of nowhere and he was amazing.

206
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:09,360
And I also think Georgia's
front forward incredible.

207
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,300
Like that interception that kid had.
I mean,

208
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,120
usually the offensive
linemen, uh, I dunno,

209
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,360
they're just not quick enough.

210
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,390
Ricocheted off the how many he found
it in the air and then caught it, um,

211
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,640
in that close to the quarterback.
That usually does not happen. And uh,

212
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,530
yeah,

213
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,980
they amazing front for and George's
quarterback to the freshmen obviously kind

214
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,040
of sucks that they ended up
losing the game. I forget.

215
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,010
I actually will tell you this,

216
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:42,270
I felt bad for Nick Saban when that
kid missed that field goal. It's funny,

217
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:47,120
for some reason I didn't feel bad for
the kid. I felt bad for Nick Saban.

218
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,040
I forget what he did. He
just throws fucking arms up.
Like, what do I have to do?

219
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,020
How big a genius do I have
to fucking be to fuck it?

220
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:04,460
Help you sons of bitches across the God
damn goal lines so we can win this thing

221
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:07,220
a go, go home. I'm, well,
what more do I have to do?

222
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,270
I would love to interview
coaches and be like,

223
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:15,350
what goes through your fucking brain?
All right.

224
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,160
Like an offensive coordinator,
whatever you call all the right place,

225
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:23,600
you play it fucking
high stakes chess,

226
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,280
where you literally,
your house,

227
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,590
your family standard of living is
on the line because if you suck,

228
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,410
you're going to get fired. And then
what then where you're going to go,

229
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,330
you're gonna have to fucking sell your
house. You Ain't know the deal pill.

230
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,890
We know the deal and you
call all the right place.

231
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:44,280
60 minutes of playing chess on
television where every fucking Dosha,

232
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,650
the world like myself is going to second
guess you who has never even coached

233
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:52,750
the game at a pop Warner level.
You get all the way down there.

234
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,610
It's a fucking chip shot.

235
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:57,550
Yeah.

236
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,560
And this soccer style con goes in there
and fucking Mississippi, like just what?

237
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:06,120
Like how do you sleep
that night? I, I can't,

238
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,450
I can't imagine.
You know what I mean?

239
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,230
Everybody talks about the field goal
kickers when they miss it and what they

240
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:15,130
have to deal with. You know,
it's, it's very simple. Okay.

241
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:18,130
Nobody knows what a field goal kicker
looks like. He move out of this state.

242
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:22,990
You start selling cars, you begin a new
life, egg, noodles and ketchup somewhere.

243
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:23,824
Right?

244
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,490
Okay.

245
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,700
I can't imagine the coach. So you got
it. Like how do you go to sleep at night?

246
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,710
You know, and you know, your wife
doesn't understand. Carl is just a game.

247
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,740
Come back to bed.
I don't as to what is wrong with you?

248
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
You're scaring the children,

249
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:45,481
Michael Guys.

250
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,200
Just I would,
you know what I would do?

251
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:52,201
I would just be standing up in my living
room drinking with my headset still on

252
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:57,330
staring at the fucking wall. Okay. Kids,

253
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,110
we're going to go to bed early tonight.
Your father's had a tough day.

254
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,120
I Dunno. That's what I see when
I, when Nick Saban's losing,

255
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,370
when I look at that guy's fucking
face, it's just like, I would not,

256
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,250
it's just not a guy you'd want.
You would want to piss off. Um,

257
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,500
I love those guys that are going bald
and they still dye their hair and they

258
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:22,590
still keep it like long. I don't
know. What is Nick Saban doing?

259
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,080
So he's got cotton candy
on top of his head. Um,

260
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,000
anyways, let's plow ahead. By the way,
Nhl fans. Did you happen to catch?

261
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:37,890
Did you happen to see the
Falcon best game of the year?

262
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,070
At least the ones that I saw.
Do you watch the Bruins first of penguins?

263
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,650
That game. It was like a game from
the 80s, except there was no fights,

264
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,510
which there should have been when the
puck somehow got lost in a shower,

265
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,610
his Jersey and that guy came up and
just sort of looked at him and then push

266
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:58,230
them down like a kid on the
playground. And I was like, all right,

267
00:16:58,231 --> 00:16:59,670
somebody's got to drop the gloves there.

268
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,820
Even though what he did was totally legal.
That doesn't make a difference.

269
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,900
This is hockey. Can't just have
him push a captain down like that.

270
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,490
Um, then nobody did shit cause that's the
new game because they're trying to get

271
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:14,370
everybody to fucking watch,
which they're not going to do.

272
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:18,270
Fighting is basically out of hockey
and all of these fucking, uh,

273
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,050
Olympic ice hockey watching cons
are still not watching. They're not,

274
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,660
they're not going to watch
it. All right. Basketball.

275
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:28,530
They'll keep watching that fucking
players going into the stance x Deli,

276
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,281
punching a woman,

277
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,370
trying to get to some guy in a track
suit that through a fucking cocacola on

278
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:36,960
your face. Right? People keep watching.
They don't give a shit. Right.

279
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,510
Players fucking getting busted for shit
and bring it up. Other players names,

280
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,460
nobody gives a fuck. They keep fucking
watch it. And then the exam, you go,

281
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,370
you get to fighting on a hockey
rarely. Oh, tell you what.

282
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:52,240
Why don't you get the fighting out
of boxing first and then, then I'll,

283
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,540
I'll actually believe that you're
against violence. I'm sorry. Anyways,

284
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,570
okay.

285
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,130
Broads first penguins. This is how
the scoring went. One, nothing Bruins.

286
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,740
Then it was one one, then two,
one pens, then three one peds.

287
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,890
Right now my GAF, fuck. Hey.
Well yeah, we just, we keep,
we can and what? What, what?

288
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:15,800
What are we doing here? Right. Then in
the fucking second period it became,

289
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,780
it was three to two penguins,

290
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:22,460
three to three 43 Bruins,
five to three broads.

291
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,360
Okay, so we scored the first goal,
penguins scored the next three.

292
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,780
Then we scored the next four w and this
isn't even the end of the fucking second

293
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,044
period yet.

294
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,290
Okay.

295
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,180
All right.
Eight fucking goals.

296
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,200
This is back when like Gretzky
with scoring a goal, a game.

297
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:42,380
I felt like I was watching this,

298
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:46,840
this game on the fucking
USA network was amazing. Um,

299
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,350
okay.

300
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,740
And then right before the period ends,
you know, I was thinking like don't let,

301
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:54,950
don't give up a goal to give them hope.
Don't fucking do that shit.

302
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:57,320
And what do they do?
They fucking give up a goddamn goal.

303
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,870
Okay.

304
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,380
And it ends up being five to four
at the end of this second period.

305
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:06,640
Nine fucking goals, right?
Third period starts at like,

306
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:10,300
we got to get the next one. We've got
to get the next one. Penguin score,

307
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:13,810
the fucking next one.
Now it's five to five.

308
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,610
And it was just play off love,
play off, play off level hockey,

309
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,350
the tire rest of the fucking game.
Unbelievable passes. Unbelievable.

310
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,750
I can't believe I'll fucking
fast. Abroads sir. Um,

311
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,720
got all these young kids out there.
It's amazing. And ended the game.

312
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,450
Brad Marshawn comes down on
sort of like a mini break away.

313
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,080
Sky's slashes him on his right hand,
right.

314
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,120
And he goes down and a, the ref calls a
fucking penalty shot when I love does.

315
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,650
Even after he called the penalty shot,

316
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:52,490
Marshawn was still shaking
his hand to make sure, you
know, they'll wrap. You see,

317
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,090
look at east slash me this
hand, this hand, right. And uh,

318
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,970
I'm like, wow, Sean's going
to score this fucking goal.

319
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,220
He's going to fucking score this goal.

320
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:05,130
It comes down and gets a BA fucking
head of steam a little this way.

321
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,770
Little that way.
Fucking five hole opens up.

322
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:12,180
He goes to Tuck it in and that fucking
penguins con just got the top of his pad

323
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:13,020
on it to block it.

324
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,340
We go into overtime and I'm unbelievable.

325
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,010
Three on three hockey and then
fucking if wasn't market Pissy,

326
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,240
the one who scored. I mean, penguins
are tough and all the time, you know,

327
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:27,780
they got Crosby on one line pan
mark and another three on three,

328
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,640
all that open ice and Phil Kessel,

329
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,990
former Bro and farmer Brian that we
traded to Toronto because of that trade.

330
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:37,080
We want a cup, so I don't want
to fucking hear about it. Um,

331
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,780
incredible game unfortunately didn't win.
But uh,

332
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:43,200
the Bruins are very excited to watch
this year as exciting as the Celtics.

333
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:47,000
Dare I say, dare I say, um,

334
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,020
I have no advertising today.
Everybody,

335
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,410
people are slowly walking away
from my podcast. Evidentaly

336
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,110
you know what I say? I say
that's their loss. Ah, admitted.

337
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,230
When you guys listen to other fucking
podcast and they just do a straight read,

338
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:07,070
your fucking, you blow through
it, you blow through it.

339
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,860
These assholes did not understand
what I was doing. I was misunderstood.

340
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,480
Was like that Guy Tucker used to make
those cars except I was the advertising

341
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:17,700
illiterate version of it.
Right.

342
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,000
You know what's annoying as I tried to
print something out before I started

343
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:23,280
doing this podcast and my
printer's out of paper.

344
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,320
So that stupid fucking printer
icon keeps jumping up and down.

345
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,043
You know

346
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,650
like when you have a big family and
there's that one kid you don't really like

347
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:37,100
any kind of senses it. So he tries
to do extra shit to get attention.

348
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,660
That's what it's doing right now.

349
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,383
MMM.

350
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,150
Anyways,
I'm going to be at a COBB's comedy club.

351
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,230
Yeah.

352
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,190
This Saturday night with
Rosebowl tailgate legend.

353
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,750
Okay.

354
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,310
10 Year Vet Joe Part Nick.

355
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,380
10 Years Tommy. So should, I'm sorry,
10 games in a row at the rose bowl.

356
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,120
Do you know we were there
and they introduced it.

357
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,360
We thought we were bad ass with that 10
10 games in a row and they out of this

358
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,710
fucking print or jumping up and down.
I get it.

359
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,613
MMM.

360
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,060
Somebody was at the game and he
was at his 70th rose bowl in a row.

361
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,680
Sky's been going since 1948

362
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:23,940
okay.

363
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,200
No,
1949

364
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,020
cause I was already thinking like
the, the, the guys that we had seen

365
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,780
like the,
that have then gone,

366
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:38,710
it'll either gone pro or one like the
Heisman trophy or something like Jess just

367
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,860
in the first like, uh, I
don't know how many years.

368
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,140
That kid on the titans
who went to Stanford, that
white kid who's really fast,

369
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:50,800
who scored that touchdown
last week, whatever his name
is, McCaffrey Assam Shit.

370
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:55,390
We saw him.
So Mark Sanchez Sanchez the first year.

371
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,960
Jamison Winston.
What's that?

372
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,690
Mary Yoda Kit Macgyver for whatever his
name is for the titans up too old to

373
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,730
remember the fucking names. And then
we saw that Ted kid on Penn state,

374
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:07,600
the running back.

375
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:08,990
Okay.

376
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,650
Shane and whatever his name is,
we saw him last year

377
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,880
and this year we saw Brewster
baker and the six pack,

378
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,410
whatever that fucking name is.

379
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:23,230
Who's Bruce to bake or how come on old
people who've remember cable when it

380
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:27,370
first came out back when these
entertainment industry was so amazing.

381
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:29,260
They let Kenny Rogers started movies.

382
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,170
Do you realize Kenny Rogers
has all kinds of hit records?

383
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,100
He started a fucking movie and uh,

384
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,080
had fast food chicken restaurant.
I don't know if he still has all that,

385
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,090
but they had to have been a point, you
know, at some point he had to look at it.

386
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,980
Whoever was his manager just be like,
dude,

387
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:51,480
I'm kind of spreading it and I'm spreading
it a little thin out of fucking you

388
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:54,660
keep putting out hit records
and make sure, you know,

389
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:56,400
nobody's putting their
hands in the register.

390
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,380
It's your 40 fucking Kenny
Rogers chicken places.

391
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,680
How much do you love Kenny Rogers
that you like? You know what?

392
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,150
I bet he makes good chicken too.

393
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,320
Like how much you believe in him
as an artist and you're like, well,

394
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,270
is an art form too? So, you know,

395
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,290
I mean I love led Zeppelin, but if John
Bottom started making fucking meat pies,

396
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,880
I mean I,
I think I'm going to pass,

397
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,240
I don't remember that being part of his
fantasy during the song remains the same.

398
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,100
Watching him make it some sort of fucking,
you know,

399
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,470
fry up or a fucking fish and chips.
He wasn't,

400
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,430
he was out on the tractors and in a
drag race, so that, that makes sense.

401
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,580
Um, he's such a horribly
misunderstood musician,

402
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,470
such a horribly misunderstood by myself.
Also,

403
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,780
you know, I was talking to somebody the
other day, there's always been like this,

404
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,590
this myth about bond him that he used
to play with these sticks that will only

405
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:03,730
like tree trunks.

406
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,660
And I remember like trying to get his
sound and I went out and I bought like a

407
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:12,370
pair of like two bs or something like
that. So if you don't know what those are,

408
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,420
I mean this thing is so big around
that, like, you know, 80 years ago,

409
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,150
legally you probably couldn't beat
your wife with it. I mean, that's,

410
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,400
that's how big this fucking
piece of wood was. Right?

411
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,480
Thinking that you are going
to get that sound. And uh,

412
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,940
there's a couple of fucking
pictures that I've looked up though.

413
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:31,711
If you really look at,

414
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:35,830
it looks like he's just using like
almost like a five a or five B,

415
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,400
just a regular size stick.
It's just he just knew any,

416
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:41,290
if you really look at him play,
he's like,

417
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,300
he never really brings his hands
up and slams down on the drums.

418
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,700
It's kind of wrist and fingers.
He just knew how to fucking hit the drum.

419
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,950
I'll tell you another guy who was amazing.

420
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:58,951
I was talking to my drum teacher about
this as I watched this clip of a James

421
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,440
Gadson who uh,
played with that,

422
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,970
that Watson hundred third street band,

423
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:09,971
but you know the ones spray deet
deet deet deet deet deet beep,

424
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,170
beep, beep, beep beep,
whatever that fucking song was.

425
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,980
Bill withers basically
took that rhythm section

426
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,840
and he went out on the road,

427
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:24,650
made albums with them and there's
a live version of him. Uh,

428
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,140
James Gadson playing and he's playing
like 16th notes and he's doing a little

429
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:33,960
ghost notes on the snare and whenever
you would go to hit the backbeat,

430
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,480
it didn't even look like he came
like two inches up off the drum.

431
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,810
It's like as ghosts notes with
down in about a half an inch.

432
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,670
And then he would just go
main.

433
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,150
Mathematically that works out cause he's
like four times higher. It should sound,

434
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:53,151
but how the crack he was getting
off the snare drum is incredible.

435
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,020
Um, anyways, I have no idea what
I'm doing, what I'm trying to do.

436
00:26:58,021 --> 00:27:01,110
I'm just trying to fill up fucking 30
minutes talking about the intricacies of

437
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:05,700
different fucking drummers
some 40, 50 years ago. Um,

438
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,580
yeah, so that's it. Billy new
wardrobe. All right. And uh,

439
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,050
I got all these fucking clothes
that fit me. Even if I'm a fat fuck,

440
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,960
uh, old Billy booze bag. So
when I'm doing is I am a,

441
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,460
I'm given all of that away and I'm
not taking it over to the fucking, um,

442
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,950
what do you call it? Goodwill.
I don't believe in those guys.

443
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,680
You go over there and people anything
that, that, that they don't want,

444
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,480
they just drop off over there. So they
only have the guilt, you know, it's like,

445
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:42,240
let's let these people throw
it in the fucking ocean. Right?

446
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,750
Actually have a friend of
mine that actually is, uh,

447
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,050
works for this place,
you know,

448
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:52,050
people recovering addicts and all of
that type of shit. What I'm saying?

449
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:55,200
Is this going to be some really
well dressed x junkies out there?

450
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,520
Not to say that have the greatest
taste. I'm just say that, you know,

451
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,670
the homeless people, my neighborhood
it can be looking at. Right. Um,

452
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,860
what do you do with socks?
So even if you wash them,

453
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:08,820
I can't get my gray socks to people.
You know what I mean? Underwear.

454
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:12,480
You definitely have to fucking throw out.
And it goes without saying,

455
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,170
even though I just said it. Um, but uh,

456
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,460
I am in very happy with the shape I'm
in right now and I'm going to just,

457
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,490
I'm going to buy clothes that just
fit this fucking shape. That's it.

458
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,690
So if I start getting out of shape,
all of a sudden my sheer,

459
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:29,730
it'll start creeping up.

460
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:32,700
My fucking white belly will be hanging
out and I'm just going to have to take it

461
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,880
because I'm not buying bigger clothes.

462
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,360
That's what I'm going to do,
you know?

463
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,070
It's all about not becoming a fat fuck,
you know?

464
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,100
And I've finally turned the
corner with my shoulder.

465
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,780
I didn't have to do any Colby Bryant
fucking Peyton manning blood in the

466
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:56,880
centrifuge and fucking Transylvania.

467
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,990
And I got blessed those two guys for doing
that too because now like you can get

468
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:05,790
that everybody's getting it done,
you know what I mean? And uh,

469
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,940
you know, pretty soon they'll level and
stem cell research and all that shit.

470
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,740
I'm just waiting like, uh, I'm still
too afraid to get lasik eye surgery.

471
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,960
I'm not going to do the stem cell shit.
What's his face?

472
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,880
Rogan was trying to hook me up with
that and I just, I that's too, I,

473
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,830
I get a little nervous about
that. You know, what does that,

474
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:25,980
they take a placenta out and they put it
in one of those kitchen aid things and

475
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:29,340
then then uh,
dropped a little virgin blood in there.

476
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,140
It just seemed a little too
fucking crazy to me. Like,

477
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,780
and then you just get this brand
new shoulder and it's like,

478
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:40,050
and then that's just it.
There's no price to pay.

479
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,180
I don't have like a slight fucking
tick in my personality. You know,

480
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:45,350
like those fucking movies

481
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,440
where you get like a hand transplant and
they took it off the cadaver or someone

482
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:54,470
who was a mass murderer and all of a
sudden the hand wants to keep murdering

483
00:29:54,471 --> 00:29:58,950
people.
You know,

484
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,780
you get your shoulder fixed and all of a
sudden you check your grandmother. Yeah.

485
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,560
Boarding.
You know,

486
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,100
she's bent down in her house coat to
pick up a slipper and you just send her

487
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:10,190
into the fireplace. You're like,
man, I don't know why it did that.

488
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:14,360
It's not being good. It's by no
shoulder. Like, you know, whatever.

489
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:18,590
I'm a fucking idiot. All right,
that's the podcast. Enjoy the music.

490
00:30:18,591 --> 00:30:23,060
And now we're going to give you a
little half hour of, um, some, uh,

491
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,760
classic Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

492
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:29,630
Monday morning podcasts from Thursday
gone by in a year that already happened or

493
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:33,200
possibly earlier this year.
Congratulations Alabama.

494
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,280
Uh,
you guys are the fucking Yankees.

495
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:39,170
You're the fucking Celtic Shear,

496
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:44,171
the Montreal Canadiens via
the Green Bay packers of the,

497
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:49,520
of, of college football. You can't
debate it. You guys are the best.

498
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:53,510
All right. Congratulations. You
fucking cunt. All right, that's it.

499
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,040
I'll, I'll to have a great weekend.
You consult to talk to you on Monday.

500
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,393
Yeah.

501
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,583
Resubmit.

502
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,460
What's

503
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,080
going on? It's bill burn. It's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

504
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:00,620
January 11th, 2010. You know,

505
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,210
I was going to try to start this
podcast just by saying hello.

506
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,370
But now it's like such like a a uh,
it's a tick. It's like I have to say it,

507
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:11,460
I got to say, Hey, what's going
on? It can't just be like, hello,

508
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:16,620
this is bill Burke. You know, I can't
switch it up. That's my catch phrase.

509
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,420
What's going on? Um, you know, I
figured out what this cough is.

510
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:22,111
Did I tell you about it?

511
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:25,870
I'm coughing up what tastes like
lighter fluid and it's actually the,

512
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,110
the chemical that they put
on the outside of those,

513
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,970
those Kingsford or
whatever the fuck they are.

514
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:33,030
Those bricks have been grilling
a lot and every, you know,

515
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,990
when you grill on a Hibachi,
I dunno what it is. Um,

516
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,340
somehow no matter you stand,
it's always blowing in your face.

517
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,140
So, uh, anyway, so let's get
down to business here this week.

518
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:49,560
I won't be whispering this
week because, uh, you know,

519
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:53,430
if that was just like a one day
vigil for, for old people, you know,

520
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,080
I flew the flag at half mast and a,
I also was doing that doing the podcast.

521
00:32:58,081 --> 00:33:00,180
By the way,
I was doing it last last week.

522
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:02,190
I did it Sunday night
at 11 o'clock at night.

523
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:05,070
So all you fucking morons
who sent me emails going on,

524
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,590
you wrote the book. I mean,
did you see the comedy in that,

525
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,140
that a 41 year old guy was whispering?

526
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,050
Do you got to take everything
at face fucking value?

527
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,260
Like I was going to whisper for the rest
of my podcast yet dumps Fox got like

528
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,500
five emails about that,
you know,

529
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,600
and it's not even like I
don't like these people.

530
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:31,590
It just reminds me of how fucking stupid
I am. I, you know, as a human being,

531
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:35,700
if this is what I attract and believe me,
I got a lot of shit this week.

532
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,800
The Jesus freaks came
out and force this week.

533
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,080
Um, I'll be reading those later and uh,
I have some questions for you people.

534
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,570
Okay. So all right. Um,

535
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,690
evidently is come to my attention
that g cast, which is the server,

536
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,060
is that the correct computer word?
Um,

537
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,980
why is it same as 46 degrees out here?
It's not 46 degrees.

538
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,120
Just sat on my fucking Hoodie
was dying out there anyways.

539
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,280
It's kind of my attention that g cast,

540
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,640
the server that I post all my podcasts
on is not going to be accepting any new

541
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:20,371
podcasters or any new
podcasts as of February 1st.

542
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:25,660
So what that means is,

543
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:30,661
I'm sad to say that the Monday
morning podcast is coming to a close.

544
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,080
All right? It's a, you know,
everything has a beginning,

545
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,350
everything has a metal
and everything has an end.

546
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:42,220
So say be shared should say it'd be done.
All right,

547
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:47,221
so I'm riding this fucker out till
January 31st and then that is it.

548
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,660
No more and Nada, you guys are
on your own on Mondays. Okay.

549
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:56,980
Cause I'm not playing this fucking
Internet game anymore. You know,

550
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,150
I already went from fucking my space
over to Facebook and now I got to go to g

551
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:05,740
CAS to fucking age cast.
Fuck all of them.

552
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,580
All right, you want to hear my
jokes? You come out and you see me,

553
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,180
you put money in my pocket,
then I'll dance for you.

554
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,510
I'm just fucking with you.
I need some help on that.

555
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:19,660
I just said that cause you know,

556
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,450
you know like someone who's not going
to kill themselves but they just say

557
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:25,840
they're going to so they can just
find out how much people care. No,

558
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,060
don't you then how we love you.
You have so much to live for.

559
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,990
You have a Monte Carlo,
you have for Laura seats,

560
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:35,900
you're going to get the air conditioning
sixth and even if you don't,

561
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,720
you still have the tee tops.
Um,

562
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,500
no I'm not gonna I'm not going to quit.
What? Just cause g cast is tapping out.

563
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,230
You don't, and you know why they're
tapping out is because of guys like me.

564
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,270
You know what I mean? It's this whole
fucking free entertainment thing.

565
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,750
I don't charge charge for the podcast.
They don't charge me for uploaded.

566
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,460
Nobody's making any fucking
money. We're just, we're, we're,

567
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:02,940
we're dancing for free and we're getting
sweaty and our shiny shirts a stick

568
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:05,820
into our chest and was starting to go,
what the fuck are we doing here?

569
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,860
We want to get paid. So I think that
that's what's going on. Um, I dunno,

570
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,750
I consider the podcast more of a hobby,

571
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,200
but I gotta tell you when I get into
my 50s and eight or nine years here,

572
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,100
believe it or not, Jesus, um, yeah,

573
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,830
there's gonna come a moment where I'm not
going to be wanting to go on the road.

574
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,480
And,
uh,

575
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,320
at that point I'll have to start charging
for the podcast and I really shouldn't

576
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:34,590
have said in my fifties, because I
might start doing it when I turned 42.

577
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,830
You know, whatever, you guys can't get
mad at me. I'm trying to live the dream.

578
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,850
Would it be awesome if you could just
fucking lay around all day, you know,

579
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,690
Talk Shit into a microphone.
Right. You know? Right.

580
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,590
What the hell the accent come from,
right? You talk shit new microflow right.

581
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,750
Just think about this dream. Okay?
You fucking, you sit around all day,

582
00:36:57,751 --> 00:37:01,860
you talk shit, you rubbing your balls.
So you have the JJ as Oprah says,

583
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,090
don't you hate it? Which fucking older
women talk about their fucking privates.

584
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,140
Yeah. Know it's just, it's fucking
old people shouldn't do that.

585
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,140
You don't have that. She's old, but she's
old enough to know. Just like Madonna,

586
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,650
you know, puts you a clam away.
Okay? You're going to give people,

587
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,950
you being went down on Madonna at this
point. You'd get like food poisoning.

588
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,080
I'm sorry. That was disgusting. You know,

589
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,800
fuck. Speaking of that, and I'll
be in Seattle. Speaking of fish,

590
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,680
I'm going to be just
thought a fisherman's wharf.

591
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,620
I'm going to be up in Seattle this
week. And uh, doing uh, Marty reamers,

592
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,350
uh, funny fest at the
paramount theater. Uh,

593
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:54,150
all the information is up on [inaudible]
Dot Com B u r r.com. You go there,

594
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:57,570
you click on the link, you buy tickets
should come out. I talk, I tell my jokes.

595
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:01,810
She'd go, wow, that was really funny.
And then you go home to your life. And A,

596
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:05,850
I go back to a hotel and I stare
at the ceiling. Um, all right,

597
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:09,900
let's stay on course here. Um, yeah,

598
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:13,740
so I need to know what the next g cast is.
All right.

599
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:18,741
You guys gradually helped me go
from my space on to Facebook and a,

600
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:22,530
which I'm doing, which sucks, by the
way. Thanks a lot for the advice.

601
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,940
You know,
Facebook sucks.

602
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,320
All these fucking people can find you
out of nowhere and they start talking to

603
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:33,930
you. And then I also found out
that I can only add 5,000 people.

604
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:37,270
I got to start my own page.
There's already a fan page.

605
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:41,260
Now I've got to figure out how to take
the fucking thing over. Yeah, I dunno.

606
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:46,150
I Dunno. It's, it's uh, you
know, it's fucking weird.

607
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,170
Then all of a sudden somebody kicked
in the balls and third grade find you.

608
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,320
It's just weird. It's just
a weird, I don't know.

609
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,960
I don't fucking, I dunno. My space
was better. My space is better.

610
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,420
I could just say this is me
and I could start my own page.

611
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,100
I didn't have to fucking say,
oh,

612
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:06,730
this is just a fan page and pretend
like it's not me, but it really is me.

613
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,820
You know, there was a truth
in my space that I liked.

614
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,460
This is me whoring myself out. How
are you as opposed to now? Gee,

615
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,980
Bill, why don't you explain
it 15 different fucking ways.

616
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:22,450
We've been on Facebook for three years.
You'd think we don't know what it is. Um,

617
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:26,740
so anyways, if you guys know what the
new, uh, the new g cast is going to be,

618
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:31,330
if you could help me out. Um, I'm
also going to call up other comedians,

619
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,280
um, such as Mark Marin.
All right. Mark Marin,

620
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,570
who does,
uh,

621
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:42,350
the WTF as in what the fuck
podcast every week. And uh,

622
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,930
I actually was on his show last
week and had an, I had a great time,

623
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,910
just had a great time. And uh, these
podcasts are fucking unbelievable.

624
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm really like a,
a,

625
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:58,390
a huge fan of these and how like a bunch
of comedians are doing them now and

626
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:00,160
then you get like different Comedians,
uh,

627
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,500
can go on together and shoot the shit.
I think it's a,

628
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,161
it's tremendous.

629
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:09,160
I wish they had these back in the day
when I was coming up and I was listening

630
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:10,810
to my favorite Comedians,
you know,

631
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,450
I would love to hear them shoot the
shit with each other, but you know,

632
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,300
they didn't have computers
back then. We'll, they did.

633
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:19,660
They had those ones that were the size
of a fucking elementary school, you know,

634
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:22,840
and they had those big reel to reel tapes.
Remember that?

635
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,870
I used to love how like on
like the $6 million man,

636
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:28,240
they just had all those fake
computers in the background.

637
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,930
It was just like Christmas tree lights
that were just blinking on and off.

638
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,640
Then there was always
like, like the big, yeah,

639
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:38,020
the big reel to reel three
quarter inch tape. Um, anyways,

640
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,610
so I'm going to be on that as
of today. Um, I got to find,

641
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:46,600
God dammit, I got to look that
up. I think it's, what the fuck.

642
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,400
I hope Maryn doesn't listen to this cause
I told him I was going to hype it and

643
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,430
then I did. And let me
look it up. What WTF?

644
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:59,080
Pod cast typing with my middle finger.
There we go.

645
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:04,081
Mark Marin podcasts yet WTF
pod dot L I B s y n.com.

646
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,510
Go on that and you'll listen
to me talking to, you know,

647
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,120
I actually covered some of the material,
not material,

648
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:14,500
just sort of riffing from last week.

649
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:19,501
I did tell them the story of
the old man yelling at me and a,

650
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:21,220
for those of you who are going to be like,
cool you already,

651
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,700
you already said you repeat.
You repeated a couple things dude.

652
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,330
So you said you're kind of like you
do when something happens to you,

653
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:31,510
when you retell the story
becomes a story and you tell it.

654
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,580
Listen to that here, that lighter fluid.
Hey, sound like fucking Lucille Ball.

655
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,190
Do you remember how,

656
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,140
how fucking old I was talking with
the fuck was I talking to this about?

657
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:47,100
About how quickly people got old
back in the day. Like celebrities,

658
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,100
like Lucille ball is
unbelief. She looks, you know,

659
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:55,410
she looks gorgeous on I love
Lucy. You know, I love Lucy, um,

660
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,110
faces all smooth or whatever.
And then, I don't know,

661
00:41:58,111 --> 00:42:03,000
her next show is in color that show with
Mr. Mooney and she just comes out and

662
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,570
he say,

663
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:08,570
they said here that that fucking
camel unfiltered cigarette.

664
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,201
I think that's cause yeah,

665
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:14,150
back then they smoke kind of
unfiltered cigarettes and um,

666
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,400
okay.

667
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,730
Being Tan was really big for a
celebrity and she was a redhead.

668
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,180
I don't fucking know. I don't know
what happens. So anyways, that, that,

669
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:25,120
that is where I'm at.

670
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,350
I need some help here as
far as where I'm going to,

671
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,910
where I'm going to post these,
uh, these latest podcasts and a,

672
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,540
and that's it. Now we're into the podcast.
I just bullshitted for 10 minutes.

673
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,300
All right.
Um,

674
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,810
last week I talked about the old guy
downstairs and how I was having a problem

675
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:50,230
with him and I got to tell you,

676
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,980
I was really surprised at the
feedback that I got from that. Um,

677
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,640
some of your suggestions,
I know a lot of you were joking,

678
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,220
but nobody really gave me any good advice
that I really saw other than, you know,

679
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:07,670
he's all just fucking let him
be and whatever people go, dude,

680
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,680
you know what I would do?

681
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,810
I fucking turned my TV up as loud as they
fucking cloud Jode I'd put this chair,

682
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,920
I buy a fucking Tuba, right?
I buy a toolbar at high,

683
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:17,830
the fucking porch in
the second he came out,

684
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,050
I just fucking blow into it and the guy
would think that he shared his pants.

685
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:21,311
Right.

686
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:24,400
You just keep fucking doing it till he
really does start shitting his pants.

687
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:29,050
What idiots. I love that whole, you know,

688
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:30,950
I would be loud as humanly possible.
What?

689
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:35,620
So I can actually piss off the same
neighbors in my complex who are actually

690
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:39,730
paying a decent amount of rent.
When they start complaining,

691
00:43:39,731 --> 00:43:43,660
then I'm in fucking trouble. Okay.
I'll let fucking, uh, you know,

692
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,530
this one guy was just like,
you know, I think, Oh God,

693
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:48,880
I got to find this fucking email.

694
00:43:48,881 --> 00:43:53,881
This guy tried to suggest that because
the guy downstairs use the term hip that

695
00:43:56,321 --> 00:44:00,520
he was actually a racist
because,

696
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:05,610
and he used the definition of hip from
way back in the day and zoot suits and I

697
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,970
didn't even know what the
fuck he was talking about.

698
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,600
I was just like your projecting
this on him. It's like, okay,

699
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:14,460
so you can project what you
want to project on them.

700
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:16,470
Okay.

701
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,800
I don't know why am I taking this shit
seriously? Alright, let's move on here.

702
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:22,380
You guys were here, so he has a couple
of youtube videos you want to check out.

703
00:44:22,381 --> 00:44:27,210
This one is, this one is
actually not a youtube video. Um,

704
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,880
this is just a great one about this
kid who had a party down in that got

705
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,390
completely out of control and now his
parents are being sued for 20 grand.

706
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:41,391
He sorta the Australian Jeff Spicoli
and they put him on the news and the,

707
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:42,900
uh,

708
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,190
the news lady keeps trying to get him to
apologize and he doesn't really give a

709
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:51,630
shit. It's fucking great.
Um, and this is what it is.

710
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:55,740
Get you a little pens and pencils
out. All right, grab your post.

711
00:44:55,741 --> 00:45:00,670
Its it's on [inaudible] dot com and uh,

712
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,690
the name of the video is funny kid isn't
sorry about huge party break.com p r e

713
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:10,350
a k.com and um,
I don't know,

714
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:13,350
I really want to tell you what happens
but then I'll ruin it and it's um,

715
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,151
actually you know,

716
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:18,690
something that made me feel better
about America when I saw that because it

717
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:22,590
looked that looked like an American
story and the newscaster look, you know,

718
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,780
it's just nice to see that those stories
about nothing that don't even matter

719
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:29,820
exist in other countries and if you,

720
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:33,380
if you are in another country and uh,

721
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,930
you have some shit like that because
people always trash in America about how

722
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:41,340
fat and fucking stupid we are and I'll,
you know, we're just being fed bullshit.

723
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,840
This is a classic,

724
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,730
classic kind of store that you see on
the news here in the states as they call

725
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:52,590
them. So it's just great to see that
down under, you know, by the way,

726
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:56,490
speaking of Australia, what is the
deal? What's the deal with that?

727
00:45:56,491 --> 00:46:00,990
Foster's lager with that
depth charge size beer.

728
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,800
Can I,
that's why I've never drank one.

729
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,330
I never understood like the
40 ounce either. It's like,

730
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:10,380
let me hold this in my hand until
it gets pissed warm, you know,

731
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,870
why wouldn't you just,

732
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,870
or you get those big Oktoberfest beer
steins and they pour like 19 beers in

733
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:20,130
there. It's like, why
don't you just have a beer,

734
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,290
finish it and then move
on to the next one.

735
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:26,310
It can be nice and cold and you see that
little frosty smoke coming out the top.

736
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:30,270
Oh my God, I'm getting
fucking thirsty by the way.

737
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:34,910
I'm 10 days into my sobriety and um,

738
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,430
I got to say, I, uh, I miss it.

739
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:43,200
I really miss it and I don't crave it.
I like it.

740
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,480
Did I already talk about this last week?
I can't even fucking remember. And uh,

741
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,520
if I told you guys what I did this week,

742
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,520
I went to that guitar center drum off
friend of mine hooked me up with some

743
00:46:56,521 --> 00:47:01,521
tickets and I saw these fucking
unbelievably talented drummers.

744
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:07,010
I got to be backstage and it was just
like every fucking famous drummer you

745
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:10,830
could. Kenny Aronoff, Tommy Lee,

746
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,200
Allen White, uh, Taylor Hawkins.

747
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,780
Who the fuck else was
there? Uh, Danny Carry,

748
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:28,350
Chad Smith was fucking everybody.
Jason Bonham. Everybody was,

749
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,480
it was fucking unreal.
I wanted to get pictures with all of them,

750
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:35,110
but I didn't know it was just like, cause
I could tell they were all fucking day,

751
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:36,980
you know, cause they're all
on the road all the time.

752
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,620
They never get to see each other.

753
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,480
Now they're all just hanging in there
talking drums. And I want to be like,

754
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:45,620
you know, like that fat guy in animal
house. Like, hey you guys playing cards.

755
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,050
I didn't want to do it. So I just,
you know, I was just like, all right,

756
00:47:48,051 --> 00:47:51,410
just remember everything that's here
and this is what sucks is I was on the

757
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:56,300
wagon and I could have
done a shot a Jaeger with
somebody's fucking super famous

758
00:47:56,301 --> 00:47:59,330
and I fucking turned it down just
because I was on the fucking wag. It's,

759
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:02,180
I don't know if that means I'm
smart or I'm fucking stupid.

760
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:06,590
But at the bottom line it was, it was
Jaeger, which I've never understood.

761
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:11,600
It's like, it's like motor oil and
syrup and you know, something that,

762
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:15,280
that does become an age where you
don't drink. He Yeager anymore. Dude,

763
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:18,110
you want to do a or bump? No, I don't.

764
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:22,880
I'll drink some fucking fix some vodka,
maybe a little scotch.

765
00:48:22,881 --> 00:48:25,130
And I'll pretend like I'm a fucking man,
you know,

766
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:29,450
and I'm shaving designs into
my chest hair. Um, all right.

767
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,630
So anyways, uh, yeah, I got to admit,

768
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:36,320
I fucking miss it and there's No God damn
way I'm going to make it until March.

769
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,230
I know I'm not, but I'm
just taking it a, you know,

770
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:42,263
yeah.

771
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,820
I'm not an alcoholic.

772
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,300
I just really enjoy it. You
know, this is this, like for me,

773
00:48:50,301 --> 00:48:55,010
quitting alcohol forever is
the same as just being like a,

774
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,540
yeah.

775
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,330
Just saying like, I'm never going to
have ice cream again. It's like, why?

776
00:48:59,331 --> 00:49:02,350
Why wouldn't you, why ice
cream is awesome. You know,

777
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,850
you don't have it every day and you've,
so you've become a fat fuck.

778
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:08,930
I'm not saying to do that, but to never
have it again. You know, to never have a,

779
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,950
you know, a beer or a glass of wine,
you know, I don't, I don't know.

780
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:17,480
There's no fucking way I'm making it.
This is really making me thirsty.

781
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,720
And you know what else sucks is I
got all these great beer glasses,

782
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:23,660
like those glasses they have
on the commercials, you know,

783
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:27,650
even got those Sam Adam
once for Christmas and uh,

784
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:31,020
I've just been filling them
up with water drinking.

785
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,130
It's fucking religious
dude.

786
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:41,870
I don't know if this cop's going
to go away. Um, so anyways, uh,

787
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,270
oh yeah, somebody wrote me
who was at the rose bowl,

788
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:48,650
evidently cheap trick was playing there
and she was giving me shit for drinking,

789
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:52,010
which she should have. And
she goes, I feel bad for you.

790
00:49:52,011 --> 00:49:54,140
And one of the reasons
why she goes is you,

791
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:59,060
you missed the greatest band in the
world. Cheap trick. And uh, you know,

792
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:03,080
come on, really at this point, cheap
trick is still the greatest band ever.

793
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,080
Do you really want to see people
who are pushing 60 singing?

794
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:09,380
I want you to want me.
That really goes back to Oprah.

795
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,540
Say and for JJ or Madonna walking around
with one of her pussy lips hanging out.

796
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,620
It's like,
you know,

797
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,060
at some point you got to put your genitals
away and just realize it's over. Okay.

798
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,353
Okay.

799
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,570
I don't know, but what are you supposed
to do? You've got to make money.

800
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,640
You got to sing the
hits, right? That's okay.

801
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,850
What is lady Gaga I going to sing about?

802
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:33,200
And she really going to walk around with
no fucking pants that I just bring up.

803
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:36,470
Lady Gaga. Look at me. Look at me
bringing up the new shit music.

804
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,870
Is it me or is this like the worst music
of all time with that auto tune? Um,

805
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,930
I don't even give a shit
about that tea pots of topic.

806
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:49,880
I'm just a fucking scrolling around
here. Okay. Another youtube thing.

807
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:54,050
I actually, somebody sent me this
great link that I, of course I lost.

808
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,470
There's been a couple of people who,
um,

809
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,100
have been taking clips from my
podcast and adding pictures to them.

810
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,560
Um, I guess if you just search my name,
somebody did one where I was talking to,

811
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,800
somebody asked me the question,

812
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,500
if you are in a gymnasium
full of eight year olds,

813
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:14,330
how many of them do you think you could
kill before they overpowered you? And, uh,

814
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,550
somebody put pictures to
the answer to my story.

815
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:20,630
And I actually really enjoyed it because,
uh, I kind of forgot that question.

816
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:21,080
You know,

817
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,380
it's been long enough where I actually
got to listen to it like it was somebody

818
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,300
else and they did a great job with it.

819
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,750
So whoever did that or is doing those,

820
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:33,920
I really appreciate that
because they're fucking funny.

821
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:38,210
They're really cool looking and maybe
I'll sell a couple extra tickets at the

822
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,220
uncle fucky shit, check whoever
the hell on performing. Um,

823
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,960
so thank you for wherever the hell is
doing those. Um, all right. That's it.

824
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,800
Yeah. Okay. Next topic.
This is really fucking,

825
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:54,710
it's just really just I need to
booze again tonight, you know,

826
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,070
to make it flow more.
Um,

827
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,880
somebody asked me this
question or actually told me
a story of a friend of his,

828
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:07,140
this is sort of a reoccurring story that
I've heard over the years. Okay. Uh,

829
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:07,641
do it.

830
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:12,641
A friend of mine was hanging out and
this famous athlete was there and,

831
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:16,610
uh, they had a couple of
drinks and next thing you know,

832
00:52:16,611 --> 00:52:20,750
it's like the guys kind of hitting on
them, you know, what the fuck, blah, blah,

833
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:21,680
blah, blah, blah, blah.

834
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,910
So this guy was telling this story about
this professional athlete, I guess, who,

835
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:29,900
uh,
allegedly was hitting on a friend of his.

836
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,120
And in the end he's like, dude, you know,
I don't, I don't really, uh, you know,

837
00:52:35,121 --> 00:52:37,880
it doesn't bother me anyways, but
he said, so what do you think,

838
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:40,400
what do you think about gay
people in Pro Sports? I mean,

839
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:42,710
the amount of people who play
in the various pro sports,

840
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:47,990
that has to be more than a couple.
Um, what do you think about it?

841
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:48,883
Um,

842
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,630
I think it's fucking hilarious and I
hope somebody comes out at some point

843
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:58,280
because it, and I hope it's a
football player because it's such a,

844
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:01,670
you know, they're always fucking thumping
their chest and shit and screaming.

845
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,990
And it would just be funny,

846
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,410
especially if it was somebody really
dominant. You know what I mean?

847
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,420
Like just some psycho middle linebacker.
He's just fucking drill at night.

848
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,303
That's a bad word.

849
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:20,300
Who's just fucking stick and everything
about it is gay drilling, sticking,

850
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,580
you know, football is a really gay
sport when you look it, you know,

851
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:28,990
this is really hacky material,
but you know, you know,

852
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:33,830
I've made whatever it was the quarterback
and then the center's got a bend over

853
00:53:33,831 --> 00:53:35,660
in front of them.
And then the whole fucking thing,

854
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:39,170
just the uncomfortableness
alone in the locker room.

855
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,420
And then what's even better is,
you know,

856
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:46,160
those people who show up at sports bars
and they have the name of their favorite

857
00:53:46,161 --> 00:53:47,720
player on the back,

858
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:50,960
which I always thought was
hilarious because it's always
this sort of an element

859
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,800
of like, it always reminded
me of, uh, of high school.

860
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,860
Like when the cheerleader would be
dating the quarterback heat, she'd,

861
00:53:57,861 --> 00:54:00,590
where is Letterman jacket?
Jesus Christ built.

862
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:04,010
What'd you go to high school in
the fifties you know what I mean?

863
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,470
She'd fucking wear his jacket.
So I always thought it was a,

864
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,010
I was always some buddies yesterday in
the sports bar and they were talking

865
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:13,461
about that,

866
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:17,970
that the only Jersey you can wear as like
the Jersey of a guy who was like, uh,

867
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,550
who was the shit when you were a kid?

868
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:23,180
Cause then then it was okay to wear like
a Roger Staubach Jersey or something.

869
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:27,520
But when you're an adult and
you're wearing the Jersey
of a guy who's like just,

870
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:32,240
it's, it's Kinda Gay, the whole
fucking thing is kinda gay.

871
00:54:32,241 --> 00:54:35,870
So what did it make sense? You know,
they're always patting each other on the,

872
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:39,230
I think it would be fucking hilarious.

873
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,540
But the problem is,

874
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:44,060
is I don't think a lot of other people
would that that's like one of those

875
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:44,870
certain times.

876
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:48,410
There's certain stories that come out
and I just kind of stay off the Internet

877
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:51,770
for like four days because I just
don't want to see the fucking,

878
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,610
the hate and all the, the shit that,
you know, it would start with that.

879
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:59,960
And then it would eventually go over to
TV and then they would get caught up in

880
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:03,080
the air, quote, hysteria. Um,

881
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:06,530
and then the Bible people would come out
and they would start talking about the

882
00:55:06,531 --> 00:55:10,670
Lord says that it's a man should never
lay with another man and all that fucking

883
00:55:10,671 --> 00:55:11,504
shit.

884
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:17,050
And then they would say role models that
the classic hysteria over absolutely

885
00:55:19,701 --> 00:55:24,350
nothing that like literally 8% of the
population would be freaking out about.

886
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,680
And the other 92% would
either be watching and just,

887
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:30,200
or just completely not
even give a shit. So, uh,

888
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,710
I don't know if that's what I feel. I
don't think, I don't think it's, look,

889
00:55:33,711 --> 00:55:38,360
if you can fucking catch the ball and make
my table and, uh, I don't give a fuck.

890
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,240
I'll take a whole team of fags

891
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:47,570
to not have what happened to my team
yesterday against the fucking ravens.

892
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,730
I don't give a shit.
They can all skip onto the field.

893
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,960
I could give a fuck just
when the Goddamn game. Wow.

894
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,080
Hats off

895
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,550
to the fucking ravens. That fucking
a, that was total domination.

896
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,331
And I gotta tell you,

897
00:56:01,331 --> 00:56:06,331
I'm really disappointed in patriots fans
with the amount of fans that fucking

898
00:56:06,551 --> 00:56:08,800
left. But I got to tell
you, I'm not surprised.

899
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,050
I'm really not surprised because that
is a through line through all of fucking

900
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,470
sports. The amount of people
who show up when you're winning,

901
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,230
everybody shows up when the
fucking winning, you know,

902
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,050
and then all of a sudden you
go through rough waters. Right.

903
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,530
And then where does everybody
go? They all fucking leave. Oh,

904
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:32,340
I'm the watch new shit and everybody
fucking storms out at that. That was,

905
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:34,560
that was embarrassing.
He stayed at the end.

906
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:37,760
I stayed at the end of the sports bar
taking shit from people. I'll do it.

907
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:41,700
Speaking of which, how much of this
sports bar and this fucking ravens fan?

908
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,260
It was almost like performance art.
Like you know what,

909
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:47,820
like when you go to a sports bar,

910
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,630
the one thing that sucks is going to be
the people who are rooting for the other

911
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:55,230
team. You know, people are going to
break balls like as a patriots fan.

912
00:56:55,231 --> 00:56:57,700
Do you know, you go in there,
if you're going to wear any
sorta patriots, you know,

913
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:02,370
tee shirt or a hat, you know,
somebody's going to be like,
ah, you fucking cheaters.

914
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,610
Or uh, you know, fuck the
Patriots. And you know what I,

915
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:08,940
whenever the fuck they
gonna say, um, you know,

916
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,880
break Tom Brady's other knee,
the usual bullshit.

917
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,680
But then there's always those people who
take it like too far and it starts to

918
00:57:16,681 --> 00:57:21,390
get to the point of, uh, you know,
there's going to be a fight. All right,

919
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,200
this guy,
I've never seen anything like this guy.

920
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:30,240
When the Ravens, the Ravens scored
a touchdown on their first play,

921
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:34,950
literally handed the ball off and ray
rice just runs right up the gut and then

922
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,250
breaks it to the left and just goes right.
Okay. And as they're doing it right.

923
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,280
This guy who everyone was saying look
like it was like Kevin James Sort of build

924
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,920
with the head of Shrek and I'm not even
joking and he just starts going like as

925
00:57:52,441 --> 00:57:56,610
the guys, when he scored the
touchdown, this guy did like this.

926
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,200
I can't even just, I can't, I wish
I was doing a video podcast and no,

927
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:04,260
I'm not going to start doing
those. Um, he just started going,

928
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:09,000
he started doing like if just magic,
if you exaggerated like walking,

929
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,780
like if he just were bringing your
knees up really high and you will like

930
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:13,920
bringing your fucking arms up,

931
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:17,430
almost like you power walking but you're
doing it in slow motion and he just was

932
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:18,080
going,

933
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,610
ah,

934
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,920
like as long as you could do
it until you out of breath.

935
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,220
And then the funniest thing ever
was winning at the end of it.

936
00:58:26,221 --> 00:58:28,050
He yelled out super bowl,

937
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,300
I almost fucking fell down into my
breakfast burrito when he yelled out super

938
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:39,200
bowl.
It's fucking a wildcard game.

939
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:43,520
You just went up seven and nothing on
the first play. And this guy, he's,

940
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,510
he's calling Superbowl already.
And Dude, I'm telling you.

941
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:52,220
And this was the thing when he was
doing okay and immediately I'm like,

942
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:55,100
all right, he is going to be
this loud, the whole game.

943
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:59,330
I am going into the other room.
So this is where it gets bad.

944
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:02,350
Now I'm in the other room. You want to be
that fucking loud, be that fucking loud.

945
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,840
But now when he starts doing is
anytime the ravens make a great play,

946
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,790
he comes in.
Oh,

947
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:11,990
I notice you don't like when Kevin Garnett
fucking dunks the ball and you just

948
00:59:11,991 --> 00:59:15,110
see him screaming.
That's what he was doing.

949
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:19,250
Anytime the ravens were doing anything,
he was doing that. Like he was doing it.

950
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:24,250
So what we started, because he was
fat, we started yelling out appetizers.

951
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:28,950
He'd be like, La Ravens,
we like potato skins,

952
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:30,870
fucking buffalo wings.

953
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,230
Right?
And it just,

954
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:37,250
and it started off funny and then by the
end it just started getting really ugly

955
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:41,680
and it almost was like escalating into a,

956
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,930
I don't know, I'll do it. He just,

957
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:47,110
it was just one of those
classic situations where, um,

958
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:51,670
you know what I kept thinking of, I just
was wishing Joe pass, she was there,

959
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,410
you know when casino,

960
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,950
where he stabs the person in the neck
with the pen and then they're down in the

961
00:59:56,951 --> 01:00:00,200
ground like Ooh, he goes, he goes,
hey, is that a little girl? Hey,

962
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,560
you hit a little here, a little girl
crying down there like the lily.

963
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:04,300
That's what I wanted
to do by the end of it.

964
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:06,240
And um,

965
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,060
I don't know man.
I like that.

966
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:10,760
That's why I don't like going
to sports bars cause I look at,

967
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:15,080
I love talking Shit and you know,
you show up and your team gets your ass,

968
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,180
gets their ass kick you,
you got to take the shit.

969
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:21,950
But like it gets to a certain point where
now you're like yelling at me or in my

970
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:22,581
direction,

971
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:25,820
like I'm going to be intimidated by you
and now you making me feel like I'm some

972
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:29,990
sort of bitch and now I got to yell
shit back at you. And it just like,

973
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:33,560
I kind of left it with like a headache.
It like it wasn't

974
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:35,860
[inaudible].
I even hate like there's a,

975
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:40,330
there's a particular person down at
that bar who's a patriots fan who's,

976
01:00:40,331 --> 01:00:43,530
it's just a fucking
asshole. Um, I was just of,

977
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,670
you guys have any stories like that.
Like he'd go to the sports bar.

978
01:00:45,671 --> 01:00:47,020
The guy who like takes it too far.

979
01:00:47,021 --> 01:00:49,390
Have you ever seen it actually
escalate into a fight?

980
01:00:49,391 --> 01:00:53,920
Because I always want to see those guys
get punched in the face and I'm not

981
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:56,830
going to do it because a,
I don't want to get my ass kicked and be,

982
01:00:56,831 --> 01:01:00,820
I don't want to, you know,
you know, you know the option
a, you get your ass kicked.

983
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:06,060
Well, just pictures of me on the ground.
You know when you get your ass kicked,

984
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:07,610
how you,
how messed up your hair gets

985
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,100
you breathing really hard and
you're trying not to cry. Ah,

986
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,310
it just always feels like the
playground is mine was up.

987
01:01:19,311 --> 01:01:20,960
Just be like grass in your hair.

988
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:24,650
Remember that Shit when you got
your ass kicked in the playground,

989
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:26,360
how just alive you word afterwards,

990
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:30,230
we could just fucking feel everything
in your ears were always hot. You know,

991
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:31,220
it's just fucking weird.

992
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:36,300
Anyways. Um, the fuck am
I talking about? Oh yeah.

993
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:40,710
That's just sort of the option
now in public where it's like,

994
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:45,660
if, uh, that's, that's the situation
now when you get into a fight,

995
01:01:45,661 --> 01:01:49,780
either you fight and you lose or
you win and you get sued. Dude,

996
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm really sorry about
my throat this week.

997
01:01:51,001 --> 01:01:53,220
I don't what the fuck's going on here?
Like,

998
01:01:53,221 --> 01:01:57,420
did you guys see Ya then I talk about,
I am so fucking out of Jersey shore.

999
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:00,210
Was that last two weeks ago,
this past week.

1000
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:04,230
This fucking guy starts talking
to one of the castmates all right.

1001
01:02:04,231 --> 01:02:07,470
And he had at a bar and he's
trying to cause a fight.

1002
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,840
He's just begging for a fight and
the kid keeps telling, you know,

1003
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,700
I don't want to talk to
you. Leave, leave, go away.

1004
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,810
And if finally escalates into a fight and
the kids from the Jersey shore fucking

1005
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,350
kid gets onto a couple
of knees, some, you know,

1006
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,700
the classic bar fight and ends up on the
ground and the other guys get nuggies

1007
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,350
to the back of the head,
right? He goes, I went, no,

1008
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,660
he's ours at an east coast thing.

1009
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:33,300
Those are those short little quick
punches that are just pretty much knuckle

1010
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:36,690
based. It's like, oh the Bruce Lee
one inch punch without the power.

1011
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,030
He's just sort of wrapping on
your head like it's a door. Um,

1012
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,070
and now I evidently that kid's
getting sued. It's like for what?

1013
01:02:43,071 --> 01:02:47,490
Cause he won the fight. The other
kid wanted to fight. I Dunno.

1014
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,960
I think it's fucking stupid.

1015
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:53,310
And then of course his girlfriend was
really the one provoking it because the

1016
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:57,390
guy was ignoring him and the girlfriend
kept talking shit. Of course she does.

1017
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,830
Of course she talks shit
because she doesn't have to
fight him. It was hilarious.

1018
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,390
So then when they go to square off,

1019
01:03:03,391 --> 01:03:06,630
the other guy's girlfriend actually
starts walking up to the Jersey shore kit

1020
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:10,560
and it's just trying to, just
standing there scratching at his face.

1021
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:11,791
And what's funny,

1022
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:15,120
she's doing it with one hand and there
are other hand is just hanging down at

1023
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:18,150
her side. She doesn't have it up
blocking that side of her head.

1024
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,120
She doesn't need to cause he, she knows
she's not, he's not gonna hit her.

1025
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:23,310
So the other girl causes the fight,

1026
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,950
escalates into a fight and then the
other girl gets to walk up and just sorta

1027
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,540
take swipes at this kid's face.
Then the two guys fight the fight ends,

1028
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,300
the Jersey shore kid gets up
and then the girl, the other,

1029
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,380
the fucking Jersey shore girls
going, oh my God, Oh my God,

1030
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:41,250
the kids go and get the fuck away
from me. You caused that. And um,

1031
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:45,030
at one point I got a backup here. At
one point during the fight he was going,

1032
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,350
he's gone, honey. Stop it. Stop. Just
stop talking to the guy. And she wouldn't.

1033
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:51,770
So he, he pushed her
not hard, just pushing.

1034
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:54,840
Know you kind of go over a step
and a half and I swear to God,

1035
01:03:54,841 --> 01:03:58,050
she goes back to the house and who ends
up feeling like the, like the victim.

1036
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:02,760
She does. And she starts crying and I
was sitting at Santa, my girlfriend,

1037
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:04,950
you watch, you watch,
she caused this fight.

1038
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:08,960
This guy just rolled around on the ground,
this guy and for all you know, he did.

1039
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:12,390
The guy's like a black belt in Jujitsu
and he's going to fucking rip his ear off

1040
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:16,770
or stab them or God knows what he's
rolling around on this, you know,

1041
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:21,420
he actually gets punched in the fucking
face and now I sweat in the girls crying

1042
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:24,120
about it. The girl who caused it is
crying and I said to my girl, I said,

1043
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:28,770
you watch, he's going to
end up apologizing. And of
course he does. And she said,

1044
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:32,920
they're going, you traumatize
me. Would you pushed me a

1045
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:38,700
fucking, I just, you know,
I don't understand it.

1046
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:42,720
I guess I'll give the guy a pass because
he's young. I was just, you know,

1047
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,140
I was just waiting to, I traumatize you
really. You just caused the fucking fight.

1048
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:50,220
And not only that, as I'm fighting the
guy, the other girls check is coming in.

1049
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,070
Fucking hit me in the
head and you did nothing.

1050
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:59,430
You know what? I lost interest in that
story halfway through it. Um, all right,

1051
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:02,550
let's, let's plow through here. What the
fuck can we wrap this podcast up with?

1052
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:05,210
This is actually a really short one.
Um,

1053
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,440
and I always say I'm going to wrap this
up and then I never fucking do. Um,

1054
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,390
all right,
why don't we end with this segment?

1055
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:16,680
I'm sure I can do another 10 minutes on
this to give you at least 45 minutes for

1056
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:20,500
the week. Let's end with
this. This segment. Oh Jesus.

1057
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:24,700
Which is really taking
on a life of its own.

1058
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,210
I thought it was going to die,
but it is somehow risen.

1059
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:37,780
Um, okay. Here we go. And get ready for
bill is the dumbest person on the planet.

1060
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,130
All right.
Feel for what it's worth.

1061
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:42,910
I think you're fucking crazy and
irresponsible explanation. Point.

1062
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:48,070
I can never say that. X, x skull
exclaim exclamation. There we go.

1063
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,240
Exclamation point.

1064
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,730
I just wanna let you know that there was
words that you kinda know how to say,

1065
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:54,990
but you just sort of fly through them.
[inaudible] um,

1066
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:59,500
what kind of person talks about God
like that? And I love this shit.

1067
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:04,090
This is what they all do. You should.
And I believe deep down inside, you are,

1068
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,070
be ashamed of yourself.
Dude.

1069
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:10,990
This is what I love about these fucking
maniacs is they're so wrapped up into

1070
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:14,170
what they believe that they listen to,

1071
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:18,970
how much this person just keeps fucking
including other invisible people,

1072
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:23,170
and then superimposing what he believes
in to what you know. He thinks.

1073
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:24,250
I truly believe,

1074
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:29,310
because he's so wrapped up in his own
fucking world that he can't possibly even

1075
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:34,270
fathom that somebody has a difference
of opinion on this subject. So he goes,

1076
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:39,010
uh, you should, and I believe deep down
inside you are, be ashamed of yourself.

1077
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:42,100
Dude.
Are Your Mom and dad still alive?

1078
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,660
What exactly does that
have to do with any,

1079
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,880
your shtick with respect to God
is hurtful, offensive, offensive,

1080
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:53,290
and despicable. Um, three things.
It always has to be three things.

1081
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,560
It can't be hurtful and despicable
or offensive and hurtful.

1082
01:06:56,561 --> 01:06:59,680
It has to be hurtful,
offensive, and despicable.

1083
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,860
Just like comedy has to come in threes.
Um,

1084
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:07,770
how difficult it must be to spew
hatred and vulgarities for shock value.

1085
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:11,080
Laughs, no talent in that, my friend.

1086
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:16,000
That's the classic place that
people go. Um, whenever you,

1087
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:16,834
whenever you,

1088
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:21,730
this is the classic guy where everything
is funny until it comes around to the

1089
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:26,230
subject that they take seriously
100% and no one can even joke it,

1090
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,780
joke about it or even
question it on any level.

1091
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:32,710
And then they always say that you're
just doing it for shock because they find

1092
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:37,450
it shocking. It's like really my views
on women, women haven't been, you know,

1093
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,710
that didn't offend you. All the shit that
I've said over the two fucking years,

1094
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,720
none of that is offended you and now
all of a sudden this does anyway,

1095
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:46,900
so he goes,
enjoy your success,

1096
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:52,090
air quotes and all the money you are
making on the backs of hard working decent

1097
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:56,860
people that understand what it means to
follow the rules and be the best they

1098
01:07:56,861 --> 01:08:00,310
can be without putting
other people and god down.

1099
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,780
The rest of us are watching
and we are not laughing.

1100
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,080
Dude, how many people are
in your bedroom as your,

1101
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:14,560
do you ever group podcast listening
party every week? All right,

1102
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:15,440
let's get back to that.
Oh,

1103
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:19,670
evidently I am making money on the
backs of hard working decent people.

1104
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,460
So let me get this straight
because I'm standing on a stage.

1105
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:24,560
Evidently what I'm doing is not hard work.

1106
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:28,670
And if people are sitting in the audience
automatically, they're all decent,

1107
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,730
hardworking people.
And not only that,

1108
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:33,890
I'm making money on the backs of them,

1109
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:38,891
really do I have some sort
of comedy sweatshop like
comedy factory was sweatshop

1110
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:43,790
Labor. What I do is actually
takes advantage of no one.

1111
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,640
I stand on a stage and I,

1112
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:51,320
I tell jokes and if you like what I say
you, you sit and listen and if you don't,

1113
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:56,270
you'll walk out right
where, where you know,

1114
01:08:56,271 --> 01:08:58,010
and I love how just because
you were in the crowd,

1115
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:00,120
that means you're a decent human being.
Do you know them?

1116
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,680
The amount of fucking freaks
and scumbags that come up to me,

1117
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:08,060
this is what I found at a comedy show
for the most part, decent people.

1118
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:11,720
They leave after the show that I didn't
want to bug them and then they walk out

1119
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:16,290
and then mania x come
up to me. You know, let,

1120
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:19,760
let's do some Jaeger and they fucking
spitting in your face and shit. You know,

1121
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:24,560
believe me. All right. But I know I
made fun of God. So now, uh, you know,

1122
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:27,890
now all of a sudden I'm now all of this.
You want to talk about people making,

1123
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,290
making money off of decent,
hardworking people.

1124
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:34,280
Take a look at fucking organized religion.
All right, those guys don't make,

1125
01:09:34,281 --> 01:09:37,160
those guys are live in pretty good.
Scaring the fucking shit out of you.

1126
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:39,290
Every God damn week.
All right.

1127
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:43,040
And I'm entitled to an opinion and I
never was cramming my opinion down your

1128
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,230
throat.
I wasn't okay.

1129
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:49,040
You believe in what you believe
in and I 100% respect that,

1130
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:52,430
but I have the right to question it.
You know,

1131
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:56,540
and you shouldn't find it
shocking that I questioned it.

1132
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:00,260
You should do and shouldn't you just
be what Jesus would do when Jesus just

1133
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:02,780
start praying for me. Anyways, let's,

1134
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,780
let's continue this just in case you're
interested. I was raised Catholic,

1135
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:09,830
married and raised my children Catholic
and definitely have my doubts about the

1136
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:12,800
whole organized religion thing.
Great. So you agree with me?

1137
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,570
Not even sure that I believe in God. Once
again, there's another point that we,

1138
01:10:17,571 --> 01:10:18,404
that we agree on.

1139
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:22,550
I lost my father three years ago and never
would have uttered these words in his

1140
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,320
presence.
Neither would I.

1141
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:29,270
What am I voice go up
so they know what dude,

1142
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:33,710
I did it on a podcast. All right,
I'm sorry your father passed away,

1143
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,140
but you know that has
nothing to do with me.

1144
01:10:36,141 --> 01:10:37,340
Do you understand what you're doing here?

1145
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:40,190
Now all of a sudden you're making it
seem like I'm walking in with my Mr

1146
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:45,160
microphone into the intensive care
saying there's no god, you know,

1147
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:49,130
whispering into somebody's ear in a coma.
He just go into the ground.

1148
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,260
We're all like, dear, I'm not doing that.

1149
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,620
I'm doing a podcast and I'm
fucking around. All right.

1150
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:57,380
If you want to take it seriously,
that's your problem. Okay.

1151
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:01,340
And if you want to bring up your father
passing away as some way to try to guilt

1152
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:06,050
me in to feeling like, I mean, you know
what I'm saying? In a hateful, hurtful,

1153
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:09,200
fucking way, dude, those are all your
issues. They have nothing to do with me.

1154
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,793
All right.

1155
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,680
Then he goes on to say that
his dad believed that there
was something out there

1156
01:11:14,681 --> 01:11:16,570
responsible for all the
beauty in the world,

1157
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:21,070
in our world and for our lives as human
beings. I don't even disagree with that.

1158
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,990
I just know human beings have no idea
what it is until they fucking die,

1159
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:29,140
so I'm not going to sit there and listen
to another human being who tries to

1160
01:11:29,141 --> 01:11:33,580
scare the shit out of me and who was
living in a fucking palace telling me that

1161
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,590
if I become rich,
I'm not going to heaven.

1162
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:39,520
I'm not out in my mind to think
that that reeks of a fucking scam.

1163
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:43,840
The same way late at night when they
have those fucking gold coins that

1164
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:48,550
evidently are with 50 bucks and they're
selling them for 1999 that that doesn't

1165
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:52,690
reek of a scam. Somebody actually
sent me a a, an email. Of course,

1166
01:11:52,691 --> 01:11:55,300
I didn't save it.
Evidently it's sprayed with like a dollar,

1167
01:11:55,301 --> 01:11:59,440
something worth the gold. Okay,
so they're making, what is that?

1168
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:04,270
A 2000% profit?
All right.

1169
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:05,591
Believe it or not,

1170
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:10,050
just because you're walking around talking
about religion and the afterlife and

1171
01:12:10,051 --> 01:12:13,060
and doing unto others,
and you're talking this great game,

1172
01:12:13,061 --> 01:12:16,120
it doesn't mean that you
can't be full of shit.

1173
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,323
All right?

1174
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:22,960
Okay. And I'm not saying that I'm right
about what I feel, but this is just it.

1175
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:27,030
It reeks of, of, of, of a scam.

1176
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:32,040
I really believe that there is some sort
of thing out there and I wouldn't be

1177
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,650
surprised if there is
something after this.

1178
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,070
I wouldn't be surprised if you just go
into the ground and you decay and you

1179
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:39,720
give life to the next fucking thing.

1180
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:44,690
I wouldn't be surprised if earth is
punishment for something that I did in,

1181
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,350
in a different solar system.

1182
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:50,400
That's another thing about religion and
forget about the dinosaurs is it doesn't

1183
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:53,610
even bring up space.
Okay?

1184
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:57,540
Let's say the rest is all
powerful big being. Okay. Okay.

1185
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,220
And I'm just trying to
question this right now.

1186
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,730
So I'm not trying to be shocking or I'm
just questioning is let's say there is

1187
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,050
this all powerful being being that
created the everything that there is.

1188
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,230
Okay.
The entire solar system.

1189
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:16,020
Why would you do all of that and just put
people on this one planet that's like,

1190
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:20,220
you created an, an uh, uh,
you built this house that has

1191
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:26,040
an infinity basically amount of rooms,

1192
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:29,760
bedrooms, and you just put everybody,
you're only using one room in the house.

1193
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:33,000
It doesn't make any
fucking sense whatsoever.

1194
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,873
And

1195
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,100
one thing about Scientology for as
much shit as people give Scientology,

1196
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:45,140
at least it has the brains to
incorporate outer space. You know,

1197
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:49,760
I don't know if that's a really good
point, if that's really fucking stupid,

1198
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:54,650
but you know, I don't fucking
know. So anyways, yeah, dude,

1199
01:13:54,651 --> 01:13:57,680
I wasn't trying to offend you
or anything that you fucking,

1200
01:13:57,681 --> 01:14:01,220
I was just trying to be funny and I'm
just fucking around and if you want to

1201
01:14:01,221 --> 01:14:05,870
take this shit seriously, that, that
is totally your fucking choice. Um,

1202
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,010
you know, that's it. All right. I'm
fucking done with that. All right,

1203
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:13,490
let's move on to the next person. Me, um,

1204
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,300
no. What the fuck? Where the fuck is it?

1205
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:23,800
Jesus Christ. I think I only buy like
put one of my thought. I had another one.

1206
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,450
I'm really disorganized this week.

1207
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,570
That's because you don't have Jesus in
your life. You don't want to have Jason,

1208
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,760
another guy said, I love how you
pick on a, on a, on a, on a, uh, uh,

1209
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:35,020
a punching bag of religion,
basically saying like,

1210
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:36,760
it's very easy to make fun of Christians,

1211
01:14:36,761 --> 01:14:41,710
but I don't dare make fun of Muslims
because if you make fun of them, Oh Shit,

1212
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:42,910
look what's going to happen.
You know?

1213
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:46,180
And which I thought was fucking hilarious
because the person was sitting there

1214
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,570
talking about how insensitive I am and
that it basically, in a round about way,

1215
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:53,820
we're alluding to the fact that people
who are Muslim means that you're a,

1216
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,950
you're a fucking, uh, uh, you
know, you're going to blow up.

1217
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,910
Like they're all going to blow up
planes and that type of shit. You know,

1218
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,280
I went to a wedding one time,
this girl was Pakistanian.

1219
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:07,150
They actually addressed that, that what
they fucking hate it was at all, you know,

1220
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:10,210
Christians thought that all of them just
wanted to walk around blowing up shit.

1221
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,990
And, uh, and I also,

1222
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:15,460
it was funny that this guy's fucking
sitting there suggesting that people just

1223
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:18,850
because they're Christian, that they're
peaceful. When do you know, what is it?

1224
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:23,020
Once every 18 months, some Jesus freaks
fucking kills an abortion doctor.

1225
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:27,920
That's pretty much par for the course,
isn't it? Um, no, and it's, it,

1226
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,670
it's not safe to make fun of Jesus freaks.
It really isn't.

1227
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,140
It really fucking isn't.

1228
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:37,141
And I think Bill Maher is out of his
fucking mind to say what he says and like,

1229
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:41,860
or actually has balls the size of the
Grand Canyon to say what the fuck he says,

1230
01:15:41,861 --> 01:15:46,150
and then just walk out in Wade
into those people and just like,

1231
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:48,340
I would never do that shit anyways.

1232
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,630
And I got to admit the level with which
that people take this shit seriously.

1233
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:56,740
It actually kinda creeps me out to kick
to continue talking about this shit. So,

1234
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:59,770
uh, this might be the last fucking week
of it because I've definitely made my

1235
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:00,640
fucking points.

1236
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,670
And at this point we're just going to go
around in circles and I'm just going to

1237
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:08,470
piss people off. So, uh, let's
move on to this last guy.

1238
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,800
What? She brought up
some great points. Um,

1239
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,580
all right, set a bunch of Nice
stuff. And then he said, all right,

1240
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:18,030
enough with the Dick Sucking.
I was going to trick,

1241
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,520
I was going to criticize religion,
but to describe those belief is,

1242
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:26,350
is to mock them there. And you know
what dude? That's what I learned. Um,

1243
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:28,900
yeah,
if you describe them,

1244
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:31,630
then you start making fun of
them and then everybody gets mad.

1245
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,770
Or as you're saying, they're just so
ridiculous. She just have to, you know.

1246
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,890
Anyways, let's fly ahead
here. Yeah. He said,

1247
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:42,840
you mentioned needing a code in the
absence of religion to live by. Um,

1248
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:47,290
I'm not sure how much, um, of the,
I don't read thing as a Shtick,

1249
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:51,700
but I recommend an excellent text
used in an intro to Undergrad,

1250
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,760
an Undergrad ethics course called the
elements of moral philosophy by James.

1251
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:00,250
I don't know if that's rock
hills or Rachael's, um,

1252
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,920
everybody goes on and on about Jesus.

1253
01:17:02,921 --> 01:17:06,340
But Socrates who define morality
is how we ought to live.

1254
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:10,070
Let a compelling life, as you
probably know. Actually, I don't,

1255
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,550
I just know him as a party reference.
Um,

1256
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,070
what do you fucking Socrates,
you know,

1257
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,130
that's one of those references that
even morons can use and get away with.

1258
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:23,060
And I'm sad to say I'm one
of those people. Um, he said,
I didn't know this shit.

1259
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:26,870
He was found guilty of corrupting
the youth. He thought Zeus,

1260
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:30,590
Venus areas, et Cetera,
smacked of bullshit.

1261
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:35,510
All right? Think about that, right?
They're corrupting the youth.

1262
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:39,440
Now every why Christians, Muslims and
everybody today would say that. Yeah,

1263
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:43,670
that is bullshit. That those people do
not exist. Cause now we've evolved to,

1264
01:17:43,671 --> 01:17:47,150
there's only one God.
There's only one bank.

1265
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,040
There's one world power. Um, and
let's see. And as punishment,

1266
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:56,510
he was forced to take his own
life by drinking hemlock poison.

1267
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:01,610
Once again, another death because
of organized religion. You know,

1268
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:04,520
these Jesus freaks, these, these
people who are into fucking,

1269
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,980
I even got one of the reason
why I don't make fun of, uh,

1270
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,920
the Muslim religion is really because
I don't know anything about it.

1271
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:12,530
And the reason why I make fun of
Christianity is because that's what I was

1272
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:15,890
brought up. And those are
the stories that, that I,

1273
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:20,780
that I hear and all I know about
Muslims is basically, uh, you know,

1274
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:23,480
the couple of wars with Iraq.
So I basically don't know shit.

1275
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,060
I just think what you,
you wrap your,

1276
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:29,210
wrap your women up and bounty paper
towels and then cut their clits off.

1277
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,520
And am I wrong?
Am I wrong on that one?

1278
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:35,930
If they're not allowed to show
their fucking thongs because, uh,

1279
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:39,350
you're going to get an erection and
because you were that bed sheet,

1280
01:18:39,351 --> 01:18:41,480
everybody's going to fucking see it. I
don't, I don't really think about it,

1281
01:18:41,481 --> 01:18:44,180
but I would definitely make fun of it if
I knew something about it, but I don't.

1282
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:44,780
All right.

1283
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:47,690
And I reserve the right to make fun of
the fucker religion that I was brought up.

1284
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:49,550
And, um, so anyways,

1285
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:53,210
he says Socrates was a humble man,

1286
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:57,920
famously announcing all I
know is my ignorance. Um,

1287
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:01,730
he sought I the one that I love people
who would take that at face value. So he,

1288
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:04,820
he said he was your fucking moron.
Right there, right there. You know,

1289
01:19:04,821 --> 01:19:08,720
Jesus is the solution. Um, he
sought answers to questions,

1290
01:19:08,721 --> 01:19:12,320
whereas religion prohibits
questioning answers.

1291
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,440
I'll fucking brilliant.
This guy is really smart.

1292
01:19:15,441 --> 01:19:18,620
You should do a podcast instead of
me. I'm a fucking idiot. Listened to,

1293
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,600
he sought answers to questions,

1294
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:24,410
whereas religion prohibits
questioning answers.

1295
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,490
And if anything fucking proves that
it's the 50 emails I got this week. Ah,

1296
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,490
I like how I'm actually asking like,

1297
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:35,420
I'm questioning religion on any sort of
intelligent level. Um, I think actually,

1298
01:19:35,421 --> 01:19:38,070
I think I am just because I say cut
and fuck doesn't mean I'm not, uh,

1299
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:42,710
bringing up some good questions.
All right. Let's finish
this for, uh, for Socrates.

1300
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:46,400
The unexamined life is not worth living.
Um,

1301
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,910
his sentiments on marriage and
nagging women are remarkably,

1302
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:53,990
remarkably similar to your own,
so underrated Socrates,

1303
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,560
overrated. Jesus. Uh,

1304
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,630
yeah. And that's, you know,
that's, that is the one thing,

1305
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:06,680
and I'm not being a dick here,
that I don't understand about people who,

1306
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:08,130
like I respect

1307
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:12,170
people who you know,
are raised in a religion or,

1308
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:16,290
or find a religion that speaks to them
and then they decide to commit their

1309
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,900
lives to what, and what I
don't understand is, you know,

1310
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:23,460
and it brings you this piece,
right? Am I wrong there? All right,

1311
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:28,080
so it brings you this piece,
but then if anybody questions

1312
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:34,490
that belief that you have,
how quickly it turns violent,

1313
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:41,440
like the amount of people who died
because they question these a holy people.

1314
01:20:42,891 --> 01:20:43,724
It is,

1315
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:49,990
you don't find that fucking like
hilarious and ridiculous on any level

1316
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,150
like this sitting there calling
the other person the devil,

1317
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:58,830
because they're questioning their beliefs
and they're saying that that other

1318
01:20:58,831 --> 01:21:02,790
person is going to hell and then they
turn around and kill the person because

1319
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:06,960
they don't believe in the holy pure way
that they live their life. I mean, I just,

1320
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:08,340
I can't get behind that.

1321
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:13,320
I can't get behind that the same way.
Is that the same way?

1322
01:21:13,321 --> 01:21:14,880
It's just because you're a red sox fan,

1323
01:21:14,881 --> 01:21:18,360
you can't recognize the talent of
Derek Jeter. And I gotta be like,

1324
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:22,620
do full cubies who fig now he's the shit

1325
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:30,060
out of fucking now. Why, why do I
continue with this shit? Um, anyways,

1326
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:31,950
so that's the podcast for the week.
Uh,

1327
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:35,940
this person actually goes on to
recommend a movie. Um, he says,

1328
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:39,480
I heard you mentioned the departed a
few times. Um, if you haven't already,

1329
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:44,750
you might want to check out state of
grace and overlook mobster flit from 1990

1330
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:48,430
that was unfortunately released
around the same time as good fellows,

1331
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:53,490
Goodfellas and Miller's crossing. It
has Sean Penn, Ed Harris, Burgess,

1332
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:57,330
Meredith, Robin white topless. All
right. That made it a little creepy.

1333
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:01,320
And Gary Oldman,
who gives an Oscar caliber performance.

1334
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:05,550
All right. Yeah, if you guys haven't
seen state of grace, I've seen that. Uh,

1335
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:09,960
I'm actually due to watch that
again. Um, Gary Oldman is,

1336
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:15,950
you know what if you just
saw him play commissioner,
uh, Gordon in Batman and the,

1337
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:20,670
the, the reserve performance that he did
and then you see him and stayed at grey,

1338
01:22:20,671 --> 01:22:21,900
she'll realize why that guy,

1339
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:26,901
he's even though people recognize
him as an incredible actor,

1340
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:30,060
he still, I think one of the most
underrated actors of all time.

1341
01:22:30,061 --> 01:22:31,230
He's fucking unbelievable.

1342
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:36,510
And you have to see the
face Ed Harris makes,

1343
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,580
um, without ruining the
movie. He gets betrayed.

1344
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,180
And when he realizes that
he's betrayed the fucking,

1345
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:49,410
the way he twists up his face,
ed Harris is another one. Dude,

1346
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:53,190
that movie is like,
um,

1347
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:57,720
the guys that are in that movie
for me are the modern day.

1348
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:00,510
Like, uh, I mean, again,

1349
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:03,630
this is a big statement because
you can never replace those guys,

1350
01:23:03,631 --> 01:23:06,200
but it was my generation's

1351
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,210
Bronson, Lee Marvin, you
know, just the guy guy guys,

1352
01:23:11,211 --> 01:23:14,870
guys like you just wanted to be those
guys and they always had guns and they

1353
01:23:14,871 --> 01:23:19,520
never took any shit. It's just, there's
just fucking, you know, Gary Oldman, uh,

1354
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,640
and uh, um, ed Harris,

1355
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,500
who else do I put in that it's
a very short fucking list.

1356
01:23:27,501 --> 01:23:30,050
It's very hard the way.
Um,

1357
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:31,400
okay.

1358
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:36,320
Nowadays in movies I think to be the guy,
you know, that, that classic, you know,

1359
01:23:36,321 --> 01:23:38,540
women want to get with them
and guys want to be him.

1360
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,210
And I think a lot of it is because,

1361
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:43,260
okay,

1362
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,560
back in the day, like those
being in shape, you just,

1363
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:49,920
you were just in sort of regular shape
and then it was the way you carried

1364
01:23:49,921 --> 01:23:54,600
yourself. Kind of like what's his
face in a Ben Kingsley and sexy beast.

1365
01:23:54,601 --> 01:23:57,090
Do you guys ever seen that movie?
I know I brought it up a bunch of times,

1366
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,690
but I remember he was in an inside the
actor's studio one time and they asked

1367
01:24:00,691 --> 01:24:04,010
him if he worked out before he played,
uh,

1368
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:08,880
before we played that
character. And um, he said no,

1369
01:24:08,881 --> 01:24:10,260
it was all the way I held my body.

1370
01:24:10,261 --> 01:24:13,920
He just stood more like a wrecked and
he had like perfect posture and he just

1371
01:24:13,921 --> 01:24:15,780
looked like this tough as nails guy.

1372
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,050
Even though it was Ben Kingsley and I
think there was something about those

1373
01:24:19,051 --> 01:24:22,380
older guys like Steve Mcqueen and
those guys that just the way they held

1374
01:24:22,381 --> 01:24:25,710
themselves because you look at it
and they all like Yule Brenner.

1375
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,950
I mean all those guys,
they were like 140 pounds,

1376
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:32,550
but somehow you just look at him like,
dude, I wouldn't fuck with those guys.

1377
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,460
And then like all the star to
many of the stars nowadays,

1378
01:24:35,461 --> 01:24:38,940
they've got like highlights in their hair
and they got abs and they got 'em all

1379
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:43,230
oiled up and shit. You look
in at my guys a fag, you know?

1380
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,500
Yeah.

1381
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,330
I don't know. Did Stars
back in the day? Did they?

1382
01:24:47,331 --> 01:24:51,590
Did they fucking shaved the chest
hair and landscape? Their eyebrows?

1383
01:24:51,591 --> 01:24:55,790
I think there's just something about
it, man. I Dunno. I don't fucking know.

1384
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:58,010
Anyways, that's the podcast
for this week. And once again,

1385
01:24:58,011 --> 01:25:00,020
I'm not disrespecting your religions.
Okay?

1386
01:25:00,021 --> 01:25:04,910
But this is my podcast and when I bring
shit up, I fucking go off on it and I,

1387
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,730
and I definitely go over the top.

1388
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:08,850
Okay.

1389
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:13,850
Saying that somebody was pet playing
the upright bass with Jesus's Juggler is

1390
01:25:14,431 --> 01:25:16,500
fucking hilarious because
it's over the top.

1391
01:25:16,501 --> 01:25:19,470
And I believe the God in
my world thinks it's funny.

1392
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,610
He's God. Why would he be intimidated?
I, there's another thing too.

1393
01:25:23,611 --> 01:25:27,540
I don't understand why God
would make all this stuff. Okay.

1394
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:30,930
And then just be so doe angry
all the time. Jesus Christ here.

1395
01:25:30,931 --> 01:25:35,460
I gone back in it again. I got a lot of
questions. Fuck you. It's my podcast.

1396
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,560
I know.
That's why I don't understand.

1397
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:40,960
Okay.

1398
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,000
You know, I, I is it, it's
more like, you know, when you,

1399
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:45,880
when you build a bookshelf and yet you
just standing back a Myra and your work

1400
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:48,850
and then it falls down on the floor and
you're like God damn fucking piece of

1401
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:52,600
Shit and you start blaming the
bookshelf even though you made it,

1402
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:55,690
you're the one that put it up there,
you know?

1403
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:57,150
Yeah.

1404
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,790
I guess technically.
Dot. God didn't make a,

1405
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:05,090
he didn't make titty bars. Guess
those are man made. But uh, you know,

1406
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:07,050
the broads in Zynnyme a man or are

1407
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:08,680
okay.

1408
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:12,100
Wow. I'm really fucking, I was just going
to say made in his image. Isn't that,

1409
01:26:12,101 --> 01:26:17,020
isn't that what you guys say?
They found a dabble. Dabble.

1410
01:26:17,021 --> 01:26:20,680
They got the devil in him.
Um, all right. What have,

1411
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:22,990
all I'm saying is because it really
gets serious to sweet people.

1412
01:26:22,991 --> 01:26:25,240
People really get fucking, they took
it a little too seriously. All right,

1413
01:26:25,241 --> 01:26:29,290
so back the fuck off. Stop taking it
so God damn seriously. And you know,

1414
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:33,190
why don't you actually practice what your
preacher preaches and why don't you go

1415
01:26:33,191 --> 01:26:37,690
pray for me? Why don't you do that instead
of coming on here telling me, you know,

1416
01:26:37,691 --> 01:26:41,140
you've given me your wrath.
Isn't that one of the seven deadly sins?

1417
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:42,640
You fucking maniacs.

1418
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:43,990
Okay.

1419
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:47,680
You just as fucked up as I am and you
don't know shit either. All right.

1420
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:53,620
All right. I'm sorry. God
bless all of you. Okay.

1421
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:57,490
I hope you find what works for you
and a seriously, if I'm bugging you,

1422
01:26:57,491 --> 01:27:00,160
don't listen to the podcast.
God knows I'm not making any money off it.

1423
01:27:00,161 --> 01:27:03,640
I don't give a fuck. Ah, that's it.
You guys all have a great weekend. A,

1424
01:27:03,641 --> 01:27:05,320
I tell you where I was
going to be this week,

1425
01:27:05,321 --> 01:27:10,240
but I'm worried some Jesus freak is going
to show up. So, uh, that's it. That's it.

1426
01:27:10,241 --> 01:27:12,640
Have a great week and a,
I'll talk to you next month.

1427
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:13,643
Hopefully

1428
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,273
down

1429
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:57,203
bells.

1430
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:08,490
Right?
Smooth.

1431
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:52,163
It was Smith.

1432
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
[inaudible].
