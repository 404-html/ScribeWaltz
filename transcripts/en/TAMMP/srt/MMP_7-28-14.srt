1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,400
Hey, what's going on? It's
built burn. It's the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:10,290
July 28th,
2014 what's going on?

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,090
Hi,
how's it going?

4
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:19,091
I just got back from Oriol Canada
doing the wonderful a Montreal comedy

5
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:24,640
festival. I had an awesome time up
there. I hosted one of their Gallus,

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,030
you know, which is a big deal. And uh,

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,580
you know,
I'm not big on hosting,

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,430
I'm not big on hosting cause I hit my
bitch are long and it's sort of like,

9
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:38,690
I don't really know how to write a joke.

10
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:42,590
So there's a lot of cursing and making
faces and I built momentum off of that,

11
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,870
so I just keep fucking roll in with that.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,240
And before people realize that
they've listened to an hour,

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,800
my shit and I get out of there,
but if I host,

14
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:56,420
I got to keep coming back out and I got
to get that energy going again. And um,

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,700
you know, it's fucking exhausting.
So, uh, to be honest with you,

16
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:05,580
I didn't want to do it, you know, see
probably like we'll build and why the,

17
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:08,270
why the fuck did you say? Yeah,
I'll do it. I'll tell you why.

18
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,190
Because I bought the money pit house.
That's why

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,850
I am out there whoring myself.
I'm gonna tell you right now,

20
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,040
cause I was going to take
the whole fucking summer off.

21
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,790
I was going to take the rest of July and
August off cause I toward like fucking

22
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:30,791
18 months straight at a all over this
great global fucking marble and I was just

23
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:37,340
like, look, I'm taking two months
off, bounce, bounce, bounce.

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,600
Right. I was going to have a great fucking
time. I'm bringing it barely back. Yeah.

25
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,810
And I was just going to
fucking chill out and grill.

26
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,810
I was going to sit on
my fucking back porch.

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,210
I was going to stare off into the fucking
half a yard that I have out here in

28
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:55,880
La, which is actually
considered a decent yard.

29
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,540
Do you know you can't throw a Frisbee in
my backyard without hitting something?

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,140
I mean it right as it leaves your hand.
It probably,

31
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,000
if I go the long way,

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,020
I decide I could maybe float
for just under three seconds.

33
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,360
It's not really a yard. I have
an area. All right, whatever. Um,

34
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,800
I live in a metropolis, so anyways, um,

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,400
yeah, so I was going to take the
whole summer off and you know,

36
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:28,370
as these guys finished this one
thing that they were going to do,

37
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:32,660
the area that got damaged
by the fucking water, and

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,180
this is what I learned when your house
is fucking like a hundred years old,

39
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,950
90 years old,
whatever this thing is,

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,880
it's just you have 90 fucking years.
Well,

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,240
let's say the first 10 years,
everything's going pretty smoothly.

42
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,420
About from about 80 years
in all the way back,

43
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:55,421
80 all the way up to right now you just
have one do it yourself fucking job.

44
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:01,080
Hey, I've got a guy, I got a,
Hey, I'll do it for nothing, man.

45
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,280
It's a 1930. Say there's a
d, there's no code. Nothing.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,880
Okay.

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,520
Now when I tell you nothing,
I mean nothing,

48
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,080
nothing downstairs in
my house was up to code.

49
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,990
Nothing. I know what you guys
are thinking. Like, well wait,

50
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,590
didn't you get somebody doing spec
the house when you bought it? Yeah,

51
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:25,090
but they can't see into the fucking walls.

52
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,790
Okay?

53
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,090
You have no idea what's in you all,
they can just look at it.

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,480
You know they're looking for fucking sweat
marks on the walls smelling for water

55
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:38,970
damage check and the gas
lines. They can do that. Right.

56
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,360
But other than that,
you're pretty much on your own.

57
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,250
And I'll tell you all you guys
fucking listen to right now.

58
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,680
If you laugh and you have no idea
what the fuck's in your walls,

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,140
you have no idea what some Douche bag did
20 years ago cause he bought the time,

60
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:55,320
life books,
those do it yourself fucking things.

61
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,000
And you have no idea what that
can't rewired in your wall.

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,370
Okay.

63
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,380
Under your floorboards.
I mean, so basically

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,970
downstairs is laid open at this point,
like at seven open heart surgery. Okay.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,370
And every time they think they got to
the last thing, there's another thing,

66
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,240
I know what you're thinking.

67
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:22,260
Built these guys downstairs to taking you
for a ride. Oh yeah, I'm sure they are.

68
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,020
But what that finding is fucking
undeniable. Do you know we,

69
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,150
they got to this wall the other
day and of course, you know,

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,320
it's got this shit fucking rotted out,
crap in front of it. They get rid of that.

71
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:35,340
We get underneath that,

72
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,240
we get behind that and at the
base board it's just dry rot.

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,350
The guys barely touching it and it's
not like it's, it's breaking off.

74
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,610
It's turning into powder.

75
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,470
Like fucking long.

76
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:53,460
Chaney junior put this board in when
he was a struggling fucking actor.

77
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:58,320
That's how old this goddamn houses
and showed. They're like, yeah,

78
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:02,490
we've got to rebuild this wall. Costs
like four or 500 bucks am I God ride,

79
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:07,250
just fucking do it. Right. So
they take down the drywall,

80
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,320
plastic,
whatever the fuck it is and you know,

81
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,840
later on that date, right, I'm, I'm
running around doing, I'm around,

82
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:19,310
I'm doing and the contractor calls me up
and he's actually laughing. He's like,

83
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:23,810
Bill, you eat it. You got to
come over and see and see this.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,670
And I'm taking in my fucking head like,
dude,

85
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:27,890
this isn't whatever you laughing about.
This isn't funny.

86
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,380
And I got over there and
basically behind the wall

87
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,610
is like this dirt, right? They have
like a, you know, this crawl space area.

88
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,730
And what they had behind the wall
is somebody had taken like this,

89
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:45,570
see through like plastic tarp,
and that was the,

90
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,930
that was the barrier between the dirt
and the wall was this plastic fucking

91
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:54,220
thing. And the guy was laugh
and go, Ha, you got to tell you,

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,250
I've never seen anything like this,
which he probably has.

93
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,390
But, uh, you know, I
know I'm just a comedian,

94
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,690
but I know that that's not the way you're
supposed to do something like that.

95
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:09,560
But the good thing is that
is the final wall downstairs.

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,750
And of course it couldn't have been,
it couldn't be built. Right, right. So

97
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,391
in other words,

98
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:22,070
I want to be doing some shows on the odd
ball toward this later on this summer.

99
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,250
Ah, fuck. I swear to God,
and this is the thing too.

100
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,220
I could have been a cunt. I could have
been like, dude, I don't give a shit.

101
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,300
Just put a fucking wall in front of
it and fuck the next guy. But, uh,

102
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,190
that's not the way I'm wired or
what are you a hero now, Bill?

103
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,360
Now I was raised properly fixed the
thing, right. Just fix the fucking thing,

104
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:41,810
right.

105
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,230
Cause I'm not going to have you put a
beautiful brand new wall in there with

106
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:49,100
that fucking a sandwich bag
barrier behind it. And then what?

107
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,180
I Dunno what happens seem to be working
all right before they cut open the wall.

108
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,700
I'm sorry. I'm fucking,
I, I've, I've had it.

109
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,280
I've had it with the goddamn downstairs.
Um, so that's what's going on.

110
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,920
So if you hear drilling and you'd be here,
all kinds of shit going on.

111
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:11,040
That's the fucking people
downstairs. And uh, we're hoping,

112
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,340
we're hoping that they're
going to be done. You know,

113
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,860
initially it was end of June,
beginning of July. Now, uh,

114
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,140
I don't even ask anymore.
Last I heard was end of August,

115
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,810
early September and come on

116
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,870
and I'm hoping by Thanksgiving I can
actually walk down there and my fucking

117
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:34,490
slip us, you know, we won't
have any money for a Turkey.

118
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,540
I'm going to shoot a fucking pigeon and
I'm going to deep fry it and I'll do it

119
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,374
the wrong way.

120
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,400
I won't take into consideration the
space that the pigeon is going to take up

121
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,660
and a the grease, we'll go over and I'll
like the whole fucking thing on fire.

122
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:53,060
We'll start over again.
Oh God.

123
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,990
Oh Jesus. This is why I
actually like going on the road.

124
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:00,110
I liked going on the road because I
don't have to listen to the sounds.

125
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,680
That's the sound of the money
flying out of your bank account.

126
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,490
How? Um, all right, so I had,
I had an unbelievable week, uh,

127
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:15,491
aside from I'm going up to Montreal,

128
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,940
Montreal comedy festival and seeing
a bunch of great comics. Um, guys,

129
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:23,900
I started with people who started before
I did and then a bunch of new faces

130
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:26,570
that I went down and checked out.
Um,

131
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,500
earlier this week I did a show out
here in la that I mentioned last week.

132
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:34,340
I was talking to Norton
Warner. I was gonna, it's gonna
play drums with his band.

133
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:38,410
They had this cool show, like best
goddamn comedy. Show us something, uh,

134
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,920
hosted by Josh Adam Meyers.
Um,

135
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,780
and uh, we basically, uh,

136
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,300
hang on a second. What the fuck is
this now? Getting this fucking text?

137
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,540
Come on. It's just, you know what,
this is one of these days, like,

138
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,403
I should just,

139
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,460
I have to get into the right mindset
because it's all going to just

140
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,310
fuck all right. Anyways, plowing ahead.
Josh. Adam Meyers hosts his show.

141
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:11,890
He's got a band and basically, and I
was a bunch of comics that play guitar.

142
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,550
Are they saying are they play drums or
whatever and you basically, you go up,

143
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,380
you do standup,
you do whatever you want,

144
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,650
but you can kind of make it music
based and then in the end you a,

145
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:24,210
you interact with the band however
you wanted to do it. So, uh, you know,

146
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:26,700
I was like, all right, I'll play
drums, will play a Zeppelin song.

147
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:30,990
And I was kinda thinking like I,
if I just go back there,

148
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,610
I can't remember if I
told this story last week.

149
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:34,670
I know I told you guys that I was
going to do it, but basically I'll,

150
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:38,220
I'll fly through it here. I
basically was thinking, all right,

151
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,000
well if I just go back and play drums
and I do a decent job that will be

152
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:45,840
interesting for like 30 seconds and
then people will have to sit through the

153
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:48,570
rest of the song. So, um,

154
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,660
like a year ago I was going to
dress up like John Bonam for a,

155
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,880
for Halloween and I, they,
I ordered the tee shirt,

156
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,250
a remake of the tee shirt that he wore

157
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,810
on now that that concert
film song remains the same.

158
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,570
And I had the blue Adidas dragons.

159
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,300
Turns out he was wearing a four
stripe Adita when he was in Seattle.

160
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,740
And then I had the white pants.

161
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,700
I went out and bought those and my wife
took me to a costume store and we got

162
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:19,200
the fucking wig and the, the led Zeppelin
one mustache that he had, you know,

163
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,190
I was like a big thing with [inaudible]
with like how long it took for his

164
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:27,930
mustache to connect into his beard because
his mustache wouldn't connect it to

165
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:32,130
the beard. And for the first, like three,
four albums, he had that beard that was,

166
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,130
that went like underneath his chin,
like a fucking Chin strap.

167
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:36,870
Like he had nothing up there on his face.

168
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,710
And you know what's sad is by the
time his mustache and beard connected,

169
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,720
it's like he died.
It was like his life's work was complete.

170
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,540
Um, so anyways, um, well I'll post some
pictures if you follow me on Twitter.

171
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,510
I already posted a few, but
I'll, I'll repost them for, uh,

172
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,580
for people who have lives and
are not on Twitter. But anyway,

173
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:02,580
so I went back there. I had
a great fucking time. We
screwed it up quite a bit.

174
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:07,230
We butchered it pretty good.
But um, but it was still
funny, man. It was a fun time.

175
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,280
And,
uh,

176
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,030
and for the longest time I was kind of
looking for a way that I could actually

177
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:16,080
play live drums and people would know
that I wasn't taking myself too seriously.

178
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,580
Um,

179
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,940
and going up and dressing up and looking
like an idiot was kind of the perfect

180
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,190
way to do it.
And it also Kinda gave me licensed slur.

181
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:26,370
I didn't have to feel self conscious that
people were looking at me cause I had

182
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:30,060
this whole fucking get up
on with the sunglasses. I
could kind of hide behind it.

183
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,060
It was actually pretty,
uh, it was pretty cool.

184
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:37,740
So I'm definitely going to do another one.
I'm trying to a,

185
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,380
I think I already know the song I'm going
to do when the drama that I'm going to

186
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:45,030
dress up like, and uh, I dunno,
it's going to be a great time.

187
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,340
It's gotta be a great time on the show.

188
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:49,230
We'll get big and then somebody's network
will come down and they'll turn it

189
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:52,860
into a TV show and then they'll ruin it
and they'll take all the fun out of it.

190
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,620
So I'll let you know when the next one is.
Uh,

191
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:59,740
so before people come in and try to
figure out how they're going to make money

192
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,330
off of it,
it's going to be a great time.

193
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,140
So I'll let you know when
the next one is and she,

194
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,510
you should definitely come down now
as we're on the beginning of the,

195
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:11,230
behind the music arc on
this idea. Uh, but anyways,

196
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,410
but thanks to everybody in the band and
Josh and everybody for having me come

197
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:18,790
down. I had a fucking awesome
time. So, and with that,

198
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:23,320
so that was my Monday. And
um, and then like I said, uh,

199
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,540
I went up,
what was it,

200
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,200
a Thursday I flew up to Montreal,

201
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:33,500
one of my favorite cities with, uh,
the team. I don't like the most,

202
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:37,450
the fucking Canadians. I don't mind
him. Whatever. Um, oh you know what,

203
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,680
PK sue band came down to one of the gals.
I thought he was coming down to my gal.

204
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:46,180
I was really excited to meet the guy cause
I wanted to ask him about that whole,

205
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,750
uh, cause it really seemed when, you know,

206
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,790
Sean squirted the water in his face,

207
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,470
like we had them and then they did that
and then they just fucking rallied and

208
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,150
they won game six and seven.
I just,

209
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,210
I was dying to hear what the
fuck he had to say on that.

210
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,010
And of course he was at
another gala. Um, oh, well.

211
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,630
So anyway, so I went up to
Thursday and, um, landed,

212
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,530
got over and did this show.
Uh,

213
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,320
Paul presents as a green room and it
was like sort of this remembering, uh,

214
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,680
all the great comics who've
passed. Uh, it was, uh,

215
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,750
you know, Patrice
Schimmel, Greg Geraldo, uh,

216
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,700
John Pinette, you know, Mitch Hedberg
and on and on and on and on and on.

217
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,670
And we told a bunch of funny
stories and gave each other shit.

218
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:40,180
I guess people enjoyed
it. Um, Robert Schimmel,

219
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,470
I don't know if I said him and, uh,
yeah, if it was a, it was actually,

220
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:47,590
it was a good time. Um, even
though I was dreading it,

221
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,210
it actually turned out
to be a really good time.

222
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,650
But then afterwards somebody mentioned
that we forgot to bring up auto and

223
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,050
George Auto in Georgia. And I was just
like, oh man. So I felt bad about that,

224
00:13:56,051 --> 00:14:01,000
but either way, she
started off well and, um,

225
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,180
and then just every night
and the Versie and, uh,

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Tony v the Great Tony v ended up at
a cigar bar every night at the end,

227
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,590
smoking Cuban cigars. And, uh,
I gotta be honest with you,

228
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:18,670
I was done after two nights. I can't smoke
a cigar three nights in a fucking row,

229
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:22,840
but Versie is a fucking animal.
And by the third night,

230
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:27,100
Tony Vee had gone back. So it was
just me and versing. I actually,

231
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:30,280
I get like a small one. And even then
I feel like, I feel like I've stood,

232
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:34,360
I stood behind a bus. Like usually I buy
a box of Cubans and I bring them back.

233
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,300
And at this point I didn't even
want him. It's like, I need to,

234
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,680
I need to take time off of this shit.
It's just too much.

235
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,000
So, um, I think I'm on the wagon again.

236
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,930
You know, I do it. I either, I
don't know how to, I even fucking,

237
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,030
I'm going to have 20 them and
fucking cigars every night,

238
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:57,930
or I just say fuck it for like 60, 70
days. That's it works for me. All right.

239
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,500
Just go fuck yourself with
your role in, uh, your eyes.

240
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,200
Yeah.

241
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,850
Can't help it.
If I don't have any willpower.

242
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,070
Actually I do have willpower
the 70 days and then I'm good.

243
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,960
Um, but I want to thank Tony Vee, Tony
Vee. Um, I went up there and they were,

244
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,500
they had this award show thing and they
were giving out these awards for comedy,

245
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:22,240
which is silly, but, uh, you know,

246
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,980
what are you going to do?
They've done a bunch of shit for me.

247
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,340
It was anybody else that would have
been like, no, no, I don't want to go,

248
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:33,690
you know what, I'm working,
but some aren't comedy fest.

249
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,780
Who doesn't want to go to Montreal?

250
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:38,650
So I went up there and I had Tony v do
the intro when he fucking absolutely

251
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:40,900
crushed it.
Um,

252
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,360
okay.

253
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,510
And, uh, that was, that
was, that was a great time.

254
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,950
And then the next night I did
the gala and a I got to give a,

255
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,460
I gotta give a shout out to, to the
people that were on the show. Man,

256
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:56,070
they were great.
This dude mocks for what,

257
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,210
who I worked with in
Toronto was hilarious.

258
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:03,600
And we had worked in Toronto like the end
of last year when I saw growth in him,

259
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,010
like major growth since the last time
I was with them. He was fucking great.

260
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,910
God Damn. I hope I don't forget
anybody. Michael Che, um,

261
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,920
who I wasn't familiar with,

262
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:17,220
I made sure I went on youtube and I
watched everybody before I went out there

263
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,330
because that wasn't allowed to say he's
been on this show or this show because

264
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:24,810
we were up in Canada and I watched
his Letterman and she said the guy was

265
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,630
phenomenal. And then his jokes
at the Gallo or even better,

266
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,100
uh, shit, I'm getting old. Oh.

267
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:36,660
Versie Versie was on the show.
Uh,

268
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,200
Nikki Glaser.
She was on it.

269
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,240
MMM.

270
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,530
Was that all day on the show is literally
two days ago. Oh. And then Chris Delea,

271
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,330
he comes out absolutely fucking
murders it. He's a based,

272
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,050
and then dom Irrera walked out.
Closed it out.

273
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,570
Yeah.

274
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,990
Oh wait, uh, um,

275
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,690
Kurt Metzger,
how much said Bert Kreischer,

276
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,330
that's how fucking old and Kurt Metzger
came out. He did this fucking bit.

277
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,300
And what killed me was the,
the,

278
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,020
I don't want to ruin the joke
because I don't want to do his bits,

279
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:20,021
but he did this bit and he was so
clearly being absurd and it was fucking

280
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,440
hilarious. It was, it was
a bit about, you know,

281
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,760
girls in their teens committing suicide
and he had a solution as to what to do

282
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:33,260
to prevent them from not killing
themselves. And it was fucking hilarious.

283
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,650
It was absurd. But the, the,
the reviewer was just like,

284
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:41,330
it didn't go over well at the gala.
It did go well on the nasty show.

285
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,070
It's like, yeah, that's not
his fault. You fucking idiots.

286
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:49,450
Do you think he's being serious?
That there's nothing that gets all the,

287
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,550
a lot of shit gets me gold,

288
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:55,140
but that really fucking annoys me when
the critic doesn't even get the joke.

289
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:59,910
And then blaming the comedian,
whatever.

290
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,440
All right.
So he fucking killed.

291
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,210
Okay.

292
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,670
Though everybody, the whole fucking
show was great. The show was great,

293
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:10,270
and I was actually, uh, I was dreading
doing it because, like I said,

294
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:13,520
I was hosting and that was
outside of my comfort zone. Um,

295
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,920
you don't wanna you know what it is?

296
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:20,921
It goes back to early in my career
where I hosted a show at the comedy

297
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,790
connection in Providence,
Rhode Island,

298
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,180
and I ate my balls so fucking bad.

299
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,770
And the thing about it is,
is if you're just doing a set,

300
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,400
if you go up and bomb is bad as it is,

301
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,840
you're tearing that you're tearing the
bandaid off. Whatever you're doing,

302
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:41,360
you know, in 10 minutes you're
getting it over with. You're doing,

303
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,260
it's going by in real time.
If you're hosting,

304
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,690
you go up and eat your balls, you
get off, you got to go back up again,

305
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,250
bring up the next, each your balls,
bring up the next guy, go back up again.

306
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:59,290
You just have to keep
going back up and in.

307
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,560
It's not like you get to start over
again. They're like, oh yeah, that guy,

308
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:04,970
that guy that we don't like.

309
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,750
And it just keeps going on and
off for the duration of the show,

310
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,350
which is gonna be be at least 90 minutes.
So for 90 minutes,

311
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,100
you're eating your balls,
even when you're not up there eating it,

312
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:19,060
you're in the green room dreading
and you're making a set list.

313
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,460
What if I did this joke?
Freaking the fuck out. Uh,

314
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,840
so I think that I actually have a,
uh,

315
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,220
I have a phobia or I did anyways. I had
a phobia fucking hosting and that, ah,

316
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,120
that got rid of it.

317
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,780
You see that when you've got dry rot
on the bottom of your fucking house,

318
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:40,340
you can get over there. A lot of fears.

The big razor companies
think we're stupid.

342
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,210

ridiculous shaving technology gimmick,

right and x and expect us to
shell out our big bucks for it.

it with a vibrating handle?

How about a roller pivot
ball? Backscratcher egg timer,
laser point a corkscrew.

You get the point. You don't
need it. I know I don't.

347
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,510
We were shaving just fine before any of

Go to prosper.com/birth all right,
here we go.

392
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,790
Back to the thing there.
You know,

393
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,970
one of these weeks I'm actually going to
look at the copy before I go to read it.

394
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,600
I always do that personal experience.
So I go host.

395
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,400
Okay,

396
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,930
what a Maroon. Um, all right. So anyways,

397
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,240
so now that I'm, I'm, I'm,

398
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,240
I'm trying to convince myself that
I'm going to knock off the drinking.

399
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:33,270
Whenever I quit booze,
I have to go like six days.

400
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,400
I can go like three, four days and I
don't give a shit if I have a beer.

401
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:41,850
But once I get to six days, I feel like
I got a little hitting streak going,

402
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:45,630
you know, and I don't want to
start back over at zero. So, uh,

403
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,520
we'll see how I am this time next week.
But I'm going to lay off the stove,

404
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,180
going to lay off the booze there.

405
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,620
And I'm like, I said, we'll, we'll, we'll,

406
00:24:55,621 --> 00:25:00,180
we'll see how it goes and I'm trying to
do my final push to tip the scales at a

407
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:04,860
buck 62. The last time I
had a flat stomach and a
little bit of abs over there.

408
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,540
And, uh, I got to be honest, you,

409
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:11,490
a lot of people are giving me shit for
my diet advice despite the fact that I

410
00:25:11,491 --> 00:25:12,720
know some people that have been,
you know,

411
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,840
some of the suggestions that I'm making,
you know,

412
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,320
keen was salads and all that type of
stuff. Somebody actually texted me saying,

413
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:21,600
your diet advice is making me angry.

414
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,230
It's just like, dude, I think that
has less to do with what I'm seeing.

415
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,930
I'm suggesting vegetables,
vegetables are making you angry.

416
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,570
I think that has to do with
you probably at, you know,

417
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,640
an overbearing father like myself.
You know,

418
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:39,450
we didn't let you speak up
and express your opinions.

419
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,820
You could just write me and
just say, hey, you know,

420
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,360
why don't you try this instead
of sitting there stewing,

421
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,880
um, no pun intended. And then
there's other people that, you know,

422
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,050
you're giving me shit just saying that
veggies or for rabbits and all of that,

423
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:58,800
that all of that usual shit. I never said
don't eat meat. I'm just saying, I just,

424
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,260
what's been working for me,
I'm in the best shape.

425
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:04,040
I've been in like three years and
everybody's saying my dietary advice,

426
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,240
advices bullshit. It's, it's
completely working for me.

427
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,770
And they're still holding on to that
whole like, you know, we like a mad,

428
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,850
you know,
fucking go kill an animal and go eat it.

429
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,780
I'm not saying don't do that
Shit, but, uh, here's something.

430
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,620
Here's something.
Uh,

431
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,960
I would like you to try for all the meat
eaters out there that had given me shit,

432
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,880
and I'm not even saying this,
so fucking paranoid carnivores.

433
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,910
I'm not even saying don't eat
meat. I'm just saying, you know,

434
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:36,360
twice a fucking week. This is what
I do with the veggies over there.

435
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,020
And they get in the backs up again,
not freaked out. Let me ask you this,

436
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:44,370
this steak dinner. I want you
to do a experiment, all right?

437
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,340
One night,
go out and get yourself a lovely,

438
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,660
amazing steak dinner with the baked
potatoes and the cream has spinach in your

439
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:53,370
glass of wine and all of that.

440
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,500
And I want you to honestly tell me how
you feel afterwards. I know you feel full,

441
00:26:58,501 --> 00:26:59,640
I know you feel great,

442
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,110
but I want to know how long after that
meal before you just have to lay down and

443
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:07,890
go to sleep, which is
basically your body going, wow,

444
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,560
look at this fucking mountain
of work we got to deal with.

445
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,170
Let me just go fucking lie down.

446
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,380
That's shut the body down so we can
get this through our fucking system.

447
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,230
If you go out and you have a
fucking Veggie dinner, right.

448
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,400
That's of of the same quality
of as a good steakhouse. I mean,

449
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:28,210
I'm not talking about going to one of
those things where they deep fry fucking

450
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:31,300
Zucchini at that point you
might as well go to Mcdonald's.

451
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,610
I'm saying actually a really,
you know,

452
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,210
like comparable to whatever
steakhouse you going to go to,

453
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:41,680
a comparable vegetarian place. And
uh, tell me how you feel after that.

454
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,500
Okay. And I will always eat steak.
I love a fucking steak dinner.

455
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,650
I love chicken. I love all of that shit.
I'm always going to eat that stuff. But,

456
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:54,220
um,
it's undeniable as far as I'm concerned,

457
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,570
how much better I feel
when I do the veggie thing.

458
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,950
So I know I'm never going
to stop eating cattle,

459
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,270
so I just look at it kind of
like what the Stovies, Hey,

460
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:11,730
I just take a break for a couple of days.
That's all I'm suggesting. All right,

461
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:16,320
so all you guys who were sending me
homophobic shit suggesting that I now want

462
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:20,910
to lay down with another man just cause
like want to have a fucking Q Columbo.

463
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:32,420
Well, don't look at the shape of it. Q
comp was like a fucking porn stars Dick.

464
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,220
You know,
it's like you're blowing the hall.

465
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,090
Um, anyways. Hey, this
is a great time with Eo.

466
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,870
It's actually getting a little
late, you know, I hope you got you.

467
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:48,980
I forgot to bring up again once again
to have yourself a little veggie garden.

468
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,410
You know, our tomatoes are just starting
to become ripe and the other night, okay,

469
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,710
one of them fell off
the branch there and uh,

470
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,020
we cut it up, put a little salt and
pepper drizzle a little olive oil,

471
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:06,310
made it a little,
I guess less healthy fucking eight.

472
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,150
The thing I was unbelievable.

473
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,920
Unbelievable what a tomato was actually
supposed to taste like versus what the

474
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:16,940
fuck you usually get. Um, so anyway,

475
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:20,020
so all you guys out there who think
I'm like, you know, slowly gonna Start,

476
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,740
you know, walking on stage
wearing yoga, stretchy pants.

477
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,890
Um, I mean I might have to
do that one night if, uh,

478
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,210
if you know that, that uh, Josh is,

479
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:40,350
show them the best God damn comedy show,
whatever the fuck he calls it,

480
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,213
you know?

481
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,130
Okay.

482
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,380
Depending on what drummer I'm
dressing up, like, I mean,

483
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:47,600
if you look at a lot of the hair
metal and that type of stuff,

484
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:48,860
some of that spend x,
I mean,

485
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:52,700
they were basically wearing yoga
pants that were shorts, right?

486
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,523
Is that what it was?

487
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,550
I want to do a Stryper song joke and
I would never do that to people. Um,

488
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:04,760
anyway, so that's all I'm
suggesting so everybody can,
uh, you know, fucking relax.

489
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,630
You can relax.
Um,

490
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,020
what else did I do up in Montreal
besides booze? My face off.

491
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,450
Oh,
I did radio and did some radio.

492
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:20,720
He did a rich and Bonnie's
podcast going in there,

493
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:24,890
knowing full well that it was going to
be some of the most awkward moments in

494
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:28,430
the history of, of radio, which
is basically what a podcast is.

495
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:32,450
I don't know why they call it a
podcast. It's a fucking radio show. Um,

496
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,000
what is this podcasting, how
would you describe it? Well,

497
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:39,770
have you listened to the radio? It's
that, except it's on the Internet. Hmm.

498
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,680
Interesting. Um, so if you've
never listened to the, uh,

499
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:49,420
rich and Bonnie podcast, my
wife hates me. Uh, uh, I,

500
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,190
I would highly recommend it.

501
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:56,050
And I went on this thing knowing that
it was going to be brutal. And uh,

502
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,820
and then me and Bonnie, we, we got this
fucking thing where we like each other,

503
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:05,020
but our conversations do not link up.
You have to have somebody like that,

504
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,320
somebody you just, you
just cannot, like you just,

505
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,640
it's just been a 20 year
misunderstanding between the two of us.

506
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,230
I never know what she's saying.

507
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:19,231
She never knows what I'm saying and it
just leads us to these fucking dead ends.

508
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,930
We'll,
we just both looked at each other,

509
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:27,040
shake our heads and walk away and then
start over again at the top of the street.

510
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,280
So that's essentially,

511
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:35,281
if you'd like to listen to like an hour
of that with rich vos telling stories

512
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,730
that really have nothing to do with what
me and Bonnie are attempting to say to

513
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,160
one another. I highly recommend
it too. I'm, I'm fucking around.

514
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,280
It was a great time. Uh,
people really seem to enjoy it.

515
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:49,390
And then also there was some really
funny comics in the crowd. Um,

516
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,550
Judy Gold, uh, you know, people like
that Shyman in and that type of stuff,

517
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:55,510
adding to it.
So,

518
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,650
and this one old guy who fell asleep
two minutes into it and we actually sent

519
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,190
him, sorry, she said the hiccups
there. I wasn't getting emotional.

520
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:08,380
We actually sent him off into the corner
so he could sleep and his friends could

521
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:11,680
watch. And a, he nodded
off for the whole show.

522
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,020
I think we got a picture of him.
Um, all right. And then that was it.

523
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,910
I did the opiate Jimmy show.

524
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,990
Okay.

525
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,620
And, uh, I think that that
was it. That's what it,

526
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:28,590
that's what I did.
That was my festival and another one.

527
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:33,270
Now the Montreal comedy festival
down enough fucking tubes.

528
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,380
Um, right. Hey, you know, don't look now,

529
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:40,040
but the New York Yankees are
making a push for the playoffs.

530
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,990
Those sons of bitches, they're
actually in the wild cad. And um,

531
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,510
as a fan of Derek Jeter,

532
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:51,140
I'd like to see them make it just to CG
to do one more post season. Of course,

533
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:53,600
I want to see the hankies loose,
which is always bigger,

534
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,160
is bigger than my respect for
Derek Jeter. But, uh, I don't know,

535
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,260
be kind of sad if that was like,
you know,

536
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,670
fuck it ended the season and then that,
that was just it.

537
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,720
I do have tickets to the uh,

538
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,550
okay

539
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,280
to that, that last game
he's playing at Fenway Park.

540
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,120
Did I tell you guys I bought in half
on red sox season tickets this year.

541
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,660
Buddy of mine was on a waiting list for
10 years and he got these great seats.

542
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:22,620
He's like, I can't, I can't swing these
man. I need some more people to buy in.

543
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:24,780
So I bought in for my
little block of tickets,

544
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,580
me and a couple of the guys or whatever.
And um, cause they're expensive as shit.

545
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,130
And I'm thinking like,
all right, well, you know,

546
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:36,210
I got enough family and friends back there
that I can sell them to them and then

547
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:40,080
I can, you know, the socks don't care if
you put them up on stub hub. So I'm like,

548
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:44,310
I'll, I'll, I'll be fine.
Right. And uh, you know,

549
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,390
the red sox shit, the bed from day one
and I can't give these things away.

550
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,490
I've lost,
I lost my shirt on these tickets

551
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,370
once again. Bill Borough and the comedy
odd ball tour later on this summer.

552
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,550
Um, Jesus fucking Christ.
So, but I do have that,

553
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,450
you know what's funny is
I could actually sell the,

554
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:08,110
and I could sell that pair of tickets
on stub hub and I can make a ton of

555
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:12,400
fucking money, a ton of my
money back. I would still lose.

556
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,450
But especially if the Yankees don't make
the playoffs and that could actually be

557
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:21,430
like his last fucking game. I
think there's a possibility. Um,

558
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,873
uh,

559
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,510
this is a sports fan. There's no
fucking way I'd rather be there.

560
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,350
I've never been like, you know, I remember
a long time ago to two of my buddies,

561
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:38,351
they get season tickets to the patriots
in 1985 and the patriots ended up going

562
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:43,691
to the Superbowl and they had tickets
to go to Superbowl 20 and they both

563
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:48,800
scalped him and I just met him.
I thought it was the dumbest thing ever.

564
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:53,360
And even though we lost 46 to 10,
even though we got fucking destroyed,

565
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,920
it's just like I would,
I would still rather go to Superbowl 20

566
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,380
and actually see the 46 defense live.

567
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:08,090
You could've saw Walter
Payton, all of those. Uh,

568
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,200
you know, Richard Dent, Wilbur Marshall,
all of those fucking hall of Famers,

569
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:14,880
all of those people you
could have seen. I, you know,

570
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:19,881
Jim McMann versus fucking Tony Eason
and then old Steve Grogan coming in that

571
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,360
whole file, but it would've been great.
And you get to party down in New Orleans.

572
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:26,910
I definitely,
I always think the experience,

573
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,810
even if your team loses his better
than selling them, and maybe, uh,

574
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,460
maybe I'm a fucking jackass, but,
uh, I always look at it that way.

575
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:39,930
So I'm definitely going back,
um, for that game. You know,

576
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:44,830
maybe I'll pick up like a one
nighter along the way. Um, but,

577
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:47,380
uh, I'm really looking
forward to going to that. Wow.

578
00:35:47,381 --> 00:35:49,660
So maybe I should be rooting for the
Yankees not to make the playoffs.

579
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:52,060
So that'll be his last game.
So actually it will be like,

580
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,440
and like the fucking bottom of the
eighth of the top of the ninth,

581
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,820
Derek Jeter coming up for
his final fucking at bat,

582
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,160
but if he hoped he hits a home run to
right field, like fucking Ted Williams,

583
00:36:06,161 --> 00:36:10,290
you know, he's got it. Do
something. Um, so anyways, uh,

584
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,670
and football is right around the corner.

585
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,950
This is such an exciting time.

586
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,110
Is there anything more exciting than
when you suddenly start going to like

587
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:22,980
fucking training camp? The greatest
month of the year for me is September.

588
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,390
It's just like I always get depressed
at how fast the summer goes by.

589
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:34,440
And then when all of a sudden it's
September and it's football and the games

590
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:38,370
count in his college football and all
of that type of shit. It's just the,

591
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,950
it's the greatest. It's the fucking
greatest. I can't wait. I can't wait.

592
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,320
So I mean, what else am I going to
do for the rest of the summer hunt?

593
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:48,560
Go out and sunbathe over there.
All right,

594
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,750
let's get into some of your questions
here for the week. Uh, the flute, it says,

595
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:57,200
Bill, you took a hammering from a
lot of people on all fronts. Twitter,

596
00:36:57,201 --> 00:37:01,640
Facebook and emails. Um, nine,

597
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:05,430
10 mentioned, Oh, 90%,

598
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:10,230
I guess mentioned anchorman. Other
suggests you youtube jazz flute players.

599
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,250
Listen, go fuck yourselves.
All right. First of all,

600
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:17,940
you guys who said when I said there's no
cool way to play the flute and then you

601
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:22,780
bring up anchorman.
He was mocking playing jazz flute.

602
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,440
He was making fun of it.
It's a fucking movie.

603
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:30,280
Do you think those flames were actually
real coming out of the end of it?

604
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,800
Do you think he really drank a
fucking drink out of the thing?

605
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:37,250
It was using it as a straw.
It was a joke. All right.

606
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,000
Um, and as far as jazz flute, let me
tell you something right now. I don't, I,

607
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,210
I'm not saying that there's not
virtuoso play. I don't want to hear it.

608
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,450
There's certain instruments that listen,

609
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,980
if you want to accompany like
some shit with the flute.

610
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,240
Absolutely.
All right?

611
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,450
But there's a reason why there's no
fucking flute players in the rock and roll

612
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:04,400
hall of fame and don't even bring up
that fucking ban. Howdo Pope, pope,

613
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,270
whatever that fucking guy
is that Jeff Tull guy.

614
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,560
I don't even want to fucking hear it.

615
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:12,920
He did not get into the rock and roll
hall of fame because of his flute playing.

616
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:16,580
It was the fucking rock
music underneath it. Okay,

617
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,830
so you can take your flute. Okay. Turn
it up sideways and shoved straight up.

618
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:26,420
Yo Carrie Dils. No. Um, yeah, no,

619
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:30,290
I stand by that. I stand by that. I
put the flute right up with the oboe.

620
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,400
Now if I go watch a, a classic, I
guess I was talking to like rock music.

621
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,620
All right. Even jazz,
you can go fuck yourself.

622
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:42,280
I'd much rather that trumpet has so
much more power. Saxophone, trombone,

623
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,650
all of that shit. I would when I
listen to that than the God damn flute.

624
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,680
Now you take a flute and Piccolo and
you stick that shit in a a sympathy,

625
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,620
sympathy as symphony.
I can listen to it then.

626
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,040
Then I find it an amazing a
company. Mint. If you had,

627
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,710
I came to any of the words
I'm trying to use right now.

628
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,950
If you fucking have 40
other fucking musicians,

629
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,700
okay. Helping to flesh out
all around a fucking flute.

630
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,570
I can listen to it. Or a
Piccolo. I can listen to that.

631
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,190
If you want to have one little movement
where you know you got some dreadful

632
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:21,240
fucking music and all is lost and all
of a sudden there's a rail light at the

633
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:22,950
top of the fucking tunnel and you want to,

634
00:39:22,951 --> 00:39:25,830
you want to emphasize that with a little,
oh Ooh,

635
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:29,910
what is that up there kind of fucking
notes with a flute or a Piccolo that have

636
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:34,080
at it have at it, but I don't want to
listen to a fucking hour. That shit.

637
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,180
I stand by it. Fuck all you flew.
Play in fucking assholes out there.

638
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,440
Who would have thought?

639
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,600
Who would have thought that that would
have become a controversy? All right. Um,

640
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,510
hey bill, when's your next special
going to be available on Netflix?

641
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,720
We are shooting for December 5th.
Um,

642
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,360
December 5th is going to be the release
date and I'm editing it right now and I

643
00:39:56,361 --> 00:40:01,220
could not be happier with the
way that this thing looks. Um,

644
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:06,490
I can't wait for you guys to see it and
I am in the process of writing my new

645
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,910
hour and I come and right out of the
gate with just a rough one. You know,

646
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,223
um,

647
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,390
it's really just coming off as sexist
and I have to be honest because I can't

648
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:22,040
stand outside of myself.
I can't have like a Jesus Christ.

649
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:25,090
What are they ripping up downstairs now?
You know what I think they're doing?

650
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:27,110
I think they getting rid of,
it's, this is actually exciting.

651
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:30,050
I have all this galvanized
pipe in my house. Um,

652
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,260
and they fucking Yank because like I said,

653
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:37,400
it's been flayed downstairs and he can
see all of it and they're like, well,

654
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:41,720
we might as well change it now before it
bursts that he's put that fear in your

655
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:45,770
head, hey, we're building this
beautiful bathroom. But sure,

656
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:50,410
it'd be a shame if this shit buying
a wall burst. I mean, we can risk it.

657
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,690
And you're like, all
right, just fucking, dude,

658
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,350
I'm not gonna make any
money off this house.

659
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:02,270
I'm going to have to
fucking live to be 150

660
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,903
okay.

661
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,810
Christ.
Yeah.

662
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:12,400
The only good thing about buying a fucking
house is that if you want to change

663
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:14,950
something you can, you don't have
to clear it with the landlord.

664
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,080
But as far as making any
money off your house,

665
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,970
it's a fucking pipe dream and less, you
fucking start fucking over other people.

666
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,230
And when the market's hot,

667
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,310
you go in and you buy houses and
you do a half ass fucking job,

668
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,340
you have fast,
the whole fucking thing.

669
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,560
You don't even know what
the fuck you do doing.

670
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:35,120
That's why I hate show where
the leaf flipped this house.

671
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,140
I can't stand watching those
people who aren't caught.

672
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,520
Like they sit there and they'll
show the guy who bought the house,

673
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,610
he's trying to figure out how to use the,
the, the, uh, the sander or whatever to,

674
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:47,840
to Redo hardwood floors.
He doesn't even know what he's doing.

675
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,340
They're playing this silly music
and he does a fucking half ass job.

676
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:57,260
And then you watch these suckers come
in because what he did is all brand new.

677
00:41:57,261 --> 00:42:00,170
So it's still holding together
and it hasn't fallen apart yet.

678
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,290
And he'd just watching these people
getting led off to fucking financial

679
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:07,830
slaughter. Sorry. Anyways. Um,

680
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,810
so this opening bit that I'm doing,
I can't tell if a

681
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,770
okay

682
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,610
if it's coming off sexist
or I just am sexist.

683
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,260
Um, the point of it is, is
not the, isn't the sexism,

684
00:42:22,261 --> 00:42:24,600
but it's really coming off like that.
It's really been a,

685
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,310
especially up there in Montreal. Oh
Jesus. I opened with that at the gala.

686
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:34,020
I'm sure we'll edit that one
out. Um, so anyways, yeah.

687
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:34,560
The next one,

688
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,270
it's going to be a December
5th and also my comedy album,

689
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,730
um, is finally done. Finally went through
all the red tape with Carnegie Hall,

690
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:48,430
Finally got Them, press all
the, uh, the records press. Um,

691
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,330
I'm going to find out today,
I actually have them in my house.

692
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,830
I have to find out when I can sell
these things to you because they're also

693
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:59,370
going to be available in stores.
Um,

694
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,420
but the fucker is done and I think I'm
going to be doing a co release with a

695
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,680
Aziz Ansari on a third man,
third man records,

696
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:15,060
which is Jack White's label out of
on Nashville, Tennessee. So, uh,

697
00:43:15,061 --> 00:43:19,130
that's a little teaser. That should
be coming up in the next, um,

698
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,810
I dunno when in the next month or
so. I hope. I'm really hoping. Uh,

699
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:28,440
I think they're finishing up diseases
album. So a, it's going to be pretty cool.

700
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:32,010
And once again I really want
to make the stresses okay.

701
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,080
The material that's on
my Carnegie album is,

702
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,310
um,

703
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:43,230
that was November of 2011 and when
I taped you people are all the same.

704
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,020
That was march of 2012.
So that's December,

705
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,210
uh,

706
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,200
January, February,
March, four months later.

707
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:54,340
So this was where my act was
at four months earlier. So
there's a ton of overlap,

708
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:59,610
which is why I wanted to put it out on
vinyl only because I wanted to document

709
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:03,370
that I actually got to
perform at Carnegie Hall,

710
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,740
but I don't want to
fuck any you guys over.

711
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:07,720
Were you thinking this is going
to go, oh my God, this is a,

712
00:44:07,721 --> 00:44:12,220
this is going to be an hour of completely
different shit that I never heard of

713
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,930
it.
That's not what it is.

714
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:17,620
What you're going to hear is where my
act was four months before I recorded it.

715
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,780
So there is some different shit,

716
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:24,340
but I'd have to say at least
80% of it is the same, um,

717
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,120
jokes, ideas or whatever. And
granted I tell them differently.

718
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,250
I'm sure someone will
listen to and be like, Hey,

719
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:34,290
actually you look the way you did the
fucking jerk off joke at Carnegie better

720
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,780
than you did it in DC.
So there will be that.

721
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:38,220
But I'm letting you guys know that shit.

722
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:40,350
So I don't want to hear any
fucking crap from any of you.

723
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,880
Like I screwed you over.

724
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:46,290
I'm going out of my way to let you
know that this is what it is. But, um,

725
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,230
it's really, uh, you know,
to have a comedy album,

726
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:52,980
you know,

727
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,960
is pretty fucking awesome
and it's something that I
don't think this will be the

728
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,440
last time I do this. I
would like to try and, uh,

729
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,041
you know,

730
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:06,550
I have a couple of ideas where I could
put out just an hour of original shit.

731
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:10,840
Maybe just od on vinyl. That could be
a cool thing. We'll see. We shall see.

732
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,570
So I'm just letting you know that
that is a, I actually have them,

733
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,990
I just have to wait to figure out
when I'm going to sell it. But, uh,

734
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:18,040
every day that I don't,

735
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,450
it's closer to the holidays and it'll
make a wonderful gift. There you go. Oh,

736
00:45:22,451 --> 00:45:24,100
Jesus.
What does that guy drilling down there?

737
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:25,923
MMM.

738
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,470
If any of the construction
people are working on my house,

739
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,280
so listening to my podcast,
I know you guys are doing a
phenomenal job. All right.

740
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:33,720
I'm just being a crabby cont okay,

741
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:36,300
so don't fucking not tighten
down the screws down there.

742
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,233
Okay.

743
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,683
Yeah,
yeah.

744
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:44,723
You hear that?

745
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,120
Yeah. I don't even know. I didn't
want to know what the fuck that was.

746
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:55,360
Um, all right, let's plow
ahead here. Uh, dude,

747
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:59,560
he didn't call Shit.
Versie um,

748
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,670
dear bill.

749
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,240
Yeah,

750
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,640
Ooda Zelie Uber.
Uh,

751
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:08,510
I'd like to congratulate Paul Versey
when no one else in the world was saying

752
00:46:08,511 --> 00:46:13,100
Lebron would go back to Cleveland.
He was the only one. Oh No, wait.

753
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:14,870
He wasn't,
in fact,

754
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,250
he didn't call it until one week before
the decision was made and plenty,

755
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,230
all in caps of other people had been
making that exact same prediction.

756
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:28,250
You can look at his Twitter feed or
listened to his podcast for proof.

757
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:33,380
Basically everyone was saying it.
It was either Miami, Cleveland,

758
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:36,200
or a few other teams
that had made phone call.

759
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:40,460
Does Paul know that guessing correctly
by picking one of four choices isn't

760
00:46:40,461 --> 00:46:42,830
calling it Jesus Paul.
He had taken a pounding.

761
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,600
He acts like he's Sam fucking
Rothstein and he may any,

762
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,100
he made some,

763
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:54,260
some out of left field prediction that
Lebron was going to the raptors as

764
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:58,190
something. Here's the thing, I like
Paul. I think he's funny, but holy Shit.

765
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,230
Cool it on the calling it thing.

766
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,430
I can't even imagine having an
argument with him in person. Ah,

767
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,960
this is fucking hilarious. Paul, look at
this guy. This guy is sharing my viewer,

768
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,200
you. Uh, he seems like, you
know, it's funny, as Paul is
listening to this right now,

769
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:17,130
and I know he's got his head down with
his looking through his eyebrows going,

770
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,840
he gets fucking bullshit. I said it
to j law had Jay lie, I can say it.

771
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:25,670
I said it two fucking years ago to j law
had an a bar in Cleveland. Um, he goes,

772
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:29,380
he seems like the type of guy who does
that thing where he puts the tip of his

773
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:33,160
fingers together when he's making a
point now he definitely doesn't do that.

774
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,850
Then shakes his hands back and forth,
uh,

775
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,880
from his chest to the floor like an
Italian and Italian and do that annoying

776
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:45,550
thing where you look at someone else in
the group besides the guy you're making

777
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:47,200
a point to as if to say,
hey,

778
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,800
we're all together on this point I'm
making against this guy in front of me.

779
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:55,300
Am I right fellas? That's fucking, that's
hilarious. That's why I love Italians.

780
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,190
I love that they do that. He goes, all
due respect to Paul though. Great Guy.

781
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,290
Now that you took the piss out of him,
he goes,

782
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:05,170
he literally has to be the worst
poker player on the planet too.

783
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:09,130
I can't imagine him playing it
cool with anything but pocket aces,

784
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:13,330
watching Paul's face and Paul's face
alone during the whole process of him

785
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:17,850
chasing a straight would be priceless.
Um, I played poker with Paul.

786
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,410
Now he has, he has a great, uh,

787
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,770
he has a great poker face and then
he has a way of looking at you.

788
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,840
He's got this face when he's looking
at you to try to figure out if you're

789
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:31,440
bluffing, that actually
makes you laugh. Um,

790
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:36,030
all right.
Paul shot has been fired your way.

791
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,330
For those of you not listening to the
[inaudible] podcast, this is like, uh,

792
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,980
like the old rap battles where Paul's
going to have an answer song, um,

793
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,930
to this guy. He's going to defend
himself. So everybody listened to the, uh,

794
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:51,180
the Versie effect.
I will email this,

795
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,350
I will copy and paste this and I
will email it to him and maybe, uh,

796
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,250
maybe he can write back. And, uh,

797
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,590
the worst part of all of this is I'm
going to have to listen to him defending

798
00:49:01,591 --> 00:49:06,180
himself first to me on the phone before
I listened to him do it on his podcast.

799
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:10,320
So I have to listen to them
do it twice. All right. Okay.

800
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:15,090
Quit drinking would rather be alone.
This next person says,

801
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,003
uh,

802
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,630
Mr [inaudible] embarrassment.
Sorry.

803
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:23,370
Um,

804
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,760
I thought since you've taken time off
from drinking that you'd be a good person

805
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:29,430
to talk to,
talk to and ask about this.

806
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,690
I'm 22 years old and after hitting the
bottle hard since early high school I

807
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:37,820
decided to take some time off after
it seemed to get out of control. Yeah,

808
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:42,180
I've been there. I said I'd been sober
for nearly five months at this point.

809
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,940
The thing is that since
putting up the bottle,

810
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:48,990
I've noticed I enjoy spending time
alone rather than with other people.

811
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,460
I still go out to bars and hang with my
buddies who drink and usually just end

812
00:49:53,461 --> 00:49:55,410
up being the designated driver.

813
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,940
He says I have no problem with
people who can control their alcohol.

814
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,660
Just thought it would be a good
personal choice to take some time away,

815
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:08,990
but being sober slash the sober guy at
22 is pretty damn rough when everyone

816
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:13,530
else is getting shitty. Just wondering
if you had any insight on the matter.

817
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,170
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,

818
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:22,220
well I can actually relate even at
46 of being the sober guy because of,

819
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,000
uh, all the free time
that comedians have. Um,

820
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,260
we can kind of drink like we're still 22,

821
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:33,350
so I know how I'm

822
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:35,110
okay.

823
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,720
I Buy, I guess, you know, but I'm not 22,

824
00:50:36,721 --> 00:50:40,250
so I guess there is an extra amount
of stress with that. But, uh,

825
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:45,000
I think what you're doing is a
great thing and a Hello Neil.

826
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,170
Um,
I think it's a great thing.

827
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,650
And um,

828
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,430
how do I put this? The w w when you,
when you go on a run of not drinking,

829
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,680
it's all about you.
Okay.

830
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:04,160
And what you want to do and
how long you want to do it. And

831
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:05,900
um,

832
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,900
I wouldn't give in to any like external
pressures as to when and where you start

833
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:13,000
drinking again.
Um,

834
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,370
I always find it funny when I'm not
drinking to go to a bar and watch,

835
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,290
basically everybody's slowly roofing
themselves and then just watch the

836
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,940
behavior.
And like I said,

837
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:26,240
I don't do it in a judgmental way because
it's more senate kind of observing

838
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:30,860
like, oh, this is how I was acting.
Um, it can definitely suck at night,

839
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,940
but there's nothing better in the morning
when you wake up without a hangover

840
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,500
ready to take on the world. And,
uh, I would think at 22 to do that,

841
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:43,020
it's pretty mature and you've
got a chance of meeting a,

842
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,170
your judgment on who you start dating
would probably be a lot better rather than

843
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,920
you're hammered and she's hammered and
you start the relationship off in this

844
00:51:51,921 --> 00:51:55,790
cloudy area. Um, you might meet another,

845
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:00,710
you know, smart person your age, uh,

846
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:05,180
who's taken some time off herself. Who
knows, who knows. But as far as like, um,

847
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,750
if you feel impressed you
to start drinking again,

848
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,930
that's the wrong reason to start drinking
because everybody else is drinking is

849
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:14,000
not the reason to come back it.
But you know,

850
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:17,750
if you feel like you have it under
control and you know, you, you know,

851
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:21,380
or if there's an event coming
up and you're like, okay,

852
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:24,500
I'm going to drink it that and then
I'm going to meet at least shut it off.

853
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,130
But I gotta be honest with you, that's
a tough thing to do because I was like,

854
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:31,490
I'm going to drink when I went to Vegas
and then I was immediately and go back

855
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:35,540
on the wagon and I was able to do it for
four days and then it was like July 4th

856
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:35,930
weekend.

857
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,230
Then I have a bad a beer and then I've
just been kinda drinking ever since. But,

858
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:39,950
uh,

859
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:44,750
fortunately I drank so
much in Montreal that yeah,

860
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,530
that now I don't want to drink.
I think that I almost need to do that.

861
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:53,050
I got to hit like a wall where I
either make such an ass of myself.

862
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:57,160
It makes such a bad decision or just
do something that, uh, it, it's,

863
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:02,000
it's easy for me to kind of like
want to walk away from it. But,

864
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:06,080
uh, like I said, it's all up to you. You
don't sound like you're an alcoholic.

865
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,560
I mean from your fucking email. I
can't really judge it, but like I said,

866
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,660
what have do whatever you want
to do, but don't, don't go.

867
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,780
Don't start drinking again
because everybody else's,

868
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,240
I guess that that would be my advice.
Um,

869
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:18,500
okay.

870
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:18,991
All right.
Let me,

871
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:21,600
let me read the last of the
advertising here then I'll wrap it up.

872
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,280
Some other questions here. Uh,
all right. Legal, everyone. Uh,

873
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:28,050
most Americans don't have a will,

874
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,740
but why you don't want the court
dictating what you just pointed at me.

875
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:34,590
I know I got to do this. I'm
doing this during this break. Uh,

876
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,010
you don't want the court dictating
what happens to your property and minor

877
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,500
children.
So why procrastinate?

878
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:44,490
Most people say too expensive or
too time consuming. My answer.

879
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,840
Legal zoom.com too expensive legal
zoom makes, uh, makes prices.

880
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,180
What legal zoom, legal zoom is. Prices
just makes sense. I swear to God,

881
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:56,400
I'm dyslexic too.
Time consuming.

882

916
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:14,770
Um, oh hey for that kid also who
was talking about not drinking. Um,

917
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:19,160
here's another thing
too, you know, at my age,

918
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,470
I see,

919
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,583
okay,

920
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,920
I see the results of a
abusing your body with booze,

921
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:31,960
drugs, food. People say food is a drug,
which I would actually 100% agree with.

922
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,330
Um, you see the results of it. And um,

923
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,730
unfortunately when I was up in Montreal,

924
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:44,731
I saw a couple of people that are my age
in 10 years older and they either look

925
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,600
the ones that took care of themselves and
kind of quit drinking and tried to eat

926
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:53,830
right and that type of thing.
They look great.

927
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,520
They still got the light in their eye
and then people who've been a, you know,

928
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,410
hitting it hard,
man,

929
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,420
it really catches up with you when
you get to be my age where it's like,

930
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,490
um,
you know,

931
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:10,300
I've been of legal drinking age
longer than I've lived when I wasn't.

932
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:15,070
You know what I mean? That tipping point
of like 42 years of age when you've, uh,

933
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,620
you know, and forget about underage
drinking that you've already been doing,

934
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:22,480
I could really, really catches up with
you. So what you're doing right now,

935
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:26,980
given your body a break when it's as young
as it is, is a phenomenal thing to do.

936
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,400
And, um, you know,

937
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:34,210
you could actually experiment steering
even more into a healthier lifestyle,

938
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:37,690
like learning how to eat a little bit
better because at 22, man, I mean,

939
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:42,520
you can fucking drink a 12 pack and eat
McDonald's late at night and wake up the

940
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,930
next day with a flat stomach. But
like, you're setting yourself up for a,

941
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,663
you know,

942
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,360
just basically being a human being is
no different than being an athlete.

943
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:55,690
It's just the timeline timeline
is stretched out a lot longer.

944
00:57:55,691 --> 00:58:00,550
Like father time is going to get
all of us. But, um, you know,

945
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,790
those athletes who throughout their
career, early in their career,

946
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,750
took care of themselves,

947
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:08,950
have longer careers and if you'd like
to have a longer career, in other words,

948
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:12,370
a longer life, like doing what you're
doing is a great thing. So, uh,

949
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,260
I don't know, when you look at it that
way, there's really no peer pressures.

950
00:58:16,261 --> 00:58:20,950
They're really peer pressure to,
to die sooner. Um, all right. Nia,

951
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:24,650
do you want to chime in on one of these?
Um,

952
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,710
you want to do dead?
Nancy did Nancy Dead Nazi GRANDPA,

953
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:35,170
can I say Nancy? You know hard.
They're laughing in England right now.

954
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,160
Fucking Nancy boy, uh,
breaking up for college.

955
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,430
Which one do you want it?
Do you want to do that?

956
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:48,010
You want to stay in your wheelhouse?
I'll come over here.

957
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,600
Who is short shorts.
All right.

958
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:56,770
That's really good about quitting
drinking. I'm not drinking this week.

959
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:01,540
Come a little closer. I'm not
drinking this week. I said okay.

960
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:05,620
That's a good idea. It is a good
idea. All right, here we go.

961
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:09,630
Breaking up for college.
Uh Oh yeah, look at that.

962
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,810
What is this? This is, this is, she just
picked up my hotel key for this weekend.

963
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:16,450
That's the w hotels that,

964
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,840
that's how they advertise their spa and
there's a girl on it wearing a bikini

965
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,780
sitting on luggage and
holding like a hatbox,

966
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:32,090
so fit Avec Avec Tara stiles.
Is she like a trainer there?

967
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,090
There's literally a picture of like
a half naked woman on your room. Key.

968
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,580
Yeah. I mean I said that a long
time ago. I did the w hotel.

969
00:59:39,581 --> 00:59:44,120
Everything looks like it's been just on.
No,

970
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,500
they have all they have of that hung
over lighting and all of that type of,

971
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:52,240
see you're making a mistake. Lamps,
you know, very sexy. Now it's Hacky,

972
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:54,890
sexy, that aquarium lighting
that they have in all of it. I,

973
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,410
I've decided I'm done with them. I'm
done with them. I like those older stuff.

974
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,600
Your places with the good breakfast
bar. What? Some holiday sauce.

975
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,630
I say holidays, holidays,
Hollandaise, Hollandaise.

976
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,360
Yeah. Many times I've read that and
I still can't retain it. All right.

977
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:11,890
Breaking up for college.
Dear bill,

978
01:00:11,891 --> 01:00:15,160
my girlfriend and I had been dating
for awhile throughout high school.

979
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,800
It's pretty much the relationship
I've always dreamt of.

980
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,770
Never really getting tired of each other,
no fighting,

981
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:23,980
similar views and tastes
a healthy amount of sex.

982
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:29,410
Sounds like a recipe and a healthy scope
as sex. Very supportive of each other.

983
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:32,650
However, we both graduated high
school and are going off to college.

984
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,680
She's going to a liberal arts school in
Philly while I'm staying in the state,

985
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,830
uh, to go to northern Arizona
University. We both agree that would be,

986
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:45,430
it wouldn't be healthy to try and
maintain a long distance relationship.

987
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:49,090
So we're spending these last few weeks
of the summer together and we'll break it

988
01:00:49,091 --> 01:00:52,990
off when she leaves for Philly.
Oh Wow. Man, that sounds sad. Um,

989
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:54,690
I could sure.

990
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:59,010
High School, this is a person who
just graduated from high school. Yeah.

991
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,180
And they're talking about,

992
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:04,080
it's pretty much the relationship
I've always dreamt of since when?

993
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:08,010
Since you were five. Yeah. I mean,
no, it's, no, it's really nice,

994
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:11,400
but it's like how, how is someone
who's graduated from high school?

995
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,620
Like I'm in the relationship.
I've always dreamed of.

996
01:01:13,621 --> 01:01:18,621
Like I didn't know that high school people
dreamt of relationships in a way that

997
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,200
they really understood.

998
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,980
Maybe this person does see.

999
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:27,320
One of the things when you
do these questions is it's
very easy to superimposed

1000
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,560
where your head was at it,

1001
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,800
but it's literally reads like somebody
who's like a 30 year old. It's like,

1002
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:33,910
it's what I've always wanted.

1003
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:36,640
There's like a healthy amount of sex
and we don't get tired of each other.

1004
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:40,630
It's like this is the highest visit.
Someone who just graduated. You know what?

1005
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:43,690
Actually see your point. They do
sound like they're 35 it's like, whoa.

1006
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:47,740
When did you dream of having
this great relationship? All
right, well let's, let's,

1007
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:52,360
let's, let's continue. Let's see what we
got here. I could very well symbol shit.

1008
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:55,750
Oh, you think this is a bullshit?
Well, I dunno. It sounds
nice. I'm sorry. Let's let,

1009
01:01:55,751 --> 01:01:58,600
let's continue. I should, well,
I'm very gullible. You can get me.

1010
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,660
I could very well see myself spending
the rest of my life with this girl.

1011
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:04,170
But at the same times,
four years is a lot of time.

1012
01:02:04,171 --> 01:02:05,740
I'm Matzoh fucking marriage right there.

1013
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:09,310
Everybody has that one couple that wins
best couple and then they got together

1014
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:11,920
the freshman, sophomore year and they
just didn't know how to break up.

1015
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,560
So then they continue on and continue on,
you know,

1016
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:18,370
and then you see him at the
10 year reunion. Yeah, we
broke it off when last week.

1017
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,470
Get on with their life.
Um,

1018
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,500
I could very well see myself spending
the rest of my life with this girl,

1019
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:26,490
but at the same time,

1020
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:30,240
four years is a lot of time and
a lot can change in that time.

1021
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,280
So I don't expect us,

1022
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:36,840
I don't expect for us to hook up
again the second we graduate. However,

1023
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,500
she's come to be one of my closest
friends and I'd like to maintain that

1024
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:42,750
friendship and she agrees.

1025
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,960
I want to watch her life unfold and watch
her inevitable inevitable success come

1026
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:50,880
alive. Yeah. These very mature people,

1027
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:53,160
whether we're romantically
involved or not.

1028
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,160
While this will be a bit of a
damper on the beginning of college.

1029
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:57,450
I know I'm going to have a blast.

1030
01:02:57,451 --> 01:02:59,580
My roommate is one of my best
friends from high school.

1031
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:03,420
He knows how to deal with me and he'll
kick my ass to get back in shape if I

1032
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:07,470
start getting mopey about this girl.
Uh, what's your take on the situation?

1033
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:11,900
Any words of advice or
encouragement? Thanks in advance? Um,

1034
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,510
all right. I would say, uh,

1035
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,420
when you break up with somebody,

1036
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:22,700
my thing has always been
when you break up with them,

1037
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:27,701
you got to get away from him because as
much as you have this mutual agreement

1038
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:29,181
or something like that,

1039
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:34,181
one of you is going to meet somebody first
and then it's just going to be rather

1040
01:03:36,141 --> 01:03:39,860
than enjoying, oh, I met somebody
and seeing how that goes,

1041
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,890
you're going to have to deal with the
fact that you're dragging somebody else

1042
01:03:42,891 --> 01:03:45,800
through it and they'll hear it in your
voice. You know, what are you doing?

1043
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:50,600
Nothing. Is there somebody over there
they're going to figure it out. And,

1044
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:54,110
uh, if she finds out before you, you know,

1045
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,280
find someone before you and yeah, yeah,
yeah. Again, you can try to get a back.

1046
01:03:58,281 --> 01:03:59,390
I mean, I think, I think,

1047
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:05,380
I think you guys suggest go cold Turkey
until you have your Thanksgiving break.

1048
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,970
Personally. Maybe an email here, email
there. Uh, but I think you guys should,

1049
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,030
you know, if you're going to break
up, you got to break up. I think

1050
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:18,050
I'm Neil,
I'm actually sure I'm,

1051
01:04:18,051 --> 01:04:22,100
I'm still trying to understand exactly
what the question is because honestly it

1052
01:04:22,101 --> 01:04:24,020
sounds like from this email,

1053
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,730
it sounds like you've got it figured
out perfectly to me. Cause we see,

1054
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:32,060
we both agreed that it wouldn't be
healthy to try to maintain a long distance

1055
01:04:32,061 --> 01:04:36,620
relationship. So we're spending these last
few weeks of summer together. Uh, yeah.

1056
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,091
I mean,

1057
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:41,640
you're not going to be the only person
in college and Freshman Year of college

1058
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:46,340
she was left their boyfriend or girlfriend
behind. That's a pretty normal thing.

1059
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:51,290
So yeah, spend your summer together.
It's, it sounds like a movie actually.

1060
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,400
You know, I've spent the summer together
and then you both go off and yeah,

1061
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:59,520
thanksgiving break they'll probably see
each other and whatnot. But I mean I,

1062
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,190
I honestly wouldn't put too much

1063
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:06,350
pressure on either one of you to try to,

1064
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,240
it sounds like you're both really amazing,
lovely people and that's really nice.

1065
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:11,841
But yes,

1066
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:16,010
you are going to meet other people in
college and the fact that you're being

1067
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:19,780
really realistic about it
is, um, if you were to guess,

1068
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,830
I don't really have much to say
about the guests so mature. I can,

1069
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,270
that's why I'm sort of like

1070
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,890
stuck. All right. You want
to go to dead Nancy? GRANDPA

1071
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:34,100
Nazi. All right. So yeah, I
can hear you guys seem you got,

1072
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:34,920
you got to figure it out.

1073
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,200
Yeah, I don't really, there's
not really much else to say.

1074
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,320
Well what about me? My, my
advice, what I'm saying he should,

1075
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:40,680
he shouldn't stay in contact with her.

1076
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:44,930
I don't, I don't think that
that's possible. I mean,

1077
01:05:44,931 --> 01:05:47,780
I don't think you should try
to continue a relationship.

1078
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:49,280
Like let's try to like make it work.

1079
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,530
You guys have already said
it's going to be too hard,

1080
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,600
but to be friends and things,

1081
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,200
I made it. Part of her blossoming will be
her blowing somebody else's. Some point,

1082
01:05:57,201 --> 01:05:59,600
I don't want to be crass,
but I don't think you want to see grass,

1083
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:00,800
but you just talked about,
well,

1084
01:06:00,801 --> 01:06:03,320
you don't want to see those things
like blowing somebody. Listen,

1085
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:06,950
there's a lot of colors in a sunset. Okay.
There's a lot of colors in the sunset.

1086
01:06:06,951 --> 01:06:07,820
You don't need to see

1087
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,640
blossoming coloring of this.

1088
01:06:09,641 --> 01:06:13,780
Let's say you're really trying to make it
or sunrise, sunrise blossoming, sunsets,

1089
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:15,560
the end. No, I think they, if,

1090
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,250
if they're going to be
friends that they're going to
take, they're going to tax,

1091
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:19,420
they're gonna email.

1092
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:22,570
They're going to see each other's social
media activity like it's impossible not

1093
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:24,550
to and someone may get jealous.

1094
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:27,850
It's not impossible not to. You just
don't look at it. You cut it up.

1095
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,490
Sound like he wants to cut it out because
they really enjoy each other. I don't,

1096
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,270
I don't know.

1097
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:36,210
Doing, I'm doing the exact
thing that I told you not to do.

1098
01:06:36,211 --> 01:06:39,630
I'm super imposing my thoughts.
The shift if we were to,

1099
01:06:39,631 --> 01:06:43,190
God forbid if we were to
break up or whatever, you,

1100
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:47,940
you would never want to like
text me or like talks to me.

1101
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:51,150
You just be like, no, of course, of
course I would, but like I, I wouldn't,

1102
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:56,250
I wouldn't be involved in it because
I know I know where that's going.

1103
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:57,880
I,
yeah,

1104
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,510
yeah, yeah. I don't, but I don't
think they should go cold Turkey.

1105
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,830
Yeah. You'd meet some guy
like some guy named Roger,

1106
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:10,790
Roger Roy and those are guys. Rick. Oh,

1107
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:15,620
he's got a car. He's
awesome. Um, all right.

1108
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,020
Dead Nazi grandpa dear Billy blowhard.
Uh,

1109
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:21,750
there's been a strong,

1110
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:25,220
a story going around in the news here
and other Philly story here in Philly for

1111
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:27,770
the past few weeks that I
want to hear your opinion on.

1112
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,800
I'm writing because I know you
were a big World War II guy.

1113
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:33,540
I was for like two months when I was
reading and then I fucking gotten,

1114
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,310
I know enough now I'm into fucking keen
Wa and then you became obsessed with

1115
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:38,930
something else.
That's what bill does.

1116
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:42,290
He gets really into something
and he's like obsessive about it.

1117
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,930
And then he moves onto the next thing,
which is why I'm a comedian.

1118
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:45,930
Why can't write scripts?

1119
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:48,980
Because my mind works in bits to take a
little of information and then I go, Ooh,

1120
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,060
there's a spider on the wall.

1121
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,141
The thing is,

1122
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:54,860
is that I gave you a hard time about
that all the time and I'm very similar to

1123
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:56,780
that finally.

1124
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,900
Okay. And following this.
Okay, I know you're big world.

1125
01:08:00,901 --> 01:08:05,820
Go to God and fall and following this is
weirdly made me feel sympathy for an ex

1126
01:08:05,821 --> 01:08:09,360
Nazi. So He's been following this story
and he feels sympathy for an ex Nazi.

1127
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,010
He says.
Long story short,

1128
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,280
there was an 89 year old man who had
served as a guard in switch when he was 17

1129
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:18,830
his mother was born in the United States.

1130
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:21,890
So after the war he moved
to the Philadelphia area.

1131
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:25,550
He lived here under his original name.
Um,

1132
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:29,930
and this is June,
I guess until June,

1133
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:34,010
2013 there was a word missing there when
a Bavarian town passed a law allowing x

1134
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:37,700
Nazis to be ex communicated
to Germany to face trial.

1135
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:42,590
He was eventually arrested and charged
with the 158 counts of accessory to

1136
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:44,810
murder.
There was a big argument about it.

1137
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:47,720
The guy just died in US prison this week.

1138
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,210
I got into an argument about this today.

1139
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,100
Is it fucked up for this
guy to get arrested 70 years
later for something he did

1140
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:58,400
as a teenager? Even if he is
the biggest content, the planet.

1141
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,760
I think the Philly cops have other shit
to worry about that movie apt pupil.

1142
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:07,190
That sounds like APP people. Do
you remember that movie? Yeah.

1143
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:09,890
Except this guy was a,
he wasn't,

1144
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:15,260
he was in a guard tower where that
other guy was like a Rudolf Hess.

1145
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,030
More type of guy.
Um,

1146
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:22,070
I don't think it's fucked up for you to
get arrested for something that you did

1147
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:27,490
in your teenage years, but like 158 but
this is the thing, he's a 17. This is the,

1148
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:30,290
if, if he can't, if he came at
it like this and saying, listen,

1149
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:33,950
this guy was a teenager,
all right,

1150
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,330
when this madman took over his country,
he doesn't have a choice.

1151
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,340
He has to join the fucking army. Um,
and everybody's like, well, you know,

1152
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:45,920
you could say, no, I'm not
doing it. And then it's like,

1153
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:50,270
then you get your brains blown out.
You can't just go, well fuck it.

1154
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:53,490
I'm Outta here. It's 17. Where
are you going to go? The,

1155
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,970
not only is your country
completely at war,

1156
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:58,790
the entire continent is it war?

1157
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:03,791
And I think it's very easy to not be 17
in the middle of fucking World War Two.

1158
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,070
And for you to sit there and go and like,
you know what I would've done,

1159
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,880
I would've been an angel and I would've
done this, this, this and this and this.

1160
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:14,690
And it's just like,
like I can have empathy

1161
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:20,050
for the situation that he
was put into, but, um, it's,

1162
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:24,500
it's one of those things where it's,
I mean,

1163
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,510
what happened there? I mean, they're
prosecuting people. I mean, I dunno.

1164
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:33,020
Do you think that the 17 year old kid,
I mean he's a fucking kid.

1165
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:38,210
I the person or the people that would
be very concerned about having this

1166
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:39,680
person,
the rest it would be like,

1167
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,920
all right.

1168
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:54,070
You know what's hilarious is that me and
Nia just talked about this subject for

1169
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:56,720
like fucking 15 minutes

1170
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:02,120
and came to this great place as to
why you have to arrest this guy.

1171
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:06,940
And the fucking batteries
wore out. God dammit. I know.

1172
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:11,030
I told you, I told you this is just
not a, this just ain't my fucking day.

1173
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:16,740
Um, so all I can do is paraphrase. Oh God,

1174
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:21,550
what a fucking buzzkill
is basically Kyle, what,

1175
01:11:21,551 --> 01:11:22,630
what I left off saying,

1176
01:11:22,631 --> 01:11:26,770
it's like he got to prosecute him
because he was part of a war crime.

1177
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:31,450
So you have to prosecute
him. But I, you know,

1178
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:36,510
I was basically making the point that
if this kid in Philly who I don't agree

1179
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:40,390
with the way he seems to be defending him,
I'm defending them the way I am.

1180
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:45,420
I'm defending that 17 year old
kid in this way that everybody,

1181
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,730
if he was to walk into it, if you,
anybody that was to wa, you know,

1182
01:11:49,731 --> 01:11:53,530
you guys were to walk into a bar and
you were to bring that up and you'd ask

1183
01:11:53,531 --> 01:11:57,190
people what they would do,
what they would've done in that situation.

1184
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,850
Everybody's going to be captain America.
Everyone's gonna be like,

1185
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,640
Dude, you know what?
I will die. I will go.

1186
01:12:01,641 --> 01:12:05,840
I would have fucking shot here the wound
phase and now we're done. We're done.

1187
01:12:05,841 --> 01:12:06,370
Then

1188
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:10,510
type of shit. And it's
just like, you know, any,

1189
01:12:10,511 --> 01:12:14,620
it's very easy to be fucking sitting in
a bar drinking a fucking rolling rock

1190
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:20,110
and a paint yourself out to
be this unbelievable hero
and all this shit that you

1191
01:12:20,111 --> 01:12:21,430
would have done.
But like a,

1192
01:12:21,431 --> 01:12:25,750
I think unfortunately this kid was
born at the wrong fucking time.

1193
01:12:25,751 --> 01:12:28,690
I don't think that, like I, I mean,
I really don't think that this,

1194
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,810
this kid wouldn't, you know, he wouldn't,

1195
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:36,100
do you think that this kid was just an
evil kid and he was like psyched to be up

1196
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:39,520
in that guard tower or is he just, I
mean, who knows? Like I'm, I'm not,

1197
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:42,430
and I'm not saying that, I'm not
saying that. I don't really know that.

1198
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:45,940
I don't really think that it matters,
which was my point.

1199
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:49,960
I feel like this person's sympathy is
misplaced. I'm not talking about him.

1200
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:53,290
I'm talking about me now. Oh, it's
about, you know, I'm talking about,

1201
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:57,760
I'm talking about my opinion,
which is what that you can't,

1202
01:12:57,761 --> 01:13:01,450
because he was 17 years old.
Chances are he wasn't,

1203
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:05,560
he didn't want to do it
and he was asked to do it.

1204
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,620
I'm saying it's 17 you're
very impressionable.

1205
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:13,690
You can get talk that you can get
brain like a 30 30 35 year old person,

1206
01:13:13,691 --> 01:13:16,990
45 year old, 55 year old person. You know,

1207
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:22,210
at that point you, you, you're,
you know, so much more about life.

1208
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:27,610
Like people can't come up to you and
tell you like it's very hard, much,

1209
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,680
very harder for,

1210
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:32,140
for a much more difficult for somebody
to come up to you and try to convince you

1211
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,550
with something that you know isn't true,

1212
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:37,660
that you know is not and you can
spot crazy from a fucking mile away.

1213
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,460
But what I was talking about,

1214
01:13:39,461 --> 01:13:43,240
which of course got lost was what usually,

1215
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:48,241
I don't know what it is about people
who are smart and people who are like,

1216
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:52,810
hey live and let live there
because of that intellect.

1217
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,320
They're also not,

1218
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,730
they don't choose violence
and unfortunately that's,

1219
01:14:00,731 --> 01:14:02,800
you need to fight fire
with fire with the like,

1220
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:06,160
well violence doesn't solve anything.
It's like violence would have solved this.

1221
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:07,810
Like when you were dealing with,

1222
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:12,811
when they were first starting to take
over and people would choosing self

1223
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:17,950
preservation rather than helping out
their neighbors is what they should have

1224
01:14:17,951 --> 01:14:22,360
gone out is they should have
gone out and like, I mean like,

1225
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:25,180
and this is once again I'm
doing this woulda Coulda,
Shoulda Shit. Like, oh dude,

1226
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:26,014
you know what I would've done?

1227
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,920
You should have gone out there or you
should organize the people on your block.

1228
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:34,330
You know, when you, if you had a Jewish
family on your block going like, look,

1229
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:37,150
we're all down with, well these are
our friends. They're not taking them.

1230
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:41,770
And if they come down here, you
know, we're fucking taking them out.

1231
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:42,730
And if,

1232
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:46,180
and if you started that movement and
you started taking them out before they

1233
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:50,110
took everybody else out,
you could actually stop it.

1234
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:53,560
But the thing is,
is decent people,

1235
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:57,040
regular people live and let live
people are essentially not organized.

1236
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,760
And that's the only advantage that
they had was they were walking around,

1237
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:03,760
they were organized.

1238
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:09,700
And then I think that people
choose the cowardly, uh,

1239
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,560
decision of self preservation.

1240
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:17,380
But I don't think self preservation
is cowardly. At 17, I think 17 I mean,

1241
01:15:17,381 --> 01:15:21,310
you were a boy. You're not, it's like
that Brittany Spears, not quite a woman.

1242
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,280
You're not quite a man there near.
And all of a sudden this,

1243
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:29,020
this fucking event comes along and
you get swept up into it. So, look,

1244
01:15:29,021 --> 01:15:30,790
if this guy was, let me,
this is what I'd say,

1245
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:34,450
if this guy was 30 and he was in a
guard tower, fuck him. All right.

1246
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:39,460
If you're 17 and a guard tower, you still
got to prosecute them. But like, I'm,

1247
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,230
it's like I'm going to sit there
and be like, dude, you know what?

1248
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:45,520
I would've gone to 17 when the
entire continent was at war.

1249
01:15:45,521 --> 01:15:48,940
I would have fucking walked to Africa
and just left it behind. Like, I mean,

1250
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,170
I don't know what this kid,
yeah.

1251
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,213
Uh,

1252
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:56,180
I mean his, his option
was basically, uh, he,

1253
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,260
he had to take a bullet in
his own head or go up there.

1254
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,720
Yeah. I Dunno. I Dunno.
I'm out on this one.

1255
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:10,710
I think I'm out. I mean, I
just don't feel like, I dunno,

1256
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:15,760
I don't have anything really to contribute
anymore to that question other than

1257
01:16:16,011 --> 01:16:20,480
what I just said about there's
sympathy beam is placed. Yeah.

1258
01:16:20,481 --> 01:16:23,750
I can't seem to have a conversation
with you about what I'm saying.

1259
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:26,540
You just keep going back to this kid.
I'm not saying that this kit,

1260
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:28,390
I'm saying what I'm saying and I'm,
I'm,

1261
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:32,330
I'm actually talking about how a fucking
lunatic, like Hitler comes into power.

1262
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,340
He doesn't come into power
because he makes sense.

1263
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:38,780
He comes into power because all these
other people that don't think he makes

1264
01:16:38,781 --> 01:16:39,614
sense.

1265
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,740
Okay.

1266
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:45,270
They choose self preservation.
Right. Okay. He's not going
after me. I'm Protestant.

1267
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:47,310
It's not going to have to me. I'm
Catholic, he's not going off to me,

1268
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:51,660
I'm straight and you and you end the fear
of watching your neighbors who he had

1269
01:16:51,661 --> 01:16:55,350
a fucking cookout with and you hear them
screaming as they're getting dragged

1270
01:16:55,351 --> 01:16:56,370
out of the house and you know,

1271
01:16:56,371 --> 01:17:00,090
you should be doing something but
you don't because of your own self

1272
01:17:00,091 --> 01:17:03,450
preservation. I think it's very easy for
people to hear this story and be like,

1273
01:17:03,451 --> 01:17:06,120
oh, the fucking nuts, you piece of
shit and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1274
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:10,940
This people as adults would choose self
preservation who would criticize what

1275
01:17:10,941 --> 01:17:15,830
this kid did when he was 17 that's my
point. My point is not that, that, uh,

1276
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:17,523
mmm

1277
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:21,120
that this is wrong, that
they're prosecuting. It's, it's,

1278
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:25,730
but I also don't look at this dude who
when he was 17 who ended up in that,

1279
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:29,610
that situation, like this was
somebody who was, was okay,

1280
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:36,370
like clearly making decisions in his life
or even had control over the direction

1281
01:17:36,371 --> 01:17:37,090
of his life.
I mean,

1282
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:40,270
there's a reason why you can't drink
till you're 21 it's because the level of

1283
01:17:40,271 --> 01:17:41,960
immaturity you have.
You think this kid can,

1284
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,520
we had 17 has the fucking maturity
to be able to handle what's going on,

1285
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:48,670
walking down the street and seeing
people hanging from, you know,

1286
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,160
by piano wire and that type
of thing. I mean, it's, it's,

1287
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,930
it's just another ruined life because of,

1288
01:17:54,931 --> 01:17:56,920
of this fucking psycho.

1289
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:58,410
Okay.

1290
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:01,920
Could you agree with that? Yeah, I
could see that for sure. All right.

1291
01:18:01,921 --> 01:18:04,830
This is way too heavy a fucking topic
to be discussed in here. So that's,

1292
01:18:04,831 --> 01:18:07,830
that's basically the gist of what it is.
Maybe it's this,

1293
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,780
maybe it's just too early.
It's too heavy. I Dunno.

1294
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:14,520
Maybe I'm still asleep and
I can't quite get into it.

1295
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:19,550
How much after what meal during the day
can you discuss a forming former guard

1296
01:18:19,681 --> 01:18:24,180
tower, a Nazi guard tower,
kids after lunch conversation,

1297
01:18:24,181 --> 01:18:28,470
I think. Okay. All right. Well
that's the podcast for this week.

1298
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:30,840
Jesus Christ, the levels just
went up. Sorry about that.

1299
01:18:30,841 --> 01:18:33,090
That's a podcast for this week.

1300

1302
