asking the wrong person. I know.

27
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm asking the wrong person.
I'm recording this on March 1st.

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,540
A very special guest on the podcast.
We've had two in a row,

29
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,830
two special guests in a row,

30
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:49,400
which means my podcast continues to get
more and more special as that dropped

31
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,050
the fucking recorder.
Uh,

32
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:55,260
we have the great Al Jourgensen
from ministry right here. Uh,

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,950
he's got a new album coming out and uh,

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,040
for whatever reason he wanted to come
on my stupid podcast to promote it.

35
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,810
One of the legends of
a really less 30 years.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,120
Basically, you invented an entirely
new kind of music, right? You will,

37
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,680
you were credited with coming up with a,
what they call an industrial,

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,540
something like something like that.

39
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,470
I just think it was probably a
bad strain of acid in the 90s

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,990
well, you getting credit all the way back
into the 80s though, are you? Well, yeah,

41
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:28,040
that was the good strain of acid. The
nineties kind of went down hill. But uh,

42
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,620
what is, what is the golden
age of acid, would you say?
Oh, the 60s definitely when,

43
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,480
when they finally figured out the,
uh,

44
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,460
the DMT compounds that we're an organic
plants and we're able to make it

45
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:44,570
chemically that was the golden age because
it was pure and it before it hit the

46
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:48,260
streets and they cut it with strict
nine and baby aspirin and whatever else.

47
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:51,740
Right. They were cutting, I mean, I
lived with Timothy leary for two years.

48
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:56,230
How to here in Jesus Christ and
you survived, uh, not only that,

49
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:56,931
to survive,

50
00:02:56,931 --> 00:03:00,860
I can't wait for the book to
come out because what would
do is he would just, uh,

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,150
have me inject like psychedelic compounds
that were sent to them by universities

52
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:12,070
around the world and then he'd
take notes on me as the Guinea pig.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,250
As University's code for the CIA
or was it actual like university

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,830
while Alex Jones. Fuck it.
So wait, so how did it,

55
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,610
how her, well, how do you meet a
guy and how does he bring up, hey,

56
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,820
you want to live with me for a while
and while you don't have to pay rent,

57
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,930
I'm just going to occasionally
inject you with, uh,

58
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,650
some acid I got through the mail that's
allegedly from a university. Well,

59
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,880
the story of o wound up
with Tim is actually better
than me being with Tim as I

60
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:47,410
met Tim through William Burroughs,
uh, which was in Jesus Christ.

61
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,530
Story on how I met William Burroughs.
And we did a video.

62
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,850
We played wide receiver for the Houston
Oilers at, I was Ken Burns. Ken.

63
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,350
I know he's, he's one of the
beat writers that I never read.

64
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:03,640
Did he write naked lunch? Uh, yeah,
he wrote naked dead. Yes ma'am.

65
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,130
Um, amongst other things, uh,
Nova Express. Um, yeah, the,

66
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:12,280
the guy is a genius and we wound
up working with them because, uh,

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,710
basically because we sampled,
uh,

68
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,470
some of his spoken word and
a Warner brothers wouldn't
release our record at the

69
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:24,130
time was a psalm 69,
I believe them so early nineties,

70
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,390
and they wouldn't release
it. And they said, well, we
can't get clearance for this.

71
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,140
And so it was a little blurb and random
notes and rolling stone that said

72
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:36,370
ministry, I'll postponed for another
year until they can figure this out.

73
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,030
And then the boroughs, people
called me and said, nobody asked us,

74
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:44,110
we'd be happy to give you the shit
man. Oh Wow. You know, uh, hey,

75
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,360
when do you want to work?
You want to do some other stuff?

76
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,560
They were all happy about it.

77
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,930
So then I wound up hanging
out with bill and Kansas.

78
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,640
When did the album come out then?
So they didn't have to shelve it for you?

79
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,460
It's like shelf for about three months,

80
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,950
but it wasn't like the year that
there were saying and all this.

81
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,840
And then we got clearance and then,
uh,

82
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,841
William Bill Burroughs introduced me to
Timothy leary during that lollapalooza

83
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,650
toward, and then out to the
Lollapalooza tour was done. Uh,

84
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:12,670
I was kind of sick of rock music, so I
just wanted to take a year or two off,

85
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,230
um, because it was just, it was just
really gross. It was just, you know,

86
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:21,520
all the after parties and all this stuff.
It just, it just gets old after a while.

87
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,250
So it wasn't the music that was
happening at the time, it was just,

88
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,880
you were burned out from all the
partying and all that, everything.

89
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,890
So I moved in with the psychedelic master
of all time to get my head together,

90
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,930
which is not a good, I was
trying to picture how this, this,

91
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:40,120
this was going to work.
Like I was sick of the partying,

92
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:44,770
so I moved in with Timothy Leary so you
could experiment on me with like acid

93
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:47,560
and shit. All right. You know,
you know who owns the, uh,

94
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,940
the notes that he took a
on all of my trips. Uh,

95
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,610
because this was a weekly thing
so you can fucking tripping in.

96
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,860
This guy says looking at you taking notes
in the corner. I never, yeah, it was a,

97
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,340
it was dropped acid. Is that how you
could say oh no, no, no. I injected it.

98
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,390
Oh sorry. Like a fucking lab
rat. Okay. He, while Jack did,

99
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,370
cause he knew I was a junkie at the time.

100
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,760
I haven't done drugs in 15 years by
the way, except for psychedelics.

101
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:15,230
I haven't done heroin and coke and all
that crap. And why, why psychedelics?

102
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,880
Uh, it's a cheap and easy Uber way to, uh,

103
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,970
to get to what people would call
enlightenment as opposed to like doing it

104
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:29,890
through yoga and stretching meditation.

105
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,690
And that just takes too long.
This just cuts to the quick,

106
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,420
and you're right there where all the PD,
no,

107
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,290
that's why I don't like weed versus
alcohol. I feel like alcohol, you earn it,

108
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:43,160
you know, you got to get it down the
hatch. You make the face and like we,

109
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,450
especially the shit they got now,

110
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:47,300
it's like you'd take two or three tokes
and then you sit down and it's like

111
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:50,590
you're borderline trip. And I just don't
feel like I earned it. I feel like it,

112
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,880
I feel like a trust fund
kid while I say this. Uh,

113
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:57,170
I mean as far as like textiles in the
modern age or if this is cutting in and

114
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:00,830
out, this is my shitty thing. I, I can't
move too much. All right. Sorry. It,

115
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,140
it's one of the few things that,
uh,

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,200
have actually improved over these
recent years is the quality of pot and

117
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,250
obviously the quality of electronics,

118
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:14,330
thanks to like stolen alien technology
or whatever the fuck we got going. Right.

119
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,810
Um, yeah, the quality of Pod has
improved to the point to where, um,

120
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,990
it's almost like a,

121
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,270
you used to really get stoked for like
a weekend of mushrooms and now it's just

122
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,490
like you smoke pot every day and it's
just like the weekend a mushrooms just

123
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:33,170
like, it's Kinda the same thing. Yeah.
The pots improved, especially really here.

124
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,620
I've never taken mushrooms either.
I know that any of the hallucinate,

125
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,570
let's stuff this weekend. Well
you're going to Vancouver show. Yeah,

126
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:44,170
I'm going to go job with some showrooms.
You could go to the back then.

127
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,050
I don't know if I want to do
that. Uh, I, I think I basically,

128
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,210
I think it's just my headphones
and it keeps cutting in and out,

129
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:53,510
but I'm watching the little bubbles here
and they keep going up like I'm talking,

130
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:58,010
so we seem good. Yeah. Okay,
cool. Um, well you know what,

131
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,460
there's a lot of people out there like
myself that have never tried any of this

132
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:05,630
shit. So what, what is it like to be on,
on mushrooms? I'm never going to do it.

133
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,220
Maybe when I get like my kid grows
up and goes out of the house, you'll,

134
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,720
you'll do it. No, no, no, no. I
don't want to do it in a hacky way.

135
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:14,930
Like go to fucking Josh Joshua
tree and be like, hey man,

136
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,900
like look at the rock for me show.
No, no, don't, don't do that.

137
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,550
But I want to go to best buy and
get like last night freaking out,

138
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,490
looking at the screen,
you need to be a veteran at that point.

139
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:30,491
You don't go into a mall
with like fluorescent lights
or a shop like home depot

140
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:34,000
or Lowe's unless you're an
experienced tripper. Okay.

141
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,960
That's when incidents happen.

142
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,860
So if you go in there and
you've done this a few times,

143
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,980
you find yourself smirking
at the absurdity of places
like Lowe's or home depot,

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
strip malls.
There's things like this.

145
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:53,200
But if you go in there first time
and do that as your first name, uh,

146
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,660
don't call me for bail because
I could always shovels, man,

147
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,460
start freaking and they're
going to dig my grave.

148
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,720
Now the first time I actually,
uh,

149
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,350
I think actually was tripping a little
bit was I ingested weed and then went to

150
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,540
the airport to board in an
international flight night,

151
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,470
two and a half a pot brownies.
And I was just,

152
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,410
I too much. Yeah, it was way too much.

153
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,830
And I know I did some sort of brain damage
and I just never fucked with it again.

154
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,200
And I just, it felt like I had, you know,

155
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,750
like I told the story on Opie and
Anthony Long time ago, you know,

156
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,580
like when your foot
falls asleep really bad,

157
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,590
it felt like that was a ball of that,
like just sitting on my head like a,

158
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,070
you know, those, those, those things you
use in the shower, those big puffy things.

159
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,700
It felt like there was like that size
of it just sitting right on the crown on

160
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:40,020
my head.
And I was like,

161
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:45,021
we'd hung over for like two days cause
I went to Costa Rica and I got off and I

162
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,310
thought it was going to get arrested.
All those things.

163
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,810
It was like midnight express and all
that shit. But, um, yeah, so I just,

164
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,710
I always like booze cause you
know, I was a corny kid in, in,

165
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,550
in my world it was legal, you know,
like it's not a drug man. It's legal.

166
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,660
It's a simple high too. It's just like,
well I'm a simple guy. Yale. Yeah. Okay.

167
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,560
Sample high and there's a, there's
a, there's a spot for alcohol in,

168
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:12,030
in one's life. I would, I
would assume, but uh, yeah,

169
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,890
it gets a bit more complex
with psychedelics and weed
and shit like this. Um, uh,

170
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:20,070
and, and, and heroin
and at first, you know,

171
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:25,071
is it's really actually it's a psychedelic
at first and then it becomes a day to

172
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:29,550
day drag and routine, which a, you're not
using the drug. That drug is using you,

173
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,580
all these great cliches, blah, blah,
blah, blah. How long does that take?

174
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,180
When is the honeymoon over with heroin?
Oh,

175
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,710
well technically, uh,
looking back on my days,

176
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,990
a couple of decades of doing that,

177
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,600
I would say after the very
first hit, really? Oh No.

178
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,860
And then you spend the next 20 years
trying to recreate that first hit.

179
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,670
Now are you able to like try heroin?
Right? This is so bad for kids listening.

180
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,740
Were you able to try heroin
and walk away from it?

181
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,240
Is can people try it and walk away from
it and just be like, yeah, you know,

182
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:05,310
I did it. I just, yeah, I
think, I think there are,

183
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:09,180
and especially because the first
time you do it generally, uh, it, it,

184
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,830
it consumes the body.

185
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,390
So much that you're just so not
used to this kind of like forced,

186
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,160
uh, almost hyperloop tunnel
into the unknown that a,

187
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:23,220
you throw up,
a lot of people throw up their first time.

188
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:26,340
It's like you can like air sick as
you're teleporting into another reality.

189
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:29,670
Seriously. It's, it's
like that a lot of people,

190
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,880
like I remember the first time I got
drunk, I was like eight years old.

191
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:37,881
My parents had some kind of like sixties
kind of Tiki themed cocktail party for

192
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,930
their mess.
Sounds like drew Barrymore's childhood.

193
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,630
Somebody gives you an eight
ball, right? He turned, Hey,

194
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:48,440
let's get it from an eight ball.
Uh,

195
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,660
fall. Great parents. No, but
like I, I went around and,

196
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:57,280
and emptied all the drinks that people
had left at this Tiki themed party.

197
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:57,761
My parents,

198
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:01,810
I was about eight and I think they're
mainly drinking like some kind of gin

199
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,890
based relations, evil. Oh, it's evil evil.

200
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:10,810
And I drank that and I got so violently
sick that I never wanted to drink liquor

201
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:15,340
again. But here I am. I mean I still drank
liquor. It's the same thing with heroin.

202
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:18,420
It's like their first time you're going
to probably get sick because your body

203
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:19,330
is overwhelmed.

204
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,870
You sorta Halluc I always thought
it just made just super relaxed.

205
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:26,920
Like my only idea of it
wasn't trainspotting when
that guy shot up in the room,

206
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,820
he just fell into the rug and sunk into
the floor, which actually I was like, wow,

207
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,090
that looks amazing.
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

208
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,540
I just can't deal with the side effects.

209
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,920
I mean that scene and get out
where like the, the lady hits the,

210
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,040
the teaspoon on the cup and then floats
down the chair of the black dude. And uh,

211
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,110
I mean you also have trips like that
on heroin. Heroin is actually an opiod.

212
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, Alistair Crowley and even, uh,
Lord Byron from like the 18th century,

213
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:55,990
they used to dabble and uh,
opiates, morphine back then.

214
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,360
And uh, just like, whoa. You know,
and there's bad trips and good trips,

215
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,340
but it is trip.

216
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:07,040
So except that a lot of the times
you're not awake during the Detroit,

217
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,570
so it's more like a
controlled or uncontrolled
dreamscape that you're having.

218
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:17,380
Even more uncontrolled, unusual.
How do your legs feel afterwards?

219
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,890
Like whenever I'm packing the day when
New York was New York and like every,

220
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,760
you know, 10th corner, there would be
a junkie just nodding out on heroin.

221
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,420
I remember Mark Marin uses this hilarious
bit about how they never tip over or

222
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,910
something like that, but I
don't, yeah. And the thing was,

223
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:35,620
but they would be in like doing
like the longest squat ever.

224
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,310
You know what I mean? You know, if
you do like a set of tennis squats,

225
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:43,020
like you're fucking thighs of burdens.
Like how does that feel? That's,

226
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,910
that's what I would think.
I wouldn't think, man, this
guy's fucking his life up.

227
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:50,110
It's minus 30 Audi has no coat on and
he's just standing this slowly going down

228
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:54,850
to the ground. Like how do you leg
slowly, how do you lay eggs? Yeah.

229
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,690
All right. Well, okay. What do they feel
like afterwards? Ask yourself this man.

230
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's say transport yourself to the
Amazon jungle. You've got sloths there,

231
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:04,960
right?

232
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,960
That sit there and hang on this
one branch for like days at a time.

233
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,120
Right. Those things only
poop like once a week. I'm,

234
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,990
I'm thinking about getting one as a pet
so when I go on tour and so I just put a

235
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,290
diaper on him and I come home and I
don't have to clean anything up that just

236
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,810
have a slot hanging out.
He's only moved three feet over.

237
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,930
I love these animals, but it's just
the same thing as being a junkie.

238
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:33,760
You're very much like a sloth. And
I'll say this much for sloths. Uh,

239
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:35,050
you can test them all you want,

240
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:38,620
but they've been around for
over 3 million years now that,

241
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,530
is there a group of people out
there just trashing sloths?

242
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,650
I just like how you said you can do this.
You can talk shit about them all.

243
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,030
You will.
I've seen it.

244
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,350
I've seen it on the inner webs where
like people are like downright bashing

245
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:54,620
sloths. I'm like such a sad world.
Well, well that's capitalism.

246
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:58,700
That's America. It's like we don't like
sloths. We like go getters. You know,

247
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,830
if you count you fat, fuck, I'm
trying to make money off you

248
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,680
as well. That's what, that's what a
sloth is like being a junkie. And yes,

249
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:14,660
you can do superhuman feats of hang on
a tree branch for three days and you can

250
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,410
go into a squat position. You
probably thought like, you know what,

251
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:22,010
you're in an alley. You're high out of
your fucking mind on heroin and you go,

252
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,490
I gotta take a shit and you probably
start the squat and about three days later

253
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,810
you finally finish up
shit. Well, you know what?

254
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:33,740
The one thing that the one good side
effects of heroin seems to be if you

255
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:38,300
survive is you're kind of in shapes
borderline shredded for the rest of your

256
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:39,740
life.
What is that dude?

257
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,580
I every fucking guy that heavy rocks
I've ever seen that they had a 10 year

258
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:47,990
period on heroin. They're like
70. They had like 0% body fat.

259
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,900
They still have ads. It wasn't for
the old skin hanging off of them.

260
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,610
They could model underwear. Man,
you just described me perfect. Yeah.

261
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,460
Going to like it. But uh, no.
I asked William Burroughs,

262
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:02,300
what the fuck is going on around
here? They'll leave blower. Oh Geez.

263
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:05,270
I don't even know who that guy is. So
you should use the leaf blower. He's,

264
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,170
I think he's from Terminator Vibe.
It's probably how he breaks into houses.

265
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,360
That's his thing.
He just walks around with a leaf blower.

266
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,450
William Burroughs at 78 looked like he
did at 18 which at 18 he looked like he

267
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:22,520
was 78 but it never changed.
Right.

268
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,320
It was like this weird pickling and
although how had human attics get that,

269
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,290
they get pickled.
Not only was I on heroin,

270
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:35,090
but of course I was on the
Methadone program for 18
years, invented by the Nazis.

271
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,590
You know another thing to be,

272
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:39,770
you don't have a wrinkle on your face
too hilarious. But all this shit,

273
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm fucking pickle and it's been 15
years since I even touch their shit.

274
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,630
I basically heard your podcast
last week bitching about like, oh,

275
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,870
you're 50 and you're,

276
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,700
let me tell you the next 10 years because
I'm going to be turning 60 this year.

277
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,600
You're in fucked fill now, man. No, I'm
going staying in my fifties no, I don't.

278
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:01,900
I know I'm carrying. How old are you
trying to Olga? Fuck. Oh No. Oh No.

279
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,320
You treat me like a slot right now. Now I
resent it. You're fucked. I mean just uh,

280
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,280
look, I'll get up and I ride
20 miles a day on a stationary.

281
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,350
Tell everybody what you watch when you
do it. Do remember you telling me this,

282
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:16,250
you were last time I talked to the show,

283
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:20,240
the reality show used to watch when
you would owe that 600 pound life.

284
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,100
So you'd sit there and watch and I mean
my wife started watching us. I was like,

285
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,520
Mia you have to shut this off cause I
watch biggest loser then they have are

286
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,430
funny fat they are. But they are funny
fan and the shower scenes, 600 pound life.

287
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,320
As soon as they focus in on a
girl named Kirsten or something,

288
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,950
then the next seven minutes are her
taking off her clothes and getting into a

289
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:50,130
shower. It's literally fat core porn
on TV know. And the thing is they don't

290
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,540
have like,
like with the guys,

291
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:55,710
they don't have to blur out anything
because they're fat covers, right.

292
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,510
It's like they have, they have like
a fucking speedo made out of fat. Oh,

293
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,750
I saw this one guy,
he was like,

294
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,930
can lean up against the wall in the shower
and his stomach hung all the way down

295
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:09,870
to his fucking ankles.
I mean,

296
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,241
yeah.
Oh my God.

297
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:15,120
And then they'd come in and the wife
will come in and she has like, you know,

298
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:16,080
that, that you, you know,

299
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:19,050
the do it yourself car wash where
they got that scrub brushes. They do,

300
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,470
we have one hand is lifting up
a roll of fat and she's just,

301
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,770
and the guys in there like,
ah,

302
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,850
like it's like he's trying to hold up
a refrigerator, but it's something,

303
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,540
it's himself. I love
that show that, and uh,

304
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:35,541
I'll ride every day to either a
600 pound life or body bizarre,

305
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,430
which is, what is that? Oh, that's,

306
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,960
that's things where people
have tails and eight legs,

307
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,180
uh, joined at the hip to head. I was
like, birth defects. Yeah. Allen,

308
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:51,420
what do they call it?
And uh, uh, body bizarre.

309
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,860
You gotta chill. They went to PT Barnum.
They were like, okay, birth defects.

310
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:59,040
I don't feel like people are gonna
Watch it if we call that. Totally. It's,

311
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,310
it's the only thing to ride too.
If you want to do an exercise program,

312
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:05,340
just like watch that
shit and ride and just,

313
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,170
you feel better about like trying to
do something for yourself, you know,

314
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:14,460
it's just like, wow, these people have
really gone to shit. I'm kicking ass.

315
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,370
I would love to hear them brainstorming
for that show a weird bodies now.

316
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,740
Now let's get alliteration going.

317
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,070
Body Bonanza body. Bizarre. Bizarre.

318
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,140
Yeah. I don't, uh, I don't know.

319
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,640
I actually dropped some weight since
last time I saw you. Hey look good.

320
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:35,550
And I'm going to try. I totally
fucking dragged that compliment Nadia.

321
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,330
I laid off the booze for like four months
and now I've been like trying to eat,

322
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,940
uh, staying away from the breads and
all that gluten shit. And I actually,

323
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:45,600
you know, as much as that's a big
Hollywood thing, I feel a lot better.

324
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,820
But every once in a while I'll fucking,
you know,

325
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,140
I'll eat a pizza and it's delicious.
I can never just like totally walk away.

326
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,221
Like,
what?

327
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:56,280
I'm never going to have a pizza again
and I'm not going to eat that stupid

328
00:19:56,281 --> 00:20:00,600
gluten free one. That's like fat Dan. This
gluten free. What is what, what is that?

329
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,400
I mean it's like Vladimir Gluten.

330
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,670
That's all I know is all my friends
are fucking Vladimir Gluten.

331
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,400
Their dictator is on there.
I don't know what it is.

332
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,020
I just know I'm losing weight doing
it and I eat that Ezekiel bread,

333
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,890
which just tastes like ass.
I mean it's really just like,

334
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,310
it's like if you took bread and stuck
it in a microwave and all the nutrients

335
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:24,090
left. Um, but you know, if
you put enough shit on it,

336
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,180
if you put a little almond butter on it,
it does taste good.

337
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:29,250
And I am losing weight.
I don't know,

338
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,300
but I feel like I'm still eating salads
and shit. It's like, remember when people,

339
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,670
people were on like that, that, what
was that diet where it's like, dude,

340
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:39,000
I can eat taken all day as long as I
don't eat this. And it's just like, yeah,

341
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:42,540
the Atkins Diet. Yeah, they had
car. Yeah. No carbs, no cars. Yeah.

342
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,040
It spawned a whole beer
industry of low carb beer. Yes.

343
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,390
Where you like shit out of cow head at
the end of the fucking day. Horns at all.

344
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,020
Yeah. I remember my watching
my friends doing that.

345
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,130
I just remember thinking
like that can't be good.

346
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,550
Like just eating meat all
the fucking time. Like they,

347
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:00,020
they didn't seem like they were eating
salads. They would just sit in there.

348
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:04,460
They we'd like eating bacon and like
Turkey and not saying any of that Shit's

349
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:07,940
bad. Cause who knows at this point there's
guys out there that stick and now like

350
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:12,740
they're putting melted butter
into their coffee. Oh God, I know.

351
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,280
No,

352
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,800
but they're saying that like that all of
that saturated fat shit that they were

353
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:21,050
saying is now a myth. It's like,
it's like the egg in my lifetime.

354
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:25,370
The egg when he times is the egg been in
and out and out and Andy over the month

355
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:25,641
or not.

356
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:30,050
It's like John Travolta's career to John
Travolta fucking Saturday night fever,

357
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:30,940
sweat hogs.
Right.

358
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,850
Then he fucking went away in the 80s that
he came back with pulp fiction than he

359
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:37,430
did fucking battlefield earth.
And I don't know what he's doing now,

360
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:38,810
but I feel like he's
going to come back again.

361
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,040
You know what, I'm, I'm actually
one of the few people that, dude,

362
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:43,910
this is embarrassing.

363
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:46,580
This is probably the most embarrassing
thing you're going to get me to say on

364
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:50,510
this pod. I love it. Is I actually
liked battlefield earth. Oh, you did?

365
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:54,080
I never saw it. I thought Forrest
Whitaker is in it for God's sake.

366
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,180
Okay. Barry peppers in it. Barry Pepper's,

367
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,140
none of these guys want us to mention
that, but those are all great actors. Yes.

368
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,860
Great actors.
And it was written by all Ron Hubbard,

369
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:06,210
which is basically the same thing
that is, uh, ancient aliens.

370
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:10,490
Guy Zacharias Cichon wrote in
his book the 12th Planet, uh,

371
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,450
about how we've been colonized for 400,000
years starting in South Africa where

372
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:20,130
they took apes and genetically made
them into like gold mine workers because

373
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:24,320
they needed gold dust to protect
their, uh, uh, plant, uh, the, the,

374
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,920
the ozone on their planet or some
kind of crazy shit. Either way.

375
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,540
It's totally believable to me. I mean, I
don't care one way or the other, you know,

376
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,100
but like,
but,

377
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:38,930
but that included with all those good
actors in this kind of tie in to sounded

378
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,650
like star wars mixed with roots mixed
with mushrooms mixed with mushrooms.

379
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:47,900
There you go. I actually like
battlefield earth. I remember a avoid.

380
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,670
So that's what that movie was
about. Yeah, yeah. It was like a,

381
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,180
a colonizing a dumb ass humans,

382
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:58,140
which they just made from
apes through their DNA and uh,

383
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,790
and had them all like mining gold for,

384
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,750
because they needed the gold on
their home planet and this and that.

385
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:07,860
And John Travolta had dreads just like
I got now. Right. It was like, no,

386
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:09,450
I'm thinking that movie.
It was pretty cool.

387
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:11,700
And I remember getting a lot
of shit for it going, Oh,

388
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:15,260
I'm all for this movie at the time.
And now it's like, okay, I'm going

389
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,440
perishingly admitting that.
Yeah, that was pretty cool. Well,

390
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,340
what's really interesting to
plot is interesting. So wait,

391
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:24,650
the Scientologists think
that we came from apes,

392
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,400
I thought they'd throw some
sort of spatial. Okay. Oh

393
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:31,310
yeah, yeah. There's a spaceship that
comes down and they needed, uh, they,

394
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,490
they tried to have their own people mind
these gold mines and these people just

395
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:39,600
said, fuck you. I want to go back to my
home planet. This is bullshit work, man.

396
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:44,100
This is like, this is like working as
a Barista at Starbucks or Mcdonald's.

397
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:46,200
And so get these age to do

398
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,850
it that are already on the planet.

399
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:51,390
And so they genetically engineered them
to be a little bit smarter and then they

400
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:54,840
started mining the gold and those
guys could hang out and drink.

401
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,800
So is that where my tax money's going?
Yeah. He's going to another planet.

402
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,970
Black projects, man. Black projects are
all over the place. What a black projects.

403
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,751
Ah,
you know,

404
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:08,070
all the shits like Alex Jones is on about
every day except he's way off the mark.

405
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,020
But just like what?

406
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,780
They don't think that guys hit the nail
on the head over there. Why not a 10?

407
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,810
I mean, he's swinging big. Yeah,
he's swinging big over there.

408
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:19,680
It was in the major leagues. His batting
average would be about one 39. I know,

409
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:22,320
but when he connects, but when
he connects, you know it's going,

410
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:26,050
it's leaving the park.
That's why you go. Yeah.

411
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,920
Do you want to see a guy swinging like
that out of right out of his fucking

412
00:24:28,921 --> 00:24:33,870
cleats. That's it, man. I can't listen. I
used to be into all of that shit and like,

413
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:37,730
I see you guys. What are
we watching? MSNBC and a,

414
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,190
I like how they walk around
now when they're doing the
news to add some level of

415
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:46,170
excitement to it. Uh, ESPN does it.
They all fucking, they all walk around.

416
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,510
I don't watch any of that.

417
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,410
This shit. All right. First read of
the week here and don't cheat. Oh,

418
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:58,150
uh, talk about how made to
measure suits compared to generic.

419
00:24:58,151 --> 00:25:00,700
Off The rack suits.
Well,

420
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:04,930
unless you're the exact same size as
a mannequin, which most people aren't,

421
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:07,660
it's just an impossible body. Him,
it's just not going to fit right.

422
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,980
So if you get it a made to measure,
you're going to look great. Uh,

499
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,550
Okay. And that's the ad reads.
And now back to the podcast.

500
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,360
Do you know I was talking to you
today on my podcast? Like what was it?

501
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,940
Will Sharon
before or fire right there?

502
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,010
There was a bunch of pro second amendment
people just standing and they just

503
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:15,780
were yelling America love it or
leave it. Right. And uh, I just like,

504
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,390
the whole thing that's fascinating
to me is that, you know,

505
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,560
these guys rotors amendment way
back in the day and it's just like,

506
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:26,730
well shit does evolve. I mean, it was an
amendment. So they were, weren't they?

507
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,810
There was a change to what
already existed and like he, you,

508
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:33,030
you do have to adjust because
I don't have, I don't have,

509
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,860
cause I don't have a problem with guns.

510
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,900
I don't have a problem with
the argument right away.

511
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,690
Is there on the corner yelling
America love it or leave it.

512
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,110
So they obviously don't love it because
they're on a corner at fucking four or

513
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:46,890
five on Wilshire yelling. So they don't
love it. So why don't they leave it?

514
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,850
They just get, because Norway doesn't
fucking want them. Oh, all right.

515
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,790
I don't know. I don't, that's why did
they not have guns out there in Norway?

516
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,950
How do they keep their people under
control? No guns. I know, I look,

517
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:03,120
I don't have a, yeah, I don't think
there's anything wrong with guns.

518
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:06,180
If you fucking own them responsibly,
they just have to figure out a way.

519
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,200
If they could just figure out a fucking
way to make sure that these fucking

520
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,850
lunatics who then go on social media
saying, I'm going to do this shit.

521
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,810
And everybody kind of ignores it. Ah, hey
man, it's, it's this, it's this simple.

522
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,530
If you get a couple of Duis, they
take your license away, right?

523
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,310
If you're going to get a gun and you've
had a couple batteries, assaults,

524
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:29,550
domestic shit,
all sorts of crappy stuff,

525
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,570
and you torture and animals as a child
and you've been thrown out of five

526
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:36,540
schools,
probably not a good idea to get a gun.

527
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,410
I have nothing against guns
either. I mean, look, uh, you know,

528
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,940
if you're some grizzly Adams type of
living in a cabin in Colorado shooting

529
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:49,080
grizzly bears for Hyde's food
tent sustenance, this and that,

530
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,520
good on Ya. You know, you're probably
a responsible gun owner. Oh, he's cute.

531
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,980
He's going to create the next people can
guys that like this all goes to shit,

532
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,360
got beat up too much in high school.
They weren't part of the cool clique.

533
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:03,360
They started making threats on Youtube,
this and that and the other.

534
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:05,910
They beat up their wives, their
girlfriends, this and that.

535
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:09,720
They beat up their moms. They've, you
know, don't give him a fucking gun.

536
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,580
Joined a band.
Yeah.

537
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,800
Get into show business like the rest of
us were presently hiring roadies now.

538
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,280
Well speaking to that before we get
all sideways here, but the politics,

539
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:22,650
I can't fucking hear myself anymore.
He let me take this out,

540
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:26,670
put it back and come on your best today.
Where is it? Where's the sweet spot?

541
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,290
There is um, you got a new
album coming up. Oh yeah. Right.

542
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,860
Tell us, tell us the name. Tell us
about it. I listened to one track.

543
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,740
I love the harmonica on it.
Then haunting like with the,

544
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:39,960
with the reverb on it and stuff.
Uh,

545
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,750
I don't know what,
whatever the name of the track was,

546
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,950
but maybe why it made me call twilight
zone. It made me want to go play drums.

547
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:51,010
That's how I know I like a sock is I
immediately go into fantasy mode and

548
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,510
whatever cool thing is happening,
I'm doing it.

549
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,470
So at first I was playing drums and
then when you did the harmonica part,

550
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:58,880
then that was me and my fantasy.

551
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:02,030
I was playing that and everybody was
gazing up at the stage going, wow,

552
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:06,890
look how awesome bill is. So you're one
for one. That could still happen. Oh,

553
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:10,730
okay. Now I know we've all heard you to
come onstage before and you pussied out.

554
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,620
I didn't pussy out. What are you talking
about? Why that Danzig at that? Uh,

555
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:16,820
whatever. I couldn't make it
down there. Oh this is the thing.

556
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,390
If you want look like we were ready to
bring you a helicopter to fly down on the

557
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:23,890
stage and have you come
back and play drums for us.

558
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,640
Now that you said I'm a
pussy, I'll, I'll do it.

559
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,820
I'm playing a little bit of double
bass now. I just don't want to ruin it.

560
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:33,940
I don't want to ruin it because people
come in there to see you like and that

561
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,680
you knew what it wants to cause you were
doing a festival so I figure you played

562
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,760
a shorter set. Yay. But if you'll go
on there and it's a full on you show,

563
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:43,640
if you have some jerk off comic,
come on for one song.

564
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,180
I think the crowd can handle
that. But if it's just like, hey,

565
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:51,800
we only got time for six songs, and
on one of them, the guy from VH ones,

566
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:54,680
I love the 80 strikes back
is going to play drums.

567
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,840
And I know you guys might
get a kick out of that.

568
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:58,750
I'm just worried that you fans like what,

569
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:00,890
what they're gonna fucking
throw at me when I'm up there.

570
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,770
But my favorite guest appearance
for us of all time was, uh,

571
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,220
during Lollapalooza we had a
Kirk Hammett from Metallica.

572
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,880
Oh Wow. Come on stage. We'd
known Kirk for a while and we,

573
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:16,490
we'd opened up from Metallica
on a bunch of dates in Europe.

574
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,430
And so we got to be friends and,
and,

575
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:22,790
and Kirk came out and we did a cover of
a black sabbath song called super not at

576
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:25,040
a festival. Uh, and,

577
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,300
and we're playing it and we gave
him the second lead in the song.

578
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,740
So he started going crazy.
I mean, his hair was flying.

579
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:37,160
It looked like he had one
of those industrial blow
dryers on his hair and there

580
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:40,220
was a whole blow dryer. It just, his
hair was flinging around. He was into it.

581
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,840
He was into it and all that,

582
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,430
but it just went on for fucking ever and
so the rest of the band was just like,

583
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:48,320
well fuck it.
We're out of here.

584
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:51,440
So we all just walked off and by the,

585
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,770
by the time he realized what was happening
and he's still in the middle of his

586
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:55,101
lead,

587
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:58,970
there's no band members up there and we're
all standing there on the side of the

588
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:03,200
stage, like looking at our
watches going, dude, really?

589
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,750
This is now like going on a 12
minute solo. You fucking, oh no.

590
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,330
So then we'll wait. What
point? He told me later.

591
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:15,170
It's like he didn't want to leave the
stage because he realized he was going to

592
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:18,200
get shit when he left, so we might
as well keep going at that point,

593
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,250
I think it wound up to be
like a 17 minutes. So locally,

594
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,310
because I knew he was going to
get his ass beat on this things.

595
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,740
If you guys leave and then he doesn't
leave, it looks like it's planned. Right?

596
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:29,600
Well, it wasn't planned.
We were just bored

597
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,870
right now. What is the
etiquette? If somebody goes to
see, you know, five, eight,

598
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,160
you've been in a fucking that to me,
if you guys that would be a Larry Self,

599
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,730
you leave me out there and I'll be up
there. Boom, crack, crack. I sit along,

600
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,020
I can do that before I get killed.

601
00:35:44,021 --> 00:35:47,260
That's when you start incorporating
the Tom Thompson shows that what I do,

602
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,040
what I would do is I would just, I would
do a backward somersault off the stool,

603
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,330
crawl my way out underneath the curtain.

604
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,570
Did he get mad at you guys or do
you think it was funny? No, he was,

605
00:36:01,571 --> 00:36:04,200
he was scared shitless by the
time he got off and then we're,

606
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:08,260
we all acted pest and now it's just like,
ah, that was fun man. You know, and just,

607
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,060
but he was kind of scared at first, but
uh, he's never come back this ever since.

608
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:17,680
He just got back on stage. We don't get
a lot of guest artist anymore. Well,

609
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:20,710
I'm sure he told that story.
I'm imagining that that went around.

610
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:26,140
I don't know if he didn't want to repeat
that story. He was pretty freaked out.

611
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,500
Uh,
I have told it anyway.

612
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,020
So you've got this new album
coming out when it comes out on on,

613
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,950
was it March 6th when it comes out? March
nights. Nights? Yeah. It's a Friday.

614
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,790
Okay. Very nice. He night
shrooms. Woo. That's right.
Shroom weekend. And where can,

615
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,490
where can people get it? Oh, I guess
everywhere. I don't know. Oh God. I mean,

616
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:48,950
what are you really creative guys on
the worst promoted we'll share with uh,

617
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,760
with a billboard and start hawking cds.
I mean,

618
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:54,810
I don't know where these things are sold.
What was it going to be on a diet?

619
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,360
They are sold anymore. They just like,
you know, by the time we post this,

620
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,680
I'm sure someone will give me a link
and I'll be able to tell people where to

621
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:05,830
get it. I mean, I, you've been in this
business long enough that you know,

622
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:09,850
that the whole purpose of this is to
get people to hear your shit, man.

623
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,790
I've been in this business long enough
to also know that I don't really give a

624
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:17,260
fuck about this part of the business.
Okay. I just kinda like do what I do.

625
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:19,870
And you know now you were influenced by,

626
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,120
like I always heard those guys
you were talking about, oh,

627
00:37:22,121 --> 00:37:24,580
Bill Burroughs as you call him William
Burroughs, right? Yeah, it didn't,

628
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:27,970
those guys, they would write type
out a bunch, oh, pages, story,

629
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,970
and then they would cut up all the,
every word individually.

630
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:33,740
They throw it in the air and
then tape it all together. Yeah,

631
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,680
and then they would just start
writing from that, you know? No, that,

632
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,390
that's what I did

633
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:43,390
on in 1980 was it 88 or some shit
around like land of rape and honey.

634
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,750
I decided to do an album like that
based on William Burroughs riding,

635
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:52,370
which is how I hooked up with him later.
I just took a bunch of pieces of tape.

636
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,410
Yes.
We actually use tape back then,

637
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:59,360
not just digital and just cut it all up
into various pieces and threw it on the

638
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,870
floor,
spilled coffee on,

639
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:05,060
I'm snorting coke off of them or did
whatever and then put them back together.

640
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:07,940
Some were backwards, somewhere
forward, some worse, some not,

641
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,270
and then put it together in
an actually told a narrative,

642
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:15,190
which is what bill Burroughs was saying.
I almost did it as an experiment gone.

643
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,300
This guy is crazy.
That can't just happen.

644
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:19,970
Like he's just throw shit random
on the floor and it talks to you,

645
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:23,780
but 90% of the time it
seemed to work like wow,

646
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,410
like you couldn't have done that
yourself. So it's like you're, you're,

647
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:31,130
you're throwing yourself to like random
chance of it coming out good. Yeah,

648
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,540
sometimes it does.
Why don't you get the balls to do that?

649
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,130
You got a record deal
and everybody is trying

650
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,760
so hard to do it the way
that everybody's doing it.

651
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,020
You have the ability to do it that way.
How did you get the balls to be like, ah,

652
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,060
well you independent at that point
so you could take that kind of rest.

653
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:52,000
He just didn't care. I, I'd done a couple
records for major labels at that point.

654
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,140
I did this horrific record where they
took over the whole thing out for errors

655
00:38:56,141 --> 00:39:00,480
to records. Then I did this other
record for Warner Brothers that, uh,

656
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,190
pretty much gave me carte blanche,

657
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:06,220
but it was still like learning
to crawl before you walk.

658
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:09,430
By the time I got to that record,
I was just sick of all these people.

659
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,370
I figured like if,

660
00:39:10,371 --> 00:39:13,300
if these are the people that
claimed to know what they're doing,

661
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,930
then I must be fucking Einstein
because these people are adults.

662
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,070
So I just decided to do whatever the
fuck I wanted to do, you know? Right.

663
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:26,150
So how did you come up with, uh, what
does, what does that song, uh, uh,

664
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,350
I'm the fucking worst.
It said thing.

665
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,710
We stigmata that guitar riff on that.

666
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,120
I always thought the guy had a slide at
Donna, an aunt, my aunt and I, yeah, that,

667
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:41,080
that is a sliding and somebody
told me, you sped it up. Well,

668
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,760
I did that too.

669
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,020
And I also added a Didgeridoo
onto that to get that slide.

670
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,990
I get really meticulous on my show. That's
one of the sickest riffs of all time.

671
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,930
I played that for my wife and she
was like, what the fuck is this?

672
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:59,680
This is awesome. And then you went
way over the top and then, you know,

673
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,050
then she kind of left it that,

674
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,900
well back then people weren't
using distortive vocals either.

675
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:09,220
And that was actually quite the accident
because, uh, we, we had this cheap,

676
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,240
Sony asked Mike that ran on batteries and
the batteries were low and when I went

677
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:18,040
to sing that first scream, it just
sounded like a cat was being tortured.

678
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Like bill, it sounds great.
Let's keep it, you know. So we,

679
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,150
and then we started trying to replicate
that sound for the next 10 years.

680
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:27,010
You know,
it's Kinda like your first heroin hit

681
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,160
in the next 10 years.

682
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,470
I think we should have kept that
microphone in those batteries.

683
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,620
So what did you do?
You just use like the bull horn?

684
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:37,070
Cause I've seen the clips of your,

685
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,710
your live shows are unbelievable
and their Osa terrifying.

686
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:43,990
Like I love him. That gave me
the chills as I'm watching it.

687
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:45,430
But then there's a part of me going,
you know,

688
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:47,950
I'm glad I wasn't in like
that fucking pit down front.

689
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:51,370
Cause especially the way I look back
then I look like fucking ruin Howard way

690
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:56,140
back in the day before it looked like a
itch injury. Rent our, our pit is like a,

691
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,130
it's scary for us too. We looked at
these fucking kids and we're like,

692
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,560
uh, you know, like, like I said,

693
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:06,430
I'm pushing 60 and I'm looking at these
20 year old kids and I'm thinking like

694
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:11,260
these could be literally physically
my grandkids and I'm worried about our

695
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:14,890
future. And so what, what's,
what a bit on stage man.

696
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,750
What's some of the weirdest shit or
scary shit you've seen when you were on

697
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,540
stage? Um, you know what? No, no,

698
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,960
I don't have anything that's like
particularly like, like a, you know,

699
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:30,460
hear about like what was, there's
some rap concert the other day that a,

700
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,760
they stopped the concert because they saw
a girl being raped in the front row or

701
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:38,390
we're in the pit or something
like that. And uh, uh, I've never,

702
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:42,810
how does that happen? Like the other
people don't see that it is so large.

703
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,280
What riff were they playing that everyone
was so locked into it that there's

704
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:49,460
literally somebody getting raped next to
you and you can't see it? I don't know.

705
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,370
I don't understand that. I've never
seen anything like that. Actually.

706
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,530
Some of the stairway, uh, stay.

707
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:59,390
Would it have been maybe people love
that one that they just waiting for that

708
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:03,840
drum fill? Well, well that,
that would be like, uh, it,

709
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,900
uh, if, if I saw something really
weird on a stairway to heaven song,

710
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,790
uh,
at a led Zeppelin concert,

711
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,900
it would probably be a hobbit being raped
in the pit because I never understood

712
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:18,950
this about led Zeppelin. Don't take me
wrong, I love the fucking band, but,

713
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,080
uh, this guy, basically his
lyrics, we've given them a pass.

714
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:28,580
All these things about his
dungeons, dragons, castles, maidens,

715
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,650
horses,
and his Dick.

716
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:35,270
It's and his tick that squeeze
my lemon or whatever. I mean,

717
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,540
I mean, this guy's really coasted,
this Robert Plank Guy Matt here,

718
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,510
and I love the fucking band. Don't take,
did you ever get to see them? Oh yeah,

719
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:49,510
of course. And then they just
amazing. What tours did you
see them on the page? Uh,

720
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,080
I saw him at the Chicago
Stadium and like what? 75,

721
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:57,320
76, 77, something like that. I mean,

722
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,250
so bottom had the vista light at that
point, right? The orange seethrough one?

723
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,370
No, he was strutting around and he's, Oh,
a little bit drunk. He gets better. Well,

724
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:08,960
while they were in town.
Okay.

725
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,990
They spent three days in Chicago and
he did his show at the Chicago Stadium,

726
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:19,550
the old stadium and a, I once saw that
and then I had to work at wax tracks.

727
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:21,860
So the, no, so this is like 79.

728
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,430
So he's got the stainless
steel kit? No, no, no.

729
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:27,770
He was walking around with like a little,
uh,

730
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,690
like girly top tied off around mid torso.

731
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,950
And then, uh, uh, Robert Plant,
I think some of them bought them.

732
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:41,510
I'm telling my bell bottoms there were
as wide as this coffee table and he's

733
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:43,850
strutting around doing all this stuff.

734
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:48,350
And at that point he's in
his mid to late forties. Um,

735
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,640
and I just thought like, um, I just
thought, damn it, this is inappropriate.

736
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:58,670
He was funny. He wasn't, he was only like
30 or 31 well he was born in like 48,

737
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:02,240
mid forties so maybe you should have
stuck to heroin because he wasn't picky,

738
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:08,290
easy turning around and I'm going
like, that's like, uh, he's,

739
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:12,500
he's doing like this chicken dance and
stuff on here and singing about hobbits

740
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,220
and, and I, I immediately zoned
out and paid no attention.

741
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:20,330
He just listened to like the tightness
of the band and you can plant did get old

742
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:25,130
quick though. He was like a young guy
and then right after physical graffiti,

743
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:29,310
he just got all the lines in his face.
Yeah, it's weird. I think that's genetic.

744
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:33,750
So I think that's that, that's kind of
like a Nordic thing. I think he must be,

745
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:38,040
have Nordic Dna because that's what
happens to Scandinavian people.

746
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,660
They look so awesome when they're young
and then because their genetics tell

747
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:43,740
them like when they're old,

748
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:48,270
they've spent 40 years of Nordic
winters and their skin says,

749
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,530
fuck you, I'm cracking wrinkling
now. They just needed some lotion,

750
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:56,520
but he looks cool now though. He needs
lotion, but he looks cool now though.

751
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,870
It looks great now he found the low
sheer, but he never, yeah, you could,

752
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:04,420
but you can tell his face. He never did
heroin. Yeah. He didn't give hope. Gone.

753
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:08,790
I got,
that's hilarious.

754
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:12,840
You can look at old people and
tell the drugs that they did. Um,

755
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,880
well, a, I, you're also,

756
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:18,860
a lot of people might not know this
about you is you're a huge hockey fan or

757
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,840
they literally in the house
building shit right now. Yeah. Yeah.

758
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,490
This is destruction zone one.
This is, let's call we've done,

759
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:29,420
we've done almost 40 minutes before the
hammering started saying, Oh, you know,

760
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:32,970
and Rassie brought up led Zepplin hammer
of the gods. Oh, right, right there. Huh?

761
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,570
Jesus. Oh yeah. That was, that
was a book that put me to sleep.

762
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,520
I believed every word of
it. Oh, I do too. Get Sleep.

763
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,990
It's compared to like the shit we did
and not only just us talking to you put a

764
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:50,190
shark in a woman and then
what happened? It, well,

765
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:54,700
what's the water is shark.
It was a dolphin. No, no, no.

766
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,120
It was a bathtub.
Plastic Shark.

767
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:01,350
And One of our roadies was
penetrating a girl willingly.

768
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:05,370
There was no rape. I wasn't about
us, not about zipline. Oh No,

769
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:08,360
I'm talking about our tour.
And I've seen,

770
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,350
I've seen some crazy shit. I mean,
that's unfolding five random.

771
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:16,410
That is that I sprouted bringing
in a shark, putting it in a woman.

772
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:19,380
Who the fuck does that? And you
actually had a story, you know? Yeah.

773
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:22,470
It wasn't a real shark. It was
a toy shark. And it wasn't me.

774
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:25,290
And it wasn't the band that was on,
we had two buses.

775
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,960
We had the road crew boss and
the ban shark bus and, and,

776
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:32,490
and the band bus basically had some
kind of decorum going on, but the,

777
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:37,260
the crew bus was literally, Dante is
ninth gate of Hell. I mean, you know,

778
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:41,860
walk on there. And it was just like
calendula on steroids going out.

779
00:46:41,861 --> 00:46:45,460
Oh Wow. That shit that you'd see. And I
just don't wander because like, say I'd,

780
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,430
I'm out of,
I'm out of smokes.

781
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,190
I go in to borrow a pack of smokes from
one of the roadies because none of the

782
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:51,060
bands smokes.

783
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:55,760
And so I'd go and I'd walk in and just
walk into like Dante's inferno stepping

784
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:00,770
through an orgy to get a human
mind field of fornication.

785
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,880
Try not to step on anybody's fucking
heads. Um, yeah. Well, you know,

786
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,840
I'm actually, uh, I,

787
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,150
I've had the exact opposite experience on
the road where it's just been a lonely,

788
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,330
isolated thing, but I was kind
of built for the lay people.

789
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:16,710
Somebody was asking you about that shit.

790
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,860
You know about being on the road and
like groupies and stuff. It's just like,

791
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:23,670
dude, that just doesn't fucking, it's
different. It can fuck me. It's just not,

792
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,080
it's not what like to,

793
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:29,130
you guys go up there with a fucking
Ukulele and you just fucking

794
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,820
brown and all of a sudden this
fucking panties flying at you.

795
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:38,410
You know what's true? I'm not saying
you, I'm not saying you, but you know me.

796
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,300
I get just bolts and coins and bottles
flying at me. I don't get panicked.

797
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,860
I'm not stuck. Um, you know,

798
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,730
some fucking jerk off could go to a
God damn coffee house on an open mic.

799
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,450
All right. And he can fucking go
up there with the Ukulele. It's,

800
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:54,100
he could literally do his cover,

801
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:57,580
probably do a reggae version
of a Mama and papa song. Right.

802
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:03,060
All the leaves of Brown man. Right. And
they don't even get to the next to that.

803
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,450
And the next thing you know,

804
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,750
there's be some woman is
going to fuck a respond to it,

805
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,270
you know w yeah. But how many
people do you travel with when,

806
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:16,930
when you go on the road? Nobody. I go
by myself. I am like have a handler. No,

807
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:19,570
I have like open it. Nah, it's
just more people I got to talk to.

808
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,790
I don't have a look. If I go to another
country and I don't mean Canada. Yeah.

809
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,980
I mean another country. I uh, wait, no,

810
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:32,940
when I did Canada, they get, they
gave like a road person. I, I,

811
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,910
it drives me up the fucking wall. Uh, but
when I'm in another country, I love it.

812
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:37,750
When I was in Australia,

813
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,870
the guy had was fucking awesome and I'm
definitely gonna use him again when I

814
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:41,111
was like,

815
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:43,930
I cover my bases here so that they can
be shit coming from the stage with you.

816
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:46,840
In other words, he traveled alone.
You just go home to Australia.

817
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,570
I'm going a lot if I'm going
to Australia. What? I love it.

818
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,560
I love having a tour manager because he
shows up and it's just like, all right,

819
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,110
this is what you need to be. Boom. I
don't have to worry about anything.

820
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:59,050
And there's transportation.
Um, when I go into England,

821
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:02,590
I've had great people and all of that
type of stuff, pray, people, Scandinavian,

822
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:06,100
all that shit. But in the states,
no, I just show up on the wall.

823
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:09,700
I get a rent a car, like fucking
Chuck Berry drive up with my mic,

824
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:14,050
stand in the car. That keeps the
overhead low. That's the thing.

825
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,970
That's where things get dicey when
like our, our touring parties,

826
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:22,880
about 17 people between band and crew and,
uh,

827
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,380
there's generally three
or four rookies on,

828
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:32,400
on each tour. And the rookies have
read too many books like Hammer.

829
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:36,560
The gods are, yeah. Yeah.
And so they bring that,

830
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,770
that that shit onto the buses.
Mainly on the crew boss. Uh,

831
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,331
we haven't had,

832
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:47,250
we've had the most boring band
bus for probably about almost 12,

833
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,470
13 years. Thank God. Because

834
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,000
did you guys sit there and playing
like cards against humanity?

835
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,330
Like that's a crazy night
actually.

836
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,030
You know what? No, we, we just,
we get the fuck off the bus.

837
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:02,900
We stay in our little areas and get the
fuck off the bus and go to the hotel as

838
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:04,490
soon as possible.
And then,

839
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,590
then are like stupid shit happens at
the hotel bar. Not so much on the bus.

840
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:12,980
The bus is like, kind of like
this. I'm a big hotel bar guy.

841
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,370
I love it because it's like
you're already kind of home.

842
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,790
It's like you downstairs
in your own kitchen and,

843
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:23,810
and then you can just drink down there
and then just tell bar tenders are always

844
00:50:24,561 --> 00:50:26,720
like, I don't even, I think their,

845
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,730
they're good. Right? Oh, at
least at the hotels he stayed,

846
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:34,640
I'd say Sheridan's Hilton's this and
that. Radissons, blah, blah, blah.

847
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:40,220
We reached at that, that kind of shit.
Those hotel bartenders in every city are,

848
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,600
are like, they must've taken a class
because they're all real similar.

849
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,520
They're all psychology based,
drink pour.

850
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,220
My favorite hotel bar is the one you can,

851
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,390
you can be like staying on the 10th
floor and you can look down over at the

852
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:58,640
elevator to see if it's still open.
You know,

853
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:01,310
those ones rather than half of all the
way down and you'll just see these drunk

854
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:05,270
sitting down. And I had still going
here. Then we got to get gone down.

855
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,710
You don't have to call anybody or
anything like that. So, um, hey,

856
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:11,960
is there a cause I do want
to promote your album, man.

857
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:15,770
I think you're a fucking genius.
So is there any sort of theme on this one?

858
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:18,830
Is it just, uh, yeah, look man,

859
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:21,720
I mean I've been known to bash our,
uh,

860
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:26,360
right wing friends before and are right
wing leaders such as George Bush and

861
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:29,150
Ronald Reagan and things
in the past. But uh, this,

862
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,790
this one is not real anti Trump.

863
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:36,500
It's more like what kind of system
keeps producing these people?

864
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,670
Uh, let, let's uh, let's
cut to the quick here.

865
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:45,230
It's the system that keeps producing
these people that we keep thinking is a

866
00:51:45,231 --> 00:51:50,150
good idea to be our spokesperson
for our ideals and a,

867
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:53,360
and the quality of these people
keeps going down and down and down.

868
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,380
So rather than a attack,
it is fallen off where we,

869
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,860
we at least we had like low bar, we add
like we used to have career politician,

870
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,970
then we went to like the boss's son.
Yeah.

871
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,980
And now we've got like a reality show,
like a TV star and now,

872
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:12,950
which is causing all these people
out here in Hollywood to go like,

873
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,540
I want to run like the second you say
you want to run for president. Yeah.

874
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:18,410
Your body and mind you,
you're basically saying,

875
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:22,970
you saying I want to have dead bodies
on my conscience because that's what the

876
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:24,290
fuck you signing up for.

877
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,320
And I'm not saying that you're going to
have to go out and do the wrong thing,

878
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:29,630
but like in the process
of doing the right thing,

879
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,050
you're going to kill people that
would just in the wrong place.

880
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:37,430
That's why I think they age the way
they do it because it's like it's heavy.

881
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,450
Yeah. Fucking heavy. I get asked this
question all the time in interviews.

882
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:43,220
All right, Mr Political, what would,

883
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:48,380
what's the first thing you'd
do if you were president?
I'd fucking quit. He could.

884
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,600
I don't want any part of this shit.

885
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,740
I put the solar panels back on the White
House and then I'd leave. Yeah. Okay.

886
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,680
I will and I'll do a, personally,
I would do that and I would get,

887
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:58,610
I'd have the guy,

888
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:03,410
the chef to the chef make me a sandwich
and I want to ride in the helicopter and

889
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:04,244
then that's it.

890
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,740
I now introduce you to the vice president
and the person who will now be running

891
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:13,890
all of this shit. You gotta throw
one party in on Air Force One, one,

892
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,060
one big kind.
It looks like a giant like fucking thing.

893
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:20,250
I always fly in the Marine One helicopter.
Always look bad ass to me.

894
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,530
You're old enough to remember it.

895
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:26,531
Old Seven 47 fleet of via ever fly seven
47 I went to jail or you got to go to

896
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:28,890
the Ronald Reagan Library on, you
know, they have that. They have,

897
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,520
they have literally the one that he sat
on talking to Gorbachev or get to go

898
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:36,390
upstairs to that bar and hang out with
the cool people or you're a fly on that

899
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:39,550
seven 47 I'd always wanted to do,
I did that one time.

900
00:53:39,551 --> 00:53:42,420
I got busted twice and sent
right back down. You know,

901
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:45,240
it was a spiral staircase and you went,

902
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:48,060
you went up there and everybody had
suits in this fucking stewardesses.

903
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,550
We'll hot bath. Yeah. When
we were, uh, I did this,

904
00:53:52,551 --> 00:53:56,560
this run through Asia, I did, um, um,

905
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,950
the fuck did I, Singapore, Hong Kong and
then Mumbai, India and leaving Mumbai,

906
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:06,620
India. We connected through Dubai and we
got on that Air Emirates. Oh, that, that,

907
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:11,630
that's not even an airline at w it's
like a w hotel with like with wings.

908
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:14,610
Yeah. It's fucking unreal.
So, and that's even like, it,

909
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:19,030
it's better than a w w was like a w
hotel like acts like it's nice. It's,

910
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,730
it's like nice if you
were in your twenties,

911
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,560
you see a lot of fucking very twenties,

912
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:27,450
a lot of aquarium lighting around
the bed and shit. But so we, we were,

913
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:32,340
uh, we were, I came up, we were upstairs
or whatever. All I remember was we,

914
00:54:32,341 --> 00:54:35,550
uh, when, if I were going to fly
that far, I use all the miles,

915
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:38,220
every fucking thing I can possibly
do, make less money. Yeah.

916
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,780
I'm going to sit at least have
one of those bed shares. And um,

917
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:47,790
so I got up to go to the bathroom and I
walked in the back to go to the bathroom

918
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:52,580
and they had like the
semicircular bar. Yeah. Like,

919
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,010
cause it was one of those wide body.

920
00:54:54,011 --> 00:54:56,610
So there was like chair two
chairs next to the window,

921
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,560
then an aisle than the middle
than an aisle and then all of a,

922
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:01,980
so that middle section it was,
is that,

923
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,330
it was that wide in the back where it
had like a semicircle and a bartender in

924
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:06,750
there.

925
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,800
And they had a little bench seat and some
stools around their bench seat with a

926
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:12,900
seatbelt that you sat down on.
So I saw it.

927
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:17,490
You were up there and I went back.
I didn't have the one go autograph.

928
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,950
I didn't have the one where you had to
like your own apartment like that one.

929
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,810
That one's like 15 grand one way this.
So, um, I went back and I got my wife,

930
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:28,290
I said, Hey, can I, uh, can
I buy you a drink? She goes,
well, you're talking about,

931
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,990
go come with me. So we went
to the back. We were like,

932
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:35,040
she and she just ear to ear grin
and I ordered a couple mixed drinks.

933
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:38,370
We sat down on the little bench seat.
I put a seatbelt on,

934
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:41,580
put mine on and we just sat there.
We didn't have that many,

935
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:46,140
but it was just so fucking cool.
It's w it didn't seem possible.

936
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:49,020
It's like I at a bar in the sky.

937
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,080
I know they flying drones
flying to New York.

938
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:55,290
It was one of those things where I was
very excited to get back to the states,

939
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,670
but that was definitely one that I didn't
want it to end. Where you just like,

940
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,210
oh my God.

941
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:03,510
It's the exact opposite of riding and
coach where it's like you could literally

942
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:06,730
be flying from like fucking New York to
Buffalo. Did your neck start hurting to,

943
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,130
sorry,
it was sitting side by side.

944
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:13,500
I came by that mustache. Oh, okay. And uh,

945
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,360
I don't know what you're doing. You're
taking stuff out from underneath the uh,

946
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,890
all right then my love to say
what's going on right? I don't know.

947
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,360
He took legal. Is it legal?
I don't know what it is.

948
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,670
It looks like he has all that
is wine or didn't think of it.

949
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,940
I thought that was like liquid weed.

950
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,060
You're going to pour into the vaporizer
and it reaches a certain temperature.

951
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:36,410
Let me tell you something,
man,

952
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,210
you are fucking rock star because I've
never had an experience that good flying.

953
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:44,750
The closest thing I ever had was I did
an 18 hour flight to Australia once and I

954
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:49,751
was on the last fucking flight
that allowed smoking on nine seats,

955
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,190
only on nine seats in business class.
So it wasn't,

956
00:56:55,191 --> 00:57:00,191
first class wasn't coach and they had
nine seats arranged on Quantus for people

957
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:05,050
who smoke. And if I'm going
to be 18 hours on an airplane,

958
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,290
I want to fucking cigarette.

959
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,810
You know nowadays you got the
East cigs and it's really easy.

960
00:57:08,811 --> 00:57:13,600
Nobody knows your fucking like nicotine
out of your mind on these planes. Right?

961
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,640
Cause I'm a flyer and puffing on my east
egg and nobody bothers me and I don't

962
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:23,750
bother anyone else. But this was the
last smoking flight Quantis ever had.

963
00:57:23,751 --> 00:57:28,460
It was actually in the news and I was one
of the people that had those seats and

964
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:28,760
a,

965
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,760
so I get there and there's
this businessman from Hong
Kong next to me and he

966
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:39,760
immediately starts blowing his nose on
the tray in front of them and there's

967
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:43,790
boogers and shit all over the sheet
in front of me can just notice.

968
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:48,530
And I was just like, stewardess, man,
I can't sit next to this fucking guy.

969
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,730
Okay. He's, he was really
weird. It was rude.

970
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,040
Oh yeah. The, I think you're
being really nice about this guy.

971
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,010
It's just define that as weird and rude

972
00:57:59,150 --> 00:57:59,820
and,
and the,

973
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,690
the flight was booked so they put me on
one of those comic Kasi sheets at the

974
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:07,370
stewardess just sit on right
before they do a little jump seat,

975
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,830
a little jump seat. So they put me in
there. So I was like, all right, cool.

976
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:14,460
Why don't they sit the her up?
They're like, well that's the point.

977
00:58:14,461 --> 00:58:19,050
So like I'm sitting there and I light up
a smoke and they just like flipped out.

978
00:58:19,051 --> 00:58:21,870
Like you can't be smoking here.
Like what are you doing? I'm like,

979
00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:24,060
well I'm not sitting
next to that fucking guy.

980
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,350
So we had this like two hour standoff
and they tried to get the guide and move

981
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:33,330
and he wouldn't move. And so they finally
acquiesce since it was the last flight,

982
00:58:33,331 --> 00:58:36,490
which smoking, I got to sit there
on the jump seat and just change.

983
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,890
That was like my rock star flying story.
Man with Hong Kong,

984
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:46,700
you know when I flew from Singapore
to Hong Kong, I'm defensive Hong Kong.

985
00:58:46,701 --> 00:58:50,090
This guy might've been from Singapore,
he might've been from New Hampshire,

986
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:53,990
I didn't talk to him, but up in the
uh, the lounge there, they had a,

987
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:57,030
they had these fucking,
they would make a dump like all right,

988
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,180
the fucking dumplings that
they make over there dude.

989
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:02,990
And they literally think if you dropped
them, if they would like float plane, no,

990
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:05,750
in the, in the airport.
Right, right, right, right.

991
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,870
So they keep coming out with
these dumplings and this
motherfucker keeps going

992
00:59:08,871 --> 00:59:10,970
up to and he would like take
seven out of eight of them.

993
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:14,720
He was a skinny bastard and he
was just fun. It was like a,

994
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:19,460
do you remember about Paul Newman and uh,
uh, get mad at them eggs. Cool Hand Luke.

995
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,620
He was eating them like fucking hand.

996
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:25,970
Luke just sticking up down his fucking
throat and they were delicious and it was

997
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:27,740
just like every time they
would bring them out,

998
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:32,150
I would have to like look over to make
sure I could go up there just to get some

999
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:36,200
for me and my wife. So this guy
must've been like 20 or 30 days,

1000
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,240
he'd fucking eat the whole
time he was up there,

1001
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,930
he child those goddamn
things and it, uh, I dunno,

1002
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:43,700
it Kinda put me in a
mood like I was calling,

1003
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:45,140
this is what Hong Kong
is going to be like,

1004
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,840
a bunch of selfish people eating
all the fucking dumplings.

1005
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:50,610
But then I had to quickly be like,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

1006
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,350
There's selfish assholes from
where I'm from and I'm one of them.

1007
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,890
So maybe I'm going to the promise land,
a travel review,

1008
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,360
Hong Kong by Bill Burr, a bunch of
selfish people eating dumplings. Fuck,

1009
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:05,870
this is based on one guy who was going
to Hong Kong who I don't even know if he

1010
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:10,040
was going there. I forget if he lived
there or if he was even Chinese. Um,

1011
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,760
so anyways, how do you watch
this shit all day? MSNBC or you?

1012
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:17,150
You seem like a news junkie.
I'm kind of a news junkie.

1013
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,060
I don't watch it intently,
but I,

1014
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:25,061
I like keep an on as wallpaper and
periodically glance over and see like,

1015
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:28,190
oh, shit's hit the fan. Holy Crap.

1016
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,830
It's been two hours
since shit's hit the fan.

1017
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:33,260
It's kind of more enjoyable
with like the sound down.

1018
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:36,980
I'm loving this guy on the right.
He has the exact same haircut.

1019
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:41,270
Is a Prince Charles sticks out
the exact same way? Yeah, it does.

1020
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:44,330
Except he's got more hair
on top if that's his hair.

1021
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:49,100
But what I like is that he's completely
covered in the graphic that the stock

1022
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:53,170
market is tanked today. Uh, they,
they do that to people. Like if I,

1023
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,020
I have to be on CNN, uh,
and what next week. Okay.

1024
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:59,360
And it's my first time. Oh, nice.

1025
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:04,160
So I'm going to be in one of those
squares and I just hope the stock market

1026
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:07,280
hasn't completely gone to shit and I
get blamed for it because that's what

1027
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:10,280
you'll remember is this
guy caused your stocks.

1028
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,380
I don't even know that that
was about the stock market.

1029
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:15,050
I just look at that guy going,
that guy's fucking is made.

1030
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,690
That's the haircut of you,

1031
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,970
that there's people right now that have
lost their pension because the stock

1032
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:20,631
market's down in,

1033
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:24,450
they're looking at this guy like it's only
down 300 285 bucks though, right? Yeah.

1034
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:27,350
Yeah. I mean that's not what that
is that through an $89? Yeah,

1035
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:31,970
it was like down 500 or something before,
I dunno. 500 bucks. What is 500 banks?

1036
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:35,450
I don't, I don't. I do. And it's
the worst. You can't get out of it.

1037
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,540
Usually pay attention to
it. Do you file? I don't.

1038
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:42,200
I just look at it like I'll never get
that money back in whatever's left when

1039
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:44,630
I'm 65 of you. Oh Shit.
I just view it. It's,

1040
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:49,300
it's like Las Vegas without all the
really gaudy like decorating and,

1041
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:53,690
and buffet food. It's just like Las Vegas.
I've done like, I've done okay in it,

1042
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,590
but I also,

1043
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:59,170
I invest conservatively and
with conspiracy theories.

1044
01:01:59,171 --> 01:02:03,680
So for the blue chip,
I go for like tangible shit,

1045
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,510
like people who make tangible shit.
And I'm of,

1046
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:10,550
I invested in all these companies that
were like digging for gold and stuff and

1047
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,490
then, cause I felt the
dollar's going to collapse.

1048
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:16,610
But then it dawned on me one day, it's
just like, well wait, at the end of this,

1049
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:17,810
I don't have any gold.

1050
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:22,490
So I bought them a bunch of shovels and
pickaxes to give to children somewhere

1051
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:26,860
to dig us out of the ground. And in the
end, oh, you know what I was talking to?

1052
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:28,080
Who the fuck was I talking to me?

1053
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:33,200
A friend in Chicago that is literally
made millions of fucking dollars.

1054
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,410
This is really sick. All right,
but I want you to listen to this.

1055
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:40,170
This is really emblematic
of what's going on today.

1056
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,030
Is this place haunted or is that somebody
hammering? No, that's somebody have,

1057
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:47,730
okay, just making sure destruction
zone right now. But this guy,

1058
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:48,480
uh,

1059
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,340
would wait for a mass shooting
and as soon as that happened,

1060
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:57,600
he would invest in gunstocks.
And sure enough,

1061
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:02,580
gunstocks would go up,
spike 25 points on the day.

1062
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:07,910
Like he come in there and go 100000 bucks
and just buy whatever gun stock after

1063
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:12,390
a mass shooting within three
days, he would sell it all
before it went back down.

1064
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:17,730
And he's made millions just
doing that now. Right. It's
kind of creepy, but it is.

1065
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,780
This is where we're at.
Right,

1066
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,010
right. But I'm trying, I wouldn't
try to make it that way. Now.

1067
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:22,440
What way can we do it?
What?

1068
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,860
Let's think of another disaster that
happens where we can make some money every

1069
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:30,620
time there's a slide. Do you invest
in what? Well, I don't know about it.

1070
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,430
Dryer, so I'm just investing
in part futures, man. Now
that Canada's going legal,

1071
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,280
I'm all in. I'm actually going to
join the stock market and uh, uh,

1072
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:44,850
I think a solar and wind and all these
other like new tech things are kind of a

1073
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:45,780
scam.
But I'm,

1074
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:50,781
I'm all into the pot market because we
saw what like alcohol didn't the 20s

1075
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:54,790
after the end of prohibition and uh,
all the mega,

1076
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:58,830
mega giant corporations that came out of
that, like Anheuser Busch and all this,

1077
01:03:58,831 --> 01:04:01,170
and I think pot's going
to be the same thing.

1078
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:04,170
It's not going to be a bunch
of mom pops in Marin county.

1079
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:08,160
It's going to be like huge.
Well, do we have a watch science?

1080
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:11,010
Yeah. I mean, have you
watched sewn on that? Uh,

1081
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:15,930
was it vice set the name of the channel
where they did like putting it into food?

1082
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:18,990
I mean it's becoming like this before
may thing overnight. Yeah. I Cook,

1083
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:23,070
I cook part food. Dude. You think
that'll ever happen for like heroin?

1084
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:25,850
Like today we're making
some opiate English muffins.

1085
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,390
Why don't you take like two bites in

1086
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:36,170
their urine test? Because they a
poppy seed muffins or so they claim,

1087
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,280
Oh, give me a fucking break. That's
what they claim. But I'm just saying,

1088
01:04:40,281 --> 01:04:42,460
so there is opiate food's already but

1089
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,890
poppy seed muffins after
they shot some heroin,

1090
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:49,220
that's why they fucking failed a test.
Let's say when people talk about,

1091
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:52,060
I used to joke about that when people like
say like, oh, it's, you know, I'm not,

1092
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:55,980
it's my metabolism. That's why
that's, that's the big scapegoat.

1093
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,450
I had metabolism, it's
really slow. It's like, yeah,

1094
01:04:58,451 --> 01:05:03,130
that and fucking 6,000 calories a
day that will make you artist shape.

1095
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:07,030
Um, so anyways, uh, all right, well let's,

1096
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,270
I think we're about to,

1097
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,990
this is the most effortless
fucking 58 minutes of my life. Um,

1098
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,370
I'm so psyched they
get made another album.

1099
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,130
I've heard the one track
twilight zone thing.

1100
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,320
I just video out, I saw the
video. I love that. And,

1101
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:24,160
and the new video comes out on March 9th,
two,

1102
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:28,750
not one of these like a concocted
by the label lyric videos,

1103
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:30,770
which we have no part of.
And I,

1104
01:05:30,771 --> 01:05:33,970
and I guess they're pretty good and
kids like him and all that, but we,

1105
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:37,420
we don't put in any really input
into that. That's the label.

1106
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:40,930
Just wanting you to get to know the
lyrics and things in the most basic way

1107
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:44,200
because people have the attention
span of a fucking bathroom, that,

1108
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:47,770
and this and that. Right.
This next one is, is a,

1109
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:49,570
we filmed it all on the same day,

1110
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,660
this twilight zone video
and then victims of a clown.

1111
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:57,280
So I haven't seen it yet. I should
be able to see in terms of a clown.

1112
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,920
Yeah, I should be able to
see it tonight. Actually.

1113
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:04,360
We get some rushers on it and I hope it's
as good as twilight zone because that

1114
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:08,230
one's pretty funny video man.
I'm out there hanging with a, um,

years and he comes from killing joke and

1131
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:05,140

1136
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:26,530
I'm not the best promo sexual youth.

1137
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,790
All right. Well but al has a new
album out. It's, it's called ministry.

1138
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:34,870
I look by its somewhere and he has a
website that has the name ministry,

1139
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,680
something like that. And he is on tour
somewhere. Those dates are available.

1140
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:42,460
It's like a treasure map. And at the end
you get the pot of gold. Just find it.

1141
01:07:42,461 --> 01:07:44,380
It's just white ministry.

1142
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:48,880
And either you'll get put to some Billy
Graham webpage or you'll get put to us,

1143
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:52,930
but I know that somewhere you'll wind up
on our page and you'll figure shit out.

1144
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,840

1146
01:07:57,581 --> 01:08:00,580
it's an honor that you wanted to come
onto my podcast to promote your album.

1147
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:05,140
I hope that you wanted to and it
wasn't your label making you do this.

1148
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:08,570
And this has been an uncomfortable, our
people doesn't even know about this. Oh,

01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:30,630
and just like, oh, well of course Chicago.

1173

01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:39,080
everyone thinks that they're all junkies
and they're going to look the same 20

trade contracts and shit.

1178
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:49,700
