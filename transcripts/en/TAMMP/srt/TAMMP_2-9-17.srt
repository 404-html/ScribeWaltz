1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,700
Hey, what's going on is bill burn is
time for them. Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,701 --> 00:00:06,930
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and yeah,

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,170
just checking in on you. Just checking
in on you, seen how your week's going.

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:14,200
How's your week going?
Hard.

5
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:18,630
Did your fucking team have another
championship parade? Like minded? Well,

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:22,130
you know what? I wish
it did. Why of function?

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,970
My town have all the goddamn success.
You know,

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,610
it's fucking unbelievable. I still
can't believe the one that fucking game,

9
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:31,370
but I'm not going to go.
Yeah.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,680
One and on and on and on and on and
on and on and on and on and on. Right.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,160
Um, I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina came
in and day before the comedy zone Gig.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,260
I went to the, uh, shall at horn.
It's versus the Brooklyn Nets,

13
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:47,880
you know, and when you try to go to
a home game, sorry, I'm going to,

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,330
I don't have my fucking microphone,
so I'm just recording. Right.

15
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:54,950
If my laptop's on, anytime I click on
something might be goddamn issue. Um,

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,480
but, uh, when you're trying to do
what it is that I've been doing,

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,810
which is to basically go to all of the,
uh,

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,830
to go to a home game of every fucking
team and all four major sports,

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,520
every once in a while you got to go
to a game. It's not the best game.

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,050
You've got to go see a couple of
franchises dead. Even though they,

21
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:17,150
they've had their moments, this
is not their time. They are,

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,060
are currently re rebuilding and that,

23
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,510
so that's what happened when we saw the
Charlotte Hornets play the Brooklyn Nets.

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,200
Um, a couple of nights ago, Jesus Christ,

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,180
it was, it was just like it was,
I dunno, I dunno what it was.

26
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,920
It was like a fucking WNB game.

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,910
WNB At its worst in the first couple
of seasons, you know, where they,

28
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,040
they just didn't look good to me.
They look way better now,

29
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,290
the fundamentals and all that,
if you watch any,

30
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:47,840
the WNB but those first few years I
couldn't understand why it looks so bad

31
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:52,770
cause women's college basketball look
better in a WNB. But Jesus Christ,

32
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:56,390
Charlotte, first, Brooklyn, Jewish,
Jewish, and I say that enough time,

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,400
oh this is how fucking
boring that game was.

34
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,690
The kids that played at halftime was
fucking more exciting cause they will run

35
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:07,650
in the court. Big smiles on their
faces was fucking hilarious.

36
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,640
The game was like subdued,
like you know, 16 to 14.

37
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:15,690
And it was all lay ups.
It was just all fucking run in the court.

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,360
Lay ups was tremendous.
And um, but anyways,

39
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:24,340
last night, uh, we went to, um, you know,

40
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:26,320
we worked the comedy zone and uh,

41
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:30,100
I did the smartest thing I've ever done
on the road in a long time was when the

42
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:34,750
show was over. I just went home
and I went to fucking bed. Um,

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,820
because the Charlotte Brooklyn night,
you know, I had a couple of flops,

44
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,860
about 17 and a. The next day
woke up. I'm like, what? What
the, what am I doing? Okay,

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,980
what the fuck am I doing? Okay,
I've got a newborn at home.

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,150
I can't get any God sleep. I'm on
the road now. I should be like a,

47
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,460
a fucking sober as a church mouse.
And just go right to bed.

48
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:58,100
And that's what I did last night.
Fucking phenomenal.

49
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,680
Other than God damn fucking cleaning
ladies coming by every 10 minutes.

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,290
Yeah.

51
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,370
Yeah. They didn't, they play some stain
and doesn't have the fuck off side.

52
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,360
Um, so they just keep
coming. Housekeeping.

53
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,700
I love when they fucking knock,

54
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,690
right housekeeping and then immediately
open the Goddamn door. There's that.

55
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,640
There's the lost art
of knocking on a door,

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,270
waiting for a response and then
coming in somewhere along the line.

57
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,840
These goddamn kids today. Oh yeah. I
just said that these God damn kids,

58
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,870
they think the fact they just
knocked that they can just,

59
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:38,490
w means they can then enter the room.
You knock, you wait for somebody to say,

60
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,320
you know, hang on a second or
blah blah, blah, blah, blah.

61
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,410
You don't just knock on a
fucking door and walk in.

62
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:50,130
You got to give the person a chance, you
know, put the dick away of something,

63
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:51,510
you know. Well, who
knows what they're doing.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,680
Maybe they're just sitting
there in their underwear, right.

65
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,920
I don't fucking know. She fucking knock.
And you wait and then you went to,

66
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,050
sorry,
I'm just saying it fucking can't stand.

67
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:08,250
That's one of my pet peeves in life.

68
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:13,230
People who knock and then
they just fucking walk in.
Um, that shit. Or if you know,

69
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,970
when you go into to a parking spot,

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,660
you know with two cars could fit and you
just stick your fucking cunt car right

71
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,494
in the middle of both.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,580
So no one can fit two cars can't fit
anymore unless you're driving a smart car.

73
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,220
Um, so anyways, tonight you probably
thinking, Jesus, Bill, I have to,

74
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,380
uh,
they're patriots super bowl.

75
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,580
Okay.

76
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,870
How could your sport,
I could just sportsworld get any better.

77
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,880
You know what I mean? Well, after, uh, uh,

78
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,420
a major dip I believe on Monday,
which I think they,

79
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,520
they did on purpose cause the Bruins had
a little gap in their schedule with all

80
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:54,120
the buzz about it. The patriots
excuse, we have yard already care.

81
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,540
Be a good time to get rid
of, uh, quote Julian. And uh,

82
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,370
I just want to thank coach Julian for,
uh,

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,440
being the best Bruins coach since
I've been watching them. Um,

84
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,470
for the last, you know,
close to 40 years. Um,

85
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,530
chasesL is Farzeen everybody.

86
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,110
[inaudible] I'm doing my podcast.
All right.

87
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,220
Do you think or no? Uh, just the Thursday
one. I'll be done like a half hour.

88
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,670
All right, cool. Hey Paul,

89
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:33,980
you go eat those eggs and then I'll
meet your first team. All right.

90
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:38,310
We got breakfast coming in and like 20.
When it's done, I'll call you. Okay. Okay,

91
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:41,140
pal. Okay. All right. The acuity

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,990
anyways.
Um,

93
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,720
okay.

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,670
The fuck. What the fuck was I talking
about? Yeah. [inaudible] Julian,

95
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:56,230
Jesus Christ. I'd never seen a guy
more of a victim of the GM and for the,

96
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,380
I do not that fucking move whatsoever.

97
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,510
You know, I guess maybe if he had a
fallen out with the people up top,

98
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:08,930
I have no idea. But, um, how,

99
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,500
how you just going to blame it on him
and not get rid of your fucking GM?

100
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:17,180
I don't know what they see in this.
Our GM, I have no fucking idea.

101
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:21,980
I don't know. Uh, I have no
idea what this guy's doing.

102
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,310
I mean he got rid of everybody and
I just didn't, I don't see they,

103
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,520
we actually were playing our best
hockey of the year. I felt, you know,

104
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,630
we won three in a row. Lost a tough one
of the fucking capital's not a tough one.

105
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,770
They actually kicked our ass five to two.
But I mean what the fuck?

106
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:38,390
They're the capitals. We didn't do
bad for a seven seat. I don't know.

107
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,240
I think it's a dumb move.
You get rid of the guys like okay,

108
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:45,200
you want to get rid of the guy? Who are
you to replace them with? WHO's out there?

109
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,610
You know, and it actually tweeted
congratulations to every year,

110
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,840
every other NHL team out there that needs
a fucking coach that knows how to win

111
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:56,630
a cup. Um, cause that's
what we just dumped.

112
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,070
Um,
I dunno,

113
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,580
I don't get to ship that stuff where
the ownership gives into the fan base.

114
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,030
It's like what are they listening to?
The fucking Dope said.

115
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:13,270
Call into sports talk radio.
I've never called it a sports talk.

116
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,210
I watch sports all the fucking time.

117
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,590
I would never call it a sports
talk radio show, you know,

118
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:22,080
just specifically to talk
about the sports thing. I mean,

119
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:26,400
I'll call it into hyper show,
you know, whore myself out. Oh,

120
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:30,450
I would absolutely do that.
I was speaking of whoring myself out.

121
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,970
Um, well wait, wait, wait,
wait. Let me get it back. So,
uh, thank you. Hello Julian.

122
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,840
And uh, for bringing us the
Stanley Cup and uh, and in, uh,

123
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,680
you know, 40 year drought, um,

124
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,410
and continued success wherever you go.

125
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,150
I know you're going to
do great wherever you go.

126
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,290
Hopefully you got a better GM at
the next place you'd go up to. Um,

127
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,190
so anyways,
um,

128
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,790
after all my ranting and
raving about a award shows,

129
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,800
I think I might be a presenter at one.

130
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,830
All Hollywood bill is the
a writer's guild awards.

131
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,240
And um, they asked me to be a presenter
or whatever. And at first I was like, Nah,

132
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,910
I'm not going to go down and do that
fucking bullshit. But then, you know what,

133
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,670
I'm actually, I guess soften
enough or selling out,
depends on how you look at it.

134
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:24,870
But what I realize is that on our show,

135
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,320
um, it's those award shows
are a big deal for, uh,

136
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,520
for the writers because that's
how they actually get money.

137
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,880
So if you win an Emmy,
um,

138
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,510
or a writer's guild or
sag thing or whatever,

139
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,380
it's great for the writers in the
writer's room cause they can say that they

140
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:46,920
wrote on an Emmy award winning show
and Blah, blah, blah, blah blah.

141
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,390
So old freckles has to play
the game a little bit. Um,

142
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,060
go put on a God damn monkey suit. It's
a fucking black tie thing. I got to go,

143
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,590
I'm going to go to one of those fucking
from places where they had the cheap

144
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:04,130
tuxedos cause I don't think
anybody can fucking tell,

145
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,930
just come out in those God
damn plastic bowling shoes. Um,

146
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,040
I know who the fuck decided that they
wanted me to be a fucking presenter,

147
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,190
but like if they've never,

148
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,910
they've obviously never listened
to me read out loud on a,

149
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,250
on my podcast. But, uh, I don't know.

150
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,860
I figured this would be a good one to
try out to see what I, to think about it.

151
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:26,970
Because a, it's not televised, you know?

152
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,190
And um,

153
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,460
I don't know if we'll see if I can
actually read out loud. I Dunno.

154
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,220
Knee has been on me about the shit. You
got gotta do it. You can't play in a game.

155
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,780
All right.
I'm playing the fucking game.

156
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,910
Why make a fucking difficult business
even more? God damn difficult. Um,

157
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,270
so fuck it. I'll give it, I'll
let you guys know how that goes.

158
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:51,300
How am I reading out loud, if that's
in fact what they have? Me Too,

159
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,500
but it's not bad. It's only
like two hours long. Um,

160
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,010
so it kind of seems like the best one
to go to and Patton Oswald is hosting it

161
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,330
and I think he's a fucking genius.

162
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:03,840
So at least I'll get to
listen to his monologue, um,

163
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,170
that I am without a doubt.
I'm going to get the fuck.

164
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:11,250
I'm going to get a nice fucking,
I'm going to get a senior prom special,

165
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,730
the clip on fucking tie
and all of that shit.

166
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,270
That's like the dumbest shit ever to go
out and go buy some expensive Tuxedo.

167
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,950
It's like, what are you a
fucking Rockefeller? Uh,

168
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,420
but I guess people trashed you then,

169
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:31,530
right when you've watched walk the
red carpet or something like that. Um,

170
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,270
so anyways,
so there you go.

171
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:36,840
There's my full of shit
moment after making fun of
all those fucking award shows.

172
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,150
Uh, I'm actually going to
work. Go to one. I don't know.

173
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:44,670
What are you going to do the
fuck am I going to do right?

174
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm doing it for the tape keg.
Can I get out of it by saying that?

175
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,470
So anyways, I was saying,
um, how my, um, my,

176
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:57,470
uh, my sporting world, how it
could get any better after the, uh,

177
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,280
the Patriots win and then they, uh, the,

178
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,330
the let down of seeing them give into the
fan pressure or whatever the fuck they

179
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,820
did. Get rid of coach Julian. Um,

180
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,460
tonight be frizzy and,
uh,

181
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Joe Barnick or doing a bucket list thing
for any person that's even remotely

182
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:21,770
into sports. We're going to
the, uh, the Duke versus, uh,

183
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,870
North Carolina Tarheels game tonight,
and we've got some great seats.

184
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:29,930
Was sitting right behind
the fucking dude bench.

185
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,160
Coach K is going to be there if it
wasn't so God damn loud in that place,

186
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,670
we could hear him, you know, during
the time outs and everything,

187
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:42,230
it's going to be crazy. So, uh, I dunno,
it was a chance you might see the three,

188
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,320
three of us dummies on TV.
Um,

189
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,150
but beyond excited to go to this like
this is, this is a fucking huge one.

190
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,550
This is a huge one.
Um,

191
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,230
as far as the bucket list sports
stuff to go two years ago I told you,

192
00:11:56,231 --> 00:12:00,760
I don't know if I told you guys
I went to the, um, I went to a

193
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:01,920
okay.

194
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,420
Indiana university
versus, um, what was it?

195
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,190
Michigan state and I believe it was
the year that Michigan State won the

196
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,970
National Championship and Bobby Knight
was still coaching there and um,

197
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,150
okay.

198
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,930
I've never seen anything like that.
All the years, everything I've ever,

199
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,910
every sporting event I've ever gone to,

200
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,180
I have never seen anything like
watching Bobby Knight coach a game.

201
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,550
I mean, that guy, you watched him as much,

202
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:33,820
if not more than you
were watching the game.

203
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,560
I was actually rooting for the Spartans.
You know,

204
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,950
I came there rooting for Indiana,
but Bobby was so fucking entertaining.

205
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,820
I started rooting for the Spartans
because I wanted to see him flip out even

206
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:49,710
more. I've never seen
somebody, yeah, yeah.

207
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:53,460
She made me feel good about myself,
like just complete loss of composure

208
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,980
obviously, or whatever his
coaching style motivating people.

209
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:02,550
I remember they let up a couple
of easy buckets and this kid,

210
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,390
the point guard starts bringing it up to
court and Bobby Knight is like 10 feet

211
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,100
onto the court and he's yelling so much.
He's like juicy.

212
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,380
Uh, was it Ben Kingsley and
sexy base? When he, when he's,

213
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,253
when he's yelling,

214
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,490
it'd be in a right content and he's like
thrown his head into everything that

215
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,350
he's saying.
That's what the fuck he was doing.

216
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,820
But it was way more intense because
he wasn't acting. He was serious.

217
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,780
And um, I've never fucking
seen anything like that.

218
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:35,680
And that's one of my favorite of
everything that I've seen in sports.

219
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,940
The coolest thing ever is that I got
to see Bobby Knight Coach at Indiana

220
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:41,680
University. Man, that's fucking legendary.

221
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,700
Like scenes Zeplin or seeing the Beatles,
you know,

222
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,230
James Brown or whatever.
Like you know that's right up there.

223
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,940
I saw Eddie Murphy on the Rod tour.
I saw [inaudible]. He's my brother.

224
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,950
Think greatest things I've seen
Eddie Murphy on the raw tour.

225
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,680
I saw when he went to purple suit,
I saw Bobby Knight Coach at Indiana.

226
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,193
MMM.

227
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,530
The fuck did I go from there?
So Judas Priest and the Turbo Lover Tour,

228
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,423
does that count?

229
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,660
I know I saw Stevie Ray Vaughan.

230
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,873
MMM.

231
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,380
I saw Dan Marino kick the
shit out of the Patriots.

232
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,023
MMM.

233
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,900
With Don Shula coaching. That's
the one great thing. Yeah,

234
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,850
it will be in an old guys.

235
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,530
You can start talking about all
this shit since I can note that now.

236
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:34,030
Fucking no longer exists.

237
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,560
So I actually made a few guys who just
bear with me clicking here. Sorry.

238
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:40,510
I know it's fucking loud as hell.
I know.

239
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:44,050
It's annoying and you're going to
listen to it again right now. All right.

240
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,270
I actually looked through,
um,

241
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,590
I got this,
this document teams scene

242
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,540
and um,

243
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,670
yeah,

244
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,540
I have seen 31
I been to a home game.

245
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,460
If every major league baseball team,

246
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,430
I haven't been to all the stadiums
cause like the mets changed.

247
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,780
There's got a new one.
Philly's got a new one. Um,

248
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,820
but I've seen a total of 31.

249
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,710
There's 30 professional baseball teams.
I've seen 31 cause I went to the expos.

250
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,170
Um, I've seen 32 home games
of the NFL. There's 32 teams,

251
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,660
but I still need to see the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers there.

252
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:28,550
The last one I need to see, but I saw
the Saint Louis and the fucking, um,

253
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,720
the Saint Louis and the
fucking, uh, La Rams.

254
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:38,800
So that's how I got up to 32.
I've seen 25 NBA teams.

255
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,710
Uh,
one of those being the a,

256
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:45,940
I saw both the Seattle Sonics and the,
uh,

257
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,500
Oklahoma City Thunder.
Um,

258
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,700
and I saw the New Jersey Nets. Now I got
to go see the fucking Brooklyn that's

259
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:01,320
speaking of which I also saw the fucking,
oh,

260
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,980
I see the fucking, the islanders at
Nassau Coliseum. Now if they don't,

261
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,020
if they don't become the Brooklyn
fucking islanders,

262
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,600
then uh,
then I don't need to go see him.

263
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,850
It's like if you change your food
that they're still in New York.

264
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:16,220
You know what I mean? I don't need
to fucking do that. So I've seen 27

265
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,610
of the 30 fucking, uh, I
got three more to see in,

266
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:27,320
um, in hockey. So I'm going to try to
knock those out over the next year.

267
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,260
The Fan Slam is what I'm
calling it, you know, you know,

268
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:34,400
Serena's fucking the Serena Slam.
This is just the fence slam the fucking,

269
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,720
you know, you have no life.
You run the fucking road.

270
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,680
You don't want to kill
yourself in a comedy condo.

271
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:44,080
So you start building it
around home games. Um, back,

272
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,160
she made a list and I don't
know if you're not a sports fan,

273
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:47,300
this is going to bore the shit out of you.

274
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:51,440
But these are all the fucking places
I've been to that now no longer exist.

275
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,870
Uh, the Boston Garden, Sullivan
Stadium, a Yankee Stadium, Shea Stadium,

276
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,250
veteran's stadium, three rivers
stadium, soon to be no longer there.

277
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,910
Joe Louis Arena,
the RFCA slash Hoosier dome.

278
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,280
I saw Peyton manning there.
Uh,

279
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,160
I saw a game it original soldier field.

280
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,420
Got a picture and then this fucking
asshole stole my God damn camera.

281
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,770
I would say at a picture of
me. And uh, when I went to, um,

282
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,210
a green bay packers, that game
was a, um, was a preseason game.

283
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,900
They played the browns bread five or
it was still there. The verse, he says,

284
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:30,660
I can't count that one cause it's
pretty seasoned. But the reality is,

285
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:33,060

457
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,810
That's Delta, Sierra, tango,
Lima, Delta. All right,

458
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,740
let's get back to the top of the
page here and finish this out.

459
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,000
Um,
all right.

460
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,350
Has that been a half an hour? I have no
idea. I never know whenever I'm fucking

461
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,590
recording on just the garage
band thing here. So, uh,

462
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,860
we're going to go to the
game here tonight. Um,

463
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,550
I can't believe I'm going to see them
be this close to fucking coach k.

464
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,770
I know Duke's having a
tough time this year,

465
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:19,700
but coach k's back from
back surgery and um,

466
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,500
he did that thing where he,
uh,

467
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,830
I guess every once in a while I
get so disgusted with his team.

468
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:26,530
He doesn't let them wear any dupe.

469
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,350
Yeah.

470
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,080
Gear.

471
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,970
And he won't let him in the locker room
until they start playing at a fucking

472
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,820
level that the university is used to see.

473
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,200
You've got to love that old school
coaching. That made me look up like, um,

474
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,180
you know,

475
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,540
I was looking up all this stuff on coach
k and I didn't realize that when he was

476
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:47,030
in army he played for Bobby Knight.

477
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,270
I didn't know that he assisted
with Bobby Knight and all that.

478
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,890
And there's all these
great fucking pictures.

479
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,000
You got to see the way Bobby Knight is
dressed in 1979 in Puerto Rico when he

480
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,450
set the pan and games of course he
ended up getting arrested because he

481
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,820
allegedly slapped a cop
or something like that.

482
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,183
Yeah.

483
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,390
You want to talk about a guy that needs
to fucking meditate? Jesus Christ. Um,

484
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,410
so anyways,
uh,

485
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,040
I was watching all this stuff where's
coach sent me down this rabbit hole of

486
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:16,970
Bobby Knight stuff

487
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,340
and um,
you know,

488
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,190
my favorite clip of all the Bobby
Knight ones was when somebody secretly

489
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:28,490
recorded him cause I feel like that
was the real Bobby Knight is I thought

490
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:32,510
towards the end he kind of was,
was doing the Bobby Knight thing.

491
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:35,680
Like when he did that game face thing.
I think at that point he was just,

492
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,030
he started like hamming it up when he
didn't need to. But like when you listen,

493
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,040
that one where he's talking about the
Purdue game coming up and that he has an

494
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:48,400
eight and 10 record, um, I swear to God,

495
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:53,401
I'm going to start listening to that
speech before I go to the gym because I

496
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:56,220
actually listened to that thing and he's
talking about how he had to go to some

497
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:58,170
function and he goes,
I'm sitting down,

498
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,540
I'm tired to sit down with a fucking
eight and 10 record every fucking look.

499
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,620
I'm sick and fucking tired. Oh,
this isn't a fucking burrito.

500
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:05,920
Okay,

501
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,030
you guys get the fuck out there. Said some
of the, if you fucking lose to Purdue,

502
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,790
you put me in that fucking position. I
will fucking run you something until you,

503
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,340
I don't know, something about
puking or whatever. It's,

504
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,980
it's just such a great speech.
And in the end of it,

505
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,350
my natural reaction, I laughed and
just said, that's how it's done.

506
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,480
And, uh, I know we got a lot of criticism
for the stuff that he did, but, um,

507
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,870
I think a lot of that criticism came
from people that are not athletic.

508
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,980
We're never in a locker
room. And, um, you know,

509
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:44,090
they came from that hole,

510
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,100
they actually had bad experiences in
sports and listening to Bobby Knight Yell,

511
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,760
I think just brought all their sucking
in gym class memories back and,

512
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:57,780
um,
I dunno,

513
00:30:57,781 --> 00:31:01,950
it's like there's this certain type of
person that is a fucking athlete and can

514
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:06,030
handle that and understands
what the fuck that is. And, uh,

515
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,160
I think if they don't
have a problem with it,

516
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,240
all these people who don't play sports
should just shut the fuck up about it

517
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:17,080
because you don't understand
what's going on. And, um, I mean,

518
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:17,591
Jesus Christ,

519
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:22,120
Bobby Knight won almost a thousand fucking
games and all his former players for

520
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:24,910
the most part love him. And, um,

521
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,830
and I always felt that kid that lasts
fucking incident that Bobby Knight had.

522
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,453
Um,

523
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,530
I thought that felt that kid was baiting
him cause Bobby Knight walked by and I

524
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:38,290
think the kids said,
what's up night? You know,

525
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,980
say that that's totally disrespectful
and night just had that fucking temper

526
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:45,060
zero to fucking 9,000. Um, but I,

527
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:49,120
I mean when I heard that story is like
that kid was being a fucking cunt. Um,

528
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,670
but you can't do that shit anymore.

529
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,000
At least during his heyday there
was no cell phone cameras, man.

530
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,920
He really would have gotten a lot of
trouble because they would have been

531
00:31:57,921 --> 00:32:01,160
fucking video of that.
And I would have loved every second.

532
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,540
I would have loved every
second of watching him grab
some student by the fucking

533
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:09,490
throat who just did what's
up night guys walking around.

534
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,670
900 fucking wins. Some sophomore
comes by. That's come on.

535
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,290
Um, so anyways, yeah. So we're going
to be hitting that game tonight. Um,

536
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,720
if anybody knows a oh by the way, I have
to give a shout out man. I went to a,

537
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:27,080
um, this is my new thing now
and I'm on the road, you know,

538
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:31,700
cause I got my beautiful little daughter
up at home and I can't play drums as

539
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:36,110
much, you know, uh, knee is still lets me
rehearse and stuff like that. You know,

540
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:40,280
never rehearse like practice and
shit when uh, what I'm homeless

541
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,410
feed the kids up blood.
Um,

542
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,510
I haven't been able to
go to a, uh, you know,

543
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,230
the practice place that I go to
out in La as much as I would like.

544
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,870
So I'm like one, I'm on the road out
or look up these rehearsal spaces.

545
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:59,340
So I looked up this place when I was in
Charlotte, it's called the playground.

546
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,590
And um,
I went down,

547
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,860
shout out to Eddie z who runs it totally
fucking one of the coolest dudes I've

548
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:12,120
met. A lot of these rehearsal
spaces are just absolute shit.

549
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:17,400
The drum kits are old. Everything's
fucked up. Everything sounds like shit.

550
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:20,430
I went into this place, this place
was like a fucking FirstClass place.

551
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,370
He stopped me in the best
room that they had a,

552
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:26,430
at a discount price cause they were doing
construction on some other rooms that

553
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:28,890
he didn't want them, you know, disturb
me or whatever while I was playing,

554
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,400
I played for like fucking three hours.
Well,

555
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:34,580
I paid for three hours long
to get it to about, you know,

556
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,850
two hours and 20 minutes in my body was
like giving out on me and I just had the

557
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,760
best fucking time. And you know
what I loved when I went in there,

558
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:46,620
the snare drum was tuned to low and I was
able to tune it up to some pretty good.

559
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,630
And I used to not even remotely have a
game plan on how to tune up the snare.

560
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,820
And um, I was really
psyched about that. Uh,

561
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,433
but anyways,

562
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,160
this guy at z was saying he,

563
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:09,180
he actually used to be a roadie for
van Halen and he was on the 1984 tour,

564
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,130
the last phone with David Lee Roth and a,

565
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:16,110
then he did a couple with Sammy Hagar.

566
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:19,590
So he had all these fucking
really cool pictures,

567
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:24,080
just originals that he
took of like Sammy and, uh,

568
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,460
Eddie van Halen and David Lee Roth
was really fucking cool. And uh,

569
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,330
I had the best time and
like that's going to be on.

570
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:32,670
So what I'm to do when I'm on the road,
now that I'm,

571
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,060
I'm back building up the hour,

572
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,500
work in the comedy clubs
like the old days. Uh,

573
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,860
it had such a great time last night on
stage, uh, comedy zone. Do comedy zones,

574
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:46,680
one of the best fucking comedy
clubs up there. By the way,

575
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,060
if you can find the God damn thing,
he got to,

576
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:54,000
he walked in and there's like a cafeteria,
then a bar and there's, there's a sign.

577
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:57,180
This is comedy zone and nobody tells you.
You got to like ask like 20 people.

578
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,820
It's like you're feeling
your way through the dark.

579
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,390
Did finally go down those stairs that
go down there, but just the hallway,

580
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,140
there's the stage is set up.
Um,

581
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,000
it seems like every seat in
the house is a good seat. Um,

582
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,840
you know, I'm obviously, I've never
sat in the crowd out there, but uh,

583
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,750
just had the best time working
the shit out. I did two shows,

584
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:19,410
both shows I was able to do a little
over an hour just pasting together new

585
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:24,000
ideas that I have and then old bits that,
you know, never made it on to specials.

586
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,630
And I'm just, I don't
know. This is, this is,

587
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,221
you wouldn't think so,

588
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:32,610
but this is one of my favorite times
of doing stand up is just letting

589
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:37,611
everything else go and just trying to
figure out like what the new shit's going

590
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:41,610
to be. You know, I'm reading
newspapers, I'm writing shit down.

591
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,530
Anything that I can
throw against the wall.

592
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,550
Last night I was on stage talking about
how fucking human beings are edible,

593
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,980
like, and everyone was
like, what the fuck?

594
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,360
And that'd be something
that I would abandoned,

595
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,490
but I had no material and I
just kept going with it. And um,

596
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,750
should, I dunno, it just takes
me back to my early days.

597
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,900
Um, I was stand up when, uh,
because you, your skills,

598
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,400
like if you don't have the material,

599
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,490
it just complete your skills
to completely diminish,

600
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,310
even though you have the poise and,
and the,

601
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:16,560
the skillset because you've
been doing it that long,

602
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:21,480
but it's just completed just from imagine
a band if they had to like just work

603
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:26,160
at workshops, some rifts in front of a
fucking crowd without like rehearsing.

604
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:30,720
That's the greatest thing about the art
of standup comedy is that you can't,

605
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,370
you can't go to rehearsal space and get
the shit together and then fucking like

606
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:36,204
you have to

607
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,460
second you like coming up with
riffs in front of the fucking crowd.

608
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,410
Um, and it's, uh, yeah, it's fucking work.

609
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,180
It's absolute work. But, um, I
dunno. I'm a fucking lunatic,

610
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:55,320
so I totally enjoy this part of it. So
anyways, that is the podcast. Once again,

611
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:59,700
thanks to whoever it is that
owns these two seats, um,

612
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,280
whoever that is getting
in with the comedy zone,

613
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:07,690
you have free tickets to any comedy
show that I ever do for life,

614
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,370
front row, whatever the fuck you want,
forgiven given up these tickets. Um,

615
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,300
Jan, thank you enough. This is
going to be amazing. So, um,

616
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,680
we're on our way up to a Durham
and I was just out there,

617
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:22,830
so I know a couple of good
spots to eat at. So, uh,

618
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,230
we're going to have a good
time. All right. That's the
podcast. Go fuck yourselves.

619
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,170
Have a great weekend.
[inaudible] and I will talk to you a,

620
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:31,940
I'll talk to you on Monday. I'll let
you know about the game. All right.

621
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,500
Uh,

622
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,070
Ooh.

623
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,603
Yeah.

624
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:59,170
Hey, what's up? This is bill bar and
a, this is the Monday morning podcast.

625
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,820
I just did a 50 minute podcast.
I tried to save it and uh,

626
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,440
didn't once again this week.

627
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,500
Talk for a fucking hour
evidently to nobody. Um,

628
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,570
I'm going to have to buy some sort of
device so I can save him so I can try and

629
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:19,420
put them back up. I don't
know what to tell Ya, but uh,

630
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:20,890
I don't even know if this
one's going to record.

631
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,750
I don't know if I'm going too long.

632
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,150
I don't even know who the
fuck I'm supposed to call.

633
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,180
Who the fuck do I call sound like I call
this number on anybody you can talk to

634
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:35,080
kicks up. You know, typical
of how we're living.

635
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,180
You know, I was on the fucking
airplane flying out to Boston, right?

636
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:44,950
I'm on the airplane and for some reason
they always have the fucking intercom's

637
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:49,070
turned all the way up to 10, right? Hello.

638
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,750
Is My goddamn ear drums out? So I
say the lady, she walks by, I go,

639
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:57,280
is there any way you can turn the
thing down? He's like, Nah, I die.

640
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:00,370
There's nothing we can do. The fuck do
you mean there's nothing you can do?

641
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:04,210
You can call up there, you can
fucking turn it down. But it would,

642
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,250
they be installed an intercom system

643
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,400
on 10 with no fucking volume,
whatever. Fuck this technology shit.

644
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,211
I got to figure out.

645
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:15,920
Somebody sent me an email about
something that I can record into.

646
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,790
I'm going to try to find that.
I guess I got to go out and buy it,

647
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,830
but I apologize.
Um,

648
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm gonna try to do one again
tomorrow or something like that. Uh,

649
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,300
oh Jesus. It was such a great podcast.
God dammit. All right. Whatever.

650
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,900
I'm going to try it tomorrow.
So all 14 are you hanging in there?

651
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,090
I'm going to do a podcast
tomorrow. Alright. Take it easy.

652
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
[inaudible] Hey,

653
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:17,654
what's up?

654
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,740
Um, I don't know what the fuck is
wrong with his cheek cast thing,

655
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:23,690
but I have figured out
how to save my podcast.

656
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,460
All I had to do was press number two
for some reason I wasn't hearing that,

657
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,590
you know,
I dunno she was saying it or whatever.

658
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:37,210
The computer with the fucking
female voice has been saying it,

659
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:38,800
but I don't know what's
going on with this thing.

660
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:40,930
It seems anytime I record
something for longer than,

661
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,590
I dunno what a fucking go through,
but I know how to save him.

662
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,060
So all I'm saying is from here on out,
um,

663
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,840
I won't lose any more podcasts,

664
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:54,450
but I'm going to do a podcast tomorrow
and I'm going to save the thing and

665
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:56,190
hopefully I can publish it.
All right.

666
00:40:56,191 --> 00:40:59,730
Thank you for your patience and God
bless the United States of America.

667
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,880
So [inaudible]

668
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,630
hey, what's going on? It's bill. It
is the Monday morning. My podcast,

669
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,230
I'm going to said poured
the Monday morning podcast,

670
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,090
we'll Guyland six 18
on a fucking Wednesday.

671
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,560
And I learned how to save these
podcasts and he go, this is the podcast.

672
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,950
This is it. I'm doing one
take. I don't give a fuck.

673
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,700
I've already done it three times and
I'm running a red light and I made it.

674
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,930
Good deal. Good deal. Oh Hey
you guys, you guys got cameras,

675
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,090
you've got cameras where you're at.
You know,

676
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:04,130
you run a red light and they
take your fucking picture

677
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,940
and then for some reason you have
to pay the fucking ticket. Um,

678
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,190
I got a way around it.
I got away around it that I've learned.

679
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,670
Somebody told me all you gotta
do when you run the red light,

680
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:22,400
he's gotta be in the center.
You know, if there's two lanes,

681
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,870
just be in the middle,

682
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,040
have half your car in one lane after car
and the other lane and it doesn't get

683
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:32,450
your full license plate or your
full face and you throw it.

684
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,940
Granted,
I haven't tried that yet,

685
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:39,170
but I heard you can do
that also is another way.

686
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,330
When I got my car out here in
Los [inaudible]. Evidently,

687
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:50,650
evidently there's so many
fucking people out here that, uh,

688
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,420
that, you know, it takes, I swear to God,

689
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:57,110
it took like four weeks or six weeks
for me to get my license plates,

690
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:58,280
something ridiculous.

691
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,660
So basically I drove around
for well over a month

692
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,710
with just the name of the
dealership where I bought my car,

693
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:12,500
act on both the front and the back.
And one day as luck would have it,

694
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,850
I was like going to the airport and I ran
a fucking red and they took my picture

695
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,820
and I flipped out and I was
like, ah, fuck. You know,

696
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,820
that's me flipping out that fuck
sake. I stink at acting. That's good.

697
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:28,430
Bill, could you raise the stakes you
want to? I really did. I was like,

698
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:32,090
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
This is fucking punk shit.

699
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,830
That's what I really did. But I
didn't want to yell like that. And um,

700
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,120
but basically all they had was a picture
of the deal is, and my stupid a face,

701
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,990
so I never got the ticket.
Why am I admitting to this?

702
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,610
Can they use this in a court of law?

703
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,720
Come and get me say so anyways,

704
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:54,350
I'm driving down the street and I don't
have my laptop with me so I don't have

705
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:55,184
your questions,

706
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,180
but God knows I read them enough times
that I can actually remember him once.

707
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:04,460
So here's the first question
somebody asked me, hey bill,

708
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:09,850
what kind of drum kit do you have and
where you're having a band and if so,

709
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:12,690
do you have any good band stories?
All right.

710
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:18,490
I have a late seventies Slingerland
five ply the fireflies shells and nobody

711
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:22,160
wants, everybody wants to three
ply shells from the late sixties,

712
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:26,150
early seventies to get that great tone.
Whatever the fuck they're talking about.

713
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:29,270
Well fortunately I'm a comedian
so I don't give a fuck. I'll take,

714
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,870
I'll take the extra two plies. And uh,
basically yeah, they're all Bonham sizes.

715
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,390
14 by 24 bass drum.

716
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:42,110
I had a 13 [inaudible] 14 and
then an 18 inch floor Tom.

717
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,090
So years later I bought
the 16 inch floor Tom.

718
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:49,560
And recently I had another bass drum
cause I was listening to the Primus and I

719
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:49,951
was like,

720
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:54,360
I want to play like Tim Alexander even
though I already had a double pedal.

721
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,430
I'm like,
I'm going to add another base drum pedal.

722
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,600
Cause that guy from slayer said it's
not the same unless you have the fucking

723
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,011
both of them.

724
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:06,930
So I went out and I bought another bass
drum and I should have realized the fact

725
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:10,110
that I suck with the double pedal,
that they added a second bass drum.

726
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,560
All it was going to do was just take up
more room and it wouldn't make me any

727
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:18,330
better a drummer, but I did it.
So, uh, yeah, that's what I played.

728
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,860
I got an old Slingerland kit and
have I ever been in a band? No,

729
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,590
I was never in a band.
I just had a fucking,

730
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,940
I did the drums were at my house
so everybody came over to jam man.

731
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,680
And we sucked.

732
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,710
Which is why everybody who ever
came over and now has a real job.

733
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,440
Um, yeah, that's it. I
don't have any rock star.

734
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:47,310
I don't even need to fucking
Dan stories other than that.

735
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,250
We stunk the usual shit.

736
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:55,770
And the next question somebody
asked me was, what the fuck was,

737
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:56,604
the question

738
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,160
was some question about I guess late
at night they got these new economy

739
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:07,710
dentures, something like that.
That's what the person asked me.

740
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:11,690
Have you seen these economy dentures?
What the fuck is this? And uh,

741
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,970
it's actually a really
interesting question because
I used to work in a dental

742
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:18,480
office and I know a little
something about dentures. Huh?

743
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,540
We're going to meet peeling off another
layer of the onion as Madonna says.

744
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,090
You know, she actually had the
balls to say that one time.

745
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,740
She doesn't have any balls. God
knows. We've all seen her Twat, um,

746
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,350
that she actually had the nerve to say
that when she did yet another totally

747
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:41,940
planned out. You know, look, I
can dress like a whore this way.

748
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,910
Nice fucking parking job.
You fucking idiot.

749
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,360
Fuck. I swear to God, man.
People just, you know,

750
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,810
people cannot fucking drive out
here in la. They really can't.

751
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,750
Like a lot of people don't know that.
All they talk about is the traffic.

752
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,970
Who are good. It's good if you could so
fucking bad man. Well, you know what,

753
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:07,930
when it clears up the driving get, then
people can actually drive the, their uh,

754
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,280
I have established it's
before, you know, they fucking,

755
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:13,470
they suck at driving out here.
Look at that homeless guy.

756
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:17,590
There's a homeless guy out here, I swear
to God, he looks like George Clinton, um,

757
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,430
from parliament. Anybody. So anyways,

758
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,770
you're asking me what
these economy dentures are.

759
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,690
I'm going to guess that they
are a one size fits all denture,

760
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,960
which really fucking bizarre.
And I bet um,

761
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,860
on the upper it has some sort of form
fitting thing that will fit to your

762
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:42,970
palate. It's horrific because when you get
a denture, you're actually supposed to,

763
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,540
you know, this impressions,
you pour up a model. You know,

764
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,710
if they took out some teeth,

765
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,840
they tried to get the teeth
to look like your other teeth.

766
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,280
So you don't freak people out.

767
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:54,730
Like one day you look like a witch and
the next day you come walking in and look

768
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,310
like Guy Smiley.
You know,

769
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,790
I used to work in a dental office.
I actually am certified to take x rays.

770
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,210
I can take impressions.
The upper impression was the worst.

771
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,970
I'd always get some. I'm just going to
let you know that I'm a gagger. I gag.

772
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,380
Really?

773
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,080
Why don't you just brush you fucking
teeth so I don't have to worry about you

774
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:21,280
throwing up on the fucking
left sleeve of my, uh,

775
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,280
like what, what do you
call it? The doctor robe.

776
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,470
The doctor coat or whatever.
Yeah.

777
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:30,970
I used to take the impressions
and people used to always gag

778
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,200
when you do the top. And if you
hang in there another eight seconds,

779
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,460
and then they always have, then
they'd always say, yeah, God,

780
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:42,910
I fucking hate the dentists. Really? Well,
why don't you brush your fucking teeth?

781
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:47,710
You idiot. You know? I
guess I do the same thing.

782
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,060
I ain't going to the gym,

783
00:48:49,061 --> 00:48:53,860
but God knows I'm going to go order
a fucking pizza right now. Jesus,

784
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,370
I'm going to move. So yeah,
that's what I would guess.

785
00:48:56,371 --> 00:48:58,180
So basically after you
took the impressions,

786
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:02,050
if you want to know the whole fucking
process and the person's going every five

787
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:06,070
seconds, if they don't puke on you,
you actually have a good impression.

788
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:10,540
Then you'd take it into the little lab
and then you take out a little green cup.

789
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:14,560
That rubber Green Cup,
that's all I remember. Things
can only be mixed in that.

790
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,510
I never took a chemistry class,

791
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:19,030
so I don't know why it couldn't
be just a plastic bowl,

792
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:20,320
but it was always those rubber things.

793
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,020
And then you'd mix it up
and then you'd pour it

794
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,670
into the fucking impression and then
you'd stick it on this little vibrating

795
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:31,630
thing,
trying to get all the bubbles out of it.

796
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:35,980
And it was nothing fucking worse if you
didn't get all the bubbles out of it.

797
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:36,850
And then I swear to God,

798
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:39,760
the bubble would always be right where
that person's tooth was and you'd fuck up

799
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:42,370
the whole impression. And then he'd
have to go in there and be like,

800
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:45,700
we gotta do it again.
I'd have to deal with that again.

801
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,680
So I would guess that what
they're doing is, is they, uh,

802
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,810
they're skipping that whole step.
I don't know what they do. If,

803
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,830
if you take a whole pack of juicy fruit
and you chew it up and then, you know,

804
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,710
form it to the top of your mouth and
then you mail that in and they make a

805
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,130
denture out of that. I have no
fucking idea. But that's really,

806
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:10,390
that's really a scary thing. It's
a really scary thing, you know?

807
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,820
That's the kind of Shit
I wish people focused on.

808
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,600
Like everybody keeps talking about
that fucking broad with the eight kids.

809
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,390
Can you believe it? I mean, that's
so irresponsible. Who gives a fuck?

810
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,020
People talking about all the
money she's going to cost us.

811
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:30,420
She's going to cost the swat a couple
million. You know? What about the,

812
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,380
so you know, the fucking bankers,
three quarters of $1 trillion,

813
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:36,980
nobody gives a fuck about that. Some chick
squirts eight babies out of her twat.

814
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,270
It's going to cost us, you know,
one half of 1% compared to what?

815
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:46,100
These fucking constant who
stole a trillion dollars
and then gave themselves $30

816
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,190
million bonuses. Nobody gives
a shit about that. You know,

817
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:52,400
some chicks squirts out fucking eight
babies and all of a sudden no one can stop

818
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:56,810
looking at it. You know why? Because it
has a face. You know what she looks like?

819
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:58,670
That's the thing.
That's the genius of the bankers.

820
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,320
Nobody knows what a bank or it looks like.

821
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,740
I don't even know what the fuck my teller
looks like. I go to the Goddamn ATM

822
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,290
because I worked nights. Um, all right,

823
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,020
what else?
What else could I do on this podcast?

824
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:13,370
This is going to be a short podcast.

825
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:17,090
I'm doing a podcast until I get home
and that's going to be it because I'm

826
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:20,720
exhausted with these fucking
podcast. All right? It's insane.

827
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:27,190
The amount of podcasts that I've done
this fucking week and to no avail.

828
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,610
You know,

829
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:33,200
it reminds me of listening to somebody
talking about who the fuck was it

830
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,150
recorded with like a Ray Charles.
You do like nine,

831
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,160
9,000 takes of Georgia on my mind and
by the end of it you wanted to make them

832
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:47,130
deaf too. You know, that's why I feel
like right now with these fucking podcast.

833
00:51:47,131 --> 00:51:48,860
So,
um,

834
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:52,550
I guess the last thing that I have to do
is I'm stuck in traffic waiting to make

835
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:56,800
my left hand turn to come
home to order a pizza. Uh,

836
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,780
is that got announce the winner of the uh,

837
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:04,610
the submissions for the
original a proctologist I
went to the proctologist joke,

838
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,930
I got to omit man. They were all
strong and everybody seemed to like,

839
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,290
there's sort of an even amount of people
like in every one of them except for

840
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:17,210
one. So basically I think I'm going
to pass out like a three or four DVDs.

841
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,870
You know, you know what? Everybody's
a winner except for the one guy,

842
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:26,340
the one guy who meandered for 20 minutes
about having the chicks Katie mashed in

843
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:30,650
the mammogram is the only one that
didn't get any votes. Everybody else,

844
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:33,260
the guy with the potato salad
line got a lot of votes.

845
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,450
The dude who freaked me out and
got a bunch of votes and uh,

846
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:42,260
the dude who did the,
uh, had the great angle.

847
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:44,690
I thought this was the
most original angle of,

848
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:49,691
of the gay guy bragging that he's
dating approch cologists you know,

849
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,080
if you didn't listen to that podcast,
he was saying,

850
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,000
it's kind of like if you know one of your,

851
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,560
one of your buddies started dating
a gymnast, you know, and then,

852
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:02,780
then all your buddies would be jealous.
Like Jesus Christ.

853
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:05,870
I bet she can do some freaky shit.
You know,

854
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,830
he can bend her every which way.
He was saying gay guys would do that.

855
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:12,860
I bet they'd get jealous if you started
dating a proctologist and they'd all be

856
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:17,000
sitting around going to hi. I bet he
really knows his way around it. Ass.

857
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,430
Thank you. That was the hacky gay guy
voice. I don't know if you guys noticed,

858
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:27,090
but my chick's voice is basically the
gay guy voice just done at a whisper.

859
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,740
If you ever want to get that
impression down, instead of going,

860
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,320
hi fellows,
I just go,

861
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,230
hey, what's going on? This is

862
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,050
it's relationship coaching.
Exact same thing.

863
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:42,930
I make complete fucking no talent and a,
anyways,

864
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,970
I'm in my garage right now.
So this podcast is over. I
know it was a quick one.

865
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:53,000
I know. It was a quick one. All right.
It's a little 12 minute. It's an EDP.

866
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:57,300
All right. Like guns n roses life.
That's what it's like. All right. Stop.

867
00:53:57,301 --> 00:54:02,301
I didn't drop the n word even though
there was a half black Obama guitarist in

868
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:03,324
my group.

869
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,610
How fucking drugged up with slash that
day where he fucking coach signed on that

870
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:12,900
one. Anyways, I want to thank
everybody who came out to the, uh,

871
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,080
my shows back in Boston.
Uh,

872
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,370
the comedy connection at
the Wilbur Theater and out
in Chicopee, Massachusetts.

873
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,260
I had an, I had a great time coming back
there and a bunch of friends, family,

874
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,880
former babysitter from the 70 showed up.
It was a,

875
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:34,590
it was an unbelievable weekend. And
uh, then I went out to chickopee,

876
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:35,430
Massachusetts.

877
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:40,460
That shows sold out as well and a bunch
of drunks and I made my way through it.

878
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,340
And, uh, then I went back

879
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,160
to my fancy hotel in Boston.
I owe today Philemon Yawn.

880
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:57,600
The maid had left classical
music on the clock radio.

881
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,960
Trying to remember how this went down.
That's why I walked into my

882
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,570
hotel room that, you know, the turn down
service, I don't know what that means.

883
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,310
They fold your sheets back and they give
you a mint and she left classical music

884
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:15,440
claim on my clock radio.
I ordered the filet minion,

885
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,200
a little mashed potatoes,
a glass of red wine.

886
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:21,720
And I sat there and ate it.

887
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,790
And it was one of the most
loneliest experiences I've
ever had in my life to the

888
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:31,530
point I actually had to call Robert Kelly
and tell him in the moment how lonely

889
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:35,820
I was. The stakes suck too. I actually,

890
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:40,710
it was such a bad steak. I actually
didn't even consider putting a one on it.

891
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,850
I went straight to catch up. That's how
bad it was. And I don't put anything on,

892
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,420
you shouldn't put anything on a steak.
They should just tastes delicious.

893
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,730
And this thing was so fucking,

894
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,860
I ordered it medium rare and it was gray
all the way through and it was tough.

895
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:59,240
Like fucking shoe leather.
That Mozzarella. Um,

896
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,040
anybody know what's that one from anybody?

897
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:06,420
I'll give you five seconds to tough like
fucking shoe leather. That Mozzarella,

898
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,090
I only know one other fucking person.
We have a new,

899
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:14,091
that reference rubber brought it
up and he owns Gotham comedy club.

900
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,370
It was a Eric Roberts

901
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,910
in the pope of Greenwich Village.

902
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,900
Tough like fucking shoe leather
that moves around. Anyway,

903
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,380
the fucking steak stunk and I
actually put ketchup on it. I like it.

904
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:33,130
Literally take it tasted like fucking
hamburger cause hamburger tastes great,

905
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,210
but you know what I mean? Any chefs
out there? You never put ketchup.

906
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,470
Okay, let's do overrated. Underrated.
You know what's fucking overrated?

907
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:46,440
A one steak sauce. I
don't even get it. It, it,

908
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,400
it's just,
it sucks.

909
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,920
I am in a garage right now talking to
myself basically about fucking a one steak

910
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:58,120
sauce. Who gives a fuck? I'm
done with this podcast. Next
week you're going to get,

911
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:01,270
you're going to get a double album
out of me. All right? I promise you.

912
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:03,700
But this week you get in the eep.
All right.

913
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:06,430
Thank you to everybody who came out
to the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

914
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:11,431
Massachusetts and all you fucking meth
heads and drugs who came up to the Hooky

915
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:16,210
loud and chickopee Massachusetts.
And uh, my next Gig,

916
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:20,800
my next upcoming Gig, I am going
to be at wise guys in Ogden, Utah.

917
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:26,560
I believe it's Saturday night,
the, uh, February 21st. So,

918
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:29,620
uh, please come out to see me, man.
I've never done a club up that way.

919
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:33,970
I've only done colleges and a why don't
you come along and bring your 18 fucking

920
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:37,630
wives or whatever the hell it
is you Mormons do out there.

921
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,050
And uh,
you know,

922
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,520
I figure you're a cool Mormon if
you're actually listening to the stove,

923
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,150
you know,
come out to the show and uh,

924
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,020
congratulations to the
Lakers in the Cavaliers, man.

925
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:51,490
You guys look like you're
going to be playing,

926
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,810
you're just playing a hungry or game
playing a fucking hungry or game.

927
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:00,880
But I have to, I have to say this
before I sign off. I really think that,

928
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,570
uh,

929
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:06,570
the reason why I can't stand the fucking
NBA is unlike any other sports like

930
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:11,890
that, that sport, the officials
control the outcome of the game.

931
00:58:11,891 --> 00:58:13,420
Like I've never seen.
It's like,

932
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:17,050
it always like the Celtics
Lakers was a fucking great game.

933
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,640
And then down to the end they just
kept blowing the whistle on both sides.

934
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:25,440
I'm not being a cry baby here. Lakers
won fair and square. But I'm just saying,

935
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:29,950
you know, sometimes they should just
put the fucking whistle away, you know,

936
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,790
just let them fucking play. And they
did that. And the Cavaliers game,

937
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:37,990
it's like you've got these two juggernauts
going head to fucking head and then

938
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:42,610
this little fat, he flown his whistle.
Now all the action stops and then,

939
00:58:42,611 --> 00:58:47,560
you know, you know, hey, stop
pushing him. That's ridiculous. Okay,

940
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,930
let's let them shoot uncontested.
It's the most,

941
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,730
it's the biggest fucking buzz kill to
the end of any game I've ever seen.

942
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:59,550
You know, and I love how God
there's been a referee that was,

943
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:04,590
has been busted for having mob ties in
the fucking NBA and I'm supposed to act

944
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,150
like that's the only guy

945
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,320
that was just one bad apple,
you know, I think, I dunno.

946
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,250
What do you guys think?
There's my question for you this week.

947
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,810
Out of all the four major sports,

948
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:22,080
which referee do you think if you bought
them could really influence the outs?

949
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,040
The at the uh,
the outcome of the game.

950
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,780
I didn't have to go and be a cause.
It's so easy to get a guy out of the game.

951
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:32,750
You just keep calling files in football,
you know?

952
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,410
Do you want how many you took?
Throw a guy out of the game.

953
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,670
You've got to wait til he,
you know,

954
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:41,240
kick somebody in the balls and spits
in the face. And I don't know what,

955
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,900
look at me babbling and it'd
be not literally the light
and my garage went out.

956
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,940
I got to get out of the car.
All right guys. That's it.

957
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:49,120
I'm going to save this podcast
so you're going to hear it.

958
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,750
What's,
I don't know how to fucking uploading.

959
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,040
It's been a brutal week. All right, good.

960
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,773
All

961
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,433
right.

962
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:30,070
Fuck list bill.
I wake up at my girlfriend's house.

963
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:34,930
She leaves to work. I can't find
my socks. She says I have some.

964
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:38,350
She says I have some
just use mine and leaves.

965
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:43,380
I wake up later and I looked for the
sock drawer. Top drawer. Right. Um,

966
01:00:43,381 --> 01:00:48,381
and I find this list with about 20 to
30 names on it and my name is near the

967
01:00:48,731 --> 01:00:53,530
bottom. Oh No. Some have
check marks on them,

968
01:00:53,531 --> 01:00:54,364
et cetera.

969
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:00,660
I asked her about it and
while she's initially upset
it turns out to be her fuck

970
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:01,744
list.

971
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,510
Yeah.

972
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:06,210
Wow. I don't have a fight.
I have a list in my head.

973
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,910
She actually made a fucking list.

974
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,280
Okay.

975
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,720
Dude,
you coined a phrase.

976
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:13,720
Okay.

977
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,720
She said she made it after we got together
with some friends drunk one night.

978
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:23,710
She then admitted to being
somewhat of a whore. Her words,

979
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:25,840
not mine before we met,

980
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,730
but assures me that she
hasn't done anything since
she met me with anyone else.

981
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,240
I do believe her,
but I totally blew up on her.

982
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,820
And we haven't been
talking for a few days.

983
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,200
I also look a bit creepy as to why
I went through her door drawer.

984
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:46,390
It was in an envelope. Yeah.
You know what it is? Yeah.

985
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:48,850
You kind of look creepy,
but she would've done that to you.

986
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:53,530
You know women call it snooping when
we do it. It's fucking creepy. Anyways,

987
01:01:53,531 --> 01:01:58,390
he goes, I need some help here on this
one. Do I apologize? She already has.

988
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:03,490
Do I just say fuck it and forget about it?
What's knee his take on it?

989
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:07,900
God dammit.
You know what?

990
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,630
I'm going to have to ask her.
Take on that one.

991
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,840
I'm not going to have it on this
podcast. When I, when I go home,

992
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,550
I fly home tomorrow,

993
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:22,680
I'll try to have an
epilogue to this podcast,

994
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:26,430
um, or maybe tack it onto
to the following weeks.

995
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:31,530
That is a great question
because I don't trust this girl.

996
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,000
Okay.

997
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,290
You know that when, when a
girl, is that fucking free?

998
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:38,790
Yeah.

999
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,600
All right. And I know girls are getting
mad. Why? Why can't we be as free as you?

1000
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:46,800
I'll tell you why you can't, because
you don't have to work at getting laid.

1001
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:51,960
Okay? I can be sexually liberated.
I still have to go out to the bar.

1002
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,530
I got to do a fucking tap dance.

1003
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:56,960
Okay.

1004
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,880
You know, like me getting laid, it's,

1005
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:02,270
it's like somebody on fucking,
uh,

1006
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:06,560
American idol trying to get that ticket
to Vegas. You know? That's what it's like,

1007
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:09,680
is it for most guys anyways,
to get laid.

1008
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:14,390
Even if you get good at it, it's,
it's like fucking, you know?

1009
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,270
Okay.

1010
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,310
It's, it's, it's not hot, but you
guys, anytime you want to fuck,

1011
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:21,690
okay,

1012
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,730
you can fuck. Look at that. Golden
Knights came up with a back out.

1013
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:26,760
I didn't know Hosea. I put my hand
and I wasn't ready. 44 year old guy.

1014
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,880
I'm sitting there, the boop,
boop, I can't even fucking talk.

1015
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,860
Um,
so that's what I would be worried about.

1016
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:37,460
Okay.

1017
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,620
She said she's a bit of a whore.
Like,

1018
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:41,480
okay,

1019
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,400
I don't know if that's a good thing or
a bad thing or if like, uh, I don't,

1020
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:48,950
I don't know about that one.
And she sat down and she made a list.

1021
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:55,390
Jesus Christ, 20 to 30
names. Now this is the thing,

1022
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:00,700
I don't know how old
she is. All right. 20.

1023
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:04,660
You know, for a girl, 20 to 30 names,

1024
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:08,290
I don't think is even that bad.

1025
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,280
The fact that she, well I dunno,
but it might be even worse because,

1026
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,230
okay.

1027
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,580
They,
they,

1028
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:16,890
yeah,

1029
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:21,770
I'm not honest about their number. They
do the exact opposite of what we do. Guys.

1030
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:26,740
We exaggerate our numbers.
They dial them fucking back like,

1031
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,250
okay,

1032
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,830
like women's,
how many guys have you been with?

1033
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:35,360
Numbers is like when they put out how many
people are unemployed in this country,

1034
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,510
you know, they try to keep that number
fucking down. It's the same thing. Uh,

1035
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,290
uh,
fuck list.

1036
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,430
I mean, uh, I, I don't know
how I'd ever get past that.

1037
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:54,090
You sat around with your friends,
are your friends all whores,

1038
01:04:56,420 --> 01:05:00,680
you know, and it's not like they just
sat there going, oh yeah, you know,

1039
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:04,520
I fucking, you know, Bobby,

1040
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:09,870
fill up fucking Dakota Tornado
ever fucking modern name.

1041
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:14,030
Um, Range Rover, whatever.

1042
01:05:14,031 --> 01:05:17,740
Fucking people called kids and boys now.
Um,

1043
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,060
and then, you know, there's
checks next to them of,

1044
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:25,990
of like what she did with
them or how good the deck was.

1045
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,700
And, uh, I,

1046
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:31,900
I don't know if that's one of those things
that they all fucking do and you just

1047
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:34,960
unfortunately peek behind the
curtain and you should let it go.

1048
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:39,390
I have no experience with
something like that. Um, oh,

1049
01:05:39,391 --> 01:05:41,020
this would have been a great nia question.

1050
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,980
I have to do this with her and
get into a fucking giant argument,

1051
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,760
but then I run the risk of
possibly getting a fucking
preview of her fuck list,

1052
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:54,010
which I don't want to know about.
I don't want to know if, I mean,

1053
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:57,160
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't give a fuck at my age.

1054
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,520
I'll give you a clean good. Okay.
What do I think you will fucking

1055
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,530
God damn bubble. I hope you banged
enough guys and learned how to fuck.

1056
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,220
I really do cause I don't need some fish
in bed, you know, just laying there.

1057
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:12,700
Haman fucked a lot of people.
Great. Isn't that Greg?

1058
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,640
Do you want a pilot who
hasn't flown a lot of planes?

1059
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:20,710
You know there's give and take. Okay. You
got a girl hasn't fucked a lot of guys,

1060
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:21,544
ed,
you know?

1061
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:23,160
Okay.

1062
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,170
She sucks at Dick.
Like she's eating green beans.

1063
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,280
That's the tradeoff yet.
Oh, ah, dude, that sucks.

1064
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,850
Okay.

1065
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:35,810
That really sucks for you.

1066
01:06:35,811 --> 01:06:38,360
Why were you going to wear one of her
socks to work though? You know, with,

1067
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:41,030
with a little fucking Chris
Everett ball hanging off the back.

1068
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:48,230
[inaudible]

1069
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:19,900
[inaudible].
