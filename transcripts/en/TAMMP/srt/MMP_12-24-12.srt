1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,390
Okay.

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,350
Hey,
what's going on?

3
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:06,160
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,120
December 24th,

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,770
2012 and as you can see,

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,330
the way I stress December 24th that I am,
I am,

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,860
I am letting you guys know that I
realize that it's Christmas Eve.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,330
Okay.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,070
I realized that therefore this
has to be a very special podcast,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,010
uh, which it won't be, but I'm
just letting you know that.

11
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:36,400
I know that you feel that
it should be special.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,230
I had some sort of Christmas special going
on here singing you guys some holiday

13
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,240
tunes

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,010
have all the jolly Christmas.
Oh,

15
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:50,980
it's the best time of the year.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Everybody is pretty cool except
for that douchey sister married.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,640
There's always one, right? There's
always going to be that one fucking guy.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,250
Everybody's having a good time. And then
this one has to come in, moping around,

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,610
you know,
who was it?

20
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,170
The chick with the substance
abuse problem or the Moody Guy.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,080
I'd rather have the substance abuse chick
around in the Moody Guy, Moody guys.

22
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:28,520
The worst he comes in, right? Like
the fucking antithesis of mistletoe.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,193
You know,

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,180
he should have mistletoe on his
shoes pointed the other direction,

25
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,540
like some sort of devil reference,
you know,

26
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,970
instead of hanging from the heavens
is coming up from the fucking fool,

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,193
right?

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,780
Kiss my fucking feed everybody cause
you're gonna have to deal with me and my

29
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,630
mood because I'm not just going to
have the decency to be miserable,

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,040
miserable over in the corner.

31
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,010
I'm going to fucking sit down right in
front of everybody and just sit there

32
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:58,660
sulking,
you know,

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,170
and there'll be a couple
of fucking hardcore people
who will see it and they'll

34
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:04,960
just roll their eyes.
But there's always the one Douche,

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,480
the one chick who's a member of the four
h club or whatever the hell it is that

36
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:13,990
she does. Bake sales helps
out with the church car wash,

37
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:18,250
whatever the fuck she does,
but she know she has to f with manner,

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,560
with manner. You look sad. Oh my God,

39
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,400
he sees,
she sees fucking sad every year.

40
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,070
Watch the language around the mistletoe.
Karen,

41
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:36,000
don't fucking do this.
Don't every fucking year.

42
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:39,840
I don't care if their kids
are going to hear right.
Anyway, they got a hair, right.

43
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,770
Anyway,

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,400
all right.

45
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,860
Every year this douche comes in looking
like fucking droopy dog and I'm sick of

46
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:50,950
it. It's not my fault. His lights,
I don't care if he could hear me

47
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,130
quartzy sleeping because he's leaving.
You're leaving, you'll leave all,

48
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:59,000
where are you going to go kill
yourself in the fucking rest area?

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,190
Right? It's one of those deals
every year. There's that Douche.

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,560
Then there's always the dose you as to
try and top everybody's stories. You know,

51
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:16,440
you could be sitting there with
the fucking astronaut each,

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,870
some out,
try to top or correct them.

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,910
Well, actually I thought, uh,
according to, uh, you know what?

54
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:28,390
I don't know what video
games, some fucking astronaut
video game to dose played.

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,770
He'd actually try to question a real
artist who even knows a national at this

56
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,270
point,
aren't they all dead?

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,710
Did the people who are on the space
shuttle where they considered astronauts?

58
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,850
Cause I didn't consider them astronauts.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,600
You're not an astronaut if
you're in a plane. Okay.

60
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:49,601
And I know it's a big one and I know
it's got rockets on it initially.

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,073
All right?

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,440
But all I know is that the astronauts
that I grew up on with what fucking day.

63
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,230
We're at the top of a missile.

64
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,980
That's what day did you didn't
steer that fucking thing?

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,030
I mean how they got back,

66
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:11,090
they had a little capsule then
he's just lean to one side.

67
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:15,500
You kept rolling back towards the
earth. Hope when you'd reenter, right.

68
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:18,920
Then the parachutes came out and they
couldn't fucking find you cause all we had

69
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:22,400
was binoculars. You know,
where is he? I don't see them.

70
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,170
Okay.

71
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,370
All right. Hang on. The Star Bar,
not, not, not the star board.

72
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,220
Right. And you're fucking sitting there
in the water, clinging to a sting ray.

73
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,900
If you lucky, you landed on an
island and then you met a genie.

74
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,230
Okay.

75
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,900
Who called your master.
But for some reason you never fucked her.

76
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,980
But other than that, that's
what an astronaut was. Even
flying a fucking plane,

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,620
you know, Wheaton Spaghettios, whatever
the fuck they did, and then land,

78
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:54,350
he get towed to the gate by a
fucking Toyota Tundra. All right.

79
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,640
That's not an astronaut.
To me,

80
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,600
that's a very impressive pilot.

81
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,610
Very impressed.
You went a lot higher than the jumbo jet.

82
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,240
I flew to Syracuse.
Sin Hat's off to you sir.

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,720
Um, I just heard Johnny
Mathis in the car, in the car.

84
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,740
Fucking guy's great. You know
what the hell song was he singing?

85
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:20,970
Yeah.

86
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,370
What the fuck song was he saying?
It's something about a,

87
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:27,500
it's the top 10 in your
heart that though. Oh, Bo.

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,920
Ah, fuck. How does it go fast?

89
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,080
I do buddy.
But then you pop it down

90
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,090
buckets right there. Something
about Deb, what the jingle.

91
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:44,091
Linea is a song in your
heart and I've got skis.

92
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,690
You want me to get Johnny Mathis always
picture that Christmas album when he was

93
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:52,530
sitting there with his, you know
his skis and sweater on, you know

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
a fuck though.
You know,

95
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,780
you think if you going to bring up a
fucking something you just heard you could

96
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:04,490
remember it, wouldn't ya
ward your, um, anyways,

97
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:07,970
I hope you guys have a very merry
Christmas. It is one day away.

98
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:12,140
Have you finished your shopping? I know
the podcast is late. I know. It's like,

99
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:12,471
you know what,

100
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:16,610
I actually recorded it this morning and
I was fucking with my dog on it and he

101
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,910
unplugged my device and
then some it all got erased.

102
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,620
So this is the second time I'm doing it.
So I think because of that,

103
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,100
I think I saw pretty jolly
right about now don't you

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,280
still coughing up mold?
Any doctors listened to this podcast?

105
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,630
Do you? Oh that's, that's a, I
don't know if that's impressive.

106
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,660
Why would you listen to this podcast?
Do you need a break from thinking?

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Cause you're so fucking smart cause you
went to college until you were 35 and

108
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,940
now you're fucking 900 grand in debt
and you're looking up people's assholes.

109
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,230
Really that was your game plan.

110
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:52,860
Okay.

111
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,730
You know, if you wanted to fuck a nurse,
you, you could have just had your girl,

112
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,630
you know, just put on a nurse's
outfit. What's the difference?

113
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,350
The goods are all the same. Did you
really need to go through all of that?

114
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,580
Just so you could walk around instead of
somebody saying, you know Mr. Johnson,

115
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:13,140
they have to be like Dr. Johnson.
I don't like how doctors,

116
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,970
like when they go to a fucking
restaurant, they have to say, you know,

117
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,740
table four and they've got
to be, you know, fucking,
you know, doctor Marblehead.

118
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,240
Okay.

119
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,450
Why can't you say just say four from
Marblehead? What I picked Marblehead.

120
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:30,260
I don't know why Peterson,
you know, for, for Peterson,

121
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:32,870
it's got four for Dr. Peterson.

122
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,663
You know,

123
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,030
get over yourself. You fucking
Douche. So many of those,

124
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,070
the goddamn doctors do,

125
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:44,100
are not involved in life and death shit.

126
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,620
I'm not saying they don't kill people
and I'm not, I guess. Well, you know,

127
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,360
if they fuck up, they can kill
somebody. But a lot of them, you know,

128
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:54,300
they're looking at toes,
they look checking out your ears,

129
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:58,670
your throat and that type of shit.
You know that those are,

130
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,210
they like the Jiffy Lube doctors,
you know, that's all they're doin.

131
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,340
Change in a fucking air filter, draining
out the oil, put the blood back in,

132
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:11,280
put a new filter on, pour the shit
back in the top of the engine.

133
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,640
Call me in two days. That's
all you're doing. All right.

134
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,580
Okay.

135
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,880
Those real guys that deal
with the fucking, the insides,

136
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,100
the Pistons and all that Shit.
Those are the guys

137
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,210
you know. Oh, the computer.

138
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,320
Those are the real doctors,
you know?

139
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,950
So next time you go out to a fucking,
whatever the fuck it's called,

140
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,810
cracker barrel. Just say
your last name. Alright.

141
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,500
Dr. Peterson.
You fucking do show getting mugged.

142
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,793
You know,

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,340
going to, what would it
go to? Fucking restaurant.

144
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:53,600
Sit to stand up comedian
per table for one.

145
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,270
Cause I'm on the road and I'm lonely.
Comedian,

146
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,360
burr immediate bar table for one.

147
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,923
Anyways,

148
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,350
did you guys watch any football?
Now it gives a fuck about football.

149
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,710
It's almost over. Can you believe how
fucking fast the NFL season goes by?

150
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,140
Why is it so short? You know why?
Because it's a fucking man's game.

151
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,620
That's why September,
October, November, December.

152
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:25,000
And you're into playoffs for months.
Baseball starts in April.

153
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,640
So that's April, May, June,
July. You just be right now.

154
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:31,980
We would be in the dog days of summer
with baseball, but football, it's fucking,

155
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,360
it's almost over.
You know,

156
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,430
this time next month we'll be
sitting there waiting for the, uh,

157
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,310
the pro bowl, which I'm
going to, by the way,

158
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,210
I'm going to be out there with like
87 other people in that stadium.

159
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,410
It, it's fucking, uh,

160
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,550
do you realize this is how much of
a pussy game baseball is or mas?

161
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:59,940
Let's spin it positively because
it's Christmas Eve. It's the e for,

162
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,790
for Christmas.

163
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,123
MMM.

164
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,830
This is how manly football is.
Baseball players,

165
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:10,540
if you're healthy for the whole year,

166
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,400
you play as many professional games as
a football player plays in a 10 year

167
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:19,150
career, you know, and
after a 10 year career,

168
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,160
most football players, they have damaged
that they're not walking away from,

169
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,010
they got some sort of a limp,
some sort of twitch in their eye.

170
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,810
They got voices in their head,
their head doesn't fucking turn anymore.

171
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,410
They got something their knees blown out.
They got something. Baseball players,

172
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:36,960
what do they got?
Huh?

173
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,040
Other than a broad and every fucking
other city had never want to go to,

174
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,860
you know, they got chicks
in Baltimore, Kansas City,

175
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:51,790
Elizabeth's NFL cities. Let me think of
a fucked up. Wait, there's this 32 teams.

176
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,540
There's more football teams and
baseball that doesn't work out, does it?

177
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,040
Whatever. I'm just, I'm
just upset. Why is it,

178
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:04,250
why didn't he just goes by
so fucking fast. Anyways,

179
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,730
I tell you something.
I got to tell you something right now.

180
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,300
I think Peyton manning has a good shot
at tying his younger brother with the

181
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:14,960
ring this year. What do you think
about that? Earlier this year,

182
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,750
you know I was like the
giants or the fucking giants.

183
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,870
You don't need to tell a patriots fan
about the giants. Ah, you don't need it

184
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,173
all right.

185
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,920
I kept waiting for them to turn it on
versus he was freaking out in November.

186
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,780
I'm like, dude, they do this every year.

187
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,590
They pace themselves and then they start
trying right around fucking about a

188
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,680
week before Thanksgiving and then they
just go on a run and they just punch

189
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,140
everybody in the mouth.
Eli closes his eyes,

190
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:48,680
looks at the opposite end zone and throws
the ball instead sticks to somebody's

191
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:52,730
helmet or fucking drops in
out of the heavens, in double,

192
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,330
in the expression on his
face. Never changes. You know,

193
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,610
he's like the Manchurian candidate,
a fucking NFL players.

194
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,173
MMM.

195
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,450
Never seen a quarterback
is good as him as look,

196
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:10,870
as stupid as he does with a helmet on.
It's like,

197
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,350
I don't think I would look worse
with the helmet on. You know,

198
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,210
usually someone who's not athletic like
myself when we put on athletic equipment,

199
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,370
it's just funny. We don't look
cool. We look like idiots. And uh,

200
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,030
as good as Eli is, he,
he looks like a guy.

201
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,900
He looks like the last guy you
would pick in gym class. Anyways,

202
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm just pissed because he beat us every
time we go to the fucking super bowl.

203
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,003
MMM.

204
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,680
But anyways,
the giants are out.

205
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,140
Yeah.

206
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,200
Now the 40 niners I don't,
I dunno what to think about them.

207
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,050
After that drubbing last night against
Seattle and I was really rooting for the

208
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:52,370
40 niners I've always liked the 49 as
well. That's not true. In 81 I didn't,

209
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,180
I was a cowboys fan and, uh, but I,
I just, you know, by the end of it,

210
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:00,600
I just, you know, the West Coast
Offense, Bill Walsh, I'll let shit,

211
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,500
I just loved them.

212
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,183
MMM.

213
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,030
And you know, Pete Carroll drives
me nuts. I can't stand that guy.

214
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't like that guy because he
looks like the greatest guy ever.

215
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,530
He looks like he just rescued
a cat out of a tree, you know,

216
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,270
after rescue a dog from a shelter
after a, you know, I don't know,

217
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:23,840
saving somebody from drowning. He just
looked the key looks like a fucking do.

218
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,460
It looks like a Mormon, you know? Could
you look any more wholesome than that guy?

219
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,230
He looks, he goes to church every
week and sings hymns, you know,

220
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,440
only has sex missionary style, you
know, only does it for procreation.

221
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,010
You know what I mean? Like there's
nothing fucking wrong with the guy yet.

222
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,130
The way he left fucking, uh, USC.

223
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,540
I mean, John Calipari
must've been like Nice, nice.

224
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,610
The way it's done that,
that's how I get that. Right.

225
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,080
You see what he just did that size?
That's how it's done.

226
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:00,920
Okay?

227
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,390
It's how it's done. You break every
fucking rule. You fucking can.

228
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,450
You win championships
and right when you smell,

229
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:12,380
those mother fuckers come and you leave
and you let the school deal with it.

230
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,450
Right? That's what the
fuck he did. You know?

231
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,050
So then he's up there
looking all wholesome.

232
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,620
And the worst thing about
losing to a Pete Carroll team,

233
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,150
or just whenever a Pete Carroll
team scores a touchdown,

234
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:29,270
is they're always going to cut to that
wholesome guy and you're going to catch

235
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:31,760
him reacting to the touchdown.
And what does he do?

236
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,230
Does he make like a fucking war face?
Does he go,

237
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:40,830
fuck you like Rex Ryan
something manly? No. He goes, oh

238
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,670
woo.

239
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,570
It's genius. It's fucking g.
It's the what you expected. Like,

240
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,050
and fuck. Yeah, he's back. They're
going to do that. You don't expect to,

241
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,410
somebody be like,
whoo,

242
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,840
but skip down the fucking sidelines.
It makes it even more annoying.

243
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,300
Okay.

244
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,250
To lose to somebody if somebody is like
fucking brow and like a grizzly bear.

245
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,610
Yeah. It makes it losing a little
more acceptable. But when that,

246
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,160
when they're making noises, you'd make a
few are pushing your toddler on a swing.

247
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,950
It's a, it's really degraded.
So anyways, you know,

248
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:28,240
Seattle just in general, it's just fucking
annoying. It's a great goddamn city.

249
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,910
But I don't like this stadium,
how they designed it.

250
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:34,810
So there are fans that aren't, that loud
would sound louder. I don't like that.

251
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:37,500
And then they get all this credit,
right?

252
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,950
Well these fans is so loud.
No, the architect was awesome.

253
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,800
Um, anyways, so now I'm
looking, I don't know.

254
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,820
Yeah,

255
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,730
I think Green Bay still fucking in it.
I have no idea.

256
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,370
Now all of a sudden it seems up for grabs.
After the last couple of years,

257
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,780
I was looking at the NFC going, this
is completely lopsided. You know,

258
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,090
the three top teams in the
league are in the NFC, so you're,

259
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:08,120
you're going to be watching the Superbowl
in the NFC championship game at the

260
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:11,270
very least. And uh, the AFC,

261
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,990
we're just going to show up to get
our fucking asses kicked. You know,

262
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,710
that's just been my, my opinion. Okay.

263
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,570
And I stand by my criticism of my own
teams. Fucking defense. As you saw,

264
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:27,770
we struggled with the Goddamn Jaguars.

265
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,250
All right? And I know, you know,

266
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,570
Brady threw a couple of pics
in that type of thing, but bay,

267
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,390
but that we made their quarterback,
whatever the fucking Dick, Chad Henne,

268
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,880
whatever the hell his name is,
you know,

269
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,030
[inaudible] made that guy
looked like John Elway.

270
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,370
So anyways, I got to fill in a and any
kind of fill in the Peyton manning though.

271
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:53,310
He's gotta you gotta fucking Shit.
He's got a chance.

272
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,380
And I'm somehow rooting for the guy.

273
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,010
I'm trying to hold up my hatred
of the guy. And I did too.

274
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:02,760
I just don't have it anymore. Once he
left the colts, it just, it's just,

275
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:05,580
he's not on the colts anymore. I
don't care. And now he's an old guy.

276
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:09,180
I'm an old guy. How do I not root for
an old guy? He's so fucking old guy.

277
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:12,720
I can relate. I can relate to it. Um,

278
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:18,570
I got tightened my stupid password
here. Do you guys know, uh, here's,

279
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,160
here's something that
happened yesterday during, uh,

280
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,270
the Patriots game that
I was watching this,

281
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,030
this is how much the game has changed.
Wes,

282
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:32,210
welcome the great Wes Welker
going to be in the very least,

283
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:37,200
we'll be in the New England
Patriots Hall of fame. All right.

284
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,280
He's got to stay healthy. He
needs a couple. Yeah, but good.

285
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,670
Probably about 4,000 more yards and he's
going to be in the pro football hall of

286
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:48,540
fame, right? So I love the guy, you know,

287
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,220
speedy white guy playing wide
receiver. It gives, it gives, you know,

288
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,380
uncoordinated white dudes like me.
Hope gives us a role model,

289
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,150
you know what I mean? Um, so anyways,

290
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:05,160
he catches a ball and they go,

291
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:10,161
Wes Welker just broke Jerry Rice's record
and immediately my fucking ears perk

292
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:13,200
up going a Wes Welker
broke a Jerry Rice record.

293
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,440
What record did he break?
He broke the record for the most games.

294
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,130
10 or more catches in a game with his
18th game of having 10 or more catches.

295
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,231
And I was like,

296
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:33,231
Wes Welker caught 10 or more
passes more in his career.

297
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,880
Then Jerry Rice. You know what? I think
I have to go to the pope pro football,

298
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:43,260
reference.com the best football
website out there. By the way,

299
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,870
stay away from ESPN and the NFL one,

300
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,660
they're too fucking busy selling
their channel and their league.

301
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,020
This is just no bullshit.
Trim the fucking fat.

302
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,260
So Wes Welker holds the record for
the most games as a wide receiver,

303
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:01,800
catching 10 or more
passes his career yards,

304
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,340
8,486 and he is played one two three four,

305
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:09,420
five, six, seven, eight,

306
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:13,260
nine seasons and nine seasons.

307
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,100
He did what Jerry Rice did
in 20 seasons and Jerry Rice,

308
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,060
his career total for yards is 22,895
that's how the game's changed.

309
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,720
These little fucking passes, which would
have been handoffs back in the day.

310
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:35,950
These guys that they're
and their fucking statue,

311
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,810
there's gotta be an asterisk next to
that one. Here's the average yards.

312
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:44,070
Wes Welker has 15 yards his first year,

313
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,800
10.3 10.5 10.5 11.0 9.9
that's for the year.

314
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,210
That's was his average per catch.
9.9 yards.

315
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:59,010
12.9 11.5 here's Jerry Rice.
All right,

316
00:19:59,011 --> 00:19:59,880
where the fuck are we?

317
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,020
18 point 918.3 16.6 20.4
18.1 you get the point,

318
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,463
right?

319
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,080
Yeah.

320
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,610
Back in the day,
they fucking,

321
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:18,230
they sled that fucking pig scan around
the god Damn Day doing this little,

322
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,680
oh, here you go. Shit. I throw,

323
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,830
I throw fucking nine yard passes to my
three year old fucking Wes Welker has to

324
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,990
God damn record for that Bull Shit.

325
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,410
Fucking nine yard cray. Hell, I'll catch
buckshot nine yards away. That ain't shit

326
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,370
sort of saying all these fucking
records are getting broken out. Dan.

327
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:46,500
All a Dan Marino's records or fall it.
Dan Marino stood in the fucking pocket.

328
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,430
You throw the ball in,

329
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:51,660
sitting there throwing these
little bitch ass passes down.

330
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,000
You know there's gotta be sure they
got it. It has to be a new stat.

331
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,680
Okay? There's gotta be a new
stat where a handoff to handoff.

332
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,680
And if you throw the fucking
ball, it's got to, it's,

333
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,230
it's gotta be at least 10 fucking yards.
How about that?

334
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,110
We say that, can we create a new
name for whatever the fuck it is?

335
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,730
When a quarterback drops back to pass
and throws a three yard pass to somebody,

336
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,840
it does that 35 times a game.
Hey,

337
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:27,220
Jess [inaudible] starts record
for above completions in a row.

338
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,421
Hey Jess,

339
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:32,950
through 26 six yard passes in a row.

340
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,860
Well, I gotta tell you
frank one a, you do the,

341
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,520
you get put in the same
sentence as Bart Starr luck.

342
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,540
You know you've accomplished something.

343
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,740
Um, I dunno. I'm just a crabby
old man. Don't listen to me.

344
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,860
I'm just fucking saying. That's all
I'm saying. Give me a fucking break.

345
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,720
Wes Welker did something and nine season,
it took Jerry Rice.

346
00:21:57,721 --> 00:22:00,630
20 seasons to do and you're going to
tell me there's something right about the

347
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:05,310
league. There's something right about
that. Well, maybe in your world, sir,

348
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,220
and maybe in your universe, ma'am, but
not mine. When you think about that?

349
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,220
Well maybe I don't give a shit
when you think about that.

350
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:18,030
You ever think about that? Huh? There's
a lot to think about Matt. All right,

351
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:18,990
let's do a commercial here.

352
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,100
stamps.com everybody with
the holidays almost here.

353
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,710
Literally almost here. You don't
have time to go to the post office.

354
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,190
What do they mean? But the holidays almost
here. Christmas. What about Kwanzaa?

355
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,590
Hanukkah, you know, have
those common gone already?

356
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,040
I Dunno. Let's stick to the copy
here. What the holidays almost here.

357
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,960
Granted they gave me this three weeks ago.

358
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,740
You don't have time to go to the
post office. Traffic, parking,

359
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,870
obese people.
Um,

360
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,090
it will be packed with everyone
mailing holiday gifts and packages. So,

361
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,400
so do what I do. Jesus. This is the
worst read ever. So do what I do.

362
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:04,380
Use stamps.com instead, cause God
knows I'm too stupid to read out loud.

363
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:08,170
So thank God they came up
with this wonderful system.
What is his stance? Dotcom?

364
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:10,110
You ask with stamps.com you can avoid the,

365
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,560
all the hassle of going to the post
office during the busy holiday season.

366
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,980
Everything you would do with the post
office, you can do right from your desk.

367
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,640
Buy and print official US postage
using your own computer and printer,

368
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,220
print postage for any letter or package.
The instant you need it,

369
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,280
then the mailman picks it up. That's it.
That's all it is. So easy. So convenient.

370
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,390
What else do you need? They're doing
everything but bringing you a sandwich.

371
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,200
I use stamps.com to send out all
my DVDs for all my road gigs.

372
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,690

374
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:46,340

just broke and up to $55 free postage.

379
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,120
They given you 55 bucks during the holiday
season. Come on. What more do you want?

380

before you do anything else,

381
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,760
click on the microphone at the top of
the homepage and type in [inaudible],

382
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,140
B u r r that stamps.com enter birth.
All right.

383
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,960
Oh, this mold, this mold
won't leave me alone.

384
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,390
So I um,
I know what you're thinking.

385
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:32,170
We'll build next time you
go to a restaurant rather
than being insecure about

386
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:36,140
the doctor,
the Doctor Party of four,

387
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,840
why don't you fucking wattle up to
them and ask them about, you know,

388
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:42,910
is it okay to smoke a moldy cigar
once in your life every day?

389
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,820
The guy at the cigar told me, he
said, he said I'd be fine. You know,

390
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,530
that's how a guy goes to the doctor.
He talks to some guy,

391
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:56,300
he doesn't know who isn't a doctor,
vaguely describes what he did and goes,

392
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,340
you think I'll be all right. And you
know the guy goes and you're like,

393
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:05,110
all right and then you girl gets on you.
Why don't you go to the doctor?

394
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,560
Cause I talked to that
fucking guy over there,

395
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,120
that guy I am taking out the trash.
Hey Sweetheart,

396
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:18,170
you don't make fun of what a guy does for
a living. Okay? It's an unwritten rule.

397
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:19,821
It's an unwritten rule.

398
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:23,330
Now you look at down to the ground as
we walked back to the car and you don't

399
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:27,380
say good night to nobody. Pope
of Greenwich Village. Thank you.

400
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,410
And I avoided the not having a
fun part. Um, all right. So what,

401
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:35,690
what went on in the world this week?
I had an awesome week.

402
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,000
I did another episode of
Glee Nudge, Nudge, wink,

403
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:45,680
wink, and could not have had more fun.
I will let you know when it comes out.

404
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,160
Um,

405
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,620
and that was my last work for this
year and I ain't doing shit baby.

406
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,060
I ain't doing anything. I recorded the
podcast earlier today and like I said,

407
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,900
I was fucking with my dog
and, uh, during the podcast,

408
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:02,000
wrestling with her and stuff,
it was funny as hell,

409
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:05,120
but we got a little too rough and
an unplugged my thing here and, uh,

410
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:09,740
the recording and I
lost that podcast and I,

411
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:13,550
I'm still, I still think about
it sometimes not. So anyways,

412
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:17,370
I had to make a fucking pie today.
Made an apple pie and a,

413
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,090
there was a little collateral
damage with the crust on top.

414
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,240
Made it from scratch pitches.
Okay.

415
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,230
Till I know I come off like
I'm miserable and I'm cynical,

416
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:30,980
but I like Johnny Mathis, Christmas
music and I can make a pie from scratch.

417
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,200
You know, what are you doing today? I
don't want to get old John Lennon on you.

418
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,310
And so this is Chris Moses.

419
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,570
Then what have you
done? Um, I got it down.

420
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,760
The big fucking thing about making a pie,
a pie crust,

421
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,250
you can't be intimidated by the flower.

422
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,973
That's the thing.

423
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,720
I finally realized I was approaching it
like a bitch every year. I was like, Woo,

424
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:04,730
Woo, Woo woo man. And I'd fuck
it up this year I was like,

425
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,120
I don't give a fuck. I got a
whole bag of flour, you know,

426
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,670
like a pimp that has a whole stable
of horse just sitting there like,

427
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:14,271
all right lady,

428
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:17,180
you either make this fucking work or
I'll get another one in there and replace

429
00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:21,950
you. That was the thing. So I'm out in
the kitchen. Right. And when you bake,

430
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,870
you know, aside from, you know, risking
getting gay bashed in your own kitchen,

431
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,940
when you bake as a male,

432
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,180
you gotta give you gotta put an apron on
because your hands are going to get all

433
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:35,570
sticky. So, uh, believe it
or not, I don't own an apron.

434
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,770
And the only apron in the house
is the one my mother got for Nia.

435
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,020
And I swear to God, it's like this floral
pattern pattern, frilly fucking thing.

436
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,390
Like if an old lady had it
on, you'd be like, oh my God,

437
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:55,130
that's the greatest grandmother ever. So
I got this fucking thing on, you know,

438
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,910
Nias and the fucking living room.
So I'm in the kitchen,

439
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:02,150
I got the door closed and she knows I'm
making a pie and she starts to smell the

440
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:04,520
Philly. And, uh,

441
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,860
I do that food network shit where I
don't measure this shit out. As I,

442
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,660
as I, you know, as I'm making
it, you know, I have it,

443
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,500
I measured the shit out and I put it all
in these little fucking things so I can

444
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:21,540
just Bam, Bam, Bam, like I'm on a
shelf. You know, he put the cream in,

445
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,340
then you had the sugar with sat together.
Now a little bit of salt,

446
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,920
little bit of Nutmeg, little cinnamon,
you know, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam.

447
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,240
And the whole fucking thing goes,

448
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,380
whatever your hands get all fucking
stick soap sitting there, right?

449
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,500
And appealing the apples
and that type of shit.

450
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:41,501
And I go to pick up one and it fucking
the apple falls and it lands on two of my

451
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:47,000
little things that already have measured
out. And they tip over on the counter.

452
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:50,510
And then the apple fucking lands on
the floor and roles across the kitchen.

453
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,890
[inaudible] now,
Nia always gets on me for my temper,

454
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:59,030
flipping out and causing intention.
And I realized that, okay.

455
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,420
So when I flipped out,
rather than screaming,

456
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,880
I sort of crouch down.

457
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,410
Okay.

458
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,243
And I just went,

459
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,703
wow.

460
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,040
Something like that.
It was with his fucking apron on.

461
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:20,160
So Nia heard that, you
know, she, it wasn't loud,

462
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,800
but the intensity was fucking ridiculous.

463
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,150
So she comes bursting in to make
sure I'm all right. And she's like,

464
00:29:27,151 --> 00:29:30,450
she's like Billy, you okay? And I
came in and got, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

465
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,770
And then she sees me standing in that
apron. It might've been the hardest.

466
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:37,590
I think I ever heard her laugh.
I knew I'd look a little stupid,

467
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,930
but like she almost fucking passed out.

468
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,900
She like laughed I think
for five minutes straight.

469
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:46,690
And every time she started the stop she
started going to get, you know, get,

470
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,020
someone's laughing so hard, you start
laughing. It was one of those deals.

471
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:54,160
And I'm sitting there trying to peel
the apples and she's laughing so hard.

472
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:59,070
I got like fucking tears in my eyes and
I can't, I can't see what I'm doing. Um,

473
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,170
but long story short,
long story short,

474
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:07,171
I just remeasured the shit lost a
little nutmeg or whatever and um,

475
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,040
I cooked it, had little collateral damage
with the fucking doe on the, uh, the,

476
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,290
the one on top and I got to tell you,
it's nice.

477
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,580
It's a good look and fucking
pie to the point I'm going,

478
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,340
I'm going to post it and I'll tell
you as far as looks, I give it a six.

479
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,870
I'd give it a six.

480
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:28,060
Now I know once it gets posted to the
internet and all you miserable cons who

481
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,880
aren't happy with your lives, whether
it be like being like, you know what?

482
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,740
That's not too bad. That's not too
bad a job. I know you guys are good.

483
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:37,510
You're going to fucking, you know,
you're going to tear it to shreds.

484
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,700
You know when I say I say God bless you.
I say happy holidays to you too.

485
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,950
I'm sorry that your life,

486
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,340
I'm sorry you didn't get that fire
engine under the Christmas tree.

487
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,810
And rather than looking at your
parents or your girlfriend,

488
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:55,000
whatever the fuck you, God, we
didn't get you to that fire engine.

489
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,540
You're going to decide to take it
out on me and my innocent little pie.

490
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,280
All right. Hope you feel
good about yourself. Um,

491
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,440
what else? What else are we going to talk
about? Oh, I know a buddy of mine, uh,

492
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,560
you know,

493
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,070
the one who was questioning my loyalty
to the Patriots Cause I had the audacity

494
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:18,210
to say that their defense stinks.
Uh,

495
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,830
actually he called me after
the Jaguar's game and said,

496
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:23,860
I think I agree with you now.
Um,

497
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,710
and then he also, he left a message,
he asked me if I saw the, uh,

498
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:33,280
the NRA press conference,
you know, or as he said,

499
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:37,230
the Ana Dogc the fucking Nra,

500
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,660
uh, press conference, fuck,

501
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,630
where's this mold going
to be out of my system

502
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,920
according to the guy at the
cigar store will be fine. Um,

503
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,380
as he sells me another cigar,
I'm, what the hell was I
talking about? Yeah. So yeah.

504
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:57,410
He said, dude, you gotta check out the
Santa Ira thing. And he goes, it's like,

505
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,340
and he said to me, he goes,
and, you know, make dope. I'm,

506
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,150
I'm in the middle and I know a million
people who say I'm in the middle and

507
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:08,630
they're not in the middle. I've said,
I'm in the middle. I'm not in the middle.

508
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,160
I leaned to the left with a nice
fucking upper cutter. Right.

509
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,680
That's where I am.
You know,

510
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,470
I am to the left when it comes to the
work and mad when it comes to the twinkle

511
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:28,000
toes when it comes to,
you know,

512
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:30,910
people wanting to come to the country,
I'm to the left,

513
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,550
you know when it comes to other shit,

514
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,720
like taking responsibility for your
fucking actions. I'm on the right.

515
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,410
No it isn't. Okay, you're
a Douche. Go Fuck Yourself.

516
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:46,220
Go make it right or go sit in
that Shell and pay your dues.

517
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,360
You don't get a do over all the pens,
but I mainly, mainly on the right,

518
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,230
I'm one of the angriest liberals.
You'll ever fucking me.

519
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,930
I guess I'm supposed to be
doing yoga or something. I miss,

520
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,240
I missed something out in on the,
on the pamphlet or what?

521
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:05,310
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but this guy, you know, I got to,

522
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,660
I got a bunch of people like versus
another guy. He's one of them. Those guys,

523
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:11,840
the classic guy who says he's in the
middle. You're like, dude, you're not.

524
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,160
You lean this way. You
totally, every fucking issue I
bring up. You lean this way.

525
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,290
And then they always say the same thing.

526
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,990
It's the dumbest thing ever going
to fuck with your registered.

527
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,360
That's a classic thing.
You,

528
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:33,050
you registered independent and then argue
all one side and then when people just

529
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:36,890
accuse you, yeah, yeah, you're
fucking liberal. You're a
conservative. And they go,

530
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,330
I'm a registered independent. Well,
you didn't have to pass a test.

531
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,710
You know,
you just,

532
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,790
you just defined yourself
as an independent.

533
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,420
The same way Madison Square Garden
just gives itself the nickname,

534
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,160
the world's most famous arena,
you know,

535
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,860
and then everybody just does. It's
the world's most, there it is.

536
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:05,380
There's the world's most famous arena,
a cookie cutter fucking stadium,

537
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,970
a stadium. That one arena that
was made during the worst,

538
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,940
most uncreative time of arenas,

539
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,740
the world's most famous arena.

540
00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:21,420
If you can tell me how that thing looks
more different than any other stadium

541
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:24,510
during that fucking time that God damn it,
I'll make you an apple pie.

542
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,150
What do you feel about
that? Um, so anyways,

543
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,100
he goes, uh, yes.

544
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,480
All you people out there who
think just because you're a,

545
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,540
you're a registered independent and then
therefore you can just argue the same

546
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:46,690
side of every fucking argument and still,
you know,

547
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,970
and then that's your parachute.
I'm a registered independent. Hey,

548
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:55,390
buy my best friend's black. You
know, it's like one of those deals.

549
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,000
It's your little get out of jail
fucking bullshit thing. All right,

550
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,230
I'm here to tell you you're not fooling
anybody. Alright, you're full of shit.

551
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,930
But this guy,
he actually,

552
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,160
I've known him for 20 years and I really
don't know how he feels about anything.

553
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,340
It keeps the shit real
close to the vest. And, uh,

554
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,920
he always surprises me every time I
think he's going this way. Go that way.

555
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:23,390
I mean, I don't know. He might be a
contrarian. I have no fucking idea.

556
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:26,380
You might just be arguing the opposite
side just to fucking drive me nuts.

557
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,620
But anyways, he says, check out
this NRA thing. He goes, uh,

558
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,550
he was, you know, I don't really feel
one way or the another about it, but, uh,

559
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:41,100
these guys come off like it's a
fucking cartoon. Like their solution.

560
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:42,950
Yeah.

561
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,280
To The gun situation is more guns.
That's what he tells me.

562
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:48,590
So I sit down and I go,
I got to fucking watch this shit.

563
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,920
Get some material out
of this. Right. Yeah.

564
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,190
And,
uh,

565
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,580
I put it on and I watched
it and I got to admit,

566
00:35:56,581 --> 00:36:00,550
I thought the guy made a lot
of good points. I don't often,

567
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,030
we get hate mail over this.
I don't,

568
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:05,580
I don't mean I don't have a
problem if they ban, you know,

569
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:09,480
semiotic semiautomatic,
a fucking assault weapons,

570
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,690
I don't know what you
need one of those four,

571
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,833
you know,

572
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:19,910
if you using it to hunt you fucking
cheating. Like how bad a shot of you did.

573
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,190
You got to bang, Bang, Bang,
Bang, Bang. That they got it.
I got it. I got it. Sorry.

574
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,203
Sorry.
I got it.

575
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,500
Got It.
You know,

576
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,100
so I don't have a problem with that,
but like,

577
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,910
I don't like the whole demonizing of
people who own guns that you're just

578
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:38,570
automatically evil. It's stupid.
That'd be like demonizing me.

579
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,650
I use a computer. So
therefore, uh, you know,

580
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:44,420
I advocate,
uh,

581
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,340
sexual predators or people who steal
your identity. You know what I mean?

582
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,730
I mean, I, I kind of think
if you're in the NRA,

583
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,310
you got your gun legally and I think I,
I vote with no status whatsoever.

584
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:03,810
Completely over my head. No research,
no nothing. I'm willing to bet.

585
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,880
Okay.

586
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,100
All right. Uh, Marangu Pie. It's
all gonna be pies this week,

587
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,010
Dan, I would say like night, what? 99%
of the people who register a gun legally,

588
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,110
first of all,
probably never do anything.

589
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,020
Most of them probably
never do anything more.

590
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,780
Then go down to the fucking
gun range and shoot it.

591
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,050
Then he got another percentage
that actually go out and
they go shoot a pheasant

592
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,130
or quail or an elk or some
bullshit like that. Right.

593
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,230
But the amount that actually go out and
commit a fucking crime or shoot somebody

594
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:39,520
as somebody, I wouldn't,
you know the problem,

595
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:40,640
you know what the fucking problem is,

596
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:46,590
is we don't have a way of
weeding out sociopath's

597
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,240
Psychos, maniacs. There's
no way to find them.

598
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,350
That's what you need to do.
If you could do that,

599
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,080
if you could some how fucking do that.

600
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,020
You wouldn't even need metal
detectors at the airport.

601
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,760
You wouldn't need anything. There
could be a gun in every fucking house.

602
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:09,400
No one's ever going to go
out and deliberately do
something. Somebody's gonna,

603
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:13,060
you know, obviously have an accident,
but shit, you have accidents in cars.

604
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,530
People put pools in their backyard,
people will fucking break their necks.

605
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,380
Shit happens. People fall
off ladders. Shit fucking
happen. There's gotta be a way,

606
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,913
you know,

607
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,160
I was running shit. I will, you know,

608
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:31,560
when you're like on a fucking tangent,

609
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,270
you realize halfway through how dumb
you sound. That was just a moment,

610
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,130
right there was like,
if was running shit

611
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:45,130
yet, you listen because you laughing
at me. Huh? You I go fuck yourself.

612
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:47,920
I don't care if I'm feeling good.
I made a pie today.

613
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,010
And what have you done?
Um,

614
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,760
if I was running shit,

615
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,440
I would go to the people who came up
with that black light that may helps you

616
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:02,350
find Jizan and a quilt,
you know, and be like,

617
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,020
make one of those lights for Psychos,
you know?

618
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:11,310
And then I would replace all the lights
in, in the street lights. You know,

619
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,700
with that light,
which would create jobs.

620
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,400
Yeah.

621
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,090
You know, and then with the surplus
of that money, we'd have healthcare.

622
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,820
Uh, just stay with me on this one
and it'll be like this maniac light.

623
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,240
Okay.

624
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,320
And if you're a good shit,

625
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:33,340
you have a soul and you have a
fucking hat and you're not a cunt.

626
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,720
It would be this one particular color.
See, nobody would know about this shit.

627
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,310
We all top secret it just be,
I know about it.

628
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,120
The guys who invented it and all the
million people who have had an unscrew the

629
00:39:44,121 --> 00:39:46,160
old light bulbs and put no,
you don't have to tell them.

630
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,280
Just tell them it's some
new energy efficient thing.

631
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:54,530
He just weed out all the psychosis and
I know what all the liberals are gonna

632
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,510
say and they'll let you deal with them.
Do you kill them if you kill all the,

633
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,000
you're just VAD as laugh.

634
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,383
Okay.

635
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,570
All right, well then I'll go
classic right wing. We take them,

636
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,880
we stick them on a fucking island.

637
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,420
Okay.

638
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,240
Let them all kill each other.
Now that would be a dumb thing then.

639
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,620
That would be stupid. That would be a
dumb fucking liberal way of doing things.

640
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,850
But we can't kill these people.

641
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:19,900
We can't illegally detain them because
they haven't done anything yet.

642
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,820
Fat.
Yeah.

643
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,850
And then you stick them on an
island and then you create this.

644
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:29,190
Can you dig it?
Fucking island,

645
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,073
you know,

646
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,440
God help us when those cons get organized
and I'll come back a shore. All right.

647
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:43,240
Isn't that enough? Will Smith's Tom
Cruise's and fucking then I what not.

648
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,370
Give me another action here with Chuck
Norris is out there to stop that level

649
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:49,830
evil.
That's the thing you got to um,

650
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,630
okay.

651
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,600
Like those fucking people holding up
signs saying that the NRA is killing

652
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:57,600
children. Um, is is just, first of all,

653
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:01,500
they weaken that side of the argument
because they're coming off like complete

654
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,334
psychopaths.

655
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,343
You know,

656
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,190
I don't know.
I find the press really annoying to like,

657
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:08,660
they had already made up their minds.

658
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,140
Like they were all over taking pictures
of the people holding up the protesting

659
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:18,140
things and some, one of the press
guys, I'm assuming suppress guy,

660
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:20,900
I don't know who it was, but
he's in the room, you know,

661
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,220
so meaning it's gotta be somebody from
the press yells at the NRA guy and he

662
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:28,040
goes, uh, what do you
think about the protesters?

663
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:32,090
And the NRA guy doesn't say anything,
just continues with his speech.

664
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,680
And then the same in the
crowd goes, uh, and he goes,

665
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,660
he goes off the stick with
the script. It's like, dude,

666
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,150
are you,
are you still a reporter at that point?

667
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,690
Because you don't sound like when your
job is to go down there and report what

668
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:51,200
happened. I'm fine with what do
you think about the protesters?

669
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,260
Even then that was borderline because
the guy was still in the middle of a

670
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:58,910
statement. But, but that's
okay because it did happen.

671
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,620
But when the guy chooses no comment,
that's what you report. No comment.

672
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:06,620
He goes on to have clause,
stick with the script.

673
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,720
I Dunno. That's a fucking
idiot Smith. It did just, I,

674
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,300
I don't, that there is no
fucking solution until,

675
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:19,440
until you can come up with something.

676
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:24,420
As much as I was making a joke about
having a cycle streetlight that identifies

677
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:28,260
maniacs, until you do
that, I don't give a fuck.

678
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,683
You know,

679
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,900
there's still gonna be keep going
to be problems. Isn't there?

680
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,830
Jesus Christ with those fucking
maniacs do in the Middle East.

681
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,950
They don't even use guns.
They got out of the home depot.

682
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:43,650
They get a fucking thing of fertilizer,
right.

683
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:48,540
Whatever the fuck they do when they walk
into a food court, blow themselves up.

684
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,440
Now what are they going to do close
down the hardware stores. All right,

685
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,800
I'm going to hold my head.
Uh,

686
00:42:56,801 --> 00:43:00,700
so this is Christmas.
All Right,

687
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:04,060
this is cruising along 43 minutes in.
Hey everybody,

688
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,140
did you enjoy the podcast this year as
much as I did? Well, I sure hope you did.

689
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:11,800
Um, oh, they also blame video games,

690
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,270
blaming video games, which um, I dunno.

691
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,273
I don't know what to tell you.

692
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,520
I find violent video games
to be a stress relieving.

693
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,740
I also find going to a gun range and
shooting a gun to be oddly calming,

694
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,030
the same sort of calm I get
when I make a fucking apple pie.

695
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,820
I'm not even lying to you. I, I
get that same level of enjoyment

696
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,970
because I'm not a psycho. I'm
a cut. I'm a dick. I'm a moron,

697
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,150
but I'm not a psycho.

698
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,120
All right,
I'll stand you come up with that light.

699
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:56,220
I'll fucking stand underneath it all.

700
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:59,910
You're going to see you as a bald
spot in a, in a, in a beautiful soul.

701
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,190
Alright, plowing ahead here
by the way, people, I got to,

702
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,120
I got a couple of gigs coming up in 2013.
Um,

703
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:14,150
in January I'm going to be at slappers
flappers comedy club in Burbank,

704
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:17,970
California. Absolutely
love this club. And uh,

705
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:22,971
I'm hoping to have a couple of a
up and coming heavy hitters open.

706
00:44:24,671 --> 00:44:27,210
And for me, I haven't reached
out to anybody yet, but um,

707
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,730
flappers in Burbank and uh,

708
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,550
that's going to be on January
10th two shows. We'll put,

709
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:36,810
we'll give you the links and everything.

710
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:41,520
If you go to the podcast page on bill
bird.com and then on November 26th,

711
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,650

thing? Sam The worst. See why, why do I,

714
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,210
why do I talk myself into
these damn corners? Oh, cause
you're not organized bill.

715
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,480
You know,
you don't have any sort of,

716
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,040
you know setlist is oh fuck yourself.

717
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,450
Um Oh, I thought it was gonna be up
on my website. Where the fuck is it?

718
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,280
Whatever. Just look, you do the work.

719
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,520
Look up bill burr and fucking
to why and you'll see it.

720
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,530
It's January 26th I will be there and uh,

721
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,440
and I'm going to the pro bowl.
He won't be able to miss me.

722
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:28,740
It'd be me and fucking 83 other
people in Hawaiian shirts.

723
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,040
It's going to be awesome. And then
I'm at the Wilbur Theater, Boston,

724
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:32,821
Massachusetts.

725
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:37,320
My old stomping grounds where I started
Wilbur theater right across some Nick's

726
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:41,340
comedy stop where I started March 2nd,

727
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:46,320
1992 on an open mic night, long,
long time ago. Uh, Wilbur theater.

728
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,320
February 21st two shows
and February 22nd one show.

729
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,641
And other than that,

730
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:58,560
the only other thing I have that's on
sale right now is May 30th in Baltimore,

731
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:02,280
Maryland.
And I'm at the Mary Hoff Symphony Hall.

732
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,630
Doesn't that sound amazing?
You know a lot. I'm going
to be, it's a symphony hall.

733
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,460
I'll sound like a fucking Seahawk fan.
It's all that artificial help. Um,

734
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,830
all right,
back to the podcast here.

735
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,500
So let's answer some questions
here. Um, if you'd like to email me,

736
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:22,800
it's uh, oh, what the fuck is it?

737
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:27,090
I think it's built the MM podcast.com
we'll have that link up there too.

738
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,710
I haven't said it so long. I forget
what the fuck it is. Um, all right.

739
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:36,540
It's terrible. Whatever you guys want
to be working today, are you, you know,

740
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,630
once you're home putting on a sweater,

741
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,670
a questions from New Zealand. So, you
know what's great about New Zealand?

742
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,980
I was at a Christmas party last night
and I met some woman there and uh,

743
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,170
she was saying how in World War One
that when Great Britain declared war on

744
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:57,690
Germany, that New Zealand felt,
because they were their colony,

745
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:00,360
both of them in Australia,
they had to follow suit.

746
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,680
So they told England that, Yay,
we're right there with you.

747
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,770
And you know what England did?
Did they mix them in with their troops?

748
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,000
Now you will see that all quiet on the
western front, that trench warfare,

749
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:17,001
we had gas masks because using poisonous
gas wasn't considered a legal in war,

750
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,230
mustard gas and all that shit. Hand to
hand fighting shit in a fucking hole.

751
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,470
Some of the worst conditions ever.

752
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,110
That's where they were sent
all those people up there.

753
00:47:29,111 --> 00:47:31,750
They were all from fucking
New Zealand and Australia.

754
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:36,751
Not One English man had the fucking
balls to go there in the trenches.

755
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,140
At least this is the way a person
from New Zealand explained it to me.

756
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,550
I might have exaggerated a little bit,

757
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:46,360
but I'm also trying to get some emails
here. Not One Englishman had the balls,

758
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,240
didn't have the fucking balls.

759
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,620
They were all sitting there with Winston
Churchill holding hands, you know,

760
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:58,860
having a biscuit. Um, Robert's
here, listen to this ship.

761
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,240
The total number of New Zealand troops
in nurses to serve overseas in 1914 in

762
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:07,390
1918, um, was 140,

763
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,070
a hundred thousand 444 from a population
of just over a million, 10% of that,

764
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,120
over 10%. A roughly 10% of their
population fought in the war.

765
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,360
42% of the men of military age served
16,697 New Zealanders were killed.

766
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:23,980
Of course they were.

767
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,980
They sent him right to the front and
41,317 were wounded during the war of 58%

768
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:34,780
casualty. Right. You know, this
is the kind of shitting with does.

769
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:37,510
And then I go over there and they
started giving me shit about George Bush.

770
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:42,010
You know, it's like, why don't you fucking
clear off your register there, Ian,

771
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,310
before you come in and make,
I can't remember the last time.

772
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,200
Some from England gave me
shit about the foreign policy.

773
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:50,410
I just like fucking pissing them off
because then they keep listening and then

774
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:52,210
the next time we played the
Leicester Square theater,

775
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:54,820
hopefully there'll be there.
Then maybe they yell some shit out.

776
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:58,720
We have a good time. All right.
Question from New Zealand.

777
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:03,550
Um, I live in Christ
church, New Zealand. Oh Gee,

778
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,790
the Christchurch,
all one word.

779
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,990
I live in Christchurch,
New Zealand, by the way.

780
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,210
I'm going to midnight mass
tonight with Nias Mom.

781
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,380
Uh,
boy with the fucking choir.

782
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,410
He able to in La.
I lodge a those brown eyes bad.

783
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,850
UHM,
Uhm,

784
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,890
two e two years ago we had
an earthquake in New Zealand.

785
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:36,850
I didn't hear about that. Then
again, I don't pay attention to shit.

786
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,190
Two years ago we had an earthquake,

787
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:43,690
which wreck the city and killed a couple
hundred people and almost killed me too.

788
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,740
Now for three years I've been going out
with a great girl. She's Nice, smart,

789
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,650
caring, fun to hang out with
and I'm not sick of banging.

790
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,890
Her problem is her cousin got killed in
the earthquake. Oh, sorry to hear that.

791
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,590
And ever since then.
She's been terrified.

792
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,230
The aftershocks have all but stopped now.

793
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:06,820
But she hasn't recovered every time a
truck buys drives past on the road outside

794
00:50:06,821 --> 00:50:09,280
my house,
she flinches and trembles.

795
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,980
Sometimes she cries randomly.

796
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,650
She won't move away from the city
because all of her family is here and I'm

797
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:21,910
pretty much at the end of my
rope aside aside from this,

798
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:26,230
she might be even marriage material
by just can't deal with this anymore.

799
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,530
On the day of the quake, I was within 20
feet of being squashed like a great buy,

800
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:34,260
a four story building that
fell on the sidewalk. Uh,

801
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:37,730
I've just been walking on while
she was having lunch in a park.

802
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,310
Okay.

803
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:43,590
So I can't sympathize with her
meant mental fragility anymore.

804
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,760
It's been too long with no improvement.

805
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:47,730
Yeah.

806
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,880
Um, I don't even know how the
fuck I expect you to help me.

807
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:55,320
I guess I just want to complain without
anyone I know in real life calling me an

808
00:50:55,321 --> 00:50:59,220
asshole for it because the perception in
my social circle is that I have to just

809
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:03,420
deal with it, but I'm not sure I can
do it for another two years anyway.

810
00:51:03,421 --> 00:51:05,580
That's my problem.
Any advice would be appreciated.

811
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,880
Come and do a show in New
Zealand sometimes because
this is a great country for

812
00:51:08,881 --> 00:51:11,640
a tourist and I can't be bothered
going to the states to see you.

813
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,960
And aside from that,
enjoy what might be the longest range.

814
00:51:15,961 --> 00:51:20,050
Go Fuck yourself for the week.
Cheers mate. Take care. Um,

815
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,600
well this meeting as you sound,
I totally relate to that

816
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,800
and you kind of sound like a
little bit of a Waldorf Psycho,

817
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,700
which I also relate to. So
you're probably, you know,

818
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,000
okay.

819
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,600
Despite the fact that building almost
fell on you, which is kind of a stretch,

820
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,540
I consider a building almost fell on you.

821
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,850
Like it starts to fall and
you run out of the way.

822
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,570
Not that I was just there 20 minutes ago.
Yeah.

823
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:51,040
You wouldn't a thousand other
fucking people. All right. Um,

824
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,570
but anyways, yeah, I totally get
what you, you know, I get it.

825
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:00,280
I get it.
Two years of every time a truck goes by,

826
00:52:00,281 --> 00:52:05,110
as you start shaking movie doing
that. Yeah. Fucking drive me nuts.

827
00:52:05,111 --> 00:52:08,230
After a while, at some point you've
got to grow up and get over it.

828
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,813
You know,

829
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,820
it's like living with the fucking show.

830
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:12,703
Wow.

831
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,050
Sitting there with his
eyes are bugged out,

832
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:19,680
shaken and pain in the fucking
corner. At some point, you know,

833
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:22,250
you got to grow a Dick. You have,
you asked her to go to that.

834
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,510
Have you asked her to go to therapy?
Maybe you should do that.

835
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,530
That's what Nia suggested when she did.
She did the first podcast that I lost.

836
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,420
Uh, she's not available now.
She was on a little, um,

837
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,250
she suggested that you
ask her to go to therapy.

838
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:42,660
Just sit down and say,
listen,

839
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:47,661
I'm concerned with the fact that you
still this traumatized by the earthquake

840
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:51,840
and I want to help you get
some help and start with that.

841
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,410
And if she doesn't get help and she
keeps shaking and trembling in the corner

842
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:59,700
and peeing like a little
Yorkshire terrier, um,

843
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,333
I dunno,
Dude.

844
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,060
You either got to break up with her or
you got to lay off the booze because

845
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:08,520
something's going to, something's
going to, you're going to snap

846
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,900
at some point. She's going to be like,
you're going to be a little drunk.

847
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,600
And you could, you could, you've had a
bad day. You're having a couple. Yeah.

848
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:19,380
Throwing them down. They'll fucking
shoe. Right. And all of a sudden,

849
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,130
whatever happens, somebody blows
their nose next door and she's

850
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,490
doing that shit.
And you're going to be like,

851
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,890
you're just gonna look at her an imitator
and then,

852
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,620
and that's gonna fucking destroyer.
You're going to do that. Jesus.

853
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:37,080
That just sounded creepy when I did that.
But it's good. It's kind of happened.

854
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,850
So I tried to get her help her, I would
get out of the fucking relationship.

855
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,780
Yeah. I mean, it's been two fucking years.

856
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,690
It's been two fucking years.
Okay. And, uh, you know,

857
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:56,920
she's acting like it happened two
weeks ago. Yeah. Two years. That's,

858
00:53:56,921 --> 00:54:00,130
that's plenty of fucking time to get,
I mean,

859
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:03,520
you never get over losing somebody,
but like,

860
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,460
I still have it be that fucking raw that,
you know,

861
00:54:06,461 --> 00:54:11,170
somebody can't even break wind without
you view breaking down crying is, is uh,

862
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:12,761
you know,
I mean,

863
00:54:12,761 --> 00:54:16,090
maybe she's that sensitive and if she's
that fucking sensitive and you're not,

864
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,840
I don't know. Sometimes opposites attract,
but I don't think it is in this case.

865
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:24,190
Uh, that's it. All right. 24 year
old virgin on first date. Hello Bill.

866
00:54:24,191 --> 00:54:27,790
And possibly Neil. Sorry,
she's not here this week.

867
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:32,210
She was during the first
taping. I'm sorry. Um,

868
00:54:32,211 --> 00:54:35,800
and it should be deduced by the
subject line. I'm a major pussy.

869
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:39,820
I've had absolutely zero
romantic experiences in my life.

870
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,870
I took some pretty brutal rejections when
I was in high school and have been too

871
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:45,490
timid to try my luck sense.

872
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,450
It's not like I'm a cowering blubbering
mess when I'm talking to women either.

873
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:53,620
I just think tend to think why bother.
I know what she's going to say.

874
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,720
It's a loser mentality, which is stupid.
I know. So what do you need my help for,

875
00:54:58,721 --> 00:55:02,170
sir? You know, you're being a
pussy and you know you're, you're,

876
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:06,100
you're psyching yourself out.
You know what's going on.

877
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:12,680
Ah, you know what the deal is.
All right, let's keep Rina by now.

878
00:55:12,681 --> 00:55:16,580
There's this girl who's really interested
in me. I'm not used to that feeling,

879
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:20,660
blah. Come on dude. What? What's,

880
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:21,770
what the fuck is wrong with you?

881
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:23,860
Okay,

882
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,920
bye. Now these young girl, they
judge me and I'm not used to that.

883
00:55:26,921 --> 00:55:28,510
What are you a fucking cyclops?

884
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,110
You can't believe the kind of
guys that women are interested in.

885
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,650
They're not just about looks,
you know,

886
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:40,210
they're about senses of humor. Uh, money.

887
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,920
Sorry. I know that they like
other shit. Um, we met in an,

888
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:49,150
in an English course. She's attractive,
way smarter than me and funny as fuck.

889
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,630
We have a lot in common and she's almost
a single cynical and black card. It is.

890
00:55:52,631 --> 00:55:57,100
I am. She's perfect. She's got a
lot of issues though within the,

891
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,230
within minutes of the
first time we talked,

892
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:04,120
she started telling me about
how she cuts herself. Oh, Jesus.

893
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,810
And about how often she tries to kill
herself. All right. Right there, dude.

894
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:08,644
It's over.

895
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:09,820
Okay.

896
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,680
My Damn Self.
Okay.

897
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:17,030
And he goes on to say she's
bipolar and schizophrenia.

898
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:23,120
All right guys, if you're gonna make up
emails, can you try to do a better job?

899
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,060
Not Make them this fucking over the top.

900
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,610
Okay,

901
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:30,480
dude, you use deduced in the first fucking
sentence of your email and you're too

902
00:56:30,481 --> 00:56:33,990
fucking dumb to not know to get
away from this. If this is true,

903
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,740
I'll play along whatever.
It's Christmas. I play along.

904
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,070
Let's just act like this is true.
She's bipolar and schizophrenia. Oh,

905
00:56:41,071 --> 00:56:44,130
that's great. She caught herself,
tries to kill herself. She's bipolar.

906
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:47,350
She's schizophrenia. You
know, I think that, I think

907
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:52,800
it's all their
bipolar and schizophrenia.

908
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:56,730
That's like the two piece meal at Kentucky
Fried Chicken with a side of cutting

909
00:56:56,731 --> 00:57:01,650
yourself and it's a go big
gulp of suicide. There you go.

910
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,980
That's what you want to let in your inner
circle. Uh, she's told me that she's,

911
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:10,770
she has a slew of characters that talk
to her, which she, oh, go fuck yourself.

912
00:57:10,771 --> 00:57:15,670
All right, nice try buddy. Okay,
I'm done with this email. Alright.

913
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:17,830
Introspective drugs.

914
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:21,550
Hey bill loved the podcast and I've got
gotten a lot of my friends to listen to

915
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:24,940
you in the last few months.
I'm a 40 niners fan.

916
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,240
I love hearing patriots fans,
bitch when they get beat.

917
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:33,180
Well you don't hear that a lot do
you? Huh? Let me ask you a question.

918
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:37,350
Are you good at catching punts? You
want to play that game sir? Huh?

919
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,220
Haven't won anything in 20 fucking years.
How'd you like that Seattle beat down?

920
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:44,680
You know what?
Here's my Pete Carroll impression for you.

921
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:48,070
How many times do you just
see this last night? Whoo,

922
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:53,280
that sounds too much like ric flair.
I got to get some NFL films,

923
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:56,970
audio of what he sounds like when he
said when he does that. Anyways, he goes,

924
00:57:56,971 --> 00:58:01,971
I know you hang out with Joe Rogan and
a lot of famous La Comedians and I'm

925
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:07,941
curious if you ever are willing to
get down with mushrooms or any kind of

926
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:12,600
psychedelic substance.
Um, get down with it.

927
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:18,270
Get down. Um, not like today or next week.

928
00:58:18,271 --> 00:58:19,980
Just anytime when the rest of your life,

929
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,010
you seem like the kind of guy
who would be balls out laughing,

930
00:58:23,011 --> 00:58:26,700
making everybody else laugh
with introspective insights.
Oh, there's no doubt.

931
00:58:26,701 --> 00:58:29,160
I would have a great fucking time
if I ever did it, but that's,

932
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,460
that's really what scares me.
You know what I mean?

933
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,240
Like when I listened to people who've
done mushrooms, I listened to it.

934
00:58:36,241 --> 00:58:40,890
It sounds fucking awesome.
It does. But uh, you know,

935
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:46,420
there's a price that you pay
when you do shit like that. See,

936
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:49,270
I like being ignorant,
you know what I mean?

937
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,050
Like walking into nature's sober is,

938
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,120
is awesome to me because I don't know
that if I was on mushrooms that I would be

939
00:58:58,781 --> 00:59:02,920
enjoying a tree that much more. The fact
that I never did it. Like, you know,

940
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:08,980
like the first time you get high
if you shoot up with heroin,

941
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:14,010
like those guys chase that every fucking
day no matter what they do see that

942
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:19,000
paid for each game. Wasn't that
unbelievable compared to what, you know,

943
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:23,510
once you shot up, it's, it's,
it's only so fucking enjoyable.

944
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,063
So

945
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:31,210
drug scare me because I know that I would
really enjoy them and I've seen what

946
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:35,110
they've done to a lot of
people's lives. And, um,

947
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,530
and I'm not literally saying you
ended up on the street homeless.

948
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:40,060
I'm not talking about that extreme thing.

949
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:45,061
I'm just saying how I've seen a lot of
people waste a lot of time and talent and

950
00:59:46,871 --> 00:59:51,430
potential and all that
type of stuff. But, uh,

951
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:56,110
I do not question why people
do them at all. You know,

952
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,420
I would love to hallucinate,
you know,

953
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,500
I'd love to talk to a sneaker.

954
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:06,080
Why wouldn't you talk to everything else
that can talk at this point? I'm on a,

955
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,320
you know, be a new experience. But the
problem is I just feel like I would,

956
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:14,220
I would love it. And uh, you know,

957
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,650
that's why I don't do it anyways.

958
01:00:16,651 --> 01:00:20,190
There's a lot of comedians
talk about we topical Shit,

959
01:00:20,191 --> 01:00:24,210
but it seems like you have a deep vein
of intelligence that a certain audience

960
01:00:24,211 --> 01:00:26,970
hones in on. Oh, I get it.

961
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,710
I see what you're buttering me up and
you want to do mushrooms with me this,

962
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,810
so this is what you're treating me
like an 18 year old incoming freshmen.

963
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,610
You know he had the most beautiful
girl here. You're not like the others

964
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:44,760
now dude, I'm, I'm, I'm
not saying I never would,

965
01:00:44,761 --> 01:00:48,540
but like I just, I, I'm not
going, I know myself too.

966
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:52,500
Well the should I do with
alcoholism that enough,

967
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,640
enough of a fucking side,
you know,

968
01:00:56,641 --> 01:01:00,150
I'm going to be buzzed at night when
I go to church as district. I can't,

969
01:01:00,151 --> 01:01:03,390
I can't show up. And he goes,
mom, no booze on my breath.
I wasn't raised like that.

970
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,900
You know when I tell you, watch that
guy breaks open the wine I l bits,

971
01:01:06,901 --> 01:01:10,230
all bets are off underrated.
A flask

972
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,410
flask at midnight mass.

973
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,580
You know what's the great thing about a
flask is if somebody catches you with it

974
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,820
all yet all you do to get out of
it is you, you, you look at them,

975
01:01:20,821 --> 01:01:23,370
you do that nod and you
give them a little toast

976
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:26,760
and it's just so awkward.

977
01:01:26,761 --> 01:01:30,900
They have to nod and kind of give you
like a fucking black power fist back to

978
01:01:30,901 --> 01:01:35,670
you. What are they going to do, you know?
Anyways, girlfriend, jealous of dog.

979
01:01:35,671 --> 01:01:39,420
Dearest William. I watched your standup
special, my girlfriend and we loved it.

980
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,340
Oh well thank you very much. Um, anyways,
my girlfriend is jealous of my dog.

981
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,590
The dog is small and I have often
have it laying with me on the couch,

982
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:52,550
sleeping in bed with us.
Um,

983
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:56,580
of course I'm cuddling with my girlfriend
at the same time while you cuddle with

984
01:01:56,581 --> 01:02:00,960
a beast, I know it's a little dog,
but still, you know, so you got like,

985
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,780
you've got a little
threesome going on there.

986
01:02:03,781 --> 01:02:07,430
I kind of see why she would be annoyed.
Um,

987
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,850
but she still complains.

988
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:14,370
Then I'm more affectionate with the dog
and is often mean and abusive to the

989
01:02:14,371 --> 01:02:18,960
dog, pushing her around, calling
her a slut, slash whore, et.

990
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,930
Has this happened to you?

991
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:26,610
Am I out of my mind or was it strange
for a girl to be jealous of an animal?

992
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:31,500
All right, dude, here's the thing. Um,

993
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:36,420
you need to stop sleeping with your dog.
When your girlfriend's there,

994
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:40,560
you got to know that humans
are higher up than dogs, okay?

995
01:02:40,561 --> 01:02:45,360
Treat your girl with a little more
respect, okay? First off, and secondly,

996
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:49,190
you need to dump that woman,
okay?

997
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,990
That whole shit.

998
01:02:50,991 --> 01:02:55,100
They're like getting jealous
of the dog is one thing.

999
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,480
Is that jealous of the dog?

1000
01:02:56,481 --> 01:03:01,481
She's just upset that you probably
say way more lovey dubby things to the

1001
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:05,570
fucking dog and are way more
affectionate to the fucking dog.

1002
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,250
Caressing the dog. Petting it way more
than you are her. So that's normal.

1003
01:03:10,251 --> 01:03:10,971
But when she takes it,

1004
01:03:10,971 --> 01:03:15,971
the point of the bizarre calling the dog
a slut or a whore and then hitting an

1005
01:03:16,851 --> 01:03:21,230
animal, pushing around on any
fucking level, let's that's
a done deal right there.

1006
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,840
All right?
If those street lights were there,

1007
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,400
I don't know what color
she would come out,

1008
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:29,570
but it wouldn't be the color that I
am. All right? All the American here,

1009
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,110
Apple Pie and Chevrolet.
Fuck Chevrolet. I like Fords,

1010
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,180
but you know what I'm saying?
That's what you gotta do.

1011
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,060
You got to curb your attention.

1012
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,790
You're giving to your dog and you
got to dump that woman. That's it.

1013
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:44,240
Anyone who was mean to a fucking animal?
Is there a piece of shit?

1014
01:03:44,241 --> 01:03:45,380
And that's the tip of the iceberg.

1015
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:49,580
It's the Bronx tale lock
the door test right there.
You're out. See Ya. All right.

1016
01:03:49,581 --> 01:03:53,840
Overrated. Underrated a bill. I love the
podcast and listen to it all the time.

1017
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:58,160
I think there are way too many
overrated sports cliches. For example,

1018
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:02,840
give 110% taking one game at a time,

1019
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:08,150
at the end of the day, et Cetera. Any
halftime interview with any coach.

1020
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,810
What do you think, Bill? What's
your opinion on sports cliches?

1021
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:14,840
Are they overrated or underrated?
If so,

1022
01:04:14,841 --> 01:04:18,200
what are some of your favorite
slash most annoying ones?

1023
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,170
Um, all right. Well this time of year they
always have the classic, I'll tell Ya,

1024
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,970
they're the eight and 16. Nobody
wants to play. They got that one.

1025
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:32,990
Um,
they always have that team,

1026
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:37,130
the best team with the shitty
record that nobody wants to play.

1027
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,510
MMM.
The,

1028
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,480
the, the one that the coach
will say, I'll tell you,

1029
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:44,700
you give me 22 on those guys.

1030
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:49,690
Give me 22 of those guys
and I go on defeated. Uh,

1031
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,310
they don't make 'em like that guy. He's
a throwback. That guys is throwback.

1032
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,570
The lovely Nia.
Everybody just walked in.

1033
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:01,680
You walked in later and he
went by the whole thing. Um,

1034
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,060
what are some of the other ones? Oh,
I, this is the one I hate the most.

1035
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:09,390
I'll tell you. I hate that guy. But
if he played for he had loved them,

1036
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:14,130
they always say that about those
dirty pieces of shit that go and like

1037
01:05:14,131 --> 01:05:18,010
deliberately blow somebody's knee out
and in their career. And for the record,

1038
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,670
I wouldn't love them if they
played for my team. I wouldn't,

1039
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,500
I don't like dirty pieces of Shit,

1040
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:27,280
whether they're wearing the uniform of
the team that I love or that I hate.

1041
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:31,660
I don't like those guys. So, um, I dunno
if that's an overrated, underrated,

1042
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:37,380
but I gave you overrated, underrated,
underrated. Bringing a flask to midnight.

1043
01:05:37,381 --> 01:05:39,510
Mass is underrated

1044
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:46,260
and uh, they need to come
over. We only got one. Mike,
come over here for a second.

1045
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:52,560
How was, uh, how'd that Pie look?
That pie looked amazing. It was.

1046
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:56,400
I walked in and I was like, oh, it
was beautiful. You did a great job.

1047
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,290
And how manly did I look in that apron?

1048
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:05,270
I don't understand why you won't
allow me to tweet pictures like this.

1049
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,410
Well I think cause I get an cause I
get enough shit. Why help him out?

1050
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:14,510
I yeah, I laugh for a solid five minutes
on that one. That was, that was good.

1051
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:17,120
It was great. But that pilot looks
amazing. I can't wait to have it tomorrow.

1052
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,570
All right.
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to,

1053
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:23,660
I'm going to fucking send out
the picture of the pot. Yeah.

1054
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,030
And watch still shit all over that.

1055
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:28,680
They'll shit all over the
edge of [inaudible]. You
already throwing somebody.

1056
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,400
They saw me take a shit on it.

1057
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:35,170
Did they know what a gourmet cook you
are though? Have you talked about that?

1058
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:38,320
How you're really your skills
in the kitchen? I've become

1059
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,140
quite good. Thank you. That was, that
was those damn near a compliment.

1060
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,830
It is a compliment. And you made that,
that prime? No, the braised short ribs,

1061
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,290
which was amazing.
Braised short ribs.

1062
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:53,320
He made it a braised short ribs
about this beautiful bottle of wine.

1063
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:56,140
It was very romantic. It was
still, and it was delicious too.

1064
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:57,640
It was like restaurant quality.

1065
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,540
Good. Yeah. Overrated
cooking. It's not that hard.

1066
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,440
All these fucking jackass is on the food
network and this is blah, blah blah.

1067
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:06,820
This is going to infuse and that's,

1068
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,260
it takes a certain amount of
creativity, I think. You know,

1069
01:07:10,261 --> 01:07:13,470
to like make something really special.
Anyone can make a by the book recipe,

1070
01:07:13,471 --> 01:07:15,060
but you've got to add your own little,
you know,

1071
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:19,810
that's all I'm doing. Udl. You got a
jazz thing. They own. What? Don't ever,

1072
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,720
don't ever do that again. No, I don't.

1073
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:25,960
I just follow the recipe word
for fucking word. That's it.

1074
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,110
When you get more,
when you get more confident,

1075
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:30,870
you'll be able to improvise a little
bit more. You won't have to do that.

1076
01:07:30,871 --> 01:07:32,370
You'll just be like,
I'm making this today.

1077
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:36,020
I seem insecure when I'm in the kitchen
of sitting there wearing a woman's

1078
01:07:36,021 --> 01:07:36,880
fucking apron.

1079
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:42,540
You got you. You, you're wearing my
friend. Yeah. That your mom gave me.

1080
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:44,940
So it was kinda like, well, either way

1081
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:50,000
I laughed. Yes, she did. All
right, well, merry Christmas,

1082
01:07:50,001 --> 01:07:53,450
Nia and Chris. Merry
Christmas. Happy Hanukkah.

1083
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:57,220
Happy Kwanza and Christmas everybody.
Everybody.

1084
01:07:57,221 --> 01:08:00,680
And thank you everybody that sheer,
everybody coming out to my shows.

1085
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:04,820
Everybody who's listened, anybody who
is advertised on this pod pod class,

1086
01:08:04,821 --> 01:08:07,400
podcast.
God bless Ya.

1087
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,520
Go fuck yourselves.

1088
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:15,960
We got one more Monday left in this year.
I hope you guys have good time. Dona.

1089
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,760
And I know there's gonna be some Douche
bags at Christmas and in law or it's

1090
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:23,780
just somebody you don't fucking
like and uh, just whatever. Don't,

1091
01:08:23,781 --> 01:08:27,840
don't engage for the sake of your mom,
your dad, or just everybody or the,

1092
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:32,270
even the person you're with. Just don't
get involved in it. All right? And just,

1093
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:35,170
I dunno, I dunno. Tam,

1094
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:38,720
go stand under the street light to see
what color they are. All right. That's it.

1095
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,680
Go fuck yourselves.
