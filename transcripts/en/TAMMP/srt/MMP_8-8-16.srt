1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,580
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:07,510
It's bill burn his time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday, uh,

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,970
August 8th,
2016 let me move close to the mic there.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,360
Try not to have it on my chest so
you don't to listen to me breathing.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,780
I know it's been an issue last
couple of podcasts, but like I said,

6
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:24,250
I'm out here on the road and the little
mix of that I use is a piece of shit.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,810
And even if I have an adapter for
some reason it seems to blow up. Um,

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,960
it probably didn't, I probably
plugged into the wall and I fucked up.

9
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:35,280
But who knows.
So I am in a,

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,060
as an American would say Edinburg. I don't
know how to fuck they say in Scotland.

11
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,010
I just did a show,
believe it or not,

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,930
I'm at like a quarter to four
in the afternoon out here.

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,040
I have shows at three 45 and 1130.

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,950
I don't know why I thought it was
cause I signed on late to the festival.

15
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:00,940
I have no idea,
but I'm going to tell you man,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,360
it was a fucking great time. It
was a great time. Look at that.

17
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:07,030
I just got a message here. All right. Um,

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,550
let me shut this fucking thing off.

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,013
Uh,

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,740
all right. So anyways, so I'd,
yeah, I just did a show. I
got to tell you, I loved it.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,990
I'm sitting there the whole time going
over there, being this cranky fucking,

22
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:25,650
you know, little showgirl, right.
I was in Amsterdam last night,

23
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:28,920
which is a great show. So
today I'm flying, I land,

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,020
I get to the fucking hotel. Hotel
isn't ready, you know, as always,

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,210
that's how my travel
always gets put together.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,510
They never let me sleep that extra
hour and a half. They're always like,

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,630
let's get them up and get them
to the next fucking shitty.

28
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:45,150
God forbid he misses his show.
And then you always get,

29
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,850
I always end up landing before
the fucking rooms ready.

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,470
And I know what you think of. Well, Bill,

31
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,650
why don't you have you were somebody
call ahead and ask for an early check in.

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,050
I'll tell you why.
Because I don't live my life that way.

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,060
I live my life moment to fucking moment.
That's,

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,840
I try to,
because if I look too far down the road,

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,410
I have a panic attack and I start getting
overwhelmed and depressed and I just

36
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,920
started going like, it's just flying
by, I'm going to die. So, all right.

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,630
It's not worth contemplating your own
mortality just to get a fucking early

38
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,970
check in.
I would rather walk in and then be like,

39
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:28,350
what do you mean the room isn't ready?
But I have a show.

40
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,360
Right. And throw a big
fucking hissy fit. Admit it.

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,370
That's what everybody wants
to see. Um, oh, you know,

42
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:41,850
something I forgot to
mention. Um, you know,

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,640
visiting John Bonham's grave,
the legendary John Bonham, uh,

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,940
and paying my respects such
a quiet, peaceful place. Um,

45
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,370
I was just looking up some stuff on it.
I forgot to mention this.

46
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,080
I don't know if they've
raised enough money,

47
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:58,140
but there's a group of people trying
to make a statue around his hometown.

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,770
It's the Bonham memorial fund. And, um,

49
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,980
I've been trying to reach
out to them to see if,

50
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,430
if they were able to raise the funds
or whatever, but, uh, you know,

51
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:13,180
with all these fucking bullshit
charities out out there, you know,

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,880
um, hopefully this one's legit.
I'm sure it is. But I, you know,

53
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:23,320
it's a pretty fucking cool thing if I
could drive you guys that way for John and

54
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:27,040
rebond bottom statute, I think that would
be, that would be a, that would be great.

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,980
At least I don't know,
something I would like. So, um,

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,680
if anybody knows somebody
connected with that fund,

57
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,370
I tried to send them an email.
I didn't try to,

58
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,270
I sent them an email and I checked
one day to see if they got back to me.

59
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,910
I didn't see anything from them and
I'm really bad at checking email,

60
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:48,850
so I'm worried that I'll never
check again. Um, but, uh,

61
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,320
I don't know. Somebody knows
somebody connected with it and uh,

62
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,680
if you can get some information,
send it to the podcast has sent it to me.

63
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,680
Hopefully I'll fucking see it.
And if they're coming up short,

64
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:03,820
I would love to send some money and make
a donation myself abso-fucking-lutely

65
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,770
towards it.
Um,

66
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,750
couldn't think of anybody more fitting
as far as I'm concerned as a performer.

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,520
Right. Um, all right, so
plowing ahead. So, um,

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:16,811
yeah,

69
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:21,811
so I had a three 45 show today
and I absolutely fucking love it.

70
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:26,230
I went over there and
I'm just thinking like,

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,890
Jesus Christ this [inaudible] give
me a bunch of blue haired old ladies.

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,390
The fuck has a comedy show
at three 45 in the afternoon.

73
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:39,391
We'd reminded me of when I was on my way
up and I was paying my dues and I was

74
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:45,460
humble and I treated my fellow human
beings with respect as opposed to now,

75
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:49,660
like I just sorta room service and like
the water wasn't in a glass bottle and I

76
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:52,180
slapped it down to the ground and I said,
how dare you,

77
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,980
I'm from the United States of America
right now. I didn't do that anyways.

78
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,930
My humble beginnings,
as I was coming up,

79
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,550
we used to do these things at colleges
and they will call newness. You know,

80
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:07,690
I got a nooner it fuck head stayed or
whatever and it was basically you did

81
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,070
stand up,
you know,

82
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:14,071
anywhere from fucking 11 in the morning
to like one in the afternoon and you had

83
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,550
no idea what the fuck you
we're going to walk into.

84
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,110
I mean you knew it was most likely going
to be one of the most humiliating hours

85
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,513
of your life.

86
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,450
You knew like 90% chance that most of
the people in the cafeteria or in the

87
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,130
hallway area or whatever,

88
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,250
had no idea that there was even going
to be a show guaranteed that whoever's

89
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,160
bringing you up on stage
is not in show business.

90
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:48,310
So it's going to be a horrible
fucking intro. The whole thing.

91
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,370
I remember I used to just go on stage
right before I would go on stage.

92
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,170
I would just look at my watch and I would
always think an hour from now this is

93
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:57,004
going to be over.

94
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,090
Okay.

95
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,550
No matter how awful this gets,

96
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,280
no matter how humiliating this gets,

97
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,150
an hour from now I'm going
to be back in the rental car.

98
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,170
I'm gonna drive away from this school
and I don't have to ever think about this

99
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:15,190
fucking show again, but I
will have the money. Okay.

100
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,360
And whatever that pay me,

101
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,680
they probably shouldn't give me twice
that amount because I blew probably at

102
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,730
least three times that on fucking therapy.

103
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:26,160
You have to go in through those things.
But that's how I always used to.

104
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,180
That's how I used to always think it.
And uh,

105
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,260
if you guys think I'm angry and negative
now you should've seen me back then

106
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,460
when I, I didn't even understand.
I'm actually, I'm not negative now,

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,380
but I was way,

108
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,860
way more angry and I was
really fucking negative.

109
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,180
I was always waiting for the other shoe
to drop before, I don't know, I just,

110
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,060
okay,

111
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,331
I don't,

112
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:51,630
I read a bunch of fucking books and
shit and I was able to come out of it.

113
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:54,480
And I know I trash a lot of
shit here on the podcast,

114
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,740
but I like to think
that when I give advice,

115
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,270
you know, you can hear the
twinkle in my eye. You know,

116
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:06,450
it starts to sound like Christmas
when I tried to help somebody up.

117
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,610
Maybe I'm not,
maybe I'm the same way,

118
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,510
but I mean back then I will at least I
wasn't even fucking aware of fucking nuts.

119
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:17,040
I was. And uh, I would just
go up there and I was just,

120
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,710
I dunno if somebody said anything.

121
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:23,280
I just tried to chop their fucking head
off and a lot of times they weren't

122
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:28,281
being mean and I ended up creating the
fucking hostile situation between me and

123
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,710
the crowd that I didn't want.
I wanted it to be an easy gig.

124
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,730
So why would you go up there and smile
and be like, Hey, it's great to be here.

125
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:39,270
You know, blah, blah, blah and try
to ingratiate yourself to the people.

126
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,670
You know why I don't know how to do that.

127
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,030
I don't know how to do that
because when I grew up,

128
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,820
I didn't see anybody doing that.
All right.

129
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,540
There's very few people from
where I'm from, from even fucking,

130
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,690
have you ever used the word ingratiating?
I'm day right now.

131
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:59,750
I have no idea how to spell it.
All right.

132
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:03,950
The first letter is either an I or an e.

133
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,370
Is it end gray? She, anyone
in, in, in Greece? I, I'm
going to go with [inaudible].

134
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,860
I'm gonna try to spell it right now.
Let's see what do we got here? Come on.

135
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:14,060
And Bill, I'm going to,
I'm going to close my eyes.

136
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,920
I N G R so it doesn't help
out in gray. C I a T. I n. G

137
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,940
come on one time. One time, get it right.

138
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,010
Oh fuck you.

139
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:27,940
Okay.

140
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,050
It's I N G R a. T. I. A. T.
I. N. G. I miss one letter.

141
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,190
Do you know what I mean? That's like
being off a degree in the space shuttle.

142
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:37,810
The next thing you know
you're on fucking Mars.

143
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,010
You know when you were trying to go to
a, I dunno, Jupiter will go with Jupiter.

144
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,100
Um, let me go back here. So anyways, um,

145
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,030
I was sitting backstage
waiting to go on and Ellen was,

146
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,870
the show was fucking tremendous
and I know, and I was like,

147
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:56,610
why the fuck do I think that
was going to stink? This is why.

148
00:08:56,611 --> 00:09:00,240
Because the last time I did shit like
that, nobody knew who the fuck I was.

149
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,260
No one knew there was a comedy
show. This shit. I went there.

150
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:05,220
It was people that listen to the podcast.

151
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,630
They wanted to go there and they
knew it was a show. So now I'm like,

152
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,530
holy fuck.

153
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,300
I want to do fucking quarter to four
in the afternoon shows from now on.

154
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,710
Fuck this. Eight, nine, 10
o'clock at night. Shit, dude,

155
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:22,580
if I could have my day over,
ah,

156
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,860
that would be the greatest thing ever.
I want to become the 11:00 AM comedian.

157
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,990
Be like back in the day. I'll become
a morning person again. Who's kidding?

158
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,380
Who with all my fucking demons, I can't
sleep on four hours a night. Anyways,

159
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,191
my wife says,

160
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:44,850
I always have a fucking look on my
face of worry or I'm thrashing about.

161
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,100
I'm a fucking mess.
She goes,

162
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:51,570
the only time you fucking sleep peacefully
is when you get fucking drunk. Uh,

163
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,040
but then I snore. I mean, as I've
told you before, like I'm a fucking,

164
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,950
my wife says sync putting
up with me. So anyways. Um,

165
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,390
I would fucking love to do that.
You know,

166
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,570
if I had it like a show Friday
night in a show Saturday night,

167
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,190
if I can move them up

168
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,620
till like four in the afternoon.
Right.

169
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,240
Even if I did a two hour show,

170
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:20,241
I would be done at six
o'clock at night fucking rap.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,140
And then at that point
I can go to a ball gag.

172
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,120
I can go see all the shit that I miss.
That would be perfect.

173
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,480
But it sucked for the four of us coming
up to see me because they'd have to

174
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:33,420
leave work early.
Maybe the Saturday night show,

175
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,180
I dunno, probably wouldn't work
people to use the other way,

176
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,010
but I have to tell you, like
I, if I didn't have this
1130 show to do right now,

177
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,680
like I like the level of excited.
I feel like, you know what?

178
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,890
I feel like right now, I feel like
I got a day off from, from school.

179
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,970
You know when you were a kid,

180
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,770
except I got that other one hanging over
my head at 1130. Oh God. It was great.

181
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:59,070
The people were fucking sober.
It was tremendous.

182
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,460
I know a number of comics
that do, like they, they,

183
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,730
there's a few comics who worked totally
clean and they do like afternoon shows

184
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,090
and um, I've always pictured
it being like, Oh God, you
must meet. See afternoon,

185
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,330
the sun's out. You did. You,

186
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:16,710
you must have to be like
beyond clean and wholesome.

187
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,750
And I gotta tell you, I just
did my fucking act. You know,

188
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,310
it's hard as I would have done it at
night and it worked fine. So I dunno,

189
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,470
I might've accidentally
stumbled onto something,

190
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,690
so sorry about clearing my throat every
five seconds. I just been, you know,

191
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,690
working every night, uh, doing this tour
and I gotta tell you, man, this is one,

192
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,370
this has been one of the best
tours of my career as far as, uh,

193
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,380
just the people showing up and the venues
that I've gotten to play when I last

194
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,780
left. Yes. Um,

195
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,110
when I checked in on you on Thursday,
I was,

196
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,060
I just gone to Bristol,
England,

197
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,710
the place where those ants were crawling
all over the chocolate cake and I had a

198
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,510
great time.
They're great show.

199
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,130
And then I went to a legendary Manchester,
England,

200
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,490
and um,
I gotta be honest with you.

201
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,520
That was the one out of all the
shows that I'm doing on this tour.

202
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,320
That was the one that I was
concerned about. I'm like, all right,

203
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,850
this is Manchester man,
United man city,

204
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,970
the fucking hooligans
and all of this shit.

205
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,560
And the only thing I knew about
them was that book that I read.

206
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:32,920
I can't remember if I brought
this up Thursday. I read
that book among the thugs,

207
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,840
whether there was an old, uh, American
journal journalist who was considered old.

208
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,680
He was in his thirties.

209
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,490
He was considered a good Giza and
he somehow infiltrated them and,

210
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,520
and just some of the violence that they
fucking talked about when they were over

211
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:49,960
there. I remember some of the
fucking stories. Do you know,

212
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:50,830
there was something that,

213
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,010
I'm not saying that this was
specifically done in Manchester,

214
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:58,360
but Manchester was only the,
the only soccer city that I
knew, I didn't even know,

215
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,020
or football as they say,
like Liverpool to me was the Beatles.

216
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,820
And meanwhile,

217
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,250
the Liverpool team before
Manchester started,

218
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,980
went on their run up until about 1990
and one more championships than anybody.

219
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:16,390
And I had no fucking
idea. Um, but anyways,

220
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:20,410
I guess one of the things he's fucking
hooligans used to do is they'd have a box

221
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:22,540
cutter or a raise or Assam shit.
Right.

222
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,150
And they'd get so fucking sharp that
they'd come up behind the supporter of

223
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,980
another club.
Uh,

224
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:33,640
when they were standing up waiting to
go in and they'd slash right across your

225
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:36,550
ass, um, you know,

226
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:39,370
horizontally and it was so sharp,

227
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:43,960
it would go right through your fucking
pants slash right across both butt cheeks.

228
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
All right.
And was done so quick.

229
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,420
By the time the person realize what was
going on in the other person had taken

230
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,910
off and is the fucking thing,
it,

231
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,100
it cut deep enough that you needed
stitches to close it. All right.

232
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,880
And the reason why they did it there was
so then while you're waiting for like a

233
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,860
week, I'm trying to remember when
I used to get stitches in it,

234
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,750
depending on how bad it was or what,
anywhere from three,

235
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:10,720
four days to like a week later
they took it out. Basically,

236
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,840
you couldn't sit down or
you'd pull the stitches out.

237
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,300
So you can't sit down, you can't sleep
on your back and God for, you know,

238
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,260
you gotta take a dump
your dough.

239
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,800
And I was thinking you'd have to get
in that, you know, that yoga position,

240
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:31,180
that table position. It's
basically, you know, I dunno,

241
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,150
just imagine trying to make
yourself a table facing up.

242
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:37,750
You'd have to do that and put a bucket
underneath you and then you can't tell me,

243
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,130
uh, God, there's, you know, during
the process of that it's not hurting.

244
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,610
The fucking misery of
that is unbelievable.

245
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:49,150
And I mentioned that to
somebody when I was up there.

246
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,830
And then they talked about,

247
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,590
another thing that they would do
is they realize that, you know,

248
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:57,230
if he cuts someone with a box car did,
they could stitch it up.

249
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,670
So then what they did was they put two
blades side by side that were far enough

250
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:04,040
apart that when you slash the person,

251
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,760
there wasn't any way for
the doctor to stitch it up.

252
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,490
They had to like glue it up
because the space was too big.

253
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:13,400
Just some fucking sadistic shit.
So anyways,

254
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,560
other fucking really gross things that
I read. So in my head I was just like,

255
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:22,580
Jesus Christ, this is like, I'm going,

256
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:26,580
this is gonna be like a Philly
show with box cutters. And um,

257
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,500
it was the exact opposite. It was
great. And I gotta be honest with you,

258
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:34,080
it felt like a show in like Boston.

259
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:38,490
Like I really felt some sort
of weird connection with, uh,

260
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,990
the sound of the crowd's weird.
Every crowd sounds a little bit different.

261
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,570
And, uh, they had that working
class, blue collar, you know,

262
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,770
sucker punched in a bar fucking vibe,
you know,

263
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:57,030
that I grew up at now, I was no tough
guy. I just grew up there. So I saw,

264
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,440
I used to see the violence and try to
get the fuck away from it. Like I said,

265
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,760
I basically fought other kids up
until about sixth grade, you know,

266
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,330
I had a bunch of baby fat, so I was
like, I was in a higher weight class.

267
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:13,890
Then all of a sudden I liked thinned out
and I was one of the scrawny your kids.

268
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:18,300
And then my fighting career abruptly
ended with a couple of ass kickings and I

269
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:21,150
was like, all right, why don't we
try being funny from here on out? So,

270
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,083
mmm.

271
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,310
After that, people just
kept getting bigger and the
injuries got worse. You know,

272
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,130
people laying on the floor of the bar
is someone's repeatedly kicking him in,

273
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:33,440
the head, teeth get knocked out. And I
was just like, yeah, you know, I, uh,

274
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I don't want to do that to somebody and
I definitely don't want that done to me.

275
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:42,660
So, uh, I'm gonna Start, you
know, I utilize my footwear
a lot when I was younger,

276
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,750
walking away, running away, skipping
away, whatever the fuck I had to do,

277
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,180
not interested. So anyways, um,

278
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,420
after I did a Manchester,

279
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,540
then I had my big shows in
London, you know, and uh,

280
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,010
at the Hammersmith Apollo and I went
and I was talking about all the,

281
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,640
all the bands that had played
in Manchester. And, uh,

282
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,910
one of the guys working on the
tour used to uh, run that building.

283
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,840
And he saw everybody from when
the stone roses first came out,

284
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:20,340
red hot chili peppers, all those bands
from that era all played there. So,

285
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,950
um,
when I went to the Hammersmith One,

286
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:25,650
I decided to look up to see
who the fuck has played there.

287
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,460
I mentioned a few of them.
I thought it was Manchester on Thursday,

288
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:32,760
but it was actually the one in London,
like Ziggy stardust,

289
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,940
that character David Bowie,
I thought he retired at the Manchester.

290
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:38,650
Paulo was London. And also, um,

291
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,620
iron maiden did, they're
a, they had a live,

292
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,873
mmm.

293
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,080
See if I can find it
here. What is it, beast

294
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,510
over Hammer Smith.
Um,

295
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,260
and that was in 1982 was sold out show
on that stage and one of the coolest

296
00:17:57,261 --> 00:18:02,120
fucking things ever. That's
when Clive Burr, who shares
my last name, I should say,

297
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:06,610
I share it with him. Um, he
actually played there, um,

298
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,090
just fucking amazing drummer.
But I went to look up all of these.

299
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,160
I hope I'm not boring you guys
with this ship, but this is,

300
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:17,000

that place. All right. 1950s.

as far as standup comedians who perform

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,310
well I'm sorry, a press conference
for the premiere of Celebration Day.

336
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,890
They did it there. So, uh,

337
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,800
in 2012 talk to the press,

338
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,650
that's how big their press conferences
or it's like most people's, you know,

339
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,500
concerts. So there's a picture of plant
page and John Paul Jones on stage.

340
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:36,770
It's pretty fucking killers. So anyways,
all right, I'm done geeking out here,

341
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,550
but I want to thank everybody
who came out to those shows. Uh,

342
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,580
the first night was, uh, was amazing.

343
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:45,630
The light was a little bit
in my eye on the first night,

344
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:49,240
so I couldn't quite see anybody and
they kind of fixed it the second night.

345
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,860
And as great as the first night was,

346
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,620
the second night might have been
one of the best shows I've ever had.

347
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,480
And I remember thinking before I
went out there, you know, I'm like,

348
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,920
you know, who knows if I
ever get to come back. So

349
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,870
make it count dog, go, go out there
like a fucking pussy or something.

350
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:08,720
I forget what happened.

351
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:11,890
And a number of people were talking about
all the heckles I got during the show.

352
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:16,480
It that did, it did not
even remotely bother me. Um,

353
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,600
I didn't find any of them to be
malicious or anything like that.

354
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:24,340
I just feel like I say a lot of dumb
shit when I'm on stage and it just,

355
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:28,370
I just feel like, you know, it makes
people want to like yell some shit. Um,

356
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,350
so anyways,
I got to tell you guys about the fucking,

357
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,530
I'm going to do it. Well, I'll read
a few advertisements here and, uh,

358
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,980
when I'm done stuttering over these,
the live reads,

359
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,050
I got to talk to you about like during
this time of the year in London,

360
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,910
um, a bunch of, uh,

361
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:52,850
Arabs come in to vacation
who have like tons,

362
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:54,920
like basically as far as I could tell,

363
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,190
limitless amounts of money and they're
coming in from the Middle East because

364
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:01,820
it's just so fucking hot.

365
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,850
So they take holiday [inaudible] out
here in London and they fly in on a cargo

366
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,740
plane. All of their supercars. I,

367
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,310
the only reason why I found this
out is because I've, you know,

368
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,880
I've never seen it. I was like, is there
a car show here or something like that.

369
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,160
And they would, then I just
started asking around. I mean,

370
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,110
just one fucking Lamborghini,

371
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:29,800
one Ferrari crazy Mercedes at fuck it.
You know what? Fuck the advertising.

372
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,370
I've got to tell you about this shit.
Like

373
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,530
I've never seen anything like it.
It was like four.

374
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,843
Okay.

375
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,440
Ferrari, California. Is that
the spiders? Uh, the, uh,

376
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,530
and then all these crazy colors like
this one fucking dude over there.

377
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,260
Look first, let me just read about
how they get their shit there,

378
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,880
if I can find it. Oh, you stupid cunt.
Bill. Did you really just mess that up?

379
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,300
Hang on. I gotta hit pause. I don't
want to fuck this up. Oh No, I haven't.

380
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,420
I have it here. Okay, here it is. Um,

381
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:01,800
okay.

382
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,940
So you know, all these, these, uh,
people at the hotel was saying no, these,

383
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:09,420
these people come in, they fly their cars
in and all that. And I was just like,

384
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:13,350
Jesus, they fly their fucking car,
like ship them in or whatever by boat.

385
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,520
Like how much would that cost?
So it says, uh, you know,

386
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,970
there's a website here
revealed how Arab playboys fly.

387
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:25,971
There's supercars in the
London on chartered a cargo
jets for the trifling sum

388
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,560
of 20,000 pounds per vehicle.
Um,

389
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,730
yeah,

390
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,560
20 quid,
whatever the fuck they say.

391
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,770
Cars are flown distances of around 3000
miles in planes such as Qatar Airways,

392
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,200
Airbus, [inaudible],
Lamborghini's, Ferrari's,

393
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:47,630
Mclaren's among vehicles
recently in Knightsbridge area,

394
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,820
which is the really ritzy
area or posh as they say. Um,

395
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,860
and the owners are usually here
only for a couple of weeks.

396
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,600
Dude, this is like a level of
fucking wealth that, you know,

397
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,860
I haven't seen it. I'm not saying that,
you know, it doesn't go on in my country,

398
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:11,200
but this, this, it was
fucking jaw dropping.

399
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,730
So basically I'll send
the link for this thing.

400
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,550
I mean these guys do not fuck around.

401
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,530
These are just some of
the sickest rides ever.

402
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,600
And then what I love is there's this
one guy, yeah, he's a Lamborghini.

403
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,670
There's a yellow one,
there's a grey one.

404
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,640
I didn't know what this other one's
like a McLaren or is that a Ferrari?

405
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,460
And they, and then this is the thing,
because they can all afford them.

406
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,390
They're trying to trick them out.
So there's looks unique.

407
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:40,990
This guy is some sort
of spider webs going on,

408
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:44,110
which is horrific to anybody who
ever considered buying that car.

409
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,850
Like why would you ruin that? Why would
you do that to that fucking work of art?

410
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,180
They look through their hooking these
fucking things up the way. You know,

411
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:55,330
those kids would drive the drifters
and shit. You know what I mean?

412
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,910
Or people drove hot rods.
What always have that.

413
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:01,960
Who's that guy is the guy used to do
all the fucking artwork on those things.

414
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,690
You know what I mean? And
those are like cars, you know,

415
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:07,450
that the kids could afford it to,
to like fix them up.

416
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,790
These are like some of the
richest people in the planet.

417
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,900
They do that to Ferrari's Lamborghini's.
So there's this one fucking guy,

418
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:15,830
okay.

419
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,710
He has all of,

420
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,730
he's like becoming famous because he flew
like six of his fucking cars over and

421
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:26,150
they're all like done in
like this mirror gold.

422
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,450
It's like,
I gotta be honest with you.

423
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:32,490
It's like the gaudiest thing I've
ever seen in my life, but it's,

424
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,470
it's fucking hilarious on,
on another level. Hang on.

425
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,260
All right,
so I found the guy here.

426
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,760
This guy's not even trying to be famous
or anything. I'd always doing it.

427
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:48,761
So Saudi billionaire Turkey Been
Abdula is the man behind the fleet of

428
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:53,750
incredible golden supercars currently
touring wealthy parts of London.

429
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,440
Okay,

430
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,940
dude, this kid, he looks
like he's like fucking 23

431
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,820
all right, these are the
pictures. All right, he's got,

432
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,240
this looks like a Lamborghini,
you know,

433
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,030
they're all the exact same
colored gold and you know,

434
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:13,300
it's funny as they get pictures of them
flying in their private jet and they're

435
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:17,260
doing that stupid piece
sign, Yolo thing, right? Set.

436
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:19,920
They're dressed in like the
traditional, you know, the steel,

437
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,110
the Saudi Arabian head gear that they
were like, it's all fucking white.

438
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,760
And then on top looks like that
traditional, a Betty Crocker tablecloth.

439
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,540
They got that with the
Lebron James Headband on,

440
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,710
right love and life in this private
jet. You know, they didn't rent it.

441
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:38,740
They probably own it. Right?
Then he's got another one.

442
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:40,510
This looks like a fucking one of those,

443
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,880
either a range rover or Mercedes truck.
And this is the greatest thing.

444
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:49,380
Custom Interior, all gold. And in
the driver's seat there's it Cheetah.

445
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,460
Uh, every car is like
350 fucking grand. Yeah.

446
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,340
You know, you ever seen that truck, this
six wheel Mercedes, it's got six wheels.

447
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,700
If going to be careful, these kids next
door, it's got fucking six wheels on it.

448
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,950
There's no fucking reason to have
this truck ever. I mean, the thing is,

449
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:16,220
I mean it's, it's incredible.
Fucking thing is incredible.

450
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,180
He's got one of those in gold. Oh.
And that's where he keeps his Cheetah.

451
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,140
Evidently, I'm just scrolling
down. He's got a range rover.

452
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,380
I mean, they had gaudy. I gotta I
dunno. Then he does him in black.

453
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:32,640
That kind of fucking cool looking.
So anyway,

454
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:36,770
so there's a bunch of people that fucking
can't stand it, you know, of course.

455
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:37,970
You mean you have one of those cars,

456
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:41,840
everybody's going to hate you if you got
fucking six of them and you're getting

457
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:45,650
them, you know, and they look like
the grilled member, those, those,

458
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,220
those fucking grills they used to
make, uh, those guys in Houston,

459
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,330
when that wrapper Paul Wall, I think he
would, he had a line in those things,

460
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:56,420
right? Remember how fucking like,
just in your face, God, he, that was,

461
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,270
but that was just teeth, you know?
So he had to make them laugh first,

462
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:01,910
which is a really difficult thing to do
with the rapper. You know what I mean?

463
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,630
The second they smile, their album
sales, they dropped tremendously.

464
00:28:05,631 --> 00:28:10,060
So it's very rare that she
got him to smile. So was God,

465
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:13,760
he used they word it wasn't that
bad, right? There's no way to,

466
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,100
there's no way to look away from
these fucking cars. 20. He was.

467
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:20,660
So I'm walking down the street right
in London and I'm just looking at the,

468
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:23,450
all these cars. It was like a fucking
car show, man. It was amazing.

469
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,550
So there's this typical fucking,
you know,

470
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,550
showy jerk off in this Lamborghini,
not a gold one. And he's,

471
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,350
he's in like stop and go traffic.

472
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:35,720
And the entire time he's in
stop and go traffic, he's just,

473
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,730
he's just revving the engine one.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

474
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,590
I can't do the high pitch.
You don't,

475
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:46,000
you don't those supercars how
crazy they are. Right. And uh,

476
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,810
I'm trudging along in this humid air
and shit with all these Londoners,

477
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:53,930
right in this fucking ladies. The guys
going is sitting there going like, Whoa,

478
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:58,070
whoa, Whoa, whoa. Do what? All
that stuff. Uh, she just goes, oh,

479
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,120
stop it.

480
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,190
I was fell down on the sidewalk at left
and that's the first time I thought like,

481
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,260
that's what made me research it going
like, like I've always, you know,

482
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:15,940
after the 50th Ferrari went by
and there wasn't a car show,

483
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:18,240
I was starting to sense that
there was something going on here.

484
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,990
But I just thought that these were
just super, I was like, wow. I mean,

485
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:24,570
there's a lot of money in London.
These guys are not fucking around.

486
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:28,560
Who the fuck would live in London? You
got the tube, you got all these taxis.

487
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,370
I mean, like it'd be like, hold on a
Lamborghini and you'll live in Manhattan.

488
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:36,390
You're like, why? Why? That's
just a disgusting level of
wealth. So I was just like,

489
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:39,570
man, these people are, uh, they're
crushing it over here in London.

490
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:43,750
But I guess it's just, um, this
group of people that comes over.

491
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,060
Okay,

492
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,600
dude, you got to look this kid up.
This kid cannot be more than like,

493
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,370
I dunno, 23, 24, dude,

494
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:58,140
he's got a gold Rolls Royce. He's got
a Bentley. I gotta be honest with you.

495
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,630
He knows his fucking car, the six wheels
Mercedes is fucking with ticketless.

496
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,500
Um, I know a lot of people are, you know,
it's blood money. It's this, it's that.

497
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,020
Yeah. You know, you're, you're
right. But whatever, you know,

498
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:11,340
it's fun to look at and you know,

499
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:15,360
something just being someone who
likes to go on stage in life.

500
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,410
I like to entertain people,

501
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:20,050
but it's also really fun to annoy people
and the fact that these people are

502
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,560
coming there and they're driving
around in their fucking cars. Sorry,

503
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:26,340
that just slid down the
pill. Sorry. They're driving
around in their fucking cars.

504
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,300
They're annoying. You know, making that
lady go, Ugh, stop it. It was just,

505
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,640
it was hilarious to me. So I'll send a
link to that stuff. Um, and with that,

506
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:39,090
with, with, um, all of that babbling here,

507
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:43,590
let me get 'em me read some advertising
here. I just started the people laughing.

508
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,690
Next door is,
I imitated the revenue of the engine.

509
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:47,100
So I don't know if they're laughing at me,

510
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,610
they're probably not cause they would
have heard me curse by now. All right.

511
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:54,660

520
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,680
I didn't know that that existed anymore.

521
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:29,580
Third corporations bought all of them up
and just said that they were artisinal

522
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:33,900
suppliers. Um, whether it's

I was just going to ask what isn't all,
all salmon's wild?

527
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,370
Is it not wild if you have it in
your fish tank and your house?

528
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,710
But then it was like, no
wait, they got manmade salmon.
They make it like porridge.

It's available by going to dollar shave
club.com/bird. That's dollar shave club.

567
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:05,880
Calm slash. Bar. All right,
let's do two and two. We'll
get back to the shit, right?

568
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,900
Will we, I hope we will. All right.

569
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:15,330
Continuing on for 34 minutes. Very
nice. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.

570
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:20,610
So, um, I actually got to spend a
day in London, which was great. I um,

571
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,970
cause I was there for two nights and uh,

572
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,900
and I also finally got to
drive and see a lot of England,

573
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,020
absolutely gorgeous country.
And um,

574
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,490
so Hyde park is like their central park
and I just went in there, walked around.

575
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,450
I always look at Royal Albert Hall Cause
I'm telling you one of these days I'm

576
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:43,050
going to play there, right? I'm going
to do a show there. God willing,

577
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,430
if not, I'm going to see a show
there, but if I do play there,

578
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,960
I can guarantee fucking tee you.

579
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,240
I'm going to rent a drum
kit again during the day.

580
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,120
I already talked to the promoter,
I was like, can I rent a drum kit?

581
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,800
Can I go in there,

582
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:00,120
put on some headphones and just fucking
play to led Zeppelin because that was

583
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:01,530
one of bottoms.
I Dunno,

584
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,900
I think it's some of the greatest
live footage of him ever.

585
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,000
Is there a performance, a Royal Albert
Hall? And um, and he was like, Oh yeah,

586
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,590
absolutely.
No problem mate.

587
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,550
So that's definitely a
bucket list thing for me.

588
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:18,150
So I always go there and I just forget
about dreaming about playing that place,

589
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,070
just to look at it. If you
Google a picture of, um,
Royal Albert Hall, it's just,

590
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:26,780
um, it looks like it's something out
of the Roman Empire. I know it's only,

591
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,960
it was made in like the 1850s
or sixties or something. Uh,

592
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,880
but it's just an absolutely
incredible, incredible venue. And,

593
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:38,370
uh, I you that time, I'm a couple,

594
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,700
I don't know when it was like
2009 or 10 or something like that.

595
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,710
I took a tour of it with Nia.

596
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,590
Nia didn't want to go cause she
said it's gonna be boring as shit.

597
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:48,750
And we got there and
it was boring as shit.

598
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,730
But then when we went to go check out,

599
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:55,200
like they brought us out on the mezzanine
level and they got to sit down and one

600
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:57,900
of the suites,
and right as we was sitting down,

601
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:00,070
like the London Philharmonic was a,

602
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,260
was like practicing for
that night's performance.

603
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:08,730
And it was like they were waiting for us,
like right as we sat down,

604
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,310
they started playing and it was one of
the most beautiful things I ever heard in

605
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:16,820
my life. Nia immediately. So

606
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,170
she puts a hand over,
a mouth starts tearing up and all that.

607
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:23,880
And all I could think was like,
you know what,

608
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,890
now would have been a great
time to ask you to marry me.

609
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,770
That would have been the, but how the
fuck did I know that was going to happen?

610
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,590
So instead I waited till we went to
white castle, now can, um, anyways,

611
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,260
so then last night I got what I got
to walk around all a Hyde Park and um,

612
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:41,630
okay,

613
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,200
truly incredible that,
that does just the sheer size of that.

614
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:47,140
And they have a bunch of parks,
um,

615
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,170
more so way more so than a Manhattan
is as far as like the size of him and

616
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:54,130
everything. And uh, just a really,

617
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,550
and it actually seemed like there
was enough space for everybody. Um,

618
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,660
and then after that I went over to
Amsterdam. The next day flew out.

619
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,920
Uh, oh Jesus. I forgot the whole
other part of the story. Sorry.

620
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,670
My brain is all even more all over the
place because I've been flying all over

621
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:14,660
the place, so, and I just did a show in
the afternoon and I'm still jet lagged.

622
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,430
I don't even know what
the fuck I'm doing here.

623
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:20,990
So I apologize if this is more scatter
brained than usual. But, so after my,

624
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,410
my, um, my second show,

625
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,800
okay.

626
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,770
In London, um, I was just, uh,

627
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,040
I could not have done a better job on
that one. I was so fucking thrilled.

628
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,930
Thank Christ. And then, uh, I
deliberately booked myself in a hotel.

629
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,240
I usually stay wherever
the fuck I don't care,

630
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,480
but this hotel actually had a cigar
bar in it and I learned that from Cigar

631
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,300
Aficionado. They got this thing called
places to smoke. So if you're traveling,

632
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:53,510
just look it up and they will tell you the
place to go. And I went there with, um,

633
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,710
with the person who was the tour manager
and it was just me and him and we went

634
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:02,520
in there. It was funny when we first
came in, they had, they were like, oh,

635
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:05,100
we're sorry, we don't have
any, we don't have any seats.

636
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,700
Because we walked in looking like
a couple of fucking rubes you know,

637
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,880
and my baseball hat on and shit
and all sweaty from the show.

638
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,430
We just look at two fucking
assholes and you know,

639
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,240
in there were all these gorgeous Arab
women and all those fucking, you know,

640
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,640
you know,
that whole fucking scene was going.

641
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:23,490
I don't know if those checks were from
London trying to meet the guy in the

642
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:27,120
golden car, but at this point I was
so caught up in the fucking soap op.

643
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,710
It was like watching a reality show.

644
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,820
Like how that isn't a reality
show is fucking beyond me.

645
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,770
Somebody needs to make
that a fucking show.

646
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,160
It's literally like fast and
loud without building a thing.

647
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,960
Meets like the fucking real
housewives meet. But there guys,

648
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,260
you know,
I don't know big brother or something.

649
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,370
I want to see them talking about
what it's like to be that rich.

650
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,120
I want to see the whole fucking process
of how they got those fucking cars over

651
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:59,350
there. Did they give a fuck that people
hate on them for having those cars?

652
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,040
How do they deal with women coming in?
Because I,

653
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,520
you've got to fucking fleet a gold cars.
I don't give a shit who the fuck she is.

654
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,780
Well that's not true.
But uh,

655
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,000
there's a sizable amount of women that
will just blow you just so they can look

656
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:16,090
at themselves sucking a dick in
the fucking shine of that car.

657
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:20,710
Okay.

658
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,920
If anybody in London ever
fucking make set show,

659
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:28,840
please text me a link cause I'm going
to watch every fucking episode I want to

660
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,960
see. I want to see the whole
thing. The riding over in the jets,

661
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,800
you know the whole thing,
the confiscating of the passports.

662
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:39,760
So you have the slave labor that builds
Dubai. I want to see the fucking,

663
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,530
I want to see the whole thing,
the pain, the sorrow, the whores,

664
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,300
the whole fucking thing.
Tremendous. Um, anyways,

665
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:54,880
where was I? I don't know where
I was. Oh. So we ended up,

666
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,240
so I just said things like, yeah,
we don't, I knew what he was doing.

667
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:00,640
He saw me coming in with
my stupid potato face,

668
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:05,050
all fucking sweaty from the show and
my dump, tiger woods beat up golf hat.

669
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,010
Then he was just like, game Saturday, so
we do not have any fucking bum Ba, ba,

670
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:12,220
ba Ba. And I was just
like, dude. I said, dude,

671
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:14,020
which really made him stop for a second.
I was like,

672
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:19,021
I booked myself in this hotel
specifically so I could smoke here.

673
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,590
Um, and he goes, well, the, you could
sit at the bar, maybe you did that.

674
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:26,830
So I fucking go upstairs, drop my shit
off. By the time I got downstairs,

675
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,530
they had a table because
I think the fucking, uh,

676
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:35,230
the tour manager guy said something
so you know, we are able to sit down,

677
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:38,170
you know, it was fucking hilarious.
Two, this is what's hilarious.

678
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,520
They were plenty of seats.

679
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,130
Okay.

680
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:47,480
Fucking assholes. You know, they saw me
coming in and looking like old sick Lee,

681
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:50,630
Ron Howard. They were like, fuck this
guy. This guy's not bringing in the ass.

682
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:54,410
So money in here. Yeah. Beat
it. Go get yourself a snow code.

683
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,940
You fucking freckled
mess. Um, oh, we're sorry.

684
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,410
You're spending money here. Okay. Yeah.
By the, well there's 40 empty two tops.

685
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,680
Where did they come from? Well, when
you went upstairs for two minutes,

686
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:11,150
all of a sudden everybody left. Um, so,

687
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:16,580
oh, it was the greatest. And the, the,
uh, the tour manager didn't smoke cigars,

688
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:21,500
but said he wasn't adverse to doing
it and a greatest feeling ever.

689
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:21,810
Right.

690
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:26,640
He sat down and he was smoking and he
was just going and he's gradually get

691
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,520
getting more and more into it.
And I was happy to see he was liking it.

692
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:34,500
Then I was also nervous like, fuck,
I just give somebody a cigar habit.

693
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,040
But he was just like, he's, I forget
what he's saying. This is brilliant.

694
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,830
This is lovely. And they go,
yeah, this is what it is.

695
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,730
Everybody thinks it's like smoking his
cigarette. Cigarette smokers are animals,

696
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,940
they're junkies.
They run outside in the rain.

697
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:50,030
They're fucking standing next to the
dumpster. Is this sitting on stoops?

698
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:55,570
Animals sucking in into their lungs.
You know, I'm going need another one.

699
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,090
Need another one. Need another one? No,
no, just the Gar. It's for gentlemen.

700
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,770
You know, you sit down, you shoot the
shit, you break each other's balls,

701
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,340
you solve the world's problems. You
don't really, but you feel like you do.

702
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:08,330
It's fucking tremendous.

703
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,330
I guess it's Kinda like cocaine rights
and that would happen when you do cocaine.

704
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,630
You think everybody's a good shit and
then you figured out how to run the world.

705
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,640
Then you get all paranoid like a
dictator. And then, I don't know,

706
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,590
somebody overdoses and everybody
runs out of the room. Um, I dunno.

707
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:24,410
I always stayed out of that world.
All right, let's get to some, uh,

708
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,220
let's get to some questions
here. Um, for the week.

709
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,970
There's no fucking way that they're not
going to make a reality show out of that

710
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:36,710
they got to do. Unless those kids are so
fucking rich and by kids, no disrespect.

711
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:40,040
It's just I'm an old man. If you're
in your 20s, you're a kid to me. Um,

712
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,750
unless they're just so rich that
they don't want to bring any,

713
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,540
well that's stupid.
Don't want to bring attention to yourself.

714
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,940
You driving a fucking gold
mirrored car down the road.

715
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,633
Oh God.

716
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,380
It was tremendous. I cause
you know I drive a fucking
nine year old Prius. Right.

717
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,170
I was always envious of those
fucking people that would
do shit like that. Those,

718
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:08,430
hey look at me people, you
know, I would feel like the,

719
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,410
if I drove down the
street and one of those,

720
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:14,130
I would feel like the biggest fucking
tool ever. Like if I ever had a Ferrari,

721
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:18,060
the last thing I ever want to
do is drive it slowly by a cafe.

722
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:23,310
I would be so fucking self conscious of
people looking at me and then people I,

723
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,080
people would actually laugh at me,

724
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,250
they'd look at me and they would be in
a Ferrari still getting laughed at and I

725
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:31,740
just, I've had enough
pain in life. However,

726
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,520
okay.

727
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,090
If I ever had a Ferrari, if I was
out on the fucking open road, yeah,

728
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,260
I would have windows up.

729
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:42,190
I don't want anybody to see me cause
that really ruins the car if feel like,

730
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:44,800
oh my God, let's see this James
Bond looking guy in this car.

731
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,750
And then you fuck it,
see my red head and there

732
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,400
he must have a terminal
disease or something. How
the fuck did he get that car?

733
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,190
Um, all right, let me uh,

734
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:58,490
okay.

735
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,230
Let me read some of the questions
here for this week. Oh Jesus.

736
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:06,520
Did I even take that in? Copy
and paste them yet. What are you,

737
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:09,710
what's going on with you this week bill?
Your yummy crunchy or you're year,

738
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,230
you're all over the map. Yeah.
All right. Content. Content.

739
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,393
All right.

740
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,483
All right,

741
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,550
bill grading me as, keep forgetting to
have you announced the posters? Oh yeah,

742
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:26,810
the Madison Square Garden posters will
be on the website. Uh, this Wednesday,

743
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:32,130
um, when I played Madison Square Garden
I made all these fucking posters and I

744
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:35,160
didn't have a merge person and for some
reason I thought the venue was going to

745
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:36,450
handle it and nobody did.

746
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:41,250
So I had all these posters
made and shipped to Madison
Square Garden and I sold

747
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:45,240
like zero and then had to pay to
ship them all the way to fucking la.

748
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,740
It was a fucking, it was a fiasco.
So I have a couple hundred,

749
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:53,730
I don't even know how many of me, I
think I hadn't made like five, 500,

750
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:56,190
maybe four or 500 of them.
So I autographed all of them.

751
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,180
You know it's funny is I always keep one
poster for like the scrapbook and uh,

752
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:06,060
I wasn't paying attention
and I autographed all of
them. So now the only poster,

753
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:11,061
I have his signed by me so I'm not going
to get one cause I can't have a poster.

754
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:15,450
Sometimes a bill keep being you,
you know,

755
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,860
Bill, be stupid. So feel
like an asshole. Um,

756
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,490
you know, it's a continuing story
of me being an idiot. All right.

757
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,750
Minimize the crazy. All right.
Love the podcast. They'll,

758
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:32,250
I listened to it at the gym cause
it's really motivating. Not uh,

759
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,430
not really just good to hear someone
talking shit rather than listening to the

760
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:40,320
constant grunting and self
praise. You hear in gyms, uh,

761
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,510
I'm in Australia and I'm
in my early thirties,

762
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,070
and I need to break up with a crazy
chick. Oh Jesus. This is always difficult.

763
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,490
It's not difficult.
If I'll tell you right now,

764
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:54,270
the degree of difficulty is greatly
increased if you're living with,

765
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:58,350
they're obviously all right, if
you're not living with her, um,

766
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,850
I can tell you exactly how you do it.
All right?

767
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,540
And I would be, oh, I can't tell you.

768
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,170
I'd have to tell you to have
al Madrigal do it. Al Madrigal,

769
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,000
I should have him on the podcast.

770
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:17,001
He had the greatest fucking
way ever of breaking up with,

771
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:20,160
uh, with a girlfriend. And I
feel like it's his story to tell.

772
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:23,700
So now that I got y'all fucking
interest in ow fuck you.

773
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,510
I'll make up 40 and let me read
this real quick. Um, all right.

774
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,680
I need to break up with a crazy chick
and I'm hoping to minimize the property

775
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:35,460
damage or stocking that usually
comes along with the crazy, well,

776
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:39,570
why don't you do this? Why don't you
set up some security little cameras,

777
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,520
catch you're damaging your property.

778
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:46,521
And for once report a woman damaging a
guy's fucking property after a breakup

779
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,570
and maybe she liked,
you have to fucking pay for it.

780
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,890
All these videos of these chicks just
fucking just destruction of property does

781
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:56,100
not apply to a female. I don't
understand it. Anyways, he goes,

782
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:59,790
I would normally just do it in a public
place and then go into hiding for a few

783
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,830
weeks with all of my
possessions under lock and key.

784
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,290
But this is different this time.
It's different.

785
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,380
We've been together for a bit over
a year and when I first met her,

786
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:10,920
I thought she was perfect, but it all
changed about nine months into it.

787
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,600
Her sister in law was caught drink driving
with their 15 month old driver, uh,

788
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,880
daughter in the car.
And as a result,

789
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:22,410
the kid was taken off both parents until
one of them could prove to be a fit

790
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:26,430
parent. Oh my God. They took
it away from both of them. Wow.

791
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,080
All right.

792
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,080
Her brothers slash the kid's father
has always been a a fit parent,

793
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,430
but in Australia the authorities
have a preference for the mother.

794
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,120
So he had to go through the bullshit
to get his daughter back. Yeah.

795
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,210
Jason's every fucking lot
seems, uh, when this happened,

796
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:47,590
we put our hand up to take care of the
kid and the kid and the girl moved in

797
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:51,310
with me, um, for a bit over 12 weeks.

798
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,550
Having the kid around was fucking awesome.
And because of our work schedule,

799
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:57,010
I got to spend a lot of time with
the kid and loved every minute of it.

800
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,130
My girlfriend, however, it wasn't
very keen on it right from the start,

801
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,850
which made it pretty clear that we
want different things in the situation.

802
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:06,490
Also brought out the
crazy in a pretty big way.

803
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,970
She tended to be angry with me every
morning over shit that I couldn't do

804
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:13,420
anything about, such as her
job. And on top of that,

805
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,650
it became extremely jealous that
are ex had a new girlfriend.

806
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,150
Normally this would be the kind
of thing that would make me walk,

807
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,010
but we were looking after the kid.

808
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,730
Now the kid is back with their
father and it's time for the breaker.

809
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,690
I'm pretty sure she's the type of
crazy [inaudible] that would resort to

810
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:34,750
property damage for, for physical
violence. And I'm trying to reduce this.

811
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,670
The only issue I see aside from the crazy
is that she still has a few things in

812
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:43,420
my house and there are a few things
that belonged to the kid left here.

813
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,400
Portable cod clothes and
toys. Any strategies you
can think of would be great.

814
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,360
All right. You know what? You need the
Al Madrigal advice and he's not here.

815
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,170
This is our mantra goals.
This is his,

816
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,680
this is how he did it.
I'm giving him total credit here.

817
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,990
When al had to break up with a woman,
then he made the decision,

818
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:10,700
you know, when he, before he
went over to her apartment,

819
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,980
he would get a box and he would take
all of her belongings that were in his

820
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:17,870
apartment,
put him in the box.

821
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:19,260
Okay.

822
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,080
And then come over holding the box

823
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:27,960
and the woman opens the doors like what
the fuck? And then you immediately,

824
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,210
oh,
I think he already changed the locks too.

825
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:35,270
That's another thing to change
the fucking locks and uh,

826
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,100
which you can easily do.
Just what the different deadbolt,

827
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:42,260
that's just a couple of screws. Just do
that. And usually, you know, if that,

828
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:47,430
that's no big deal. Um, I
guess down belows a couple of
two, well it's no big deal.

829
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:49,710
Just change the fucking logs,
put everything in a box.

830
00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:53,670
Then you go over to her place, you sit
down and you just say it's fucking over.

831
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,560
Blah Blah Blah.
They flip out,

832
00:49:55,561 --> 00:49:59,940
they want to break something that are
in their house. That's it. Fucking over.

833
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:00,803
If I'm

834
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:02,110
okay,

835
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:05,290
if you have anything in
her apartment of value,

836
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:10,270
I would get that first and then I
would do the rest of it. But um,

837
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,380
there, there really should
be, you know, you know,

838
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,930
with all these things now that the
complaining that men do like anything from

839
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:21,570
fucking like mansplaining man
spreading and all that, the,

840
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:25,600
all these fucking feminist groups up and
down the fucking street about the shit

841
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,010
that we're doing.
Do any of them,

842
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:32,300
the ridiculous level of destruction of
property that women do to guys when,

843
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:36,840
when they break up with them or even if
they get caught fucking around. Okay,

844
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:40,520
you fucked around on you. That does not
give you the right to key the guy's car.

845
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,460
I mean, you can do it, but you should go
to jail. He should have to pay for it.

846
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,420
She'd go on your fucking record. And
the guys always just like, you know,

847
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:49,640
I just want to just make it go away.
Just make it,

848
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:54,270
they make like youtube
videos of themselves fucking
destroying property. Um,

849
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,640
so that might be something else you want
to look into do to this chick's crazy.

850
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:02,990
I would just go total CIA on him.
Go over there without her knowing.

851
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,020
Just take back leave.
Just first of all,

852
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,170
you're gonna have to leave some troops
behind. A couple of pairs of sneakers.

853
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:12,530
Got to go Willem to fall. Put tune here.
All right. But if you've got, you know,

854
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:14,020
if you've got some, I
don't know, I don't know.

855
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:17,510
Fucking iPad or some shit like that.
You need to grab that shit.

856
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,220
Get that shit the fuck out of there.

857
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:23,330
You have some sorta nerd friend or a
friend who knows a nerd. They wire like,

858
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:26,590
you know, you got fucking cameras and
all that shit. You got that going.

859
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:30,860
Change your fucking locks box up the shit.
Go over there.

860
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:34,560
Drop the fucking hammer.
MMM,

861
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:35,540
okay.

862
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,910
If you're worried that this woman's
going to get physical with you,

863
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:38,744
I would do that.

864
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,050
I would break up with her in a public
place because I don't know how it works in

865
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:45,800
Australia, but um, here in America,

866
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:49,940
a woman can take out a machete,
chop a guy's head off and then, uh,

867
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,290
sue the surviving family members for the
blister on her hand that she got when

868
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:58,520
she swung the fucking things
through his head. So, um,

869
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:03,410
good luck to you. Be careful and I hope
it all works out for you. All right.

870
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:08,990
Oh, for God's sake, I fucking 80 fucking
computers. You know what kills me?

871
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:11,930
I can't get him to do anything and then
you barely brush up against them and

872
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:13,160
everything fucking goes away.

873
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:18,370
What the fuck drives me
nuts. All right. All time.

874
00:52:18,371 --> 00:52:23,290
Lows all time low. Sorry.
All right. Hey there,

875
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:27,550
Billy, with the Little Red Willie.
The fuck. Do you know about my Dick?

876
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,470
Dare you insulted like that.
Fucking, I challenge you.

877
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,550
I challenge you to a Instagram photo
up now. Okay. All right, dear bill. Uh,

878
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:38,950
I'm a 26 year old guy
living in Pennsylvania.

879
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,440
Until recently I was dating
my girlfriend of four years.

880
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:46,640
We bought a house together
six months ago. I, I,

881
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,300
what year?
26 year in Pennsylvania.

882
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,010
You're dating a girl for four years
and you bought a house together.

883
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,870
We had two Greg cats and couldn't be
happier with the fucking marry this girl

884
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:03,160
dude, or stop buying shit with her.
Sorry. Uh, about two weeks ago,

885
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,870
she went on a 10 day group hike,

886
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:09,580
hiking trip to Nevada with her
aunt and a bunch of random people.

887
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,100
When she came back,

888
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,930
I had a $300 purse waiting for her
as a welcome home gift. However,

889
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:20,590
after she thanked me for the gift, she
sat me down and said we needed to talk.

890
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:22,840
Oh yeah. She went on a hike, dude.

891
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:27,960
Which means she did some soul searching
and Dick Sucking no kid. So then we, uh,

892
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:32,760
she then told me she was breaking up with
me because she doesn't want to live in

893
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:35,340
the suburbs anymore or
work a desk job anymore.

894
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:39,150
She said she wanted to move out west and
become an outdoor adventure guide and

895
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:43,890
that it was a dream to work
in our country's national
parks and live and outdoor,

896
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:48,660
adventurous adventure type life. I asked
if there was another guy and she said,

897
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:52,200
no. She said she just needs to
find herself and follow her dream.

898
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,570
Um,
all right,

899
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:57,600
well up until now you can't get mad at
her if she's just telling you what she

900
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:00,630
wants and life as a regular
listener of your podcast,

901
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:03,290
I always hear you tell people
to follow their dreams.

902
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:07,590
So even though I was heartburn broken,
I supported her decision.

903
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:09,030
Okay,

904
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,830
we'll do it. I got to tell you,
that's really mature of you.

905
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,730
Most people would go and you know, most
guys would go into the fall, set up,

906
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:19,010
you fucking bitch. Uh,
the next day I saw her,

907
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,700
she got a text from a guy named
Zach. Uh Oh, we don't have any,

908
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:28,680
Zach's in our friends circle. Uh
Oh. While she was in the shower,

909
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:32,070
I snooped through her phone and
read her text message with Zack.

910
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,480
There were messages about how much they
missed each other and now she, she,

911
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,000
she couldn't wait to move out to Arizona.

912
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,860
They both sent each other naked pictures
and they talked about how much they

913
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:47,520
liked fucking each other
on their trip. It, boy,

914
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,400
she still doesn't know.
I've been through a phone.

915
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:53,370
So as of now I am at an all time low.

916
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,890
I have to sell my house
and lose a ton of money.

917
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,140
I lost my girlfriend to another guy.

918
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:02,400
She is also taking the cats and since
I can't afford an apartment by myself,

919
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:05,580
I'll be a 26 year old guy
living with my parents.

920
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,630
Well don't you get to half of the house?

921
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:09,920
Okay.

922
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,300
He goes in and to top it all off,

923
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:14,780
she's walking around with
that $300 fucking purse.

924
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:18,620
My question is how do I confront
her about the text message?

925
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,590
Do you have any advice
for me moving forward?

926
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,200
And was there ever a point
in your life that there,

927
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,980
that was an all time low and
how'd you get through with it? Um,

928
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,780
first of all, dude, uh, sorry,
you're going through all of that.

929
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,020
Here's the bright side. All right? Look,

930
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,450
if your girlfriend went on a fucking hike,
that's what she always wanted to do.

931
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,150
And when she went out there,
you know,

932
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,380
okay,

933
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,540
she gets all caught up
with this other guy.

934
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:48,710
Yeah.

935
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:52,760
She comes back and just immediately
breaks up with you. You know,

936
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:56,630
maybe she's letting you down a little bit
easier that she didn't meet this other

937
00:55:56,631 --> 00:56:00,950
fucking guy. Why, why
add insult to injury.

938
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:02,953
Um,

939
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,283
okay.

940
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,660
But the fact that she accepted the purse,

941
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,210
okay.

942
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,070
She should've said,
I can't accept this.

943
00:56:12,071 --> 00:56:14,620
She didn't have to tell you about
the fucking guy. I mean, what,

944
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:18,370
what second and do other than make
you feel fucking horrible. Um,

945
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,560
he's the bright side of
this, all of this. Okay.

946
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,100
The bright side is you're a fucking great

947
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,110
guy.
You're a solid guy.

948
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:30,010
You didn't get mad her or any of that
type of stuff you support in fucking dream

949
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,420
whip and uh, she kept the
purse, which means she's a cunt.

950
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,440
And I don't think this guy, Zach knows
what's going to hit him, you know?

951
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:41,290
But you know what? Zach might be
a dick. She's going out there.

952
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,970
She h you know what I mean?

953
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:47,310
W what, what are you going to
do? She wants to go out and go,

954
00:56:47,311 --> 00:56:50,370
fuck some guy wears sandals on a
rubber raft. I mean that, that's,

955
00:56:50,371 --> 00:56:54,630
that's her idea of a man than
you just gotta let her go. Um,

956
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,820
but the thing is you can't internalize
it like it had anything to do with you.

957
00:56:59,821 --> 00:57:03,660
It had nothing to do with you. All
right? You just picked the wrong one.

958
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,570
But you know what, dude, I was
going to say, at least you didn't,

959
00:57:06,571 --> 00:57:09,390
that you didn't have any kids.
You learn something.

960
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,740
Don't buy a fucking house with
somebody you're not married to. Okay?

961
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:14,881
You want,
you know,

962
00:57:14,881 --> 00:57:18,150
100 fucking percent that this is the
person you want to spend your life with.

963
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:22,710
And they say that to you. You
know, hopefully then that line,

964
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,430
which is the difficulty of
fucking relationships, um,

965
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,100
then you go out and you buy a fucking
house with somebody. But Dude,

966
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:33,270
you're only 26 years old. You got
your whole life ahead of you. And, um,

967
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,760
I would bring up the fact that she was
with that guy, Zack, I think, I mean,

968
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:40,190
I dunno.
This is what you should do.

969
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:41,830
Yeah.

970
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:42,730
This is what you should do.

971
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,953
Okay.

972
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:50,270
Here's what you do. Just be
a total fucking gentlemen
and asked her if she likes.

973
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,440
Oh God.
Here we go.

974
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,770
Just sit her down and just ask her if
she likes to person all that. And right,

975
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:59,750
right before, this is the last time you're
going to see, uh, last time, you know,

976
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:05,220
you're going to ever see her just
right before she [inaudible] hey honey,

977
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,530
you know, good luck with your
dream and blah, blah, blah, blah.

978
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:11,240
You do your little bullshit hug.
And she walks away and go, oh honey,

979
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,370
one more thing. Hey, tell
Zach I said what's up?

980
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,990
And just shut the fucking door.
And then as she's walking away,

981
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:24,660
you just scream out. She a fucking oh,

982
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:29,250
um, no. Your each be finding, listen,

983
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:32,390
you just said you'd throw
Zach in the middle of it.

984
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:35,360
You could really have a lot of fun with
this and I'll tell you something right

985
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:38,960
now. No one knows more how much fun
you can have with it that a woman,

986
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:41,900
a woman knows how to fucking
like, I'm, I'm going to ruin this.

987
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,350
Women are really good at this. Guys
are just like, go, let's go fight.

988
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,200
Women know how to be like, Ooh,
I got this piece of information.

989
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:52,700
What is the perfect fucking way this
will do the most amount of damage?

990
00:58:52,701 --> 00:58:55,970
What if you put it in the middle
of it? If you say, listen,

991
00:58:55,971 --> 00:58:57,950
I just want you to know I'm
really happy for you and Zach.

992
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,340
You know you're going to be out.
That's too early. Really happy for you.

993
00:59:01,341 --> 00:59:04,940
You going to be out there living your
dream and as much as I'm going to miss you

994
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:05,421
and everything,

995
00:59:05,421 --> 00:59:10,100
I'm just so happy that you're have
the courage to follow your dream,

996
00:59:10,101 --> 00:59:10,934
you know?

997
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:11,950
Yeah.

998
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,950
Oh, how do you do somewhere
in there, somewhere in there?
You just gotta you know,

999
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:18,100
you can be out there rafting, you know,
you can keep fucking Zach and, but no,

1000
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,770
it's only to say for don't say
fuck. See, I'm gonna mess it up.

1001
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,880
But you understand where I'm going
with that. She got to just put,

1002
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:27,770
just put drop sack in the middle of it
and then do about two more sentences and

1003
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:31,490
then just stop and just
stare at it and just,

1004
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,080
just leave her in this stunned
silence of that moment.

1005
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,193
MMM.

1006
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:44,060
And then whisper in your ear so I didn't
have gifts with you and then you walk

1007
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:48,650
away. Sorry. All right. That was creepy.
Anyways. All right. Amusement parks.

1008
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,600
Hey Billy Bonzo a bozo. Sorry, Billy Bozo.

1009
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,940
I thought it was a compliment to me.
He was actually insulting.

1010
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,660
Just wanted to hear your take on amusement
park. Well, you're taking an amusement.

1011
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:00,494
Parks are,

1012
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,950
I went the other day with my girl and
just could not help but notice all of the

1013
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:08,420
fucking animals around me from people
walking barefoot to the fat asses,

1014
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:12,560
walking with their giant fucking
Turkey legs around the park.

1015
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:14,380
I hope you guys can't
hear my stomach growling.

1016
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:17,120
I haven't eaten all day to day cause I've
been eat. They've been eating so bad.

1017
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:22,040
Trying not to fucking
eat a giant breakfast here anyways.

1018
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,010
I was just disgusted or lunch,
I should say.

1019
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:29,810
I was just disgusted you a fan of
going to an amusement park, whatever.

1020
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:34,430
Go Fuck Yourself. No, I'm not.
They are. They are fucking,

1021
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:35,580
yeah.

1022
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,480
Animal magnets. Look, I don't
mind kids that go there,

1023
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:43,710
but the fucking adults that go there,
some of the worst tattoos,

1024
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,570
some of the worst bodies.

1025
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:50,340
Some of the mouth breathe in fucking
morons. Like you go to amusement park.

1026
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:53,490
That's right. Everybody who
can afford to go to Disneyland.

1027
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,120
You're talking animals.
You're talking rides that don't work.

1028
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,330
People get killed at those fucking
things. I swear to God, Dude.

1029
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,270
It's like it's,
it's

1030
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:04,510
okay.

1031
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:06,370
It's a bump up from a carnival.

1032
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,400
Okay.

1033
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,440
But even carnivals aren't as bad because
I feel like a carnival, you have the,

1034
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:13,970
the community,
it came to your town,

1035
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,550
so there's a bunch of high
school kids seeing each other.

1036
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,730
It's still kind of a fun thing,
but you just go to an amusement park.

1037
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,330
It's just there any of
those fucking water parks,

1038
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:28,640
any of that type of shit that is
just a white trash fucking magnet.

1039
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,760
All right, that's my elitist
comment for the fucking day. Uh,

1040
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:33,050
we got a couple more of these to read.

1041
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:37,250
Let me a couple more questions and
let me just knock out these last two

1042
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:40,960
advertisements here.
Advertisements, alright.

1043
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:45,800
MVMT watches, uh, when you're, when you're
in your early twenties and thirties,

1044
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,140
money can be tight if you're not careful.

1045
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:50,000
Dressing well can drain your bank account.

1046
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:53,390
Like spending four to 500 bucks in
a dispatch department store. Watch.

1047
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,230
There's some brands out there charging
and same prices for watches than aren't

1048
01:01:57,231 --> 01:02:00,200
even worth it. Well, if you want
to look great when you go out,

1049
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:03,020
but still have enough money to buy
him or her a drink, checkout movement,

1050
01:02:03,021 --> 01:02:05,360

1056
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,790
You could buy one of these and
still go to amusement park. Uh,

1057
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,930
they're sleek and minimalist minimalistic.

1058
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,830

movement has grown organically purely by

1064
01:02:50,281 --> 01:02:52,260
It probably becomes second nature to you.

1065
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:55,560
They seem easy because you've been doing
your mailing and shipping that way for

1066
01:02:55,561 --> 01:03:00,360
so long. But think about all the
hassles man. Drop in what you're doing,

1067
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:03,330
driving. They're finding
parking, hitting an old lady,

1068
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,980
looking around to see if anybody
saw you hiding the body waiting.

1069
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:09,870
There's so much better ways to go.

1082
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:58,370
burr. Alright, let's knock
out these last few questions.

1083
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:02,230
Come on,
help me out here.

1084
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,643
Okay.

1085
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,260
I fucking hate computers. They just
don't fucking work for me. All right,

1086
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,770
there we go. All right. Baby's
mom is a whore. Jesus Christ,

1087
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:19,440
Jesus Christ. Or as they say a
fucking hire. Um, get the chairs.

1088
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,300
Get the hearts and the
chairs. All right, I'll,

1089
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:23,400
I'll try and keep this
short and to the point,

1090
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,760
I was dating a redheaded succubus
lady for almost eight years.

1091
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,350
Uh,
what is succubus meet again?

1092
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:34,320
This is the one who basically
takes over your life,

1093
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,360
kills you afterwards.

1094
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:40,620
I remember the South Park was the first
time ever heard that chef was warning

1095
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:41,790
them about a succubus

1096
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,210
succubus a female demon believed to have
sexual intercourse was sleeping men.

1097
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,423
What?

1098
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:52,483
Hmm.

1099
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,120
And appears in dreams takes the
form of a woman in order to seduce,

1100
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:58,870
been through sexual activity.

1101
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,570
But then what does she
make you do afterwards?

1102
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,893
Hang on a second.

1103
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:13,430
Peers to take the form of the
male counterpart is the incubus.

1104
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,190
Oh, is that how they got the name
for the band? Religious traditions

1105
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:22,950
hold that repeated sexual activity
with the succubus may result in the

1106
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:25,240
deterioration of health or even death.

1107
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,830
I really don't see the downside to
any of that. All right? Let's, uh,

1108
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,650
is supposed to be scary. It's
fucking great sleeping. She comes in,

1109
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:40,060
she takes care of you. We need more
sucky business in the world. All right.

1110
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,150
Her and I conceive Tucson's together.

1111
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:49,090
Why do people date and have kids and
buy houses together and in that time we

1112
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:53,950
were talking about getting married.
I loved her very much with all my hat.

1113
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:56,740
We rented a house and live together
for most of our relationship.

1114
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,240
I've always treated her with respect and
tried my best to be the best provider

1115
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:05,710
for her and my two sons and her third
son whom she has with another guy.

1116
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:09,220
Needless to say, she went out with the
girlfriends, which she had done many,

1117
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:13,210
many of times before, but not did
not come home until the next day.

1118
01:06:13,211 --> 01:06:17,830
When I asked her why she stayed out all
night or it didn't call to let me know

1119
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:22,300
what, what's up, she responded by telling
me she had sex with some random guy.

1120
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:26,710
She met because she was drunk. I was
like, what the fuck? How could you,

1121
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:30,370
why would you do that?
Her and I started to argue.

1122
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,620
Then the course of the argument,

1123
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,510
not only did I find out that she had
cheated on me, but in the entire time,

1124
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,860
but in the entire time
her and I were together,

1125
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,810
she just admitted to cheating on me
with 12 other people in our eight years

1126
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:47,644
together.

1127
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:53,220
What the fuck doesn't
quite put my feelings into
perspective and the only reason

1128
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:58,600
she gave was the only reason she gave us.
She wasn't happy with me.

1129
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:02,740
I don't understand that. And to this day
she still will not elaborate on that.

1130
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:06,070
So I've since then moved out,
back home and my mom's,

1131
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:10,210
I feel crushed like my entire life
was with her was a lie. It was,

1132
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,080
she betrayed me in the worst possible way
and completely destroyed my outlook on

1133
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:17,770
love. But not only that
I foe, but not only that,

1134
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:21,970
I feel like I'm failing my family,
my kids,

1135
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:26,200
and even that reddit and whore because
I couldn't keep my family together.

1136
01:07:26,201 --> 01:07:28,930
I've offered to go to
counseling now, dude, fuck that.

1137
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:32,050
To try and work through this,
but she's not interested.

1138
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:36,160
She acts like our eight years meant
nothing. It didn't mean nothing to her.

1139
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,570
That doesn't mean you're a bad person.

1140
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:41,320
She's been bouncing from guy to guy since
we split up those situations kind of

1141
01:07:41,321 --> 01:07:43,600
fucked up. Yeah. And you got
kids there and she doesn't care.

1142
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:48,310
It's been several months now
and I still feel like shit. Uh,

1143
01:07:48,311 --> 01:07:51,550
I've been slang, bar sluts, right
and left, starting to work out,

1144
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:54,190
trying to focus on bettering
myself and my sons lives.

1145
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,580
Trying to keep my mind positive,
positively occupied.

1146
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:01,930
But I still feel this pain in my chest.
Like something's missing her, I guess.

1147
01:08:01,931 --> 01:08:06,430
I don't know. Still Phil's
still feel lost his shit, dude.

1148
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:10,510
All of that's totally normal. Um,
you supposed to feel that way.

1149
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:14,770
Um, she probably doesn't feel anything
or maybe she does and that's why she's up

1150
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:19,010
going around there. You know, fucking
everybody. Maybe she had an asshole dad.

1151
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:23,090
I have no idea. Maybe she's a
succubus. I have no idea. Um,

1152
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:27,020
the only way to get past this dude is
it continue doing what you're doing.

1153
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:30,020
Go to the gym and I say, you got to
fuck every, warn them that moves.

1154
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:33,920
But the only thing that
cures this is time, time.

1155
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:37,490
And don't try to block it out,
dwell on it and cry it out of you.

1156
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:40,940
All of that shit you're not supposed
to do as a guy. That's what women do.

1157
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:42,440
They sit down,
they talk about it,

1158
01:08:42,441 --> 01:08:47,120
they cry it out and they get past it and
we fucking hang onto it forever and it

1159
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:51,320
kills us.
So cry that bit shoddy you um,

1160
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,080
you know,
is a big thing.

1161
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:59,140
Never trash her to your kids because
as much as she fucked you over,

1162
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,850
that's their mom,
you know,

1163
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:06,920
and it's going to fuck them up and it's
going to make them pick the wrong kind

1164
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:10,910
of woman or it's going to make them
treat women disrespectfully. So,

1165
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,400
mmm.

1166
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,160
I think what you gotta do is just,
you just did, it's all about you.

1167
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:17,300
Now obviously you have kids,

1168
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:21,590
but I would just try to become the best
guy you could and go meet a woman that's

1169
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:26,000
worthy of being with you and then have
a great fucking life together and a,

1170
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:29,870
you'll never need to trash your
wife in front of your kids.

1171
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:34,280
They'll figure it out. They'll
figure it out. That's it.

1172
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:39,020
And, uh, she trashes you and says
all this shit about you, just,

1173
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:43,670
just be a great dad to a minute. It'll,
it'll, that aspect of it will work out.

1174
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:47,900
But as far as like feeling lost, feeling
like a piece of shit, then, you know,

1175
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:53,390
that just is how it goes. I mean, I had
that happen. I mean, I haven't had kids,

1176
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:56,660
but I, you know, I had, I
women cheat on me. You know,

1177
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,910
I've been an asshole. I've cheated
on women. I kind of gave an,

1178
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:05,320
took equally in my dating history,
but uh,

1179
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:11,080
you know, especially when
like I was younger and I
dated the fucking older woman.

1180
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:14,810
She fucking ran around and I was an
idiot and then I was going on that good.

1181
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:17,780
They're all fucking like that or
whatever. So whatever. You'll work it out.

1182
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,350
All right. Time, travel, followup.
All right, this is the last one.

1183
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:25,630
The podcast is done.
All right, Mr. Byrd, uh,

1184
01:10:25,631 --> 01:10:30,580
just now caught up with your podcast about
the time travel topic and thought you

1185
01:10:30,581 --> 01:10:32,890
might be interested in a few resources.

1186
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:37,660
Last night there was a Chris Hardwick
show episode about the time travel story

1187
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,050
that may have influenced your
writer or not. In any event,

1188
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:42,910
the coincidence is interesting to me.

1189
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:48,330
The Hardwick bid was based on the actual
candidacy for president of a man named

1190
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:52,870
Andrew [inaudible] like Chicago.
Alright.

1191
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,210
Mr [inaudible] claims to be the whistle
blower slash witness you would like to

1192
01:10:58,211 --> 01:11:02,680
hear come from any real
development program is
essentially claim is that he was

1193
01:11:02,681 --> 01:11:06,450
inducted into a deep black
military program. Uh,

1194
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:10,210
there are many of these around the age
of six and discharge eventually at the

1195
01:11:10,211 --> 01:11:11,170
age of 23.

1196
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:15,450
Then program develop physical and
modes of teleportation and time travel.

1197
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,410
It's as easy to create an address for
a different time as a different place.

1198
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:20,243
It turns out,

1199
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:24,600
which was in service starting about 1967.

1200
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,630
Yes. He says, I don't understand
what any of this shit,

1201
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:32,670
I believe Mr Peshtigo testimony to be
truthful, so take that as you must.

1202
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:34,170
But if you are interested in the story,

1203
01:11:34,171 --> 01:11:38,400
you should at least give some of his long
form interviews. Listen, I think, uh,

1204
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:43,430
I think you can find them easily
by searching his name on Youtube.

1205
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:44,573
Uh,

1206
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:49,440
the quality of the interview views vary
a lot depending on the interviewers.

1207
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:53,070
So if you get one when the interview
was annoyingly dumb, continue.

1208
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,340
One of my favorites is this.
Here's the link. Just listen to,

1209
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:01,260
just listen to the first four minutes
and see if you want to stop by. Right.

1210
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:05,760
You know what I meant? I man, I love
this Scifi conspiracy theory shit.

1211
01:12:05,761 --> 01:12:08,420
I'll read it anytime you want.
All right. That's it. Uh,

1212
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,950
if you could hear the kid
screaming next door, my apology,

1213
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,860
if I had the recorded too
close to my gurgle and stomach,

1214
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:17,460
I got to get some dinner before
I do my second show here. Um,

1215
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:22,960
I apologize for that and big thank you
to everyone who came out to my show last

1216
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:28,530
night and he had that kid
in Holland, uh, Amsterdam.

1217
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:31,440
Unfortunately, I literally landed,
did the show and then had to leave.

1218
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:36,270
I barely went by the van Gogh Museum.
Just saw it,

1219
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:39,710
didn't get to go in. And
uh, I dunno. Would've been,

1220
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:41,720
would've been great to hang
in such a great city of,

1221
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:45,100
didn't in a chance to thanks
to everybody who came out, uh,

1222
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:48,630
when I went through England. It's just
been a great tour. And, uh, so far,

1223
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:52,140
one out of four shows has done here
in Scotland, and the first one was,

1224
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:56,190
was as fun as shows you can have at four
o'clock in the afternoon as possible.

1225
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:59,820
So that said, I'll check in
on you on Thursday. Go fuck
yourselves. I'll see you.
