1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,540
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:06,660
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,390
January 11th, 2016 what's
going on? How I yeah,

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,280
I was at going, I'm in a great
fucking mood. I don't know why.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,350
You know what? I haven't boozed in like
fucking, I don't know what it's been.

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,360
I don't t nine 10 days
or something like that.

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,100
I did have a sip of wine last night,

8
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:31,010
but I don't really consider that booze
and you know, the way I go after it, um,

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,930
my wife, so you know, something, we, it's
funny when I, when I stopped drinking,

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,740
my wife always tries to
get me back to drinking,

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,390
not to get drunk or anything. She just
is like, you're so fucking, you know,

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,420
I drive her so fucking nuts
that I just think sometimes,

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,250
you know,
if she wasn't such a good person,

14
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:57,900
I think she would try and like drug me
every night like around supper. Right.

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,080
Make a little dinner, be like, how
is that honey? Hello? Look at you.

16
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:04,200
You look sleepy. And like, I have no idea.
Like, she just put some shit in my food,

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,160
not to like kill me, just
to sort of sedate me. Um,

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,200
but uh, anyways, but I haven't drank
in like 10 days or something. Wow.

19
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,510
That really made my head go somewhere
like, wow, that's kind of fucked up.

20
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:20,470
She does that. Um, but yeah, I
haven't drank in like 10 days.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,350
I, uh, I'm feeling good and that,
so what happens is nice slowly,

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,760
you know, I start to eat better. I'm
starting my day off with the old, uh,

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,890
from the old country thing,
you know,

24
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,370
you little fucking water
at room temperature,

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,300
which should make you keg if you're any
kind of a fucking human being, but a,

26
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,230
you get used to it with some lemon and
then a little cayenne pepper in it.

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,960
And then I take a,
I let that settle in me.

28
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:49,110
Then I get a couple of
scoops of a Greek yogurt,

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,830
the all natural stuff that actually
kind of tastes like sour cream.

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,410
And the first time I ate it,
I was like,

31
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:59,610
this is the worst shit I've ever
tasted because I was used to the, uh,

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,420
the crack baby yogurt that I've been
eating my whole life that has like fucking

33
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,570
40 bags of sugar in it, you know,
and you yogurt, you'll like, yeah,

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,421
I mean,

35
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,140
the amount of sugar that's in fucking
regular yoga Humani you should fucking

36
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,790
snort it. I mean, it's literally
like, I mean, I'm not glad he,

37
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,630
I still fucking love it, but, uh,

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,280
the Greek shit took me a minute and
now I'm actually, uh, I like it, man.

39
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,410
If I drink this shit and just
have a couple of scoops of that,

40
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,580
it kind of fills me up.

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,470
And that's kind of the big thing is you
become an old fuck like me. It's just,

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,520
just somehow getting the hunger to go
away without doing damage to yourself,

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,570
you know,

44
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,690
and then walking around and burn a few
calories before you go to the next one.

45
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,760
You know, and I know this
is a bunch, you know,

46
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,030
hopefully some younger listeners listening
to this judging Mikko this is this

47
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,250
old fart talking about
fucking lemon water,

48
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,250
Cayenne pepper and fucking Greek
yogurt. Well, you know something.

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,940
If you're lucky enough,
you'll live long enough.

50
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,920
If we don't fuck up something or something
bad doesn't happen to, you know, to,

51
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,430
to by age and you know,

52
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,480
it's good to start healthy
habits now. Fuck. Shut up bill.

53
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:08,180
What do you the fucking first lady,
you know what I'm doing right now?

54
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:11,150
I'm doing shit that like a first
lady does right now. I'm actually,

55
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:12,650
let's get in shape.
Kids.

56
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,430
How about you go outside for 10 minutes
a day and you just do some jumping jacks?

57
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,190
Can you fucking believe that they've got
to tell kids to go out and play piano?

58
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,230
That's how fucking insane
video games have got.

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,191
I mean,

60
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:35,191
if I made video games and I actually
saw Michelle Obama on TV begging kids to

61
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,690
try to not have their first
cardiac incident by the
time they were in the third

62
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:44,680
grade, I mean I, I would tear
up and just be like, I did it.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,300
You know,
I am so fucking great at my job.

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,270
I've made children stop playing outside,

65
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,560
you know.

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,730
Do you think there's like at the Alec
Baldwin of the video game industry,

67
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:05,420
you know, from Glengarry Glen Ross
Ross coming in just screaming at him.

68
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,520
Okay.

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,310
Yeah. But kids, I cause
to have a heart attack,

70
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,240
seven fuck Yo. Right.
She's screaming at him

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,753
trying to get them to,

72
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,420
we haven't done our fucking jobs till
every kid has a fucking pacemaker by the

73
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:28,400
seventh grade. Um, I dunno.

74
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,900
Anyways. Yeah. So I'm trying to get back
in shape. So, uh, I've been stoned sober.

75
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:36,970
So yesterday I got my, uh, my, my
first massage in like, I dunno,

76
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,300
like two years.
Whenever I get a massage afterwards,

77
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:43,520
I always think like, I got
to start doing this, man,

78
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,460
this is great for an old fart like
me, you know? And then he'd come home,

79
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:47,600
you crush the waters,

80
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,710
you get all the toxins out here or
whatever yoga shit they tell you to do.

81
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,080
And um, but the, I know this always
happened in my own fucking do this.

82
00:04:57,081 --> 00:05:01,040
You know what? Once, once a
month [inaudible] you know,

83
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,710
fucking, you haven't worked out my
fucking back, like my whole right.

84
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:05,210
I don't know what,

85
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,030
like I have a little curvature
of the spine and the lady's like,

86
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:12,230
where are the problem areas? Right? And
of course your brain always goes my dick.

87
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,640
But you know,
it's illegal place.

88
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,570
They seem to be having a problem in the,
uh,

89
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,600
central pelvic area on the
frontal lobe. Um, I'm like,

90
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,720
I never even noticed it either.
I was like my right shoulder,

91
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,230
my right forearm and my right
foot. And I was just like, wow,

92
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:37,140
how fucked up is my right side?
And then I realized all of them,

93
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,190
all of those injuries I got
from playing drums, you know,

94
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,890
my right forearm from fucking
holding the stick wrong.

95
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,020
I Dunno what I'm doing with my shoulders
probably after I fuck up another field

96
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,540
looking at the bass player.
And shrugging like, I'm sorry.

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,420
I mean I tried to get back on
one, right. And then my foot,

98
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,200
I fucked that up years ago trying to
get my bass drum fast as John Bottoms,

99
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,190
you know, which I never even remotely
achieved. I just had the lifetime pain.

100
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,710
You know,
every time I take a step,

101
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:09,210
I'm always reminded of what a wonderful
drummer John Bonham is. Um, so anyways,

102
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,350
uh, I did that. Um, with the lovely Nia,

103
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,320
that's always a good thing to do it, you
know, you go in there with your wife,

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,530
then you don't feel like a dirt bag.
Cause anytime I go to get a massage,

105
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,970
I always feel like a dirt bag.

106
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,600
There's just no way not to feel like
a fucking complete piece of shit.

107
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,400
When you walk in, they're
like, yeah, Hey, I want you to,

108
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,250
I want you to work out the kinks there,
sweetheart. You know what I mean? Oh,

109
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,540
wait a minute. What am I talking about?
I got a massage and fucking, Nah,

110
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,170
Milwaukee, no, I didn't.

111
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,690
No, I did not. That was the steam.
That was a steam. That's right. Oh,

112
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:51,500
that's right. That's right.
Yeah. I guess I haven't,

113
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,770
I'd like two fucking years and they
always do the same thing, wouldn't they?

114
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,580
When they put my hands on my
back, they just go, wow. Wow.

115
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,800
Do you have a lot of stress? Has
it been a while? It's like I, yeah,

116
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,600
if your back feels like gravel.

117
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,330
So anyways,
we did that and then we came home and um,

118
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,280
we made a Mario Batali
is a Lasagna A's and uh,

119
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,130
it was fucking delicious. Homemade Pasta,
homemade pasta things and all that.

120
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,350
I got to get my homemade pasta game up.

121
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,550
I tried to make the spinach pasta
and the pasta was definitely green,

122
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:33,780
but he could still see the
chunks of a spinach in there,

123
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,650
you know what I mean? So what does that
mean? Did I not need the dough enough?

124
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,020
Was because it was frozen spinach,
like it's said to be like the, uh,

125
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:46,260
the recipe said to me, am I saying
that right? Like the recipe said,

126
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,970
said to be, what the fuck does
that mean? Like the rest of the,

127
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,160
we said it should be. I think that's
what I was trying to say, but um,

128
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,440
you know,
and I dried it out.

129
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:58,910
Yeah.

130
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,310
And maybe I just didn't dice it up
enough. I have no idea. But, um,

131
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,470
I'm actually psyched that, uh, the
consistency though, I can get that down.

132
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:11,250
I might have needed it needed to knead
it a little bit more. I don't know.

133
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,660
Is there any,
uh,

134
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,370
higher qualified people out there that
could help me out on how to make the

135
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,760
right spinach pasta because I watched
some videos and I still fucked the thing

136
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,530
up.
But anyways,

137
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:25,740
so we did all of that and meanwhile
I was watching like the playoff games

138
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,750
playoffs and I'm fucking
great games this weekend.

139
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,360
Heartbreakers but just fucking,

140
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,870
just great games with also that,

141
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:40,200
that creeping sadness that I always
have when the playoffs are here.

142
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,700
That it's just like did another regular
season. Go buy that fucking fast.

143
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,260
Okay.

144
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,810
God Damn it. It's going to
be over there. Not a month.

145
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:51,260
It's going to be fucking over this
time. Next month is good. This,

146
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,900
I'm not even gonna say, cause there's
gonna be two fucking depressing. Um,

147
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,730
however, I have gotten totally into the
Celtics and NBA hoop with my Bruins.

148
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:04,550
So I mean, I got a little game almost
every night sometimes too, but anyways,

149
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,250
so let's go through them. Let's go
throw him. Is that be fucking Douche?

150
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:11,960
Who doesn't like sports is going to
roll their eyes just fast forward like

151
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:16,610
fucking 40 minutes and you'll be
safe. Um, the first one I saw,

152
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:20,480
I think I want, I taped all of them.
Um, so I watched them at weird times.

153
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:24,740
I watched, uh, the second
half of the original Texas,

154
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,230
the Kansas City chiefs, just absolutely
dominating the, uh, the new Texans.

155
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,270
And I actually tweeted that
out to an AH, on Twitter. Um,

156
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,100
and I actually got a ton of shit
for it. People are like, oh,

157
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,350
what are you trying to show off your
sports knowledge? It's like, no,

158
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:43,670
I like Sharon it. I love when people do
stuff like that and I am a sports nerd.

159
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,110
Okay. I'm not acting like I played at a
professional level. I just love that shit.

160
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,340
So I'm going to take you through it.

161
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,090
For those of you didn't know that the
chiefs were originally called the Texas.

162
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,110
They actually played in Dallas, Texas. Um,

163
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,210
when the AFL first started and when
the AFL first came out, the NFL,

164
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,070
the established league publicly
laughed at them and said,

165
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:11,690
these guys are crazy. They'll,
this will never work. Ha Ha,
ha, whatever. I, you know,

166
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:15,650
are you nervous now? We're not nervous
at all. We're just going to do, you know,

167
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,730
the American people know where the
quality football is that right?

168
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,630
That's what they said publicly.
And then behind the scenes,

169
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,800
as much as they may or may have not
believed that they then hedged their bets

170
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,950
and they wanted to try to

171
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,440
sabotage the AFL as much as they
could before it even got started.

172
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,270
So the AFL, how many fucking teams did
they had? They had the Boston Patriots,

173
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,690
the buffalo bills,
the New York titans.

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,590
Yeah.

175
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,460
Uh, the Dallas Texans,
the Minnesota Vikings,

176
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,460
and I'll get back to that before
you say that. I'm wrong on that.

177
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:57,090
They had the Minnesota Vikings.
I used to know this by heart.

178
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,840
Denver Broncos.
Oakland Raiders.

179
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,030
Okay.

180
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,290
San Diego chargers. I'm sorry.
The Los Angeles chargers.

181
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,070
Yeah.

182
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,900
And a dolphin's weren't in it.
Bengals weren't in it.

183
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,100
Who the fuck else has left? Bears.
Lions. Yeah, something like that.

184
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:18,480
I probably forgot a team or two.

185
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,140
And so the owner with the
most money was Lamar Lundy,

186
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,320
I believe that was his name.
I didn't look the shit up again,

187
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,660
but I read this whole book on it.
Lamar Lundy,

188
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,780
and he was the wealthiest of all owners.

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,440
So basically this guy could hold out
the longest in this new crazy venture.

190
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,000
All right, so Dave, how
they attack the fucking AFL?

191
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,500
They did it on two different levels.

192
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,550
The Dallas Texans were
owned by Lamar Lundy,

193
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,770
the most wealthiest of all the owners.

194
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,800
So what they the NFL did was
they awarded Dallas a team,

195
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,660
which became the Dallas cowboys.
So for a season or two, I forget,

196
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,790
I didn't look it up as I said that you
could either go see the Dallas cowboys or

197
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,590
the Dallas,
Texas now the Dallas cowboys,

198
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,750
as much as they were
an expansion franchise,

199
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,190
you could go down and watch them get
the shit kicked out of him. You know,

200
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,690
by Johnny Unitas. Jim Brown
or you know, Frank Gifford.

201
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,520
And while these guys, you
know, all these legends,

202
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,010
the fucking Green Bay
packers would come to town.

203
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,700
You get to see Vince Lombardi and the,
the, the early days of the packer sweep,

204
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:31,900
you could see all this professional level
talent or you could go across town and

205
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,340
go see the Dallas Texans,

206
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,820
a bunch of nobodies playing a bunch of
nobodies cause they want to establish it.

207
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:41,200
So obviously that completely,
um, that's a no brainer.

208
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:42,130
As a sports fan,

209
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,610
you're going to go see the NFL team and
go see all these stars that you've been

210
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:50,320
watching on TV. So, uh,
that completely fucked them.

211
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,410
And they had to move to Kansas
City and they became the chiefs.

212
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,530
They kept their colors though.
But they were originally called the Texas,

213
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:59,620
but they gave up the name.
And then the Minnesota Vikings,

214
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,310
which I did not know. I didn't know
any of that shit till I read the book.

215
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:06,460
The Minnesota Vikings were
originally going to be an AFL team.

216
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,240
So at the NFL did was not
only award Dallas a team,

217
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,280
they also went to the owners of the
Minnesota Vikings and said, hey,

218
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,090
do you want to just join the NFL
and not be part of the AFL? Come on,

219
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,730
we're an established leak.
And of course they said, hey,

220
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,640
fuck you guys and your new venture.

221
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,760
We're going to fuck a fuck the
whole going against the NFL,

222
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:31,990
we're going to join them. So
that's what they did. They, uh,

223
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,130
they opened a franchise across town
from the wealthiest owner and then they

224
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,580
stole one of their teams that,

225
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,980
that was their two moves as they publicly
laughed at the AFL. So there you go.

226
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,240
There's a little fucking little
little history from all freckles.

227
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,650
Um, but having said that, you
know, baby, they got him back,

228
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,630
but I guess they'd have to
beat the fucking cowboys.

229
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,400
And they're also part of the NFL.

230
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,360
So a congratulations to the chiefs and
evidently they're playing the Patriots is

231
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:02,500
what I got from some of the tweets. And,
uh, I am not a comfortable Patriot fan.

232
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:05,440
No Patriot fan who's been watching
the Patriots is, you know,

233
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,540
we had a lot of losses towards the end
of the year. Um, I'm hoping, you know,

234
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,610
we're going to get some help
back on our offensive line. Um,

235
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,570
either way it's going to be,
even if we were healthy,

236
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,300
it would have been a brutal
day. Cause, uh, you know,

237
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:21,910
Andy Reid is no slouch as much
as the guy gets a ton of shit.

238
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,650
I mean the guy's been to a bunch of,
uh,

239
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,290
NFC championship games and shit like that.
He has been there before, but you know,

240
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,560
you do need the players.
You do need the ownership.

241
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:36,610
You need all of that type of shit
to try and to try to succeed.

242
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:39,100
So congratulations to them.
And I'm,

243
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:43,990
I am by no means comfortable
with next week. Um,

244
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,330
and you know, also, you know,

245
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,620
the chief speak the Seattle Seahawks
as far as p and the loudest fans at one

246
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:53,910
point, they did it in that old
ass stadium rather than the, uh,

247
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,300
the stadium's Seahawks fans half that
helps him out and contains the south.

248
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,240
That was such a cut. But it's true. Um,

249
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,250
and uh, yeah, so speaking of
the Vikings and the bangles,

250
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,390
my condolences to fans of both teams.
I've been there,

251
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,740
fortunately you have not been there in
a long time. I guess the giants losses,

252
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,840
but I can't wine as a fan with all the
other shit that was going on. But uh,

253
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,700
Jesus fucking Christ.

254
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,600
What the fuck was that guy doing
after he picked off the ball,

255
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:27,120
walking up to the tunnel
already celebrating.

256
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,090
I thought fucking athletes
were were superstitious.

257
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,710
The fuck are you doing
right there? Yeah, right.

258
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,180
That's fucking unbelievable to me.
And then he's fucking sitting there.

259
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,440
He probably already took his God damn
cleats off and then the very next play,

260
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:47,260
what it was at two plays in,
they fumbled the fucking ball.

261
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,320
I had to watch this part of the game
on highlights because I taped the game.

262
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,110
If the one time I don't do
the extended fucking record,

263
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,240
this shit happens and I'm
probably to put his cleats on,

264
00:15:58,241 --> 00:15:59,310
run back out on the field.

265
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:02,260
I think he was so fucking frustrated
cause he still had champagne, you know,

266
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:06,040
coursing through his veins. He was already
mentally the next week that he goes,

267
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:10,450
it's, this was the same guy, right. Goes
in and fucking knocks out that player.

268
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,250
Unfucking believable.
Unfucking believable. Hey,

269
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:20,420
Steeler fence. How many you shut
the game off after the interception?

270
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,210
Huh?
Not because you're a fair weather fan.

271
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,410
Just because you couldn't stomach to
watch the bangle fans jumping up and down

272
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:31,310
and having some joy. You know, I,
I'd forgive you if you did that.

273
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,920
I'd forgive you if you walked away.
You know,

274
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,600
or if you already started celebrating
and you turned your big fucking sausage

275
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:43,430
eaten back to the fucking TV and you
are already doing well where gay.

276
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,820
But uh, but uh, who do we got
next week doing all that shit.

277
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,430
Fucking brutal. And uh,
the Vikings, I won't even,

278
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,323
I don't even,

279
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,950
can you explain to me how you place
kicker had the laces facing you kick her

280
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,770
twice in one fucking
game and a playoff game

281
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,720
that's on fuck him. I've never, I mean,
you never see the laces in, right?

282
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,820
I never even knew about it.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

283
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,730
I didn't ever even knew about
laces out since fucking ace mature.

284
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:16,000
That's when I learned about
it. Or is it ace Ventura? Um,

285
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,300
Jesus. Fuck. I mean,

286
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:23,140
I watched the replay of that game and
I went on Twitter beforehand and I,

287
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,800
you know, I found out the vikings
one in which a fucking sucked,

288
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:29,340
but I was in the middle of, you
know, trying to make spinach pasta,

289
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,260
which was well beyond my cooking ability.
So, you know, I was a little fucking, uh,

290
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,210
got a little sideways there for a minute.
And um,

291
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,190
I was thinking like, what the fuck
at Man, he must make this field goal.

292
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,760
Okay.

293
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,760
And then Seattle just has a ridiculous
kickoff return and then they're able to

294
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,180
kick it. Oh, maybe they,

295
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:55,050
they score a touchdown or maybe
a defensive back falls down.

296
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,020
I had no idea that he was going
to fucking lose it. Oh my God.

297
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,250
Fucking brutal.
But you know what,

298
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,180
every championship team,
you gotta have a little bit of luck.

299
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,990
The first fucking Superbowl, the
Patriots won. We had the Tuck rule,

300
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,200
which was a fucking rule.
Everybody blames Tom Brady.

301
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,080
It was a blame the officials.
Oh,

302
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:19,860
now the rule rules committee for coming
up with that weird one because I say to

303
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:22,830
this day, that's a fucking
fumble. That's a fumble.

304
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,920
The way sugar bear Hamilton did not
interfere with Ken Stabler the year the

305
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,860
fucking Raiders won a super Superbowl 11.

306
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:32,670
So anybody in Oakland puts your fucking
hankies away cause I don't wanna hear

307
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:37,250
you crying about it. That was
payback for super bowl. Uh,

308
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,100
not super 11.

309
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,100
The fucking playoffs playoffs and a 77
which sugar bear Hamilton was already in

310
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,240
the air jumping at Ken Stabler and,

311
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,830
and then he lets the ball go and they
called roughing the passer and back then

312
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:54,831
it wasn't a 15 yard penalty or they put
the ball where the guy threw it and it

313
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,650
was the end of the game needs
through a 50 yard fucking prayer.

314
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,330
Ray Hamilton's already in the
fucking air lands on Ken Stabler.

315
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,920
They call roughing the passer and they
took the ball from like the 50 and put it

316
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:12,850
on the fucking one inch line and then the
Raiders went and won the fucking game.

317
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,140
So I don't want to hear anything about it,

318
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,480
but I am man enough to say that the
Tuck rule was fucking horseshit and, uh,

319
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,460
I think it's a fumble,
you know,

320
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,240
but I'm not expecting that level of
maturity from rate offense. You know,

321
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:30,070
a fan base that goes to the game,
you know, dressed with uh, you know,

322
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,540
spikes on your shoulder pads that have
been checked by security to make sure

323
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:39,320
that they're totally safe as you
make a, I'm not safe, angry face.

324
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,660
Um, you know, something that does bug
me. I can't stand when they fucking, um,

325
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,560
when people get upset that Hollywood has
the audacity have awards to have award

326
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:55,810
shows and they always talk about
the self congratulatory night. Um,

327
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,870
like what business doesn't have an award
show, it's just not fucking televised.

328
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,890
You know, if you fucking drill for oil,
you know, they have the best of, you know,

329
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,910
BP and all them.

330
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:12,911
They have their fucking yearly fucking
Christmas party in l bass rage and all

331
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:14,220
man at Jr.

332
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,020
Okay

333
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,190
goes Duh Clem,
Clem field that a fucking Mishawaka clam.

334
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:23,820
I'm paying for that copper all tonight.

335
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,610
you know they do and they get
them a little fucking trophy.

336
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,270

they give you a little badge to
so on your fucking shirt. Right?

341
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,130
Why isn't Hollywood allowed
to have that little fucking

342
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,000
okay.

343

346

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,990
we only have four this week, so why
don't I do two, one, two, let's do that.

426
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,070
All right, let's get back to
the thing here. Um, all right.

427
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,660
Uh,
Oh,

428
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,800
today as I'm rushing through
this fucking podcast, I'm,

429
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,220
I'm having somebody coming over
looking at my garage today.

430
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,550
I even have to whisper this shit.
I somehow talked my wife into, uh,

431
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,780
you know,
allowing me to have,

432
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:12,140
just have somebody come over
and take a look at the garage.

433
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,440
I know I did that a couple months
back, but then I got busy, but now I,

434
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:19,130
I got the person coming back again and uh,

435
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,550
I'm actually using her
skills,

436
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,910
you know, that she does with me.
That's how I ended up with a dog. Like,

437
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,290
we're not getting this dog,
we're just,

438
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,750
we're a fostering the
dog for a couple of days,

439
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:33,900
cause she knew that I'd fall in love with
the fucking dog and then that would be

440
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:37,410
hit. So it's kind of like when you
first start, start dating a woman,

441
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,510
um, you know when she wants
a relationship, when she
comes over to your apartment,

442
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:47,280
but she starts do is she leaves shit there
cause it gives an excuse to come back.

443
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,430
I mean, it's fucking nuts, right?
Like the thinking that far ahead.

444
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,970
All you're sitting as a look at
those debts. Oh, the fucker. Right?

445
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:56,220
That's all you're thinking.
And they're sitting there plotting.

446
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,660
You know what I mean?

447
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,710
It's like you're some fucking head coach
that has no game plan and she's across

448
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:05,610
the field like fucking Bill Walsh calling
the first 25 plays of the game. Right?

449
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,180
Oh, I love a football life. There's
a nice reference to use. Um,

450
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,960
so, you know, it's fucking hilarious.

451
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,860
And speaking with Patrice O'Neal
benefits coming up once again, uh,

452
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,020
tell you a quick Patrice story.
Um,

453
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,400
he was so fucking brilliant than I
remember he was dating this woman and you

454
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:31,360
know, or whatever in her and she started
leaving shit around his house and I,

455
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:34,230
I just just had brought that
up because yeah. You know,
I dated swimming, you know,

456
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:37,920
she left this shit here and she left
that. It's like, what the fuck? You know,

457
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,000
I only see her like, you know, once
every two weeks he's just has shit their,

458
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:46,380
so for two weeks I keep looking at
her fucking brush or the shampoo,

459
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:47,970
she left bell or whatever and it just,

460
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,860
I keep thinking about
her and it's annoying me

461
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,470
and Patrice just goes Ecos,
so throw it out.

462
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,190
I go, what? He goes, throw it out. I'm
going to cancel out a brush. He goes,

463
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:05,160
I would, I go get the fuck
out. He goes, yeah. He goes,

464
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:10,161
I did that and he told me his story but
there was a woman he was messing around

465
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:15,570
with and she left these toiletries
and a little bag of like, you know,

466
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,830
makeup and brush and all that.
Eddie,

467
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,030
he fucking throw it out.

468
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,020
And then he came back like a week and
a half later and she goes to go in the

469
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:31,680
bathroom. She's like a, she's like,
Hey, what did you do with my, uh,

470
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,330
my stuff? He goes, and he just plays
dumb. He goes, what stuff? She goes,

471
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:40,860
I left shampoo here, a little makeup
bay. He goes, Oh yeah, I was yours. Yeah.

472
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,090
He goes, yeah, I throw it out.

473
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,020
And she was like literally beside herself,

474
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,340
but actually on some level respected him
for like fucking realizing what she was

475
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:54,714
doing.

476
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,400
And then also I think because that early
on he clearly let her know in a very

477
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:07,280
funny fucking way that he wasn't
looking for a relationship and uh,

478
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,050
that she was able to relax and
kind of be thinking that, oh,

479
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,080
we're just fucking all right. I wanted
a little more, he doesn't at least,

480
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:20,700
but he let her know so fucking
early on that it didn't really hurt,

481
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,330
you know? Does that make sense? I mean,
I don't, maybe I'm speaking for her,

482
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:28,560
but I guess I am, but whatever.
Either way it was fucking funny.

483
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,510
Jesus was at the fucking worse.

484
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,010
I literally just jumped out of the plane
and pull the fucking rip cord on that

485
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:39,330
story. Sorry. It's been awhile. It's been
awhile since I told that story, hasn't it?

486
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,750
Or have I told it before? I don't fucking
know. So anyway, so I'm kind of using

487
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,600
the same fucking tricks that my wife used
that got me the dog I'm using with her

488
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,650
because, um, we're going to like,
hey, why am I whispering here?

489
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:01,620
Like she can't just listen to the fucking
podcast. Fucking I eat that sometimes.

490
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,750
Like how dumb I am. It's just
really fucking, so anyways,

491
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,340
what I want to do is I have this
old school fucking, you know,

492
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:14,341
my house is built in 1923 so the garage
whenever it was fucking built was built,

493
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,373
um,

494
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,880
to house like a fucking model t Ford
kind of car and those things for those

495
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:25,330
things, you sat inside the fucking
wheel wells, you know what I mean?

496
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,780
If you look at old cars,
um,

497
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,710
you know how the fenders used to flare
out and then there was just the engine

498
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,540
and you know,

499
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:39,330
you sat like literally like
right behind basically what you,

500
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:42,100
you sat and I can't,
I don't know if I'm explaining correctly.

501
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:44,740
You know what I mean? You sitting inside
the fucking wheel wheel wells, right?

502
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:48,730
Not like literally in them, but as far as
like the line down the side of the car,

503
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,690
right? Like if you stuck your head out
and you didn't have any fenders on it,

504
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:57,160
you'd be looking at the fucking
tire. Right. As opposed to, you know,

505
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:01,710
the fucking road. I know all you
guys know what I'm talking about. Um,

506
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,590
it also goes to show you, I like how
fucking fat and in big people have gotten,

507
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,180
you know what I mean?
Two things,

508
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:10,330
if you ever go to mount Vernon and he'd
go to Thomas Jefferson's house and you

509
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:14,230
have to duck underneath
the fucking, uh, the, uh,

510
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,700
the fuck Dee, calm the doorframes,
you see how much taller people are.

511
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:20,830
And then when you look at
those old fucking cars,

512
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,050
the fact that two adults could sit side
by side like that and it wouldn't be,

513
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,840
it probably won't even touch on
each other, you know, so many ways.

514
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,330
What I'm trying to say is that my,
uh,

515
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:36,310
my garage is long and skinny
and it's like high up,

516
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,550
you know,
and uh,

517
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,710
and then it kind of
flares out at the back is,

518
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:44,140
it kind of wraps around the back of the
house a little bit. So what I want to do,

519
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:48,010
the, the front part is long enough
for me to squeeze my truck in there.

520
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,923
Um,

521
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,890
but then in the back what I want to do
is I want to turn that into like a little

522
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:56,500
gym,
which my wife has all four.

523
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,320
And then I'm also
pitching that I build the,

524
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:02,170
maybe a little drum room
that could actually,

525
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,850
I got this drum kit that I bought that I
haven't cases that if I want to play it,

526
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,220
I have to throw it in the truck
and drive it down to a studio.

527
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm thinking of making,
building like a room within a room,

528
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,470
which will add no value to
the house unless I someday
sell it to another fucking

529
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:21,700
drummer who also whispers on his own
fucking podcasts like his wife can't hear

530
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:24,730
it. Fucking I'm still whispering.
You know why? You know why?

531
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,130
Because the guys coming in like a half
hour in, my wife is asleep downstairs.

532
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:30,490
If she hears me yelling about it,

533
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,680
I might have to have this argument sooner
than I'm prepared to have it. So, um,

534
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,010
that is the game plan. And like a
couple months back I bought those holds.

535
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,530
Um, you know, all those things like
though that American Ninja Shit,

536
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,150
so down downstairs in the garage,

537
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:50,840
I want to just have those hanging from
the ceiling so I can do all that grip

538
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:52,910
strength shift that I want
to get better at. By the way,

539
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:56,810
I fucking started working out for the
first time in forever and I went to Duke

540
00:32:56,811 --> 00:33:00,950
Code do pullups Holy Shit. I
literally felt like, I was like,

541
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:03,680
do I have sandbags in my pockets?
What the fuck's going on?

542
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,540
I did six good ones and whimpered through
the last four. I always try to do 10.

543
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,370
I can't even fucking do
it. It's pathetic. Um,

544
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,840
so that's like the big exciting
thing in my life right now.

545
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:18,310
And I got to kind of get this thing going,
um,

546
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,830
before my wife wakes up and find
something else to do in the house,

547
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,190
you know, maybe, I don't know.
So anyways, by the way, people,

548
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:30,110
I'm doing a Gig in a van couver

549
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:36,110
I'm doing a Gig in Vancouver,
uh, Canada this Sunday night.

550
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,640
A last second one that was added because
I left my January open because I'm

551
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:43,940
still waiting to hear
about a season two. We, uh,

552
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,970
meet with Netflix this week to
pitch them our ideas for season two.

553
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,000
Uh, so if you've already
watched F is for family.

554
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:56,960
I thank you so much because you've got
me to at least getting the meeting.

555
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,110
So we'll see. Uh, we will see
what happens with that. And, um,

556
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,380
so I hadn't booked anything in January.

557
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,100
So now we're having some last
second gigs, um, coming up.

558
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:13,040
I'm going to do a Gig in Vancouver this
Sunday and then I'm going to do a couple

559
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:17,600
of dates, one or two dates I think right
before the Patrice O'Neal benefit. Um,

560
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,210
in the tristate area.
We're still,

561
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:25,070
I'm trying to fucking iron
those things out as we speak.

562
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:28,520
Jesus Christ fills, spit it out.
All right, let's get to the, uh,

563
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:33,020
the questions of this
week. Uh, all right. Inbox,

564
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,690
inbox, inbox. Where's the content is
the co no, I had it on the other page.

565
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,140
What am I doing? Oh, there we go. All
right. Bill Patriots first. Kansas City.

566
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:47,080
Hello there. Mr. Barr. How's it going?
You freckled cunt there? How I, yeah,

567
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,920
I hope your holidays were just peachy.
Same to Cleo in Nia. Uh, today.

568
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:56,921
I just wanted to hear your honest and
objective thoughts about the matchup

569
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:00,050
between your paths in
my chiefs this weekend.

570
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:04,550
I was just listening to your
podcasts from 12, seven, 15. We'll,

571
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:09,380
you said Casey won't win. Shit.
Somebody tweeted me that. I said that.

572
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:12,800
I talked so much trash, I don't
even remember saying that. Uh,

573
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:17,060
and I'm content that you may eat those
words this week. Oh, absolutely. Oh,

574
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:21,710
I absolutely might eat those
words this week. Uh, but
having said, I think I might,

575
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,180
well, Casey, what, when Shit is,
you're not going to win the super bowl.

576
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,850
That's what I mean. My pick
is, uh, the Seattle Seahawks,
which is not really a, uh,

577
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,610
it's not really a genius pick
by any stretch of the means.

578
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:39,390
They've been there two fucking
years in a row. Um, I mean,

579
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:41,460
didn't they win yesterday
without Marshawn Lynch?

580
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,630
I was running back and
forth trying to make lasagna
noodles. Uh, as far as I know,

581
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:48,090
I didn't see Marshawn lynch in there.

582
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,500
My wife was also clicking back and forth
to like the fucking Golden Globes. So,

583
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,330
um, I just know that they, uh,
now when our weight, that was,

584
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:01,050
that was the earlier one dude,
you know, yesterday I watched,

585
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,040
I watched fucking Ohio state,
Indiana.

586
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,870
I watched two playoff football games
and I watched half of a Celtic game and

587
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:11,340
fell asleep was fucking ridiculous.

588
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:15,840
So I'm trying to remember what the
fuck I saw this weekend. But, um, no,

589
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:20,140
I don't think it's going to be an
easy a, listen, I gotta tell you this.

590
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:24,040
If we were fucking healthy, we would
kick the shit out of you. All right?

591
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:28,270
If we actually had an offensive line and
Edelman was back and Amygdala was back,

592
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:32,590
we had a fucking running game and
we, we, we've, we were healthy.

593
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,460
This is no fucking contest at home.
You know it and I know it right now,

594
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,920
Brady is driving a fucking rental car.

595
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:42,250
So you might go in there and beat us and
then you get to get all fucking excited

596
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:45,100
and loud, and then, you know
what? I Dunno. You know,

597
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:47,760
why would I root against you guys?
Hey, you know what you guys have,

598
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,970
you guys haven't won
since what, 1970 right?

599
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:57,770
What was that? Uh, what was
that fucking Hank Sram call

600
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,540
power trap. Cross 57 five and drive.
What the fuck was that thing called?

601
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,610
I don't remember. You guys have an
a, when you beat the fucking Vikings,

602
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,250
Jesus Christ going way back,
you beat the AFL team.

603
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:16,010
That fucking sold off.
Maybe that's why they're cursed.

604
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,970
Maybe that's why they've lost, what did
they lose? Three, three, four Superbowls.

605
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,020
Three Superbowls. Right? They
lost through the fucking chiefs.

606
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,830
They lost to the pack.
Is

607
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:32,600
they lost to the dolphins and they lost
to the Steelers. Is that right? Wait,

608
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:36,820
the dolphins lost to the cowboys.
Then they

609
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,450
beat the vikings and they beat
the Redskins. That's right.

610
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:47,290
She speak the Vikings Green Bay B.

611
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,700
Yeah. The chiefs. They didn't
beat the Raiders. Did they?

612
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,330
They beat the vikings right
now. The Vikings would have
been in the NFL by then.

613
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,690
I don't fucking room. Whatever. You
lost like fucking three of them.

614
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,510
Maybe because you'd get,
you didn't stick with the AFL guys.

615
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,920
Does that make any sense? Whatever.
Good luck to the chiefs this week.

616
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Good luck to the Patriots. Obviously
my heart is with the Patriots, but uh,

617
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,770
you know,
I don't know.

618
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:18,320
I didn't lie like that dolphins
game where every time Brady,

619
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:20,060
the few times he went back to pass,

620
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:24,260
it was just somebody writing his
grill every fucking time. Um,

621
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,200
but whatever the end of the fucking day,

622
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,260
we have the greatest fucking quarterback
and coach of all fucking time.

623
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:33,890
So go fuck yourself. I think we're
going to be, yeah. All right.

624
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,370
It'd be no fun if I said good luck
to you guys. So fuck you guys.

625
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,880
You don't stand a chance there.
Now if you'd beat me,

626
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,080
you got something to talk about,

627
00:38:42,081 --> 00:38:44,690
then he could trash me and I can fill
out a fucking hour next week on the

628
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:48,380
podcast. Um, all right. Drive
to school. Oh, by the way,

629
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,170
Alabama. Clemson, I have no, I
don't know shit about either team.

630
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,620
I was so fucking busy in the
fall. I didn't get to watch
any of it, but of course,

631
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,730
mmm. I wouldn't care if Alabama won,
but Clemson hasn't one in a while.

632
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:10,390
So I'd love to see them win.
However, if, if Alabama wins,

633
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:16,050
it just makes the Cleveland browns
futility even funnier to me because

634
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,750
the dumbest fucking move ever.

635
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,980
Do you realize that they
had bill Bellacheck and Nick
Saban coaching their team

636
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,460
and they fired the,
the Vus,

637
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,340
the fucking Paul Brown,

638
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,320
Vince Lombardi of the modern day
NFL and the Paul Brown bear Bryant,

639
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,140
Vince Lombardi
of Ncaa Division One football.

640
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,200
They had them both coaching together

641
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,320
and they fired.
So if Alabama as a Cleveland Brown fan,

642
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,060
you have to be rooting for Clemson.
You just have to,

643
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,930
you guys have had enough
fucking pain. Right? Who knows,

644
00:39:57,931 --> 00:40:01,880
maybe Lebron can get you over the hump
this year, you know, uh, roof a Cleveland,

645
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:03,920
like I said, I have relatives, you know,

646
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,350
family that grew up out there
and all the type of shit. I, uh,

647
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,580
I actually loved Cleveland.
So, um, however, I also love
a good joke. So if Alabama,

648
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:14,630
Winston, and it'll still be
funny. Anyways, continue one
drive to school. Hey Bill,

649
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:17,480
I've been a fan of yours since the
O and a days and Chappelle show.

650
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,680
Somewhere along the line I had a kid
and he's old enough to listen to some of

651
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:25,850
your podcast. Uh, I listened to it
with him on the drive to school.

652
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:30,650
I listened to the whole episode before
beforehand and cut out any of this stuff

653
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,540
that is a bit heavy or sexual, uh,
Jesus, you're fucking great dad.

654
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:40,160
When you start editing that content,
you know, look at you, you're a regular,

655
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:43,580
typical, uh, not because
I'm sheltering him,

656
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:45,730
but because he and I don't need,

657
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,430
don't need certain podcast moments.

658
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:53,690
When you talk of ges in some
skank before 8:00 AM exactly.

659
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,810
Let the kid have a childhood,
uh,

660
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,260
trying to keep it light and positive
with the exception of the funny negative.

661
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,980
Anyways, I wanted to tell you that
it's the best thing we got going.

662
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:07,850
We listened to about 15 minutes a day.
It puts him in eye and a laughing mood,

663
00:41:07,851 --> 00:41:11,960
which he needs schools a lot of work
these days and he always got a ton of

664
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:15,650
homework and projects and his dragon
in the morning. This wakes them up.

665
00:41:15,651 --> 00:41:19,820
Sometimes we pause and talk about certain
things or all explained certain stuff

666
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:23,330
to him about politics, sports, et
cetera. Yeah. In other words, correct.

667
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:26,190
The dumb shit that I said, all
that fathers, sons stuff. Uh,

668
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,270
thanks for the parental
assist. Ah, that's great.

669
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,200
Who would have ever thought my
ignorance could be hot, warm?

670
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,120
Um, anyways, uh,

671
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,510
I'm already regretting fucking
making funny record your face.

672
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:44,900
Why did I do that shit? But you
know what I mean? He's making fun.

673
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:47,150
Everybody on the show.
It's only fair, right?

674
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:48,610
Okay.

675
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:52,030
Does showing up with fucking acceptance
speeches and he's got all those fucking

676
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,940
zingers at him and his writing
staff wrote. It's only fair.

677
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,360
That's why I like Mel Gibson. They'll
give some, gave him shit back.

678
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,200
I don't understand why people just go
out and smile and they should fucking

679
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:05,920
trash them. A vasectomy. Ah, dear bill,

680
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,280
I don't want to get a vasectomy.
I just don't,

681
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:12,860
my wife and anyone else who chimes in
on the subject started trying to break

682
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:16,630
down positives and point out
the lack of negatives ever.

683
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,390
Just not want something.
I just don't want one.

684
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Can you believe this or you with everyone
else said it must be rooted in some

685
00:42:24,761 --> 00:42:28,660
fear, et cetera. Fuck Dat dude. Fuck that.

686
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,220
Are you fucking kidding me?

687
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,640
Do you think you could fucking tell a
woman what the fuck to do with her body

688
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:36,760
for two seconds before she just said,
you're a, you're a chauvinistic.

689
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:41,290
Cont yeah, dude. Fuck that. Fuck that.

690
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:46,020
All Day long. That's your fucking
Dick and balls. All right. Dot.

691
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,050
That they fuck with your deck.

692
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,930
If you don't fucking want them
to go in there and snip, snip,

693
00:42:49,931 --> 00:42:53,350
whatever the fuck I've even looked up
the operation, I still don't get it.

694
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,330
I don't get it.
Nothing comes out.

695
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,970
So does it stop your
ability to make judges,

696
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,200
do they put an order down there where
you got to milk the ges out as allow?

697
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,770
That's disgusting. I, I don't get, I
don't get what happens, but fuck that.

698
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,510
Fuck that. Fuck that. Just just
sit down with you. I say, listen,

699
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,510
I don't want to do that. And she'll be
like, why? Why not you? You're just,

700
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,260
you're just fear based.
It's like, no, it isn't.

701
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,740
I don't want to be walking
around and it like, dude,

702
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,620
you know what that's like.

703
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,490
You like a muscle car and they want to
rip the engine out and put a Fucking v

704
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:32,324
six in there,

705
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,360
fuck you and keep you Shelby badge on
the side of your car and every day in the

706
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:42,941
morning you wake up standing there looking
at yourself after he got out of the

707
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:47,180
shower, knowing that it's
a lie. Fuck that dude.

708
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,850
Fuck you. Keep the bullets of that
gun. All right. She can't handle it.

709
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,450
You know, I said, you know,
what is she going to do to you?

710
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:03,160
Huh? She gonna hold you down and make it
while someone else does it. Just, yeah,

711
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,560
you don't want one dude.

712
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:08,640
You don't want one to the level you're
reaching out to a fucking podcast.

713
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,150
Okay,

714
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,820
okay.
Do you understand that?

715
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,710
Would even use that and make
your argument just be like,

716
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,430
I don't play this audio though.
I would just say, listen,

717
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,360
I so do not want to do this,

718
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,870
that I actually wrote into
a podcast to get advice.

719
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,770
That's how much I don't want to do this.
And then she'll just be like, well,

720
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:32,040
maybe we need to go
talk somebody about it,

721
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,790
which means she's going to set up an
appointment with somebody who agrees with

722
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:39,990
her all cause she's gonna set up
the appointment, gone. Listen,

723
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,470
my husband needs to get a vasectomy.
He's very nervous.

724
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:45,240
He says he doesn't want to get it,
but I,

725
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,390
it's going to be the best for us and
she's going to totally set the fucking

726
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:51,810
table. It's like those dumb
fucks that go on, Doctor Phil.

727
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,540
Do you ever see those sad sacks that go
on that fucking show with their wife?

728
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,520
Like they have a fucking prayer
doctor? Phil's audiences, women.

729
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,560
So he's going to have to side with the
woman every fucking time. Even if he,

730
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:08,400
you know, he's going to try to, you know,

731
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,690
hide his hand and give her a little
bit of Shit. But at the end of the day,

732
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,220
he's going to be looking at you go,

733
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,870
you need to get your balls snipped right.

734
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,770
He's going to come at you like
that while he sits there, you know,

735
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:27,080
with his junk still fucking working.
You know, he's got a giant fucking unit.

736
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:30,140
Doesn't he do that big fucking goof,
that big bulk goof.

737
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:34,520
Walk down the hall that you know,
he's got a fucking giant fucking unit.

738
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:39,800
Big Gray, great Dane
balls. I don't know why.

739
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:45,320
I think he's got a fucking giant
unit. He does. He's just like,

740
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:50,300
he's just dug. But uh, the
way he talks, he's just, God
always gives them big dicks.

741
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,180
It just, I don't know what it is. Um,

742
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,830
well this giant size 16 brown wooden
wingtips just sitting across from you.

743
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:09,540
That's gotta be the worst
fucking show evidence. Oh my God.

744
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,170
I never thought about doctor Phil's junk
before you see that it takes somebody

745
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:18,030
to fucking bring up a vasectomy, you'll
never be able to think about him again.

746
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,550
Megan, my big Dick say, you
need to listen to your wife.

747
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,420
All right. Jumping out
of a plane. Hey Bill,

748
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,920
where are you at on
jumping out of a plane? Uh,

749
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,710
if you're a chicken shit American,
I'm a Brit.

750
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,920
How much money would it take you to jump?

751
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,050
Uh,

752
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:45,110
I got a bet with my mate that you hate
heights and it take 500,000 US dollars.

753
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:51,960
Don't change your answer to be contrary
to what I just guess. Keep it fair.

754
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:55,920
Good sir. Thanks Jesus.
Another arrogant Brit.

755
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,510
These guys think they're fucking geniuses.
Um,

756
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,250
I've already done it. You fucking
idiot. And I paid someone to do it.

757
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,360
I went to a,
at Pepperell,

758
00:47:08,361 --> 00:47:13,361
Massachusetts when I was 19 years old
and I didn't do a tandem jump either.

759
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:17,120
I did a static line jump. I've told
this story on the podcast, sir,

760
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,350
if you're a little bit, um, more up on it.

761
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,330
Uh,
and also I have a pilot's license.

762
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:31,270
I fly helicopters. So if I was afraid of
heights, I mean, I'm afraid of heights.

763
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:35,770
Look, if I don't have a parachute
on my back and I'm not in a, in a,

764
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,060
in a vehicle that's designed to fly,

765
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:41,960
okay,

766
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,410
then yes, I'm afraid of
heights. Like, I don't like, uh,

767
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,770
you know,
like if he should,

768
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,560
like one time I watched a youtube video
and they just showed these guys that had

769
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:56,190
the climb up to the top
of this fucking building

770
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,403
and then,

771
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,230
no, not clients. They took the elevator,
who's getting hope? They, they,

772
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,390
they were on the roof and it
was already on the fucking roof.

773
00:48:06,391 --> 00:48:10,080
This building was so fucking
high up and you know,

774
00:48:10,081 --> 00:48:11,790
the wind up there must be ridiculous.

775
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:15,660
I would literally just lay down in the
fetal position and crawl back to the

776
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:18,300
fucking door that leads to the stairwell,

777
00:48:18,301 --> 00:48:22,960
reach up to the handle and
fucking go back down. But this,

778
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:23,820
this dude,

779
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,733
mmm.

780
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,500
Then climbs the fucking,
the, the, the whatever,

781
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:35,590
the radio tower or whatever and it just
keeps getting higher and higher and

782
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:41,120
higher in the tower gets smaller and
smaller and smaller and he's hooking and

783
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:44,360
unhooking his safety line.
I literally,

784
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,330
I couldn't find,

785
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:51,331
I mean obviously the guy live cause it's
his GoPro on his helmet and I've never

786
00:48:52,191 --> 00:48:55,850
been so fucking unsettled watching
something in my life. Okay.

787
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:59,780
Then I would hate heights. But I think at
that point everybody hates heights. But,

788
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:02,000
um, yeah, when I was 19 years old,

789
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,840
I went to this place in Pepperell,
Massachusetts,

790
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:07,280
which I don't think exists anymore.

791
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:11,210
They might still be an airport
there and they had a, uh, uh,

792
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:15,020
school and uh,
I did the static line jump.

793
00:49:15,021 --> 00:49:16,400
If you've ever seen that movie,

794
00:49:16,401 --> 00:49:21,401
a Fandango when a Kevin Costner's earlier
ones where the dude from a breakfast

795
00:49:23,511 --> 00:49:27,890
club, uh, Judd Nelson,
his character jumps out.

796
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,793
Okay.

797
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:34,750
That's exactly what I did.
And I remember when we went up,

798
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,720
the command was sitting in the door,
get out,

799
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:40,020
and then he slapped you on
the shoulder and it said go.

800
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,000
And uh,

801
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,260
I remember when he said, sit in the door.
I thought he was saying close the door.

802
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:50,110
So I was reaching up, I'm sitting down,
reaching up, trying to close the door,

803
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:52,900
and he had this big smile on his face.
Like he thought I was chickening out.

804
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:57,930
I feel like I just told this story on
the podcast and then I find Rosa who's

805
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,051
saying,
sit in the door.

806
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:03,390
So you sit in the door and basically
it's one of those planes were the,

807
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,050
the wing is above the aircraft.
Do you know what I'm,

808
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,670
it's on top of the aircraft
as opposed to below,

809
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:12,250
which actually gives you a much
better site I would think, um,

810
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,920
as far as if you wanted to look down.
Um,

811
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,790
and then there's the support that
goes to the side of the plane. So,

812
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,250
and then right above one
of the landing wheels,

813
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,780
the wheels don't retract on this plane.
They had a welded a little step.

814
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:30,050
So you sat the fucking door

815
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,570
and uh, I forget how high we were at
going to say we will only like 1500.

816
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:39,860
We weren't that high yet because
you shoot immediately comes out. Um,

817
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,190
so you said you sit in the door,

818
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,880
then he goes get out and then what you
do is you reach out and you grab that

819
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:51,881
support be from the wing and you hold
onto that while one of your feet is,

820
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:55,100
uh,
is standing on that little step thing.

821
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,880
And then basically what you do
is literally acting this out.

822
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:01,480
So I can remember is
you then basically you,

823
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:03,920
you bend your arms and
you bring your chest,

824
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,470
like flush with the support
beam and then the, the,

825
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,230
the foot that's dangling,
you put it straight out behind you.

826
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,040
It's almost like a yoga pose. So
it was sit in the door, get out,

827
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:20,450
and then he slaps his shoulder
and he goes, go and you let go.

828
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,430
And then you, you arch you arc,
right? Arc One arc, 1002, 1003,

829
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:29,240
1000. Look, if nothing, look, reach,
pull. And when you're looking,

830
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:32,510
you're looking over your shoulder
to see if your shoot came out.

831
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,800
And then if nothing,
you look down at the handle,

832
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,690
reach it. Because for some reason
they say if you don't look down,

833
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:46,130
you might be flailing because you're
panicking because it's the first time you

834
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:51,100
jumped in the chute didn't come
out. Sorry. Cayenne pepper. Ah,

835
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,970
hang on a second.
So anyways,

836
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:00,560
I get out, he goes, go, I let go.

837
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:06,050
And instead of arching ice, I don't know
what I did. I just reached for something.

838
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:11,260
All I know is I started doing front front
flips as my shoot was coming out and I

839
00:52:12,951 --> 00:52:16,550
felt it go by my leg,
the inside of my leg,

840
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,110
I felt it go by my leg.

841
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:22,730
I felt something hit that and I was
immediately thinking, oh my God,

842
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:25,010
I'm going to roll right up
in this fucking thing. Like,

843
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:29,630
you know when you put Bacon on shrimp.
And uh,

844
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,790
the second I had that thought like
to shoot already had come out.

845
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,330
And by the grace of God,
I didn't get tangled up.

846
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,190
I think about that sometimes.
Like how easily I could have fucking died.

847
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:48,500
Um, and then boom, you shoot comes
out and when you shoot comes out,

848
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,100
you don't even feel like you're falling
because there's nothing going past you

849
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:53,960
because you're above the
tree line and all that.

850
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,770
So you just feel like you're just
sort of suspended in the air.

851
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,430
And,
uh,

852
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:03,110
there was a radio and this lady just
talk to you and she say pull the left

853
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:05,630
toggle and you had to pull it all the
way down to unique cause I remember there

854
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:06,464
was this,

855
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:09,890
this big girl in the class and she
couldn't get it around her hips and she

856
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:13,310
landed across the street and a pile
of loom and dislocated her knee.

857
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,270
I remember that before. And then I went
up after her and I was just like, fuck.

858
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,380
Um,
and then they have this ridiculous,

859
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:25,810
you know when you get to the tree line
you suddenly realize how you're falling.

860
00:53:25,811 --> 00:53:29,860
I think it was like 17 feet per second
or maybe 11 feet. I can't remember.

861
00:53:29,861 --> 00:53:32,440
But it was really fast. It
was like basically, you know,

862
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,570
jumping off of a, of a basketball
rim. Like how fast you'd come down.

863
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,600
It had to be a little
bit slower, right? Oh No.

864
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,820
Cause you're not reaching terminal
velocity. I don't fucking know.

865
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:44,350
So all I know is when you hit the ground,

866
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:48,190
what you were supposed to do is look
straight ahead because for some reason if

867
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:51,250
you look down at your feet, what you
were going to do, they were worried.

868
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:53,800
You pick your feet up too quickly
and somehow break your legs.

869
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,080
So what you had to do is look straight
ahead. And as right as you hit the ground,

870
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,190
you supposed to do this little fucking
like collapse down and then this big

871
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:03,911
ridiculous,

872
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:07,960
bring it both your legs straight up
in the air and then over to your side.

873
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:13,090
I don't know why. I doubt that they
still have people do that. And I did.

874
00:54:13,091 --> 00:54:17,770
What everybody else did is I came down
and the second my feet hit the ground,

875
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:22,771
I did a face plant right into the
grass and my buddy grab the uh,

876
00:54:23,171 --> 00:54:26,140
the Mike from the person that called
me a dickhead, something like that.

877
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,190
What a dickhead or something in
the um, in the, in the radio.

878
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:34,720
Um, so yeah, there you go. So I did it.

879
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,160
And what are you basing chicken
shit. American art. Huh? Oh,

880
00:54:39,161 --> 00:54:43,150
you tough guys over there with your
fish and chips. Have you done it yet?

881
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,470
500 years. I, there's nothing you can
sub. If I don't want to do something,

882
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:52,380
I wouldn't do it. It's not money that
you could give me. I know he goes,

883
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:55,930
Doug, fuck a break. Now I'm making
great money. I got enough money.

884
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,560
I've got enough money. I'm good to
take my life in my fucking hands. Now,

885
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,440
that's one of those things out. And when
I was back working at the warehouse,

886
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,010
I mean, granted I pay somebody when
I was working in a fucking warehouse,

887
00:55:09,011 --> 00:55:12,400
I a shit, you know, let's see.

888
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:18,560
How much would they, I mean,
if they gave me, literally,

889
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:21,740
if you gave me $400, you would
have doubled my pay for the week.

890
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:25,920
So I would have done
that. Well, let's see.

891
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:29,310
Let's go back to the building
to climb up that building.

892
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:30,980
Okay.

893
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:35,330
How much money would they have to give me
a, when I was working in the warehouse,

894
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,620
a $800.

895
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,003
MMM.

896
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,220
And that now for that, that
building, uh, I would say, uh,

897
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:48,720
yeah, I just wouldn't do it.
I'm all right. I'm all set.

898
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:52,770
I'm all set. I, you know, I should
actually send you guys said video.

899
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,513
MMM.

900
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,580
So it's not that I hate
heights, sir. I hate,

901
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,560
I'm risking my life to that level.

902
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,840
If there's like a parachute
or something like that,

903
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:10,120
it is a bungee cord or there's like
a fucking safety line, that's fine.

904
00:56:10,121 --> 00:56:13,510
But you know it going up that tower where
I have to unhook the safety line and

905
00:56:13,511 --> 00:56:16,510
then hook it back up and there's
wind and shit. Fuck that.

906
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:18,970
That's too much of a risk.
I wouldn't do that, but uh,

907
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:24,090
you know,
why

908
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,640
don't I ain't, what the fuck I'm
talking about it college cooking Billy.

909
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:34,220
Oh, that's a great one. What a
great one. Bill it. Billy Boy D.

910
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,610
Oh fuck. I gotta wrap this up. This
guy's coming in 12 minutes. Uh,

911
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,580
I'm sure everyone is blowing you
up to make another cooking video,

912
00:56:41,581 --> 00:56:44,380
so don't worry.
This isn't that I'm a college student.

913
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,550
I know you've lived like a college
student, India early thirties,

914
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,150
from past stories about living
with Bobby Kelly, us do.

915
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:55,330
We weren't living like college students.
We will live in like fucking animals.

916
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:00,520
Do you have any menu
suggestions besides pasta?

917
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,930
What would you mix together? I'm pretty
crew creative and I do all right,

918
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:06,790
but I'm open to some suggestions.

919
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,600
What's good to throw together on a
budget and on a fly. You know what dude?

920
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:14,560
I would go to, um, I would,
this is what I would do.

921
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,940
I would go on Youtube and I would ask
that question and you'll find videos and

922
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,110
then just start searching in.

923
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:24,610
At some point you're going to connect
with somebody and I feel like I'm,

924
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,580
you know, dropping the ball here on
the question, but like I'm not a chef.

925
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,080
I'm not even a cook. Um, really
early on this to this myself.

926
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:39,160
So that's what I would do.
There's a bunch of old episodes of Mario,

927
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:44,180
Mario Batali's, multiple Mario,
M. O. L. T. O. Mario. Um,

928
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,860
I really suggest watching those.
Just watch the guy.

929
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,400
I used to just watch the
show and just by watching it,

930
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:56,350
you learn things and you start
to see how things are made. Um,

931
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:02,310
and, and uh, the big thing is
not having, you just have to,

932
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:07,260
to learn shit in life. You got to have
the, the mindset of like, I'm gonna,

933
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:10,840
you know, I'm going to fuck
this up probably the first
time and that's all right.

934
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,510
And then I'll get a little
better like the pasta already,

935
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,800
just even just running it through the
pasta maker. I already have like three,

936
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:21,370
three fucking things that I'm not
going to do the next time. Um,

937
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:21,881
and by the way,

938
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:25,690
somebody gave me a great tip when you're
after you find kneaded the dough and

939
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:27,970
you put it through your pasta maker,
be sure to,

940
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,990
to douse like both sides with flour,
be liberal with the flower.

941
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:33,730
Cause if you don't,
it's going to tear.

942
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,090
It could tear when you're in there because
it's supposed to be like sticky and

943
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:40,900
elastic at the same time. And,
uh, when you run it through there,

944
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:46,420
um, yeah, you could, you could
possibly have some issues and it tears.

945
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:48,730
Then it's a big fucking pain in
the ass and then he gets sad.

946
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:51,850
You feel like a fucking failure and
you're not, he had the balls to try it.

947
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,680
So I would,
uh,

948
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:57,040
I go that Rachel Ray's got a great bunch
of great ones from back in the day.

949
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:59,120
Everybody always makes fun of her,
but she would,

950
00:58:59,121 --> 00:59:02,680
if she had made 20 million meals,
he had a little fucking lab sheet do.

951
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:04,030
I used to watch a shit all the time.

952
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,300
That's great shit for
probably where you're at.

953
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,720
But I would also Google
some stuff like that. Um,

954
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,370
but it's great as a college student,
if you start to learn how to cook,

955
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:20,170
if you start to learn how to cook
right now and you do it religiously,

956
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:24,200
you are going to be a fucking beast
compared to the average person.

957
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,660
Um, by that time you were in
your 30 stowed, forget it.

958
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:31,460
If you add like shit,
like learning how to,

959
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,330
how to make a pie crust cause then
then you can make Turkey pot pie.

960
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:38,720
You can make key, she can make all of this
shit. He started making homemade pasta.

961
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:43,100
Forget it. It's fucking over. Then you
learn how to do all this other stuff.

962
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,530
I forget what I mean.
I made it with Nia.

963
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:48,560
I was really concentrating
on making the pasta.

964
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,980
She did the Bowland A's and then
she did the whole milk sauce thing.

965
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,400
But I just was watching her do that.
When you heat,

966
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:57,770
heated up some butter and some flour
and then he heated up some milk.

967
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:02,330
Then you poured the whole thing together
instead of using like a ricotta cheese,

968
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:06,230
um, arena, that type of shit. Um,

969
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,860
you use this really rich milk thing.
It was almost too much.

970
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,500
The fucking dish was like,
it almost tasted like a dessert.

971
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:16,520
It was so fucking good. But um, I didn't
know how to do shit when I was your age.

972
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:21,260
So I think it's great that
you're doing it. Um, you know,

973
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:22,790
you want,
how about Blue Apron?

974
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,870
Sign up for that shit and just,
you know,

975
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,290
steal some of them meal ideas and
then expand on them. If there's a,

976
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,600
in the earth is a style of
cooking that they give you,

977
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:36,510
then you go on Youtube and uh,

978
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:39,920
you just start looking at
recipes about that. Like,

979
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:41,870
you know what I don't know anything about,

980
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:46,080
which is weird because I loved the
food is any sort of Asian style, um,

981
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:51,200
cooking. I actually smoked some
ribs and I, and I had this, uh,

982
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,250
this dipping sauce that was like,
you know,

983
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,850
whatever Chinese or Japanese influenced,
you know,

984
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:01,430
with the fucking soy sauce and all that.
And it was,

985
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:06,140
and I was in a part of the grocery store
that I never went to and it was the

986
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:09,200
shit. It tasted great. And, um,

987
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,170
that's something I was kinda thinking
this year I want to get down pasta and,

988
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:16,970
and started to have some Asian,
uh, type dishes in there.

989
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:19,820
So if there's anybody out there that can
help me with that, I'd appreciate it.

990
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:23,600
So anyways, the guys coming here in eight
minutes, I get to upload this fucker.

991
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,790
Um,
I'll talk to you later.
