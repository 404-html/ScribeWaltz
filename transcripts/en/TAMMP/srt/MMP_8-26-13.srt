1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,880
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,230
August 26th, 2013 what
he is saying, hey fuck,

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,870
oh, how are ya? How's it going? Holy Shit.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,830
Where did the summer go? You
know, I always make fun of that.

5
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:24,690
I always make fun of people go, Oh my
God, can you believe it's already August?

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,700
Um, I worked my ass off to summer, so the
summer did fly by. I can't believe it.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,730
I didn't get the layout or anything and
he'd get the Tan myself up and they get

8
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,390
to read myself up at all. You
know? Did you guys lay out Dick?

9
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:43,170
Get a little skin
cancer? Um, I am finally.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,710
Okay.

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,710
I'm finally back in Los Angeles after
spending a month in New Orleans.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,850
Uh, had a great fucking time down there
and did it with a on a great note.

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,350
You know, I settled my differences with
the city. I finally said, you know what?

14
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,620
You win. I'm going to have some
of your fried fucking food.

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,440
And um,
I ended up going,

16
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:10,150
I went bow fishing out in
the buy you a fucking bow.

17
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:14,680
And Arrow, right? I got myself
a six pack of Bud talls.

18
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,600
This is America, few people overseas
right now for you people over there,

19
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,330
I don't know what we did to you and
know what we're doing to you right now,

20
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:25,720
what we're gonna do to you in the
future that's going to make you fucking

21
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:27,190
passively aggressive,

22
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,020
aggressively attack the great
game of American football.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,491
You know,

24
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,770
cause you won't get to the real core
of the issue that you don't like our

25
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:40,390
foreign policy. And by our, I mean me,
because I sit in on those meetings,

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,910
I'm making the calls,
you know,

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,900
and all you fucking cunts over
there who got cake every week,

28
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:49,530
every week I'm getting these fucking
emails that people still shit and acting

29
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,170
like NFL football players aren't tough
compared to rugby because they wear

30
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:56,290
helmets.
Do you realize how fucking dumb that is?

31
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,760
Okay.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,140
That's like saying,
well you know,

33
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,800
so basically if you're in a car you can
drive it into a tree and you won't get

34
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:06,450
hurt because you're in a car. Is
that what you're telling me? Huh?

35
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,450
With all your portly fucking white
guys waddling around out there putting

36
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:13,210
shoulders into chess.
Okay?

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,550
It's not what we're talking about here.

38
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,510
We're not talking about a bunch of pasty
fucking white dudes running around who

39
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:25,570
can't even write a fucking five second 40

40
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,290
that's not what we're talking
about at all. All right?

41
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,730
We're talking about a game that is played
at his size and speed that is not seen

42
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,040
overseas. It just doesn't. You know
why? Because you're not big enough.

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,980
You're not fast enough.
And you know why that is.

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,540
Cause you never went to a country that
was bigger and stronger and force them to

45
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,910
come over here and do all the hard shit.

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,540
See what you guys did was you fucking
went to where they lived and you tried to

47
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:03,110
fucking build a castle over there.
Stupid, stupid fucking move.

48
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:06,820
Or what happened? You lost all
of it. So what do you do now?

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,790
Do you own up to it and just say,
you know what,

50
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,540
America's better at pressing the
world right now than we are now.

51
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,580
Okay?

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,960
You don't man up and say that.

53
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,250
You send me Cunty fucking
emails about a Goddamn game.

54
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,360
I've told you from the very beginning,

55
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,000
rugby plays is the toughest sons of
bitches. You know the tough, you know,

56
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,790
great fucking game.
I really enjoy it.

57
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,283
Okay,

58
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,150
well let's not pretend then of Leon let
right now rolled off the fucking couch

59
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,070
and decide to run down the fucking pitch
and some short shorts that, you know,

60
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,780
those guys wouldn't be falling over
on their backs. They would, I'm sorry.

61
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,870
It's bigger. It's stronger. Faster.

62
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,240
Yeah.

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,970
Hence, you know, and then you put a
helmet on. Now you've got a weapon.

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,530
That's all it is. It protects your
skull, but you fucking brains going.

65
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,360
What do you think they are? That
fucking thing. And next thing you know,

66
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,530
you're on the roof of your house when
you're 40 years old shooting at mall cops.

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,320
That's what happens to our retired
players. What do you guys do?

68
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,133
Huh?

69
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,110
Fucking get your ears fixed.

70
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,190
Okay.

71
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,890
Finally get that Wedgie taken out of
your ass. I don't know what you do.

72
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,050
Wait, when you retire as a
rugby player. I'm sorry people.

73
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,430
I'm a little grumpy right now.

74
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,470
Okay.

75
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,480
All right. Um, I finished
my, uh, my acting Gig,

76
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,200
my big song and dance number down there.
I'd like to thank Mike binder.

77
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,770
They've given me a shot on that thing.
Um,

78
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,110
okay.

79
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,550
And the second I was done.

80
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,040
Okay.

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,840
I ended up going up to Boston before I
came home because I had a Gig at the, uh,

82
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,003
the MGM.

83
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,330
Yeah.

84
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,150
Mgm Casino there in Connecticut,
not in Las Vegas.

85
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,540
I played the one in Connecticut, which
is like going to the University of Miami,

86
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,374
Ohio.

87
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,680
No kidding.

88
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,860
It was a great gig and I want to thank
everybody who showed up and everything

89
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:09,580
and I was in a fucking grumpy
mood when I came out on that one.

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,280
Okay.

91
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,820
I started shitting on Paul Versey. I
was going off on the traffic. I've just,

92
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,700
I just, I just really needed to
go home and have a fudge it call,

93
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,950
you know,
some conference.

94
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,130
I don't know what the fuck I
need and I'm still all wound up.

95
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,320
Okay.

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,820
Ah, fuck. Where the hell did this
fucking year ago? I got to tell you this,

97
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:33,270
I lost my shit. I know. I
started to tell someone, Oh,

98
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:36,820
both fish and I'll get back to that.
Remind me,

99
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,930
remind me to get back to
the bow fishing thing. Um,

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,890
yeah,

101
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,760
I forgot what the fuck I was just
going to talk about the, the traffic.

102
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,820
Yeah.

103
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,900
My fucking brain moves in a straight
line of very slow but it fucking line.

104
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:56,280
But it is a straight line. If I miss the
exit, it just keeps going and I can't,

105
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:58,840
I can't turn.
Um,

106
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,800
okay.

107
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,680
See it made me fucking forget the traffic.

108
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:03,880
Yeah.

109
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,580
I lost my shit like three fucking times
when I was up in Boston. All right.

110
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,670
I fucking hate that city now. I
love it. I love the sports teams,

111
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:17,510
but I hate that fucking city because you
land in it and the first thing you go,

112
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,710
you drive into is that big dig,
which is the biggest fucking scam

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,570
I did ever perpetrated when it comes
to fucking transportation. Jesus.

114
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,730
Talk my way out of that one, didn't I?
I didn't know where to go with that.

115
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:34,630
How the fuck do you shit on a highway?
These fucking assholes.

116
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,520
They just took everything. They put it
on the ground. They made it all one lane.

117
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:41,200
Everything's fucking one lane.

118
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,180
I don't know if there were anticipating
some, some plague or something.

119
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:52,200
I don't know what. But that thing like
this should just be like model t's out.

120
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:55,950
Oh God. Driving around that fucking
thing. They didn't add any lanes.

121
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,890
Every time I go in there, the
whole fucking thing. Shut down.

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,690
They got the Ted Williams tunnel.

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,080
You know what they should have outside
the head. Ted, Ted Williams tunnel.

124
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,160
They should have his head upside
down on a tuna can, you know,

125
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,290
like made out of concrete and tribute
to and then sell his family that we're

126
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,320
going to fucking leave that up there
until you give that man the proper burial

127
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:17,540
that he fucking deserves.

128
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,050
Okay.

129
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,560
So anyways,

130
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,560
you're going to fucking teddy ballgame
tunnel and there is enough room for like

131
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:28,570
five fucking lanes and there's only
two. And then there's this, this,

132
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,070
I don't know what this
bike lane for the obese,

133
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,950
what is the fucking e?
It's never opened.

134
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,340
And then the other one always
has cones on it. Sorry.

135
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,230
I've gone there like three
times his fucking year.

136
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,560
And no matter what time I drive in and
that this fucking traffic because of that

137
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:47,760
Shit, oh, I'm in a mood. I am
in a mood people, I admit it.

138
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:49,630
Okay.

139
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,520
And here's another thing.
I'm driving down to my Gig,

140
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,390
going down to the fucking MGM thing there.
Mgm Miami,

141
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:00,070
Ohio Gig that I had and I'm fucking
two 30 on a Friday afternoon,

142
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,160
should be wide open bumper to bumper,
fucking traffic,

143
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,140
you know, bumper to bumper, fucking
traffic. And I, it got to the point,

144
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,800
I literally wanted to roll down the
window and just an ask the guy next to me,

145
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,570
just be like, where the fuck are
you going? Don't you have a job?

146
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,190
Are you also a comedian? You know, are
you, do you work the fucking night shift?

147
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:25,480
Please tell me you're actually driving
a job and you're not just out here to be

148
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:26,314
out here.

149
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,560
Fucking come back from the MGM thing.

150
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,910
I get myself for fucking hours
to get up to Logan Airport. No,

151
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:38,010
three hours to get up to
fucking Logan Airport.

152
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,960
So I'd have a two hour fucking window

153
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,200
to get to my goddamn plane and I and
I ended up getting in bumper to bumper

154
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:45,621
traffic.

155
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:49,580
The second I get near the South Shore
Plaza bumper to fucking bumper traffic.

156
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,310
It's like 1230 in the
afternoon on a Saturday.

157
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,040
And where the,
where the fuck,

158
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,810
what of those fucking idiots sat
in traffic Monday through Friday?

159
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,510
Did are they,
do they like sitting in traffic?

160
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,580
It actually made me
look up the population.

161
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:11,090
I was like his is the population
exploding in this country because I didn't

162
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:12,500
think it was,
we were doing that bed.

163
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,040
I started doing the road hardcore around
97 98 we had about 267 million people

164
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,720
would just say to 68 okay.

165
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,040
Before I get some country email from
somebody who works from the Census and now

166
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,550
we're up to 313.9 so
we'll call that three 14

167
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,750
all right. So what's said no,
Jesus is going to do some math.

168
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,300
That's 32 million plus 14 million.

169
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,790
That's 46 million people
spread out over 50 states.

170
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,860
I don't fucking know if that's the
problem with white boy. I'll tell you,

171
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:43,910
they're all out on the highway.

172
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,680
It's almost worth being president,
you know,

173
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,780
just so you don't have to
sit and fucking traffic.

174
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:56,640
It's almost worth just
becoming an absolute yes men
and signing off on shit like

175
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:00,360
spying on American people,
being able to put American citizens,

176
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:03,750
citizens in jail indefinitely without
a fucking trial just because you think

177
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:08,720
they're a fucking terrorist. It's almost
worth doing that. You know, Jesse,

178
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,950
you don't have to sit in the traffic.

179
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,570
Maybe I'll just get like
a helicopter license.

180
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,310
I'll get one of those little
two seater once, you know,

181
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,510
basically the smart car of uh,
air travel

182
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,690
did. They, did they,

183
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,670
there's a lot of flat fucking things out
there that you can land on structures

184
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,260
and what are people going to do if you
land on their roof and just repelled down,

185
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,870
willing to call a tow truck.
Hey, you can't leave it to,

186
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,770
I just did.
We'll be back at 20 minutes.

187
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,560
You don't even know who the
fuck the call about this.

188
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,040
We're going to call the cops.

189
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,280
You got to stay in here with your hands
on your hips there. That is a helicopter,

190
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,980
you know. Well fucking keep it. I don't
give a shit. I'll get another one.

191
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,730
All right. Costs me 400 bucks. Look at it.

192
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,993
MMM.

193
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,440
And I'm sorry,
this is just all,

194
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,060
this is what being away from
your shit for a month, dusty.

195
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,700
And then you come home and you have
a mountain of junk mail. You know,

196
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:18,580
I realized that my mail,
nobody sends me anything nice.

197
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,090
I don't get one fucking, hey,
just thinking about, yeah,

198
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,300
I guess that's emails now, you know,
back in the day when somebody would just,

199
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:33,190
you know, cause you couldn't call him,
had to have some fucking jerk off.

200
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:36,970
Right? A pony with the Goddamn, I
didn't ride a pony. Rode a horse.

201
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,790
Why did they call it the Pony Express?
And I would tell you guys,

202
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,920
when I was a kid,
I thought a pony was a little horse.

203
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,770
And eventually it grew into a horse.

204
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,490
So he's fucking people down the
street at a pony. It was ridiculous.

205
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:51,400
He had it tied up to the back of their
house. I don't think they had a fence.

206
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,970
Fucking, I'll maybe the little bit of
offense listening, just stood there.

207
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,540
Okay.

208
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,570
With drive and buy the thing for years.
And I finally looked over at my mother.

209
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:03,380
I'm just like, I'm like one of one, does
that pony going to turn into a horse?

210
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,260
She just sort of looked at me,
you know,

211
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,770
I didn't realize that look when I was
a kid, but I realize it now where's,

212
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,613
she just was like,

213
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,060
okay.

214
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,920
She was literally looking at me like,

215
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,800
who did I meet with that, that d that
came out of me and just asked me that.

216
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,860
Oh Shit.

217
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,200
Anyways, so I want to thank
everybody who came out to, uh,

218
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,980
the MGM and, uh, Connecticut,

219
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:39,050
wherever the Hell I was
fucking beautiful out there.

220
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,880
That's the one thing I do like.

221
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,500
And then one thing I really do miss
about living out here in La is a,

222
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:49,070
I miss all those trees and the lakes.
I love that shit.

223
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,370
Okay.

224
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,203
You know,

225
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm gonna be one of those douchebags at
fucking sells his house here in the city

226
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:57,300
and just goes out and gets a ranch kid.

227
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:01,020
Even fucking change a light bulb
by the whole outfit, you know?

228
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,570
Okay.

229
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,400
Big stupid cowboy, handsome chaps getting
in and out in and out of my prayers,

230
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,650
you know? No, I can drive my
old truck. That's what I do now.

231
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,420
Before I went in town to get provisions,

232
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:17,270
I just roll around in the dark to make
it look like I was actually out doing

233
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:18,104
something.

234
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,173
Okay.

235
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,260
Oh Christ. Um, anyways,
oh, you know what? Let's,

236
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:30,860
let's bang out lumps, bang out a
little fucking a shit. Wait, no, Nada.

237
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:34,160
You know what? I started talking about
the bowl fishing. Let's, let's finish it.

238
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:35,420
So my last night there,

239
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,220
I get invited out to go fishing and uh,

240
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,250
I was just like, yeah, I'll fucking do
that. Shoot fish with a bow and arrow.

241
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,790
I have, I don't know how to do that,
but I would like to know how to do it.

242
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,490
Why not? Right? So we
fucking go out there.

243
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,040
It's like a group of,
uh,

244
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,790
four and we meet these
guys at a gas station.

245
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:07,580
You got to get a fishing license
and all this shit. And uh, you know,

246
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,520
I got a six pack of Budweiser. I mean,
you're getting on a boat. I mean,

247
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:14,240
you have to, where I'm from, you have
to do that. If you're getting on a boat,

248
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:17,270
you have to have a six pack of something
and you've got to drink it or else

249
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:20,900
you're an asshole. So I got it.
And one of the guys is like, dude,

250
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,070
you're going to have a weapon.

251
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,600
Okay.

252
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,051
It's like,
yeah,

253
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:28,010
well I'm not gonna be pointing it at
you or me pointed at the fish. Let's,

254
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:31,220
let's try to make this a
little sporting here. You know?

255
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,200
Good. It's not like I'm taking a stick
like Tom Hanks in that fucking movie.

256
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:41,990
What he talked to the soccer
ball cast away. Well, sad, right?

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,940
Did we went out on this
fan vote? Yay. Nay.

258
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,450
All the way out in the fucking buy you,
it was terrifying.

259
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,790
It was fucking to second we got out
there was, because we did it at night.

260
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,850
It was a full moon was the shit,
you know what I kept thinking of,

261
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:58,160
you know that movie southern
comfort with powers booth.

262
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,240
That's what I thought about and I've
felt good that I was thinking about that.

263
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,910
Not Deliverance cause I feel like
that's Hacky at this point. You know,

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,050
one fat pasty dude gets banged in the
ass in the woods and nobody can remember

265
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:13,090
southern comfort after that.
It's fucking ridiculous.

266
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,080
I think it's high time that
stops. All right. So anyways,

267
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,663
um,

268
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:19,850
okay.

269
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,750
It was, it was, it was amazing.
Basically when you both fish,

270
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,770
I don't know, I don't know
where to even begin this shit.

271
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:29,150
The guy had like a flashlight,

272
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,810
one of these born in the by you guys
and he go right there, right there,

273
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:33,141
right there,

274
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:38,000
right there to the bone arrows
trying to shoot some fish.

275
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:39,380
That was this fucking chilling out.

276
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,220
And uh,

277
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,840
basically what you do is,
is you shoot wherever you,

278
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,720
wherever the fish looks like it is,

279
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:51,380
you shoot like five inches below
it because it's an illusion man.

280
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:56,120
Cause a little water. So it took a
little bit of time to get to use that.

281
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,480
So what I did was I started aiming it all
these small fish just bring in the bow

282
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,840
up cause I realized I was just shooting,
I wasn't aiming,

283
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,990
I was just kind of shooting in the
general direction. I kept missing.

284
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,750
So I was practicing on the little fish.
I didn't shoot at him.

285
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:13,100
I would just bring it up just to get the
muscle memory and a, I did all right.

286
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,770
I hit, I hit three and about, um,

287
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,030
three hours average, like one an hour.
It was a lot of looking for them.

288
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,870
I'm not going to lie yet, so I wasn't
that bad, but I missed a lot. Yeah.

289
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,673
MMM.

290
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,370
But I got three including one.

291
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,080
We fucking pull this thing in and it was,
uh,

292
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,150
had an alligator face and the back look
like an eel is call an alligator gar.

293
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,290
The thing looked beyond evil,
look like a fucking dinosaur.

294
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,320
And we got in a boat and they're like,
all right, watch out. Watch your feet.

295
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,990
Don't let it bite you. Don't let it bite
you and all that shit. And he's like,

296
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:51,930
dude, you got to get a picture with
that. You got blood on your face.

297
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:54,330
It looks fucking awesome. Everybody's
saying all this shit. You know,

298
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,060
I got to tell you,
you tap into that inner fucking caveman.

299
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,100
Cause when I went out there,

300
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,110
I immediately had this sinking feeling
like I can't go back to fucking the

301
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:09,111
village without bringing home
something to eat that's still in me.

302
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,930
And the village was my fucking hotel
room where I have room service.

303
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,890
It was fucking stupid.

304
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,790
But I literally felt that I don't want
to be the guy that doesn't fucking get

305
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,570
something. So anyways, it's
now feeling like a fucking man,

306
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:26,550
cause I killed this God damn thing.
And uh, I dunno. So I'm like,

307
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:27,780
all right, so what do
we do where, you know,

308
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,840
we killed a bunch of fish and I asked the
guy, go, can you, you guys are going to,

309
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,340
you know,
clean these things.

310
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,400
You put the fucking meet on ice or some
shit and ship it to me and the guys just

311
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:39,510
like, yeah, no,

312
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,783
Nah.

313
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,190
So then I was like, well, what the
fuck would you Saudia killin shit.

314
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:52,980
And it just kind of bugged me.
Oh No. What's going on here?

315
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,960
How come I'm not getting
any readings here?

316
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,940
Yeah,

317
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,340
I think it's recording. What the
fuck is going on with my mixer? Oh,

318
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,310
was it just saying it's really loud. What
is this? What is this? Come on. Come on.

319
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,570
Talk to me.
Talk to me.

320
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,710
What's wrong with my
mixer at Jesus Christ?

321
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,710
Now I gotta I gotta shut this off.
I'm going to splice this together.

322
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,900
You're not going to notice, but I gotta
make sure I'm recording here. Hang on.

323
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,940
All right, so it was recording and I'm,
what the fuck's going on with the mixer?

324
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:26,260
What did I do? What did I do too?
It gives a shit. So anyway, so yeah,

325
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,740
so at that point I was like, all right,
well I killed three of these things.

326
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,400
The other two that I shut, they will
fucking beautiful. Really thick.

327
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,740
And I was like, you know, if
I'm going to kill these things,

328
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:39,460
I want to fucking eat it. I just want to
be putting holes in shit. But I anyways,

329
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:44,440
the, I guess that alligator Gar think
can survive out of the water for a couple

330
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,410
hours. So we were able to put that one
back or they said they were going to,

331
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:50,290
so I don't know. That's the only
part I didn't like. Other than that,

332
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:55,210
it was fucking great and uh, yeah, it
felt like it was in like a Mad Max movie.

333
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,500
Thoroughly enjoy it. Just next time I
do it, I only want to kill like one,

334
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,000
you know, or killed like two
or three and then fucking

335
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,670
okay,

336
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,580
clean up, take it in, fucking eat it
for the week. Does that make sense?

337
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,550
That's how it made me feel bad was I went
home and I looked up the alligator Gar

338
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:18,410
and I was waiting for it to be out of
the most vicious fucking alligator eel

339
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,430
this side of the fucking Mississippi,
Yada Yada. And they did, it was just like,

340
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:25,910
yeah, it's kind of, it's
very docile if it sees you,

341
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:29,540
it's shy and swims away.
I was like, Oh man,

342
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,780
I shot a fucking nerd,
an ugly nerd fish with an arrow.

343
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,150
And I judged it because of its face.
Like it was evil, you know? I don't know.

344
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,810
Okay.

345
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,910
The people I went with, they
also hunt wild pigs. That's,

346
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,680
that's something else I could shoot.
I could shoot a fucking pig dear.

347
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,860
I couldn't do that. Who's kidding?
Who? If I was starving I could do it.

348
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,963
You know,

349
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,630
she would have fucking cat if
I was hungry. Hungry enough.

350
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,250
Does anything I learned from reading
that fucking book fly boys and no,

351
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:04,660
that's not about a boy band.

352
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,430
Okay.

353
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,300
You know what's up Brooklyn?
We are flow.

354
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,230
I'm sorry,
I saw the vms were on tonight.

355
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,180
What's the deal with venues?
I know a lot of people say this,

356
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:22,840
but doesn't MTV have a lot of fucking
balls? They don't show videos,

357
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:25,620
but they still have their
video music awards. You know,

358
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,130
I know that's completely hacky, but
like I actually saw some of the videos,

359
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:32,890
I'm like, he's a fucking great
videos. I wish they would show them.

360
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,640
Where can I see these? How do I know
this music is out? Where do I go now?

361
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,200
Can anybody help me? Oh,
Kenya. Um, all right,

362
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:45,520
let's do a little bit of advertising
here for this week, everybody. All right.

363
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:48,130
Dollar Shave Club.
Darla,

364
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,000
there are so many things in
the world that irritate me.

365
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,530
Traffic at two 30 in the afternoon
on a Saturday or a Friday.

366
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,900
You know, stewardesses who just
love talking on that microphone.

367
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,450
We want to thank you for flying. American
Airlines are flying time two days,

368
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,890
three hours, 22 minutes and 18 seconds.
He's going to be a time different.

369
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:17,840
Shut up lady.
Um,

370
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,150
when so many things can irritate you.

371
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,290
Why add razors to the list that
doesn't make any sense, does it?

372
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,960
It's time to stop
milking your razor blade.

373
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,990
Everybody I know with brand name razors,

374
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,040
you're used to paying outrageous prices
and exhausting those raises until they

375
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,240
start to look like rusty soda cans
and start carving up your face there.

376
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,180
It's time to move on.
Move on to a better world.

377
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:45,080
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing
quality blades to your door for just a few

378
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:49,340
bucks a month. Everybody never think
about it again. They send a pack,

379
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,410
they send a pack every so you can change
your blades every week. That's not me.

380
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,300
That's missing a thing.
They send you a pack every month,

381
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,480
I guess is what it's supposed to be.
So you can change your blades every week.

382
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,330
I love these guys and your
face will love them too. Uh,

383
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,130
they also got a brand new
product called one wipe Charlies.

384
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,430
You know,
if that line was in the movie platoon,

385
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:21,160
that would probably be really
offensive. Way One wipe Charlie. Um,

386
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,690
it's a buttwipe for men.
What?

387
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,980
Okay.

388
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,820
And it's classic. Check out the
video for that. There's no way.

389
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,120
There's no way that's
true. No Way. That's true.

390
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,670
They got a new book. I hope it's
true. One one wipe Charlies.

391
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,100
It's a buttwipe for men.
What about women?

392
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,340
They supposed to walk around with a
stinky ass or you trying to say that they

393
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:49,170
wipe their ass is better. Oh my
God, the sky is falling anyways.

394
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:51,780
I guess they're classy.
Check out the video for that.

Okay.

453
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,550
That's not bad. Right?
That's a good skill to have.

454
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,170
One of the dollar collapses and I'm
out here in the desert with no lakes.

455
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,520
Well I can modify it then.

456
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,650
You know what the fuck would I shoot?
What can you shoot? That's not a fish,

457
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:21,330
but it's like a fish and it's out of the
water. I know a toddler. There you go.

458
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,290
And you know what? I wouldn't be
killing more than I was going to eat.

459
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:29,310
I'd only take one. Bill. Why are
you talking about cannibalism?

460
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,570
Cause I just read an amazing
book called fly boys. Uh,

461
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,780
Jesus Christ. What a book,
what a fucking book that was.

462
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,740
It's unreal. Everybody has done
horrific things around the planet.

463
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:45,540
Like right now how we
sit and they're given a,

464
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,000
yeah,

465
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,040
the powers that be shit over
there in Syria, Damascus,

466
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,660
whatever the fuck it is for
possible using chemical weapons.

467
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,923
I Dunno,

468
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,080
some of the Shit we've done.
We got a lot of fucking nerve.

469
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,970
Yeah.

470
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,750
Is this thing recording? What is with
my God damn electronics this week?

471
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,410
And I know, you know what bells
stop blaming the technology.
Why don't you man up?

472
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,870
Um, yeah, you gotta read this book.

473
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:15,871
It's really just balanced and it just
shows the fucking horrific shit that

474
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,750
basically the, uh, the the Americans
did and the Japanese did to each other.

475
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,920
And then also the unbelievable
heroic stuff that they did.

476
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,690
The whole God damn thing,
every color of the rainbow. Um,

477
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,240
I don't know how to talk about it
without fucking ruining the book.

478
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,253
MMM.

479
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,380
I Dunno, it, it just, uh, I can tell
you one fucking stories can help.

480
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,380
Douchebags aren't going to read it.

481
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,520
If you listen to this podcast is no way
you read. I'll tell you one quick story.

482
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:48,930
All right.
This will probably take two minutes.

483
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,560
If you want to fucking fast forward.
They're going into bond.

484
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,350
This god Damn Island shaped
like a horse shoe, right?

485
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,750
And the thing is, is what? They're
bombing. All right. He's right in the,

486
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:05,170
uh, like, you know, you know what a horse
shoe looks like, right? Sure. We all do.

487
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,940
We all have a fucking crazy uncle. It has
a horse, don't you? Or a pony. All right.

488
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:11,020
The bottom of the horse shoe,

489
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:14,680
not the two ends with a luck runs out
if he's hanging upside down right there.

490
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:17,440
Like you're going around the going around
the corner, right, right down there.

491
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,200
What part of the Horse Shoe was
that called? You know, it's funny.

492
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,260
People do crossword puzzles. Know what
that part of the horse shoes called.

493
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,310
Anyways,
that part down there,

494
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,340
like if you're pouring water into a
way where would gather we got it Phil.

495
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,290
That's where the fucking
radio station was.

496
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:35,640
And they had to basically fly right
into it. All right. But on the sides,

497
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,230
that's where the mountains were.

498
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,190
They were actually above where
the airplanes will, they'll just,

499
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,250
the mountains on the sides were so high
up and these guys had to come and so low

500
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:49,251
that the antiaircraft fire was coming
down on them and these guys had to have

501
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:54,870
the fucking balls. 20 years
old, 1920 years old to fly
in there and just be like,

502
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:59,310
well, they're not going to get me. The
other guys got to get it and no one full.

503
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:03,450
Well that if they got caught, they were
going to get fucking tortured and just,

504
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,340
they basically told them
to keep one in the chamber.

505
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,590
It just fucking blow your brains out
because if these guys catch you after the

506
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:15,120
Shit you've done, um, you
know, because once, once, once,

507
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,210
once airplanes got involved,
uh,

508
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:22,560
I guess way more civilian started to get
killed. And I know that sounds obvious,

509
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,090
but like I never really
thought about that.

510
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,300
I thought back in the day like
the revolutionary wars. I mean,

511
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,140
I thought people just,
you know,

512
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,720
just indiscriminately raped and
pillaged and went all the way around.

513
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,400
I guess she could, but uh, you had
to be a man about it, you know? Yeah.

514
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,810
He kicked open the door,
you know,

515
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:41,470
kill a couple of males and then tackle
somebody in a house coat, you know,

516
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:44,980
all kinds of scratches. Do
you face? I mean, yeah, you
fucking got, you got dirty,

517
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,510
you got dirty back in the day. Then all
of a sudden the advent of the air, Ariel,

518
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,400
Ariel type plane there,
right.

519
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,190
This does this sound as dumb
as it sounds to me out loud.

520
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,910
They fuckin you could just fly over,
you know.

521
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,650
Okay,

522
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,780
you're trying to hit a
warehouse yet a house.

523
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,080
You blow up a couple of babies and stupid,
they fucking hated these pilots.

524
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,490
They thought they were cow, that,
that thought they would devils and uh,

525
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,070
so they didn't want to
get caught or whatever.

526
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:17,071
So this fucking guy is
flying in antiaircraft fire
comes in the flack as what

527
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,320
they call it,
fleck.

528
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,490
That's what I call my boss would give
me shit for not unloading a truck quick

529
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,340
enough. That's what I called
flack. At 20 years of age,

530
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,590
these guys had such big balls,

531
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:33,210
that's what they call people trying to
shoot down the fucking airplane they were

532
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:33,940
in.

533
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,940
So it's basically like softball size holes
that go on through this guy's fucking

534
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,480
wings and he loses it and
he goes into his spin.

535
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,310
So he tells the two guys in the
back that they got to bail out to,

536
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:51,890
he's got to do this move
where he brings up like the,

537
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,950
the the fucking flap on the right wing
and then something with the Rodrigo.

538
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,400
They basically causes the plane to kind
of go sideways and it gives these guys a

539
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,820
chance to open the door in the
back because if they couldn't,

540
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,420
the air pressure would like hold it tight.

541
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,740
So the guys doing this move as the front
of his plane is on fire and the flames

542
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:13,480
a lap and at his feet he's doing this
maneuver so his buddies can get out and it

543
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:17,620
works. Both his buddies jump
out and now the fucking plane,

544
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:20,500
it's almost going to hit the
goddamn water. It's in a flat spin.

545
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,530
This guy takes off his seatbelt,
he's still fighting it.

546
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,410
You take the seatbelt off,
that's the last thing you get out.

547
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,560
And at the last second he catches it and
he comes out of the spin raw and goes

548
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,980
up and then he looks back,

549
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:38,490
seen as two buddies fucking landing in
the water and they're going to swim and

550
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:41,820
get taken prisoner by the Japanese.
And the guy was completely

551
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,920
okay.

552
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,640
You couldn't eat.

553
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Unconsolable landed on the
aircraft carrier was just balling.

554
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Just all he could say over and over
again was I took my seatbelt off,

555
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:57,950
meaning I was going to bail out. It was
just, you know, it's just fucking, I,

556
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,900
I butchered that story. Just imagine
someone who could actually write,

557
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,350
telling you that story.
It's a fucking unbelievable book.

558
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,360
It'll make you a better person
when you read it. And, um,

559
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,820
Jesus Christ,
I,

560
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,660
I think I'm going to read a whole bunch
of books on World War Two, no spin and in

561
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,740
and, and like the, uh,
the part of the war.

562
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,550
I wanted to say specifically the Pacific
Ocean and I just don't feel those words

563
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:25,660
go,
go together well.

564
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:27,240
Okay.

565
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,880
Particularly the Pacific Ocean part of
it, cause I, all that shit. Okinawa.

566
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,090
He would g might,
I don't know where any of that shit was.

567
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,960
They had a map and everything. You
don't dummy like me. Actually it was,

568
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:37,794
it was really,

569
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,180
if

570
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,390
it's all going to be a book like that
where they show the dirt on both sides.

571
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:44,650
That's the kind of shit that I like.

572
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay.

573
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,560
Just fire bombing cities.
This is fucking unreal.

574
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,013
You know,

575
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,230
you basically on both sides in a war,

576
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,450
if she got war criminals and then whoever
wins gets to prosecute the other one

577
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:03,790
going,
how could you be such a piece of shit?

578
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,830
And everybody kind of did the same shit.

579
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,520
Okay.

580
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,241
That's what I was saying.

581
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,790
The bow and arrows with the babies
basically when shit goes down,

582
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,640
like babies die.
It's unavoidable.

583
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,740
Does this make any sense?
It's this fucking horrific.

584
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,120
I'm like 300 pages down this fucking road
and you guys haven't read the book yet,

585
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,430
so you probably looking
at me like I'm a maniac.

586
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:26,050
Why the fuck is it so hot in here?

587
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,193
MMM.

588
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,540
Anyways, hopefully I'm able to get
this podcast up on time. You know,

589
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:38,070
last week I recorded it on time and
there was something going on with the God

590
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:42,000
damn recording. Wow. Who's
kidding? Who? You know what
that something was? It was me.

591
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,940
So I actually recorded it on Sunday and
still couldn't get it up until fucking

592
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:49,590
Monday afternoon. I'm the worst. All
right. What have we talked about? Oh yeah.

593
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:52,190
So I started reading up on all
this, this stuff about the, uh, the,

594
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,690
the war with the Japanese and shit.
And I didn't realize,

595
00:33:54,691 --> 00:33:56,160
do you know that was like three guys,

596
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,840
three Japanese soldiers that
didn't surrender until 1974.

597
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,390
One of them wasn't aware that the war
wasn't over. We'll call him a bill.

598
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,110
That's some shit I would
have done. Uh, the other,

599
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:15,720
other two guys knew the war
was over, but they will, like,

600
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:20,160
I'm not fucking standard down until the,
the fucking Grand Poobah tells me too,

601
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:22,200
cause that's what I was told when I went.
They just were like,

602
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:25,290
Dudley do right's these fucking maniacs.

603
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:26,640
Okay.

604
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,590
Stayed in the woods for an
extra 30 years in their uniform.

605
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,380
Their guns still work. They still in
ammunition. Well of course you did.

606
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:37,230
The fucking war is over.
And every once in a while they'd run it,

607
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:39,670
some local fishermen and
they take shots at them,

608
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,810
local fishermen. It was just
like, come on man, let it go,

609
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:47,830
man.
It's over.

610
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,830
They would drop leaflets in there and
they were reading them and they thought it

611
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:51,664
was a trick.

612
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,263
Yeah.

613
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,190
Oh my God. Just sitting out there fucking
eat and squirrels for 30 goddamn years.

614
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,030
Yeah. Best friends like
are they gonna fucking Huh.

615
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,400
Okay.

616
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,090
What, what, what'd you
be friends without there?

617
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,570
Yeah.

618
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:07,841
I don't know.

619
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:11,290
I'll give you the link to that shit
before it just butcher it anymore. Um,

620
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,170
if anybody else knows any really good
books about World War II where it's really

621
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:15,004
balanced.

622
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,913
MMM.

623
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,420
Cause I read a few, I read
this one. That was great. Uh,

624
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,360
I read the rape and Nan
King along time ago.

625
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,890
I read this Hiroshima diary about this
guy who was in that city when the bomb

626
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:29,104
hit.

627
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,800
Uh,

628
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,430
I ran another one. I like those first
part. Like people who were there.

629
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,110
I read one one time about

630
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,720
this Jewish kid who was
on the run with his dad.

631
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,620
It's a classic too. I forgot what the
fuck was called. I'm such an idiot.

632
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,800
But at one point he was kind of looking
at his dad and he was just like,

633
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:53,250
just die already. Cause he was, I dunno,
it was slowing them down or something.

634
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,030
He has his guilt about that. She
was fucking unreal. Actually.

635
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:01,650
It's Kinda depressing when you think about
it, but I'm out too. It gives a shit.

636
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,040
Hey, I got all caught up and breaking
bed. I didn't have AMC my hotel.

637
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:08,910
So why I came here just binge watched
all fucking three of them. Jesus Christ.

638
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,210
Is that the greatest fucking show ever?
I don't want to over hype it, but uh,

639
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,323
yeah,

640
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,140
fucking insane. I'm not going to
talk about, I know I shouldn't.

641
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:20,610
I should have said right
out of the back then.

642
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,850
I'm not going to say anything
that happens in them, but um,

643
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,300
I didn't think anything
was going to beat the wire.

644
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,270
I guess I put them on par because the
wire, just the size of the subject.

645
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,310
And how many different
angles they hit it from.

646
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,500
But as far as keeping your
stomach and absolute fucking nuts,

647
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:46,440
uh, I don't know if I ever saw a
show like, like this one man. Um,

648
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,290
it's kind of funny cause I always have
like quick little scenes of him and

649
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,810
that's all they would ever give
me is just like the little scene.

650
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,060
So I don't know what,
I don't know what's going on,

651
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,780
which is kind of perfect because
my character doesn't need to know,

652
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,600
doesn't need to know what is
going on and wouldn't know. Right.

653
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,160
Saw would just call me up and say,
just fucking do this. And I'd be like,

654
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:06,994
all right.

655
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,670
So I always end up watching
the episodes. I'm like, oh,

656
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,590
that's what the fuck that was for.

657
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:22,110
Um, that happened this week.
All right. So anyways, hey,

658
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:26,430
I'll put the red sox are coming out
to la, beat the fucking dog. Just,

659
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,280
I would've loved to go
into a game down there and,

660
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,420
and not war any red sock shit because
fucking la fans are such fucking

661
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,740
psychopaths. Well, maybe they actually,

662
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:40,770
maybe they wouldn't have beaten me
because I wasn't there with my children.

663
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:47,080
Fucking pieces of shit.
Good God Almighty.

664
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,280
You know I wanna know what the fuck you
want to know what happened out here.

665
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,230
I don't get it.
I don't get why that's that extra level,

666
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:00,940
that gang bang or vibe is out here.
There's gangs every fucking city.

667
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,510
Okay.

668
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:06,890
Are these like in la? I like these. The
only our southern California is just say,

669
00:38:06,891 --> 00:38:08,990
cause I felt that vibe
at a charges game too.

670
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,210
Like is this like the only part of the
country where gang or into like sports

671
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:15,044
too.

672
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,903
You know,

673
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,360
you think he gets some hard, looks at a
fucking next, game it down everybody's,

674
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:22,410
they're having a good time.

675
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,600
Okay.

676
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,800
I don't understand it. They're going to
have something to do with neck tattoos.

677
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,590
Why don't you get the neck tattoo?

678
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,410
I say it was fucked up
when I was in New Orleans.

679
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:39,411
I saw two guys face tattoos
and I couldn't believe how uh,

680
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:41,690
okay.

681
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,250
Unshocking they were at this point.

682
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,350
I've seen so many people with
face tattoos at this point.

683
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:48,530
This guy literally had one right in the
middle of his forehead and it wasn't a

684
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:52,820
good one.
You know,

685
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,490
Jesus Christ. I thought I was dedicated
to being a comedian or whatever.

686
00:38:57,491 --> 00:39:02,230
You put a tattoo on your face.
I mean that you've limited yourself to

687
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,170
I get either working in a tattoo
parlor or doing just illegal shit.

688
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,440
Right. That's kind of a good way, you
know, if you ever think that you don't,

689
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:17,940
you don't, you don't have the
balls to stop following the heard.

690
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:20,760
Just get a nice, you know what?
Don't do it. Don't, don't do it.

691
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,360
I don't want to suggest to you get a
fucking face tattoo. Please don't do that.

692
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,290
Can you? Can you please not do that. Um,

693
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,180
did I mention I was at the
University of Cincinnati last night,

694
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,490
Saturday night by the time he gets it.
So it'll be two nights ago.

695
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:34,380
I want to thank everybody
for having me out there.

696
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,020
What a fucking beautiful school that is.

697
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,270
Okay.

698
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,090
Absolutely gorgeous man.
I love those. Those,

699
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,140
they have like the perfect size football
stadium and it's like built down in it,

700
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:48,680
so into the campus. You know, she
come walking by and it's really open.

701
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:53,390
Like you can just walk right
into it. Um, had that same vibe.

702
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,720
Like when I went down to Florida state,
I like the students can like, you know,

703
00:39:56,721 --> 00:39:59,480
run the stairs if they want to.
I love that shit.

704
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,870
I hate when you go to those places and
they got the stadiums like all locked up.

705
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,410
Um,
I was surprised when I went to Boise.

706
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,350
Okay.

707
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,240
You know, when I was trying
to look at the blue turf,

708
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,360
I saw a little bit of it that,

709
00:40:11,361 --> 00:40:13,960
that the whole stadium was just
locked up like that. I think it boys,

710
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:15,040
he's a cool place.
Right.

711
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,770
What are you worried about
the meth heads coming in,

712
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,900
stealing the aluminum benches? Is that
what it is? It probably is. I don't know.

713
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,000
Oh,
by the way,

714
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,690
I want to thank rolling Stone magazine
for putting me on the cover this month.

715
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,440
It finally happened for me. That
was a, a big moment, my career. Oh,

716
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,720
we'll definitely have a link.

717
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,540
I know a lot of people don't
read magazines at this point,

718
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:40,490
so it's not a big deal,
but it's a big deal to me.

719
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:44,850
Finally being on the cover
of rolling stone. Um,

720
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,390
actually I don't,
I have no idea who that kid is,

721
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:51,930
but if fucking freaked me out
when I saw it. Um, all right.

722
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,710
What am I talking about here?
What do I got here? What am
I going to go to the, uh,

723
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,110
as the straight up it was for you to
fucking read one of these things here.

724
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,210
Why don't we do that?

725
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:07,550
Why don't we read a little fucking
letter full moon. Mr. Barr,

726
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,280
you mentioned something about the full
moon in last week's podcast and I would

727
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:14,720
cause the strange behavior.

728
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,250
I worked in an emergency room for three
to five years and when I started working

729
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:22,760
there, I thought that theory was
bullshit. You actually said both.

730
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,970
I don't want to make this guy
sound crass. He goes, I now know,

731
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,750
I now know what to be true. Every
month during the week of the full moon,

732
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:32,570
we get a surge of patients other than the

733
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,170
plethora of fatties that clog our
department. He spelled it plethora.

734
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,900
Uh, we get Weirdos, example,

735
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:46,901
a one legged schizophrenia man with a
suitcase of knives in a butane torch.

736
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,190
I don't even,
I don't even know why.

737
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:50,930
Okay.

738
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,120
Other than the other
than the Weirdos though,

739
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:57,200
we have a lot of really sick patients
come in. There are more strokes,

740
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:00,140
heart attacks and other
serious health related issues.

741
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,000
I have recently heard a theory on
why this is from another healthcare

742
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,070
professional. Well thank God you
went in this direction buddy.

743
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,850
Cause I thought half a fucking second.
You were going to put this in my lap.

744
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,230
All right. Cause I have no
clue about any of this shit.

745
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,700
Um, all right. What do
we got here? He goes, I,

746
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,100
I to take a lot of what I hear is fact.
All right.

747
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:26,660
The theory is the theory is this,
even our blood has its own tide.

748
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,510
Yeah.

749
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,060
Jd says Christ,
why don't I read up on science?

750
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:33,790
This is like better than any
fucking movie. Just the truth.

751
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,110
Okay.

752
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,760
What do you mean it has its own tide

753
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,400
when it goes out as does
that when I get lightheaded,

754
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,600
is that what you're
talking about? Uh, he goes,

755
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:46,710
this may be minuscule.

756
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:49,500
I love that you're spelling all these
words wrong and you fucking work in an

757
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:50,970
emergency room.
Uh,

758
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:55,200
but the lunar pole on our bloodstream can
cause a person with health slash heart

759
00:42:55,201 --> 00:42:59,220
problems to be at a higher risk
for stroke slash heart attack.

760
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,420
It can also cause behavioral changes
because of the change in our bodily

761
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:06,540
function and our body function.
Whether this is true or not,

762
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,160
I cannot deny three and a half years
of dealing with hell every week.

763
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,150
The full moon appears. Thanks for the
free imitate entertainment and the lefts.

764
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,310
So that's really interesting.
So like,

765
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:19,900
yeah,

766
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,050
if that's true. So when there's
a full moon, that's like a,

767
00:43:23,051 --> 00:43:27,760
when societies like menstruating,
that's our once a month.

768
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,240
Yeah.

769
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,790
Like everybody just acts
like a fucking maniac,

770
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,370
a one legged schizophrenia with a suitcase
full of knives and a butane torch.

771
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,940
Jesus Christ. Doesn't that
sound? That sounds like,

772
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,920
what the fuck was that movie Mickey
Rourke was in that? Look like a cartoon,

773
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:49,600
but it wasn't. Jessica Alba had the
chaps on and she was a stripper. But you,

774
00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:51,670
she still looked like you
could have her as a girlfriend.

775
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,650
And then there was that guy with the
yellow head and the red eyes for some

776
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:58,630
reason.
Remind me of the guy who played Beretta.

777
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,860
Do you know I saw him when I was out here.
I saw Robert Blake.

778
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,730
That's a hell of a thing.
Ryan to a guy or fucking killed somebody.

779
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,310
Okay.

780
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,940
What did he get off? I Dunno.
He fucking did it. Jesus Christ.

781
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,720
You're going to do a spaghetti Freddy's.
You know,

782
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,220
you got to take a piss and all of a sudden
you girlfriends shot in the head and

783
00:44:18,221 --> 00:44:20,950
nobody saw anything and you found her.
C'Mon.

784
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:26,700
C'Mon Beretta for reals. Come on. Um,

785
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,700
alright. Wisconsin's a rod.
Yo Billy red face. Love the,

786
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,970
and I would love to paint another
picture of the AE rod story. Alright.

787
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,890
My version is with no,
Ryan Braun.

788
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:42,960
I live in Wisconsin where Aaron Rodgers
and the Green Bay packers are basically

789
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:47,670
a gift from God. I am a Chicago
bears fan, so I think basically,

790
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,350
so I think they're all cunts. Sorry,
I'm really reading worse than usual.

791
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,570
Um,
all right.

792
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:59,520
Brian who also got popped for PDS had
opened two restaurants with Aaron Rogers

793
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:04,521
called the eight to 1208 12 [inaudible]
bar and grill since they were both named

794
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:09,510
Mvp and their respective sports. And
I'm gathering that his number is eight.

795
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,350
Is He a baseball player? I
don't watch baseball. Uh,

796
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:17,820
when the news broke about Braun getting
suspended, Wisconsin was enraged.

797
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,290
Not so much that he was cheating or
being the bad image to kids or whatever.

798
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,910
These parents who want to blame mother
the others for the kids' lack of luster

799
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:30,540
or athletic skills,
but because he lied to Aaron Rodgers,

800
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,260
that's fucking awesome.

801
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,480
They're Wisconsin has some great sports
fans and I love the fact that their,

802
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,820
their fan base owns a part of the team.
I where the fuck that works,

803
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,460
even though you know, none of them
are allowed in the board meeting.

804
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,350
It's probably just by name only.

805
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:50,730
And some day they'll realize how
bad they got fleeced. Um, anyways,

806
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,900
in the past month or so when it came
to the news reporting, the reporting,

807
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:58,710
this story, local NBC, ABC,
Fox and CBS affiliates,

808
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:00,540
within 10 seconds into the story,

809
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,130
they talk about lying to Aaron Rodgers
when interviewing fans about it.

810
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:09,720
All they talk about is, I can't believe
he would lie to us and even lie to Aaron.

811
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:14,130
Like everyone knows each
other on a personal level.
People need to quit talking,

812
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:18,090
taking professional sports too
seriously and taking it personally,

813
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,130
especially when they are
multimillionaires. Line to
other multimillionaires.

814
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,540
Google search some of this to get a laugh
at how brainwashed sports fans in my

815
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,900
state are come to show Milwaukee during
the football season to see for herself.

816
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:34,740
I've been up there. It's fucking great.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um,

817
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,340
well look, I mean he,
how did he lie to Aaron?

818
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,090
Yeah,

819
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,270
they got in business together.
You know,

820
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:49,160
it's not like he got on their
football team and then he said,

821
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:52,580
well, you know, I'd like you to join the
packers as long as your steroid free.

822
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,160
They opened a business together.
I don't give a fuck what you do.

823
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,510
Just don't steal from the register.
That would be more lying to Aaron Rogers,

824
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:00,344
right?

825
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,750
Or do you think he actually sat down and
said, well listen, I have a great image.

826
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:07,561
You know,

827
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:11,240
last thing I needed to be doing is
hitching my wagon to some guy who's then

828
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:15,830
going to be a, a, you know, you
know, fucking hookers and uh, uh,

829
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:19,530
but somebody stick a needle in
his death. I, you know what?

830
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:21,480
I've never opened a business
as you can tell. I don't know.

831
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:24,900
I don't know how the interview
process goes, but I don't, yeah,

832
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,400
I don't feel like he'd lied to Erin.

833
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:27,890
Okay.

834
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,560
MMM. Maybe. Maybe they actually came
up with this. Maybe this is a good cop,

835
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:36,100
bad cop thing that don't with
this other guy plays the bad guy.

836
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,260
And then Erin sits at the bar looking
all dejected and the cheese heads walked

837
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:42,910
by and then they come in and they
buy more fucking Mozzarella sticks.

838
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,670
You know that that could happen.
Right?

839
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,770
I don't fucking know who gives a shit.
You know what the fucking thing is?

840
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:54,070
And I'm telling you, I'm pulling a Paul
Versey and I said this three years ago,

841
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,430
within 20 years,
everybody's going to be on steroids.

842
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:02,110
Everyone's going to be on Hgh,
okay? We're all going to be on it.

843
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:07,000
They're going to fucking get it to the
same way we'd is gradually becoming

844
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:10,990
legal. That's what's going to
happen with roids. All right?

845
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:15,100
And now how also if you smoke weed now,
if you have a vaporizer,

846
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,880
you just basically inhaling just
the shit that gets you high.

847
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,823
All right?

848
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,220
So it's doing way less damaged to sitting
down drinking a bunch of Budweiser

849
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,360
like I did on that fan bulb
out in the fucking buy you.

850
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:33,610
They're going to do that with roids. Back
in the day, you did some fucking Roids,

851
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,773
right?

852
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,490
You ball shrunk up and you went and you
punched a horse in the fucking face.

853
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,280
That's what happened. And now
they're, they're way more mellow.

854
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,760
Although fuck Jerry Rameys kids snapped.
I Dunno.

855
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,840
Jesus Christ.
That's another fucking Boston story.

856
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,480
You don't want to, when all these,
all these, uh, stories came out,

857
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,410
all this shit that's happened recently,
how was actually thinking? Well, you know,

858
00:49:00,411 --> 00:49:05,060
this is the balance. We had
such an unbelievable decade.
It has to balance it out.

859
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,501
You know,

860
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:10,340
with all this horrible shit happened and
now and it's like now wait a minute now

861
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,500
it was nothing but horror. So with
those championships that made us even,

862
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,710
so now there's some horrible shit
common these last couple of years.

863
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:20,481
So you know what that means.

864
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:24,560
We're going to win some more championships
coming up. That's how I look at it. Oh,

865
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,860
by the way, any San Francisco
49 fans listening to this,

866
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,970
how do you feel about all fucking capper,

867
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,390
nick out there fucking on
the cover of every magazine.

868
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,860
Half naked with his fucking ass in the
air showing off his tattoos and his abs

869
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,140
doing commercials and
all that type of shit.

870
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:40,920
You'd think he won the fucking super bowl.

871
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,200
Have you seen one God damn
commercial with Joe Flacco? Huh?

872
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,880
Have you?
I haven't as a football fan.

873
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,330
I don't like when that shit happens.
I'll tell you right now,

874
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:55,950
once Tom Brady started
experimenting with his haircuts,

875
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,290
you walking around with Doug's going
to fashion shows. I don't know.

876
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,540
We have one 1 cents.

877
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:06,590
Doesn't that sound like some typical
moron shit that you'd hear on Sports Talk

878
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:07,240
Radio?

879
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,430
Lorena car I had when I was in Boston
was tuned to sports talk radio and I,

880
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,810
I can't fucking listen to
it. It's just a dumb, I was,

881
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:21,110
I put it on and they were criticizing
big papi saying he's a selfish player and

882
00:50:22,411 --> 00:50:27,411
all it's classic Boston fucking morons
sports where it's just inevitable.

883
00:50:28,731 --> 00:50:29,690
They're gonna eat their own.

884
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,930
You mean the guy who fucking helped was
one of the main factors in ending that

885
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:39,710
curse. The 86 year curse of the
Babe, all of that fucking horse shit.

886
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,910
That guy should be able to shit in the
street for the rest of his fucking life.

887
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,500
Not even 10 years later. You're
already saying that the guys selfish.

888
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,070
Shame on you. Boston sports
talk radio. Shame on you.

889
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,510
All right, let's get back to the
podcast here. Sorry guys. Um,

890
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,750
so I'm actually predicting,
Nah,

891
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,560
you guys might have a little bit of
a hangover there in San Francisco.

892
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,130
You coach is putting on weight,
right?

893
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,000
Filling out those dockers
more and more every week.

894
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,570
Trying to will his people to win.
Actually,

895
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:12,830
I think Catherine is going to do great,

896
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:15,410
but I always get nervous with
quarterbacks who run around like that.

897
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,770
Eventually those linebackers,
they get sick of that shit and a,

898
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:22,280
they get an open shot at you and
they, uh, next thing you know,

899
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:26,120
you're bleeding into your lungs.
Um, advice for a skinny guy.

900
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:32,180
All right, here we go. A day a Billy boy
first till that first time. Long time.

901
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:33,830
Thanks for all the last
there. No worries. All right.

902
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,300
It's great that you're helping out those
who are overweight by shaming them.

903
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:40,610
Is that what you're saying?
I've helped out a couple of,

904
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:44,800
I've probably had other people have their
face in a bucket of KFC right now. Uh,

905
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:45,681
but if I may,

906
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:48,950
I'd like to ask for advice for a guy
who's a little on the thin side of the

907
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:50,810
spectrum.
I'm tall,

908
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,340
six foot seven and weight
around 155 160 pounds. Dude,

909
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:59,780
I can't fucking help you.
You six,

910
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:03,350
seven one five. I weighed one 55
and high school and I swear to God,

911
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:05,150
I looked like I was going to
get blown down the street.

912
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:06,820
Yeah,

913
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,230
Jesus Christ,
Dude.

914
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,880
Okay.

915
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,430
Even though I eat quite
a bit any regularly.

916
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:13,710
Yeah.

917
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,270
I even also have protein slash meal
supplement drinks in between though.

918
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:21,250
Don't fucking drank those things.
I don't know shit about no,

919
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:25,920
but don't drink those. Thanks. That's
fucking powder thing that comes into that.

920
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,410
That breaking bad fucking oil
drum. Don't, don't do that dude.

921
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,080
Okay.

922
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:38,010
All those supplements and all that type
of shit. Don't fucking do that. All right.

923
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,680
Just accept who you are. We all want to
look up a little bit better. All right.

924
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,470
Believe me.
Trust me on this one.

925
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,380
You're going to fill out all right.

926
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,080
It happens whether you want it or not.

927
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,910
So enjoy the fact that you can kind of
eat whatever the fuck you want to, but I,

928
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:58,920
I,
my gut tells me to,

929
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:03,840
I don't fuck around with shit like that,
that creatine and that,

930
00:53:03,841 --> 00:53:08,070
that fucking muscle milk stuff and all
that shit. You turn it around the back.

931
00:53:08,071 --> 00:53:10,020
You can't even pronounce
half the shit that's in it.

932
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,480
There's no fucking way that
that stuff's good for you.

933
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:14,400
There's no way that that thing,

934
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,370
it's going to be better for you than
sitting down eating a nice grass fed

935
00:53:17,371 --> 00:53:21,330
fucking steak there. Um, granted,

936
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,970
I don't know shit about nutrition,
but I'm also not a fucking moron.

937
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:25,703
Okay.
Right.

938
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,410
Anyways,
he goes,

939
00:53:27,411 --> 00:53:31,400
my siblings are just as tall as I
am and they are not been like me.

940
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,720
I'm also 23. Is that metabolism dude,
I'm not a doctor. I don't know. Well,

941
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:38,000
I pass this stage.
I don't know.

942
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:42,500
I am somewhat comfortable with myself
and I have a smoke and girlfriend of five

943
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:47,030
years. Well, go fuck yourself then to
come on. Who loves me for who I am,

944
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:51,380
but wouldn't mind a few pounds.
Oh, wait a minute. She bring it up.

945
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:55,080
Should I binge on Pasta?
Thanks bill.

946
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:58,290
I bought the raises because of you,
while I helped the razors workout for you.

947
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:03,530
Jesus Christ do with your height. You
probably need to order them twice. Um,

948
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,900
now dude, listen, listen, listen, listen.
You gotta be who the fuck you are.

949
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,210
All right. Would you ever say to
your girl like, Hey, you know,

950
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:16,510
I'd like it if you lost a
few. He can't. You know,

951
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:21,150
I dunno if she just made one comment
and forgot she even said it or she,

952
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:24,250
she's literally given you a body image.
But I'll tell you,

953
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:27,820
do one of the greatest things you can
ever do in life is except yourself.

954
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,340
All right? And I'm not
saying like, Hey, you know,

955
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:33,880
I'm doing something unhealthy to myself
and I accept it. I don't mean that.

956
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:38,770
I mean like, except what the
fuck you look like and uh, and,

957
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:39,640
and,
and just,

958
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,473
you know,

959
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:44,650
just be a good shit and it,
everything falls into place.

960
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:48,760
You don't need to go out there and drink
muscle milk and he fucking angel hair

961
00:54:48,761 --> 00:54:49,960
pasta,
you know,

962
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,660
set your alarm and get up at three
in the morning and go eat that shit.

963
00:54:52,661 --> 00:54:57,490
You're 23 years old. You're supposed
to be in good shape. All right.

964
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:01,950
Okay. So you're a little
fucking underwear. Who gives
a fuck? Dude? You know,

965
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:05,320
you're built like you built like
snoop Dogg, he seems to be doing fine,

966
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,460
you know?
Um,

967
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,320
I, I would, I would not
try to gain any weight.

968
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,600
I wouldn't try to lose any weight.

969
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:18,380
I would just just keep doing what
you're doing. All right. You're a guy,

970
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:19,530
you're six foot seven,

971
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,550
you weigh about 160 pounds at 23 and you
have a smoking hot girlfriend and loves

972
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:24,384
you for who you are.

973
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:27,600
And she made one fucking comment about
putting a few more pounds off by this.

974
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:31,380
Let, let that, let that go right by
you. I wouldn't even worry about that.

975
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:35,490
All right. You're a good man. You'll,
you'll look how you're supposed to look.

976
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,760
All right. Put that fucking
powdered nuclear waste away.

977
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,420
I don't know what the fuck that shit does.
The kidneys or your liver or whatever.

978
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:43,254
But uh,

979
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:45,893
no.

980
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,170
When the ingredients look like the last
name of Russian hockey players, you know,

981
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,570
or the fucking Swedes, I think the Swedes
got the most difficult names. That's,

982
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,180
that's a good time to fucking,
you know,

983
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,820
the only time to eat shit like that
is if you're orbiting the earth.

984
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,090
Other than that, you know,
go to a farmer's market
like a God damn human being.

985
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,710
All right. Organizing porn.
Uh, bill on a recent podcast,

986
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:12,030
you complained about the difficulty
of searching porn on the road. Did I?

987
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,560
I thought I was talking about how
I wanted to stop watching porn.

988
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:21,090
I might've said that on a podcast and
in the past and you just listened to it.

989
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,800
I don't fucking know. But recently
I've been trying to down on it,

990
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:29,530
I've been trying to watch an only on
Sundays and that's not a slap to the face

991
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:34,090
to whoever created all of this
shit. It's just, you know,

992
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:35,220
Sunday's a day arrest

993
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,520
and I like to be totally relaxed.
If I can open up to you guys a little bit.

994
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,240
I'm sorry. All right. Anyways,

995
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:49,300
he says as I also have a job
that requires me to travel a lot.

996
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,320
I know all too well.

997
00:56:50,321 --> 00:56:54,490
The frustration of unreliable Internet
connections and the sheer amount of time

998
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:57,040
wasted on searching for
the perfect porn video.

999
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:02,020
So let me tell you about a little trick
I recently discovered paying for porn.

1000
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,910
I know paying for pouring feels
counterintuitive, but it's worth it.

1001
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,120
Um, here's what you do. Well,

1002
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:13,330
this is the reason why and I'll pay for
porn is because I don't want my credit

1003
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:16,390
card on the porn site.
And then if they double swipe it,

1004
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,720
I don't want to have to call the credit
card company saying that, you know,

1005
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:24,490
you just Dotcom fucking double swiped my
credit card and I'm really upset by it.

1006
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:29,860
Or no, even worse, they call
me up, you know, you know,

1007
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:34,690
did you a fucking, I don't know. I can't
even come up with a good fucking did you?

1008
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,470
Uh, ass bag 9,000. Did
you fucking rent that? No.

1009
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:43,600
Did you rent fucking scumbag
on the ass bag returns?

1010
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,370
Yeah. Yeah, I ordered that one.
No, I'm kidding. I'm not into.

1011
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:52,210
Amanda does get everybody
the German kind or the,

1012
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:55,990
or like the shit that scat man Crothers
did I ever tell you how much I hate to

1013
00:57:55,991 --> 00:57:56,824
sketch thing?

1014
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,880
I'll tell you one of the worst get
singers of all the time would be fucking

1015
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:05,810
Frank Sinatra at the risk of pissing
off all the Italian Americans,

1016
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,470
his scat singing at the end
of strangers in the night.

1017
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,260
Doobie Doobie.

1018
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,810
Do Toby di Di da Di da Da.

1019
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:19,640
Yeah,

1020
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,350
he sounded like Joe Piscopo doing him
before Joe even did it. Right. Anyways,

1021
00:58:24,351 --> 00:58:26,330
let's go back to this shit.
So let me tell you what I learned.

1022
00:58:26,331 --> 00:58:28,430
A little tricky thing.
Uh, paying for porn.

1023
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:31,250
I know paying for porn feels
counterintuitive, but it's worth it.

1024
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,210
Here's what you do.

1025
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,200
Find a site that has the kind of
content that you're looking for.

1026
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,220
Make sure that the site allows for
downloading and isn't just streaming only.

1027
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,900
This is key. Download all your favorite
videos to an external hard drive.

1028
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:46,790
Ah, Jesus Christ. Do it.

1029
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:50,990
And then what the FBI kicks open the
fucking door and make sure you cancel your

1030
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:54,800
membership before you're 30 days is
up or else they'll charge you again.

1031
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,300
Once you've done all that,

1032
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,710
you'll have a drive full of high quality
porn that you can keep forever and you

1033
00:59:00,711 --> 00:59:05,540
don't even need an internet
connection to watch it. Jesus Christ,

1034
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,870
this guy might have some figured out here
between the external hard drive that's

1035
00:59:08,871 --> 00:59:11,960
50 to $100 and a one month subscription,

1036
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:16,700
25 to 30 you're looking at about
80 to $100 initial initial setup.

1037
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,950
Do that.
Math doesn't work out.

1038
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:25,430
You're looking at 75 to $130 all right.

1039
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:30,050
You kind of fucking alligator on both ends
of it. Whatever. I suck at math, so no,

1040
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:32,780
actually I don't suck at that kind of
math. I suck at the kind that, you know,

1041
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:35,530
once you have to learn how
to build a bridge, you know,

1042
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,230
once there was shapes and there was these
paragraphs, right, you had to memorize.

1043
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:41,400
Yeah,

1044
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,370
I haven't did okay in Algebra.
If I wasn't such a jerk off,

1045
00:59:44,371 --> 00:59:46,800
it could have fucking got the c minus
and not have to go to summer school.

1046
00:59:46,801 --> 00:59:50,340
But that's a whole another fucking
thing. Also, I trashed the, for the, uh,

1047
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,230
my teacher had a speech impediment,
so I used to make fun of them.

1048
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,650
That was stupid. So when I kind of
had a 69, he didn't give me the 70,

1049
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:04,020
and he fucked my summer.
Um, anyways, where am I?

1050
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,230
You're looking at about $8,000
initial investment, but think of,

1051
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,350
think of all the time and frustration
you'll save by not having to deal with

1052
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:14,220
surfing for porn on the road.
It's changed the way I travel.

1053
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:17,723
Yeah.

1054
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:22,130
Dude, you sound like you just bought
the ultimate like neck pillow, pillow,

1055
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:26,170
however the fuck you say that word, by the
way. I fucking hate those things. Yeah.

1056
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:30,110
I hate you fucking walk around the
airport and those fucking douchebags have

1057
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:32,570
those neck,
neck pillows are already around the neck.

1058
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,110
I always just want to punch him right
in the nose because he already was like,

1059
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:40,660
they have that neck brace on
a fucking lazy. Are you? Do.

1060
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,930
You can't hold your head up when
you're walking around. Sorry. Um,

1061
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,230
anyways, Bill, thanks for the
free hours of entertainment.

1062
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,290
They've gotten me through countless
boring flights and cab rides. Well, dude,

1063
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:54,470
so now if I fight, download, my
favorite ones were the ones who is,

1064
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:56,240
when I find one that I really like,

1065
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,810
I always forget the name of
it and then I can't find it.

1066
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:01,550
And then I try to search like these,

1067
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:07,580
I try to come up with words that describe
what I watched and that never comes up.

1068
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,990
Like the search engine, all these sites
stinks. So maybe that's a reason to do it.

1069
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,713
Uh,

1070
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:17,040
and also if I want people
to pay for my fucking DVDs,

1071
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:22,420
shouldn't I be paying these porn stars?
How would I be in a hypocrite? God, it,

1072
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:25,690
I think, I think I've convinced myself
through youtube trying to convince me.

1073
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:30,880
People, I think it's high time.
I'll come. Lars did our fall.

1074
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:33,860
Rick didn't speak out about that.
Well,

1075
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:38,470
I guess it wasn't happening to them back
in the day that Jesus, I don't even,

1076
01:01:38,471 --> 01:01:42,100
what the fuck I'm talking about
here. Um, all right. Overrated.

1077
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:43,090
Underrated for the week.

1078
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:47,680
Everybody guys using the term
slut to refer to his male friend.

1079
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:53,560
That's overrated. As in
what? As in what up slut.

1080
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,560
Oh, Jesus. Guys say that to each
other. That sounds terrible.

1081
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,800
He said a kid I hadn't
talked to in awhile,

1082
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:06,700
whom I was supposed to meet up with
in New York City dropped this on me,

1083
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:09,520
and not only did I tell him
I didn't want to hang out.

1084
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:14,440
I told him I wanted to connect my knuckles
to his teeth in a way that would send

1085
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:16,000
them across time square.

1086
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,020
Okay.

1087
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,530
Oh yeah, it's bad. What ups
luck. That doesn't sound that,

1088
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,470
that sounds like something one white
frat guy would say to another white Frat

1089
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:28,200
guy,
you know,

1090
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:33,150
and then do some bastardized version
of some my gangster side. Right.

1091
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:34,510
Okay.

1092
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:37,030
I got, I got a, I have
an underrated for you,

1093
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:41,170
everybody watching reruns of Tj Hooker.

1094
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,493
Okay.

1095
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:47,030
Tj Hooker.
He's arguably the worst acting.

1096
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,720
Yeah.

1097
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,553
Ever.

1098
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:54,860
On any show that ever happened or at
the very least I would put it up there.

1099
01:02:55,260 --> 01:03:00,180
All right. Well, let's say you had
the march madness of worst TV shows.

1100
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:01,860
All right,

1101
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,750
that anybody ever acted on TJ hooker
without a doubt would be a number one seed

1102
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,380
in, in one of the regions
without, they would be like Duke.

1103
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,120
Okay.

1104
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,440
It's fucking horrific.

1105
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:18,750
First of all was the episode I saw him
and the Armenian dude or whatever the

1106
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:23,340
fuck his name is, who's pretending
to be Italian. Uh, Romano.

1107
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:28,860
They get separated and they're on walkie
talkies and somebody shooting at Tj

1108
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:33,330
Hooker and Romano is going in
into these call and Tj Hooker.

1109
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,910
And I don't know why he's not saying Tj,
he just,

1110
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:40,620
he's just going hooker and then they'd
show fucking TJ hooker with his fucking

1111
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:45,180
awful to pay. We're half the show. It
doesn't even match his fucking side parts.

1112
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,580
More gun play,
more gun play.

1113
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:50,580
And they cut back to Romano
again and he's goes hooker

1114
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,760
and then fucking captain Kirk,

1115
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,410
any chance she gets to fondle and
get cheap fields on Heather Locklear.

1116
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,693
He does it.

1117
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:08,390
He rescued her one time and he was
literally like caressing her face just for

1118
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:13,531
like fucking the final like 90 seconds
of the show was just rubbing the side of

1119
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:15,120
her face.

1120
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,240
And you can tell she's like a young
actress and she doesn't know how to say in

1121
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:19,590
between. Takes like, Hey,

1122
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:22,290
do you want to do me a favor and maybe
just have your hand on my shoulder just

1123
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,280
for a second. Yeah, because it's,

1124
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:26,040
I just don't feel like your
character and my character.

1125
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:29,250
That's how you talk your
way out of somebody doing
something awareness scene and

1126
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:30,300
she doesn't know how to do it.

1127
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,373
Okay.

1128
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,540
Just imagine them running around and
Larry Bird short shorts because they do

1129
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:39,440
that also. And Captain Kirk is sucking
in his fucking stomach. What happened?

1130
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:42,950
Don't, don't, don't, don't listen to
this here. Just sit down and watch it.

1131
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:46,100
If you can find it on your right
and your cable. I'm telling you,

1132
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:51,260
unbelievably underrated. Uh, by the
way, by the way, my tickets came,

1133
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:55,030
my tickets came for
fucking Texas a and M uh,

1134
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:58,850
Alabama college station. Me, dude,

1135
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:01,190
I called it Paul Versey and uh,

1136
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:04,880
two of my other buddies outside of the
business are going to go to the game and

1137
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:09,200
uh, we're taking some fucking a, I'm
doing a couple of gigs. Oh, that's right.

1138
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:14,450
I'm doing an El Paso part of the Billy
red state tour and then I'm doing,

1139
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:18,700
um, uh, San Antonio. I've never,

1140
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:22,570
I never been to either one of those,
either one of those states, states,

1141
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:24,220
either one of those cities in that state.

1142
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,950
So I feel like at this point
