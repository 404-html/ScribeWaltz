1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,880
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:06,600
It's bill burr and this is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,460
November 30th, 2015 what's going on? How,

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,170
um,
I'm not doing shit.

5
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:20,310
It's Sunday night sitting here with my
fucking pit bull and I'm watching a,

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,010
it's halftime of the Patriots Broncos.
That's what I'm,

7
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,050
that's what I'm recording this.
What?

8
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,350
Bop Bop bop that data.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,340
You know what sucks about the fucking NFL?
I never thought I would say this.

10
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:36,240
This fucking parody think I swear to God,
every,

11
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:40,560
any team can beat any team. See it die
like a thousand deaths every Sunday.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,180
Remember back in the day, you know, if
your team was good, you had those teams.

13
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:47,820
You could just kick the shit
out of four of them a year.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,660
It just seems every week.
Now you're in a fucking dog fight.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,790
Okay.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,780
14 to seven. Now they're going into the
half. It's starting to snow out there.

17
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:59,720
These orange crush of
starting to feel confident.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,660
Okay,

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,420
hightower got hurt. Yeah.
What are you going to do?

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,300
You know what I noticed
watching Sunday night football,

21
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,960
you know when they have the,
uh, the little thing, I'm sorry,

22
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:14,990
I got the TV on in the background.
I can't believe they're redoing the Wiz.

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,420
Yeah.

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,870
You know. Did you guys ever see
the original one? I swear to God.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,420
Is it me or is it fucking nine hours long?

26
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,300
It takes them like three hours before
they even get to Nipsey Russell.

27
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:26,950
Okay,

28
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,870
come on in. Ease on down. Why don't you
fucking run down the road? I'm sorry.

29
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:36,110
That's such a bad joke when
it's too fucking long. Um,

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,390
who the fuck pitch to Redo that thing?

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,420
I don't even get and why do you put it
out now? That's not a holiday movie.

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:43,590
Okay.

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,370
Why don't they just keep them
like the old, what's do you know?

34
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,380
I'm taping Rudolph the red nose.

35
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:52,680
Rob Babo Rudolph the red nose reindeer.

36
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,490
That classic one from um,

37
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,720
well it would have back in the fucking
day. I'm going to watch it, you know,

38
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,360
Tuesday night it comes on.

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,030
Get myself into the
fucking holiday spirit.

40
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,170
I can't have the TV on do a podcast cause
I'm just keep talking about you guys

41
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,290
want to watch TV with me.
I just saw this new ray Liotta um,

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,090
Jennifer Lopez movie or TV show. I don't
know what it was. It was just coming out,

43
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,150
I thought was gonna be one of those
commercials were Ray Liotta just stares at

44
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:22,740
somebody because they're
not drinking vodka.

45
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,310
I just want the other person to be
like frank. No, I make the, I'm sorry.

46
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,770
I love fucking Goodfellas,
but this is my drink.

47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:32,980
Okay.

48
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,220
What's going on with you man? What's,
what's with the fucking looks relaxed.

49
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:37,930
I get it.
You can kick the shit out of me.

50
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,603
You know,

51
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,560
he's just laughing at their fucking
manhood. He's disgusted with him.

52
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,330
He's just dusted.

53
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,680
It's actually an amazing piece of
acting because he never says anything.

54
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,210
He just fucking looks at him and he's
just see, just see the generational gap.

55
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:57,740
He can just see him going.

56
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,020
Your entire generation is
a bunch of fucking pussies.

57
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,330
Okay.

58
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,880
Just with one fuck. He just gives
him that one. Fuck it, look,

59
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:06,481
and next thing you know,

60
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:09,180
of course they got the guy sitting
over there with like an umbrella drink.

61
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,480
I don't think I've ever sat in a bar
in anybody's ever fucking looked at me

62
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:15,700
cause what I was drinking,
I guess I've gotten shit for it.

63
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,870
Okay.

64
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,850
You know, but that was just back when I
lived in the Boston area. They'll come on,

65
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,350
you fucking do was shot.
Um,

66
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,450
God driving into, we're
all driving, only arrest,

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,490
making fucking excuses. Um,
anyway, so you know, and that,

68
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,400
that fucking horrific Sunday
night football song comes on,

69
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,500
you know the little cutie pie there in
her glitter outfit cause she's in show

70
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:47,860
Biz. Right. So you got to
have some glitter on. It's
all this special effects shit.

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,680
Um,
I don't know if it's me or what is,

72
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,340
isn't that song just a complete
fucking rip off of Joan jets?

73
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,810
I hate myself for loving you.

74
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,230
Yeah.

75
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,980
When they get to the whole
fucking, you know, I,

76
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:04,490
I love my for watching
football, isn't it? How it goes.

77
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,520
I think I know what they say.
I always fast forward through it.

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,110
I've never liked that song.
I liked it back when it was an orchestra.

79
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,240
You know when you had
somebody like John Williams,

80
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:19,410
you had some great composer come up with
a piece of music that I could actually

81
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:20,790
move you emotionally.

82
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,970
And then somewhere along the line they
went to Hank Williams jr and he took his

83
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:30,210
hit song. All my rowdy friends
are coming over tonight,

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,670
you know, don't blame Hank
Williams jr it's not his fault.

85
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,690
Okay?

86
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,690
His Dad obviously banged somebody
who had no musical talent whatsoever.

87
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,230
And so the best Hank Williams jr could
ever be is half Hank Williams Sr.

88
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,890
But you know, sometimes you
get a little more, you know,

89
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,950
you get a little more one than the other.

90
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,820
So rather than him singing and what
the fuck did Hank Williams sick?

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,780
You cheat and heart my loan. Some truck.
I don't know what the fuck he saying,

92
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,470
but all I know is that guy
like drank himself to death,
but he was only like, wow,

93
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,390
I got to look this up.
How fucking old was that guy?

94
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,870
That guy looks like he's fucking 60

95
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,870
yeah,

96
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,040
he drank himself to death. [inaudible] I
gotta look this up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

97
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,200
You know, this is the kind
of, this is what happens.

98
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:27,710
This is what happens when you fucker just
run your God damn mouth. Hank Williams,

99
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,630
Hank Williams, Hank that he was,
he was the original frank the tank,

100
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:37,631
but he was Hank 1923 to 1953
he was fucking 30 years old.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,910
Okay.

102
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,000
You know, he, that's a, you
know, as, as sad as that.

103
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:49,001
Is that as a hell of an accomplishment
to drink yourself to death by 30 I mean

104
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,960
anybody can, Oh d am I that, you know,

105
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,800
but I mean to literally to put it in the
fucking hours that the amount of hours

106
00:05:56,801 --> 00:06:00,600
that it to drink yourself to
death and only 30 years. I mean,

107
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:03,270
you've got to figure the guy didn't
have his first shot of booze.

108
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,493
Okay.

109
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,280
I'll even give out. Get say 13 he
had his first fucking drink. A Bose.

110
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,510
Yeah.

111
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,840
And within 17 years guys fucking dead.

112
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,313
Okay.

113
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,153
That's amazing.

114
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,430
I remember a long time ago watching
some fucking show or something that was

115
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:24,970
saying the body was actually
designed to live 150 years,

116
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,850
optimal conditions,
you know,

117
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,840
basically if they treated
you like a fucking classic
car that had been at a body

118
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:35,890
off restoration and they just sort of
floated you around and never drove you or

119
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:40,720
anything like that. Right. Like you could
live, you know, breathing perfect air,

120
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,740
eating perfectly and all that.
You'd live for 150 years. Um,

121
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,980
which that made sense to me because
every time when those people used to come

122
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,900
and give the cancer
talks about cigarettes,

123
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:53,500
it'd be like every time you
smoke a cigarette you take
five minutes off of your

124
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:57,340
life,
there's 20 cigarettes in a pack.

125
00:06:57,341 --> 00:07:00,280
So that's a lie.
That's a hundred minutes.

126
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,770
So you just took almost two hours of
your life away. So I was sitting there,

127
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,350
you know, doing my dumb
Masco. Well, Jesus Christ,

128
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:12,010
you'd be fucking dead by the time you 30
cause I was counting down from like 80

129
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,600
I guess their count down for one 50 or
maybe they just lying and they're trying

130
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,860
to scare the shit out of you and they
don't think some freckled cutting.

131
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,380
The crowd's going to try to actually do
some math. I don't know. All I'm saying.

132
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,600
Okay.

133
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,380
As you got to give it up to Hank Williams,
you know,

134
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:28,900
okay.

135
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,050
Drinking himself to death, you
know. Ah, you know the first third,

136
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:36,280
the first third is cirrhosis is fucking
fun. After a while it's not fun anymore,

137
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:40,030
but you know, a lot of things
aren't fun after awhile, you know?

138
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,540
Okay.

139
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,540
Being a parent isn't fun.
After a while you see it on their faces.

140
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,640
Once they get to ask the little bundle
of joy once he's done say acute cute

141
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:53,680
things, once they'd done
being cute, you know,

142
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,280
like they step on an ant and they say,
hey wait, what? Go Guy dead it identical.

143
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,520
Yeah,

144
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,480
go. Did you say I taste, she
just said I did it. Killed it.

145
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,060
Oh,
that's adorable.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,500
All right.

147
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,230
The little things kids say once they get
past that and they start rolling their

148
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:14,010
fucking eyes. Yeah. You
know, you're just like, yeah,

149
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:17,360
I'm fucking over this shit.
That's right.

150
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,610
Parenting is like cirrhosis of the liver.

151
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,760
Look at Bob Costas with this fucking
smart looking coat and his goddamn scarf

152
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,000
guy always look sharp. You gotta
give it up to them. Um, my,

153
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,540
I'm the only person who wins too when
they talked about what was wrong with

154
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:37,250
Peyton Manning's foot plantar Fisher
writers, which I've actually had,

155
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,320
um, from improper technique playing
drums. I didn't know how to get,

156
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,520
I was trying to do those John bottom
triplet fucking things from good times,

157
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:50,120
bad times. And I think I was just using
my big toe to try and make it happen.

158
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:52,520
So it was arching my foot.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

159
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,720
I woke up the next day. I thought someone
was stabbing in the foot, but, uh,

160
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,180
Peyton actually it's basically this, I
don't even know what it is. I had it.

161
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,320
I don't even know what the fuck it is.

162
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
I thought it was a tendon that
runs along the Archie of thought.

163
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:10,890
I Dunno where to after I saw the drawing
then I didn't know what the fuck it was.

164
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:15,480
But it goes from your heel to like,
uh,

165
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,650
like when you get your Bunyan there,

166
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,750
you know if you get hammertoes
stop hammertoes dual due to too.

167
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:24,930
If you get a hammer toes, right.
That part that sticks out. Anyways,

168
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,560
the part near the heel they say
is tearing away from the bone.

169
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,060
What the fuck I'm done.

170
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,980
I am fucking done.
At that point I might,

171
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:39,000
well part of my body is
tearing away from the bone.

172
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,620
I just stopped doing standup.

173
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,780
If my fucking arm from leaning on the mic
stead is something in my elbow started

174
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,300
Terry, that I would just be a
podcast and that would be it.

175
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,100
My voice would crack and I would cry.

176
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,330
So that looks like we're
going to be losing Peyton
manning and Coby Bryan in the

177
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,480
same fucking year. Two monsters of
their game. Do you guys see kobies poem?

178
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,140
My wife read it to me. I actually, even
as a Celtics fan, I was a little sad.

179
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:06,390
Then I also, I had to chuckle
that he wrote this whole poem,

180
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:07,950
this whole Ode to basketball and,

181
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:12,660
and not once did he ever mentioned coaches
or teammates and I was kinda thinking

182
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:15,930
like, you know what ads? That's why
he never passed the ball dead. He,

183
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,470
he's still one of the greats,
but Jesus Christ.

184
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,610
How about a shout out to fucking shack?

185
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,910
At least his ass, you know, remember
that. How does my ass taste? I'm sorry.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,030
Well let, let's, let's get, let's get
back. Let's get back on track here.

187
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:39,000
What was I talking about? I was
talking about Plantar Fisher. Itis is,

188
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,980
I would know, I was
talking about how, um, the,

189
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,200
the hook of that Thursday night fucking
song, the Sunday night football song,

190
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,000
they got to get you into it,
right?

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,310
Cause you're not into you cause
you're not into football evidently.

192
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:54,300
So they've got to have some lay
come out in a little sparkly dress,

193
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,160
throw a couple of looks to
the camera. Like, you know
what? I blow you fewer here.

194
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,270
I'd fucking blow.
Yeah.

195
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,570
She's got to give you those looks
Thursday night football is his mouth tits,

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,530
right? They do. That can break
free of the things that you do.

197
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:13,770
It's the same fucking sock
and full life of me. You know,

198
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,210
I think Joan Jett or is she had to
go after the fucking NFL. Why not?

199
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:22,740
They went after Tom Brady.
Why can't they go after fucking Joan jet?

200
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,221
Do you know?

201
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:27,270
I got an a big argument with this fucking
friend of mine right through right now.

202
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:31,560
I think he said can't talk,
but he just was, you know,

203
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,090
he was being, he was being at what?
I've never run into a whiny giant fan.

204
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,710
New York giant fan. I love giant fans.
They never bitched. They never whine.

205
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,500
They just fucking beat my team. I
got to respect that. He was fucking,

206
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,980
he was still whining about the giants
losing to the Patriots two weeks ago.

207
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,060
It's like, dude, you went to and Oh and
the fucking super bowl against this.

208
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:54,800
Why don't give a fuck about a game
in November? You know who won?

209
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,300
They could wield,
she wouldn't look good.

210
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:59,720
Cause when you go to go to [inaudible]
they wouldn't cared. But he caught it.

211
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,880
Yeah, I agree with you. Okay. I thought
Dez Bryant caught that fucking ball.

212
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:07,240
I don't understand what you got to fucking
do these days for them to call it a

213
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:10,040
catch. It's a weird fucking rule. Okay.

214
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,300
So he started going in on how the
Patriots cheat and I'll let fucking whiny

215
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:17,390
horse shit.
And he tried to say that the Patriots win.

216
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,360
This is the best one I've heard so far.
The Patriots where 90% of coin tosses,

217
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,620
which I think that's the number I always
pull out of my ass when I want to win

218
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:32,290
an argument. That's the percentage
I always go with 90%. Okay.

219
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,660
If 90% of people out there with rarely
fucking blue, blue, blue, right.

220
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,800
So he tried to tell me that
90% of the fucking time we,

221
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,870
when the coin toss it's like, okay,
so what are we doing there? Yeah.

222
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,500
Are we somehow sneaking a fucking
different quarter in there? Like, it's,

223
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,420
it's just unfucking.
And he continued on with the whole,

224
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,780
the Patriots watched the rams
final fucking a walkthrough
before the super bowl,

225
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,920
even though the ESPN detracted it and
said that was a complete horse shit lie.

226
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,130
Of course they'd attracted at
1230 in the morning. You know,

227
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,940
they talked about it for five years at
nine o'clock in the morning on sports

228
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:10,790
center. And then when they find out
that they were perpetuating a lie,

229
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:15,540
they then know, oh, sorry about
that. It fucking 1230. So,

230
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,590
um, I dunno, I finally
got him to come around.

231
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,250
I finally got him to come around.
It's just like, look, okay,

232
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:27,540
if you want to see the guilty of
gamesmanship, absolutely do they fucking,

233
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,310
you know, try to get away with shit
if they could get away with it. Yeah,

234
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,150
but so does everybody. They just don't
fucking, when all the Superbowls,

235
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,593
you know,

236
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,170
it's unfucking believable what other teams
have done and there's like no fucking

237
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:45,720
problem. Like, I'll tell you right now
that fucking, do you guys see that,

238
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:49,350
that Redskins play
where, uh, Kirk cousins,

239
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:52,860
they hike the ball and the ball flew
out of his fucking hands and he asks the

240
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,240
Ref way,
did you get this ball?

241
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:57,090
Cause he thought there was
something slick on it and they go,

242
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,710
you got it from your own sideline.

243
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,310
If that happened during a patriots game
and the other quarterback said that we

244
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:05,880
would have lost a draft pick somehow
they would have fucking put his you.

245
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,710
Is it possible that maybe date day Greece
the fucking bled. Somebody sneak over,

246
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:13,950
dress like a red skin and
grease stop the balls.

247
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,150
Um, you know what I mean? I don't, I,

248
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,150
I've gone through this a Zillion fucking
times, but uh, you know, I, I don't know.

249
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,570
It's unbelievable that,
that piece of shit,

250
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:29,510
Jim or say and that piece of Shit fucking,
uh,

251
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,940
I can't remember his name, man. Eric Mann.

252
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:38,400
Jeanie have affectively
tarred and feathered. They,

253
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,420
the Patriots that will,

254
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,820
that will be brought up for them
for the rest of fucking time.

255
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,520
Air Pressure in stealing signs is
what they're fucking guilty of, right.

256
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,953
That's it.

257
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,810
These are the teams have to fucking
deep edge tested positive for steroids.

258
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,110
They're building stadiums that make their
fucking fan base sound loud is fucking

259
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,800
hilarious. Oh, that's the
pumping fucking crowd noise.

260
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,580
It added five, five. Don't worry
about it. Don't worry about it.

261
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,730
Jesus fucking Christ. We still signs
for one fucking game. One game.

262
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:13,630
It was illegal.
Then

263
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,130
they did it every game.

264
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,433
Okay,

265
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,190
unreal. I'll have to have that
debate for the rest of the time.

266
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:26,070
It was only illegal for that one
game that we did it and got caught.

267
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,620
If we did it the year before, the year
before, it wasn't fucking illegal.

268
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,630
Then I'll use stupid cuts out there.

269
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,510
Who think all you have to do is just film
the other coach and then you know what

270
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:35,280
they're going to do. You
dumb fuck. She got a,

271
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,320
you'd have to take that and
line it up with their plays.

272
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:43,850
Watch it at halftime and then try
to memorize as much as you can.

273
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,040
If you're lucky, maybe on two plays,
you know what the fuck they're doing.

274
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,133
You know what I mean?

275
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,241
I mean,

276
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:55,530
the teams sit there and they watch game
film every fucking week looking at their

277
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:58,320
formations and all of that shit.
How was that legal?

278
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,740
He couldn't do that back in
the fucking thirties right? He

279
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,010
fucking just sitting there. I guess
you could. If you get what camera?

280
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,690
Some guy in those fucking jockey parents
and just sit there role in the film.

281
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,350
How was watching game film legal?
That's gear considered.

282
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:20,670
Then you're a good student,
but if you try to steal their signs,

283
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:24,240
then you're a cunt. I don't, I
don't get it. I don't get it,

284
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,070
but I'm never going to defend that.

285
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:28,950
The Patriots don't try to fucking
bend the rules in their favor,

286
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:33,160
but I won't go so far as to say that
everybody else in the league doesn't also

287
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,690
fucking do it. This whole fucking
horse, you know what they sound like?

288
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:40,680
They sound like Republicans when they
talk about America, when they go,

289
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:42,510
America was founded on,

290
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,660
everybody's got a shut and they
completely ignored genocide and slavery.

291
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,950
Right. That's what other football
fence sound like to me when they,

292
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,790
when they try to act like we're the only
ones who fucking Dick around with the

293
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:01,770
rules. Oh Jesus Christ.
He just landed on Brady,

294
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,000
the Brady rule in effect,
personal foul hit, and Tom Brady,

295
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,610
I love that man. He's got a cute
little bud, 15 yards first down.

296
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,640
I love it. I love it. I love it.
It's called the Brady rule. You know,

297
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,620
even still, it's the money rule.
They call it the Brady rule.

298
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:24,621
That actually suggests that the NFL on
some fucking level gives a fuck about a

299
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,680
Tom Brady. If they don't, they give
a fuck about the money he makes.

300
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,700
You know what I mean? It's like
fucking Lance Armstrong. All right.

301
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,420
After all the bullshit after
he gets fucking cod there,

302
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:42,180
everybody gets on their high horse.
That's disgusting.

303
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,480
That's not what the Tour de France
is about and all that fucking shit.

304
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:50,300
Let me ask you this. All those constant
made, all of that fucking when he met,

305
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,410
when he wants seven in a row and people
who didn't give a fuck about bike racing,

306
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:58,520
tuned in and watched, and they could
charge more money for advertising. Okay.

307
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,680
During that whole time,
did they give the money back?

308
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,850
All the fucking money they made all
those owners that made all that money off

309
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:08,480
all those fucking guys doing steroids,
you know,

310
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,070
hitting a ball over the fucking God
damn freeway made all that money. Oh,

311
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,450
we're going to clean up the game.
Oh yeah,

312
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,390
you're going to give away all that
dirty money. You made you fucking cons.

313
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:20,750
Like you didn't know they
were doing roids that shitty.

314
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,640
If you manage to an Applebee's in,

315
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,370
in half of your staff was on
steroids when you wouldn't,

316
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:29,330
you wouldn't fucking notice at
some point when you walk in,

317
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:31,880
when you go in and to go get a
fresh sack of fucking potatoes,

318
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:34,760
you wouldn't walk in on somebody
inject and somebody else in the fucking

319
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:38,840
buttocks. Just out of just
being there every fucking day.

320
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,520
You know what's going on.

321
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,890
I ever tell you that time when
I used to work at that fucking

322
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,980
is holding all fucking day and they let
it got Brady Dank doesn't end itself.

323
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,360
Love fell you motherfucker.

324
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,190
Okay.

325
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,080
We got away with holding on
that one. Jesus Christ. Anyways,

326
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:04,250
I used to work in this fucking, um,
I used to work in this restaurant.

327
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:09,251
It was called the sable cafe and
Cary North Carolina back in like 87,

328
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,120
88.
Uh,

329
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:13,820
why did I just say that now I'm going
to say all this fucking horrific shit

330
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,280
about it was a fun job.
And uh,

331
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:20,870
there was some activities that were going
on in the back room who gives a fuck?

332
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:24,740
It was almost 30 years ago anyway,
so I worked in this fucking place and um,

333
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,120
I used to work on a mesquite
grill and I had this big chef hat,

334
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,590
like I knew what the fuck I was doing
and the place was gradually going out of

335
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:37,130
business. One of the managers
had a major cocaine program,

336
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:39,980
but a lot of people did. It
was the 80s. It wasn't really,

337
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,640
it was just becoming a problem, you
know? That's right around was cocaine,

338
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:47,320
the big lie, you know what I mean? So
this guy used to steal from the registry,

339
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,060
do a little fucking toot.
Right. And you know,

340
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,950
you know if the fucking the guy,
if that guy fucking running shit

341
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,360
yeah

342
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,270
is on drugs and I mean it just trickles
statement guys sent in the example.

343
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:00,104
So you know,

344
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,230
I remember I used to work like the fucking
dinner shift one night and it's just

345
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:08,260
fancy fucking restaurant and buy fancy.
I mean this carpeting,

346
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,660
this cloth napkins and they had
a giant fish tank. All right.

347
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:15,150
That was fancy for fucking
Cary, North Carolina, you know,

348
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,310
and it was fucking asshole. So he's giving
me shit for being a Yankee, you know,

349
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,750
affect carry back then stood for
concentrated area of relocated Yankees.

350
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,290
That's what these say like, you know,
you don't, you don't care. Stands for,

351
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,730
you know what that stands for. I
know buddy. What does it stand for?

352
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,350
Concentrated area. Relocated. Yank.

353
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,990
I fucking hate the draw. Play.
Yukon's has the draw play ever will.

354
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,580
It's never fucking
worked. The draw play, eh.

355
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,410
Okay. May, it must've worked at some
point. Keep running the fucking thing.

356
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,570
I think that's what you've just decided
that you're going to punt. It'd be like,

357
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:57,470
all right, you know what? Let's just not
give the ball over right here. Let's just,

358
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,080
uh, you know, just wait
a second. It never,

359
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,660
it never fucking works.
It's weird how the draw play doesn't work,

360
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:08,030
but somebody fucking basically
doing the same thing.

361
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:11,960
But if they go out for a pass, it always
works or it works more times than not.

362
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,590
You know what I mean? Like, so did
the, did the uh, delayed screened

363
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,633
right

364
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,300
when you got the line gap rackers
coming up the gap. Ah, Jesus Christ.

365
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:26,180
What are we doing? Yeah. Fucking crazy.

366
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,800
Anyways, I gotta be honest with
you, with all the interest we got,

367
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,980
I think if we replay Carolina Panthers
right now, um, the only reason we,

368
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:37,610
if we would win would be we would just
out coach him out of fucking experience.

369
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:41,210
But I think Carolina, it looks like
they look like world beaters to me.

370
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,853
MMM.

371
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:44,650
I Dunno.

372
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,910
How fucked up is it that the red skins
are fucking five and six and they're in

373
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:51,800
first place.
You know what I mean?

374
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,650
Like I think seven and nine
could win that division.

375
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:55,810
Yeah.

376
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,643
You know,

377
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,650
I'll tell you what's going to be brutal
is watching the New York media drive,

378
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,700
Tom Kauflan out of town. That's going
to be fucking unreal. Like he doesn't,

379
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,510
not a coach.
You know,

380
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,540
it's not his problem that one of his
best defensive players maimed himself.

381
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,390
You know what I mean? That whole fucking
thing he had to deal with. I mean,

382
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:17,500
I don't know. I don't, I mean, the
fucking guy's a winner, man. He,

383
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,730
he came to BC immediately, turned
it around after the, the, the,

384
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:24,820
the Doug Flutie hangover. All of a
sudden we became, we were winners again.

385
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,930
I have to pick now left.
He went to Jacksonville.

386
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,800
He always got the Jacksonville
Jaguars to the fucking super bowl.

387
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,160
He fucking goes to the
Goddamn New York giants.

388
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,170
They went to super bowls beating
the undefeated patriots. 18 and off

389
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,840
guy has one fucking bed. I guarantee
it. They're going to fucking stay.

390
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:49,060
Going to send them out of town is,
you know,

391
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,550
one of my buddies thinks this
because of his wind burned face.

392
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,040
I've never seen a guy who needs
fucking lotion more in my life.

393
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,580
Like I think that that's his next move
before he, if he gets run out of town,

394
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,890
you know, and he just needs a break from
football. They should do that thing,

395
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:04,960
you know, like if you go and
bald and they just go, Eh,

396
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,610
not only the fucking Douche bag and the
commercial, I'm also a client. Right.

397
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:11,740
He should do that with like fucking,
uh,

398
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,740
whatever face lotion, whatever
the fuck eco, whatever.

399
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,590
How do you get that red shit off of his,
he's got,

400
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,280
he's unbelieved the guys getting these
guys wind burn in like September.

401
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,390
It's like,
it's like he loved,

402
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:29,190
he always looks like he just got
done competing in like America's cup.

403
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,650
You know what I mean?
At least come out with a little knock.

404
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:34,950
Zima and you know is right. I don't
want you guys to thinking like pill.

405
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,140
You're just running your fucking
Yap here. How about a break? I'll,

406
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,050
I haven't gotten the advertising or the
fucking, the questions yet for this week,

407
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:46,980
so I'm just fucking filibuster in here
trying to get through this shit. Um,

408
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,040
hey did I did, I mentioned that I went,
oh, I told you guys not on Thursday.

409
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:56,100
I went to the, uh, the king's
Blackhawks game. And, um,

410
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,260
um, what, what, uh, the, the
highest level hockey I've seen
in so long, it was unreal.

411
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,150
Like the whole first period.

412
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:05,250
He just seemed like they were feeling
each other out to see what they were going

413
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:09,470
to do and, and just that,
the whole fucking thing,

414
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,870
every fucking line, every deep
defensive unit that goal tenders,

415
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,290
all of that shit. It just, it was
incredible the way that they play.

416
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,300
Do you know that was, there was
only two penalties. The whole,

417
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,480
it was two penalties in the
first period. That was it. Um,

418
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,740
Chicago went up to nothing and then the
king score two and the third and then

419
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:31,550
came back and won in overtime by the way,
three on three.

420
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,340
Even if you fucking hate hockey,
there's,

421
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:38,210
there's nothing to hate about
three on three hockey and overtime.

422
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:40,190
It's fucking unbelievable.

423
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,390
Just end to end action every five seconds.

424
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:48,420
It seemed like he was seeing a two
on one or a breakaway and um, ah,

425
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:51,680
the lovely Nia. Everybody look
at you linger in over there.

426
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,380
I actually heard Al Michaels tonight.
Talk about the three on three hockey.

427
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:59,140
Are you leaving? Are you going to come
here? You got to go see creed. Yeah.

428
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,610
Nia is like one of the only black
people ever into that band. No.

429
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,740
Yeah,
don't you like them?

430
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:10,760
What are they saying about [inaudible]
crash on the Brown chair and,

431
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:14,560
and he got you to having a
shot. Okay, good. No, not,

432
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,890
not created the band. What did
creep sanctuary, the moving,

433
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,040
I don't know if you can sing a creed song.
Oh, I'll take you out for an ice cream.

434
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,560
Okay.
Can you take me

435
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,563
hi.

436
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Oh, that's right. I
wasn't bad. Can you take,

437
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,353
I don't know what he said.

438
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,063
Hey,

439
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,150
is that like power rock?
Is that considered power rock?

440
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,580
Those kind of bands were like,
the lead singer is just like,

441
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,830
like just like this really,

442
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:51,150
anytime they say power
associated with music,

443
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:55,940
there's no power in it. Okay. Come here,
come here. And it says, who says you? Yes.

444
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,750
Just me and my dumb opinion. Ah,
you are fucking over me today.

445
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,350
Are they playing in Boston?
The Patriots now they're playing a Denver.

446
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:08,670
It always rains. No, no. Sorry. Um, yes.

447
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:12,840
I'm going to go see Korean. Are you
coming? Are you going to be done?

448
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,120
I don't have the advertising of the
questions yet, so no, look at Clio.

449
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,470
Look how cute she is.
She's actually an exhausted by,

450
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:24,630
took her on a long hike today.
Yeah,

451
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,550
I think we definitely need
to start feeding her more
cause he exercise her like

452
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,870
you're just like an athlete. Yeah, because
she didn't put on fucking 10 pounds.

453
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:35,430
I did. Yeah, me too.

454
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,970
You know what I'm going to try to do in
December? What's that, honey? Oh God,

455
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,790
I pissed me off today. I got to
tell the story. I got this. The Nia.

456
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,870
Nia hates when I make fart noises.

457
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,340
Like if I'm singing and I dunno,
I just go home if I just do that.

458
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,090
I hate when people do that in general.
It's so,

459
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,170
I don't like it because I don't like
bathroom, a toilet humor. Like, I just,

460
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:07,090
I think it's so gross. So she hates it.
So of course, Duh. What am I going to do?

461
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:10,840
So I'm singing along to the radio and
I just keep making fart noises in the

462
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:14,770
matter. She gets, the funnier it
is to me. And I keep thinking,

463
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:18,160
don't do this because we had a wonderful
afternoon. This is going to ruin it.

464
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:21,450
And I just, there was so much
fun. I had to keep doing it. Yeah.

465
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,970
And you kept doing it while
it Natto Dude, dude, dude,

466
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,560
dude, dude, dude, dude, I
have to go to the movies.

467
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,323
No,

468
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,700
you know there's something wrong with the,

469
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:36,950
if you don't think of fart noises funny,

470
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:40,130
I can see if I actually fired and he had
to deal with the death that came out of

471
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:42,680
me. Right. No, nothing is wrong with me.

472
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:47,510
You have the maturity of a 12 year old
and it's like you can't just let someone

473
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:51,710
enjoy their day without doing
something irritating. It's true.

474
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,590
You like to irritate people.
Especially me.

475
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,290
Admitted,
admitted.

476
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,020
I have no idea what
you're talking about it.

477
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:04,000
I just wanted to take my lovely wife
out to lunch. You did take maps lunch.

478
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:04,900
It was very nice.

479
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,440
That was great.
Okay.

480
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,630
I don't want to stay away
if such a problem with that.
I'll, you know what, I'm,

481
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,260
I will make an effort to stop doing it.

482
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Can you take me high or
near old person has to say,

483
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:23,890
I'll make an effort not to make
fart noises. Like what? Seriously.

484
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,750
I'm a fucking clown. That's what I do
for a living. What do you want from me?

485
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,200
Not to make fart noises.
You're better than that bill.

486
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,430
I'll fuck you for a psychology.
I'm not know how much you hate that.

487
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:38,800
Say you're better than that.

488
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,640
Terrific. All right. I'm going. Hey,

489
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,850
have you noticed the Bronco's
quarterback is like eight feet tall?

490
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,220
Are you talking to me?
Yeah. Why would I? Okay.

491
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,120
Well you can notice as somebody
who's tall can do that.

492
00:28:57,121 --> 00:29:00,360
Weird how fucking tall he is. I don't
know which one you're referring to.

493
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,010
I want to see him riding a
tank like Michael Dukakis,

494
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:08,100
just to see how much of his torso
comes out of that fucking hole.

495
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,520
Remember what he did. The
you were too young when they,
when he ran for president,

496
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:14,200
he was running for president. He was
doing fine and then he drove a tank. Well,

497
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:15,034
you to drive a tank.

498
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,650
They just had him stick his
fucking head out the running.

499
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,080
I remember when he was running for,

500
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,530
even though I was young and I remember
his wife drank like rubbing alcohol.

501
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,690
Then Shame Kitty Katie.

502
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,140
Oh Yeah, you need to caucus. Yeah.

503
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,870
It top three dumbest reasons I ever saw
anybody not be able to run for president

504
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,160
or lose it.

505
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,390
Is Dukakis sticking his head
out that fucking manhole.

506
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,890
That's what it looked like. He was his,
it was his fault. Can eyebrows. That's,

507
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:46,930
that's what screwed up

508
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:53,410
Gary Hart getting fucking in trouble for
banging is a that fucking broad on the

509
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:58,210
boat. I mean, that's what you
get a boat for. Right? All right,

510
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,070
you're losing me. I'm losing Ya. And
then third was when Howard Dean, when

511
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,230
an enemy, we were just like, I fucked
that guy. He got a little excited.

512
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,150
He was like a restaurant. I thought
that was weird. I got to Carolina.

513
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,900
I'm leaving goodbye. It
was an unfortunate, no,

514
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,480
it was an unfortunate moment.
Hey Ann, a joy the movie.

515
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:31,340
I wish I was going to go see
it. Email. What time it is.

516
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,030
I texted all the information.

517
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,750
Do you mean literally what time it is
you saying that and like a black way?

518
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,610
Like you know what time it is?
Jesus. She hates me. Um, all right.

519
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:44,100
That's the first half of the podcast.

520
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:46,350
I have to wait for the
advertising and all that shit.

521
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:47,880
So it's not going to mean shit to you.

522
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:51,570
I'm just going to hit pause and when I
come back I'm going to read a little bit

523
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:55,170
of advertising. Uh, it's 14 to seven.

524
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,510
The nine foot quarterback drops back.

525
00:30:57,511 --> 00:31:00,900
He throws it down and that's
a first down for the Broncos.

526
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:02,750
Yeah.

527
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,000
Jesus Christ.
Look at the size of them.

528
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:06,800
Okay.

529
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,710
It's not even any snow on the
top of his helmet. I mean a guy,

530
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:13,240
he's up up the star cloud.
Sorry,

531
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,840
what's his name?
Osweiler.

532
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,750
Okay.

533
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,680
Do you don't need it took me to this
fucking German bar and I had the best God

534
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,290
damn fucking brought.

535
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,600
And I got one of those giant beer
steins like a fucking asshole. Um,

536
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,820
but whatever it starts tomorrow, man,
I gotta turn this shit around, right?

537
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,200
I've actually, I didn't lose the
weight. Nice fucking play. Um,

538
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:42,710
I didn't, sorry. I didn't,
uh, I didn't lose the weight
I wanted to lose, but I just,

539
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:45,740
I stayed the same, which is pretty
good for fucking Thanksgiving week.

540
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:49,700
I still worked out every day, buddy.
You know, I made a bunch of pies.

541
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:54,020
I had to eat them. You know, what the
fuck was I supposed to do? So, um,

542
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,960
anyways, what I want to do
is, uh, six days a week,

543
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,480
I'm actually going to go to the gym
and I'm going to get on that fucking

544
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:07,070
elliptical for an hour. I'm going to do
it six days a week throughout December.

545
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,130
That's the promise that
I'm making to myself.

546
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,350
And as you can tell by
the tone of my voice,

547
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:14,180
I'm not even remotely thrilled by it,

548
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,830
but I refuse to go right back to the
fucking fat ass cunt fucking weight that I

549
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:21,560
was. Uh, the pies are done.

550
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,420
Most of our Thanksgiving food is
done. So I can go back to my, uh,

551
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,140
yeah,

552
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,720
my thrilling way of eating healthy.

553
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,820
I can't believe I fucking die.
What the why?

554
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,320
I can't believe I did
this to myself again.

555
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,610
You know what the one good thing I do
have is I haven't had a cigar in 15 days.

556
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,840
That's pretty good. So I want to
be that guy or fucking, you know,

557
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,160
once a twice a month I'll have a cigar.
It'd be a special moment.

558
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,053
You know what I mean?

559
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,060
Okay.

560
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,760
Oh God. I just pictured Caitlyn
Jenner and a bubble bath.

561
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:56,620
My wife showed me that fucking picture
and I freaked out. I wasn't ready for it,

562
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:58,580
you know, just showing
it. I was just saying, Oh

563
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
yes.

564
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,820
Woo.

565
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:05,390
Okay.

566
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,470
There you go. Yeah. With your
stupid Movember mustache.

567
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,010
We know people are dying of cancer.
Kill fucking shave that off.

568
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,940
Um, anyway, so I'm just
literally stalling,

569
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:22,700
waiting for this shit to fucking
come in here. I got to, uh, let me,

570
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:23,451
let me hit pause you.

571
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:25,730
I'm gonna hit pause and I'm going
to fucking find out where the were,

572
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,910
where ever I'm going to get to the
bottom of this and now when I come back,

573
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:32,270
you guys are going to get to listen
to me read out loud. All right.

574
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,060
Ooh.

575
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,110
Okay.

576
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,781
All right.

577
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:41,781
By the magic there with the magic of the
pause button on back like a half hour

578
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,043
away,

579
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,390
it's still 14 to seven to
beginning of the fourth quarter,

580
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:53,220
but now it's time for me to read
out loud with that APP. Me undies.

581
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,270
Mandy's.
No more sweaty testicles.

582
00:33:57,271 --> 00:34:02,271
But who to to Mandy's Biondi ga
when you're fucking chest to Kohl's.

583
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,310
And why did I say testicles?

584
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,880
Goddammit is you fucking
take it is nice and dry.

585
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:14,000
You fucking cut my dad a
patriots. Hey, cut. Oh,

586
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,620
go fuck yourself.
No flavor.

587
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,700
Mandy's Mian d you'll feel like
your balls are made out of the lore.

588
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,900
Oh yeah,

589
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,660
yeah.

590
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,030
Um, all right. When you look
good, you feel great everybody.

591
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,740
It's a cliche because it's true.

592
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,060
Mandy's understands this and that's why
they designed underwear specifically for

593
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:38,690
you and your nut bag,
and it makes you look and feel fantastic.

594
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,270
Wasn't a fucking running
back or caught that number.

595
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:44,990
38 who the hell said can't read. He's
got the dreadlocks over his name there.

596
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,260
Please include all of the following.
Shut the fuck up.

597
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:52,580
I'll read anything you write me undies
is the mold is made from modal, modal,

598
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,290
modal fabric.

599
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:58,430
That's twice the softest cotton kind
of fuck you measure that. I don't know.

600
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,700
What do you rub it up against?
Some scientists face. All right,

601
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:03,920
and here's the other side.
Oh, I liked that one better.

602
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,050
How much better on twice as
better Yada. Ah, that's twice.

603
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:12,490
The soft is whatever underwear you're
wearing right now. Balmy undies.

604
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,980
Swear to God. If you cross
and uncross your legs, you're
gonna fucking blow alone.

605
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,570
That's how fucking sausage.
This underwear is just tickling you.

606
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:25,490
Fucking God. Damn p holder. I mean,
Andy says tons of colors and styles.

607
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:29,390
Of course they do. And the only place to
get matching pairs from men and women.

608
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,240
That Jesus, how fucking awful
a relationship are you in?

609
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:34,310
If you fucking underwear
matches your fucking wife,

610
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,350
why don't you wear her underwear?
You fucking pussy.

611
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,980
They even a new design every month I
wear whatever free pair they give me a

612
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:43,200
Goddamn,
but my nuts have never felt better.

613
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,660
Plus we know that paying
for shipping sucks.

614
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,420
[inaudible] has removed that
from the equation. Yeah,

615
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:51,540
by rolling it all into one price.
I hate when they say shit like this.

616
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,500
All orders in the U S and Canada
shipped for free me undies.

617
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,740
Even as a money back guarantee.
If you don't love your first pair,

618
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,620
you keep it for free. Why
would you? You don't love it.

619
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,830
You'll literally have nothing to lose.
So fucking go check it out. All right.

622
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,140
You know,
once you treat yourself,

623
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,980

gross old blade week after we give her

624
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:22,830
thought about that? Why do you do
it? Cause it's a pain in the ass.

625
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:26,370
It cost a zillion dollars. They've
got to unlock it from the case, right?

626
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,980
You don't want to shell out 20 bucks
for a pack of new ones basically.

627
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,670
And it's a pain in the ass even
as to go to the fucking story.

628
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:35,790
Even if they were priced what they were
supposed to price be priced at. Right.

629
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,870
Set of a sentence works. I don't
know. Let's get to the point here.

665
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,170

They sent me over some watches.

00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,790
It was this little crowdfunded brand
that is revolutionizing the watch game.

672
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,990
Oh snap. They started to get a
lot of press from Gq. Playboy.

673
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,790
Hypebeast askmen said they are the
hottest watch company on the market.

674
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:29,910
What the Hell is hypebeast?
Uh,

675
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,300
they're all about this idea that high
quality doesn't have to break the bank and

676
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:37,480
they actually deliver probably why
they have over a million social media

677
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:39,730
followers.
You there?

678
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:42,010
They got some horse showing her
tits while she wears the watch.

679
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:44,740
That's another way to get, that's where
to get another million right there, right.

680
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:50,140
Anyways, quality crafted watches
starting at just $95. You know something.

681
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:52,570
If he tried to get a watch like
this at a department store,

682
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,480
you'd be spending at
least four to 500 bucks.

683
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,220
This style is minimalistic.
It's clean and it's sleek.

She can wear this thing at
the office during the day
or out at the bars at night.

688
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,230
All right.
It's new and it's an all day.

689
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,840

00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,070
mercifully. Mercifully. Was that
a fumble patriot? Say they got it.

700
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,860
Patriots like it.
I don't see the refs flipping out.

701
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,280
He's pleading his case and ain't going
to happen. It ain't going to happen.

702
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,120
Is a fat referee right there.
Bet He's warm.

703
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:13,060
He's got a built in fucking ski Parker
right around his fucking his chest,

704
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,580
right? Oh No. Oh No. We fumbled the ball.

705
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,030
We fumbled the ball and then
the Broncos recovered it.

706
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,090
Oh God. Damn you. God Damn you.

707
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,630
How dare you do that?
Wearing Steve Grogan's old number.

708
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:33,410
I think the Broncos get this ball.
Oh, you fucking cock. You know,

709
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:35,390
I just realized you guys
already know what happens.

710
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:36,850
Okay?

711
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,100
You know I'm sitting around acting
like this suspense here. Oh, Bella,

712
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,080
check doesn't look happy.

713
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,090
21 to seven we had these guys
put away the ball coming back.

714
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,080
40 60 Ted,

715
00:41:49,081 --> 00:41:53,860
you let this eight foot quarterback right
back in or the 40 yard at 36 yard line,

716
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,820
eight foot quarterback drops back
to pass. He throws it down. Hell,

717
00:41:57,821 --> 00:41:59,440
the guy fucking drops it.

718
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,570
Okay.

719
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,020
Came right through a cloud. All
right, stamps.com everybody.

720
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:08,230
We know what the holidays here.
You have time to go to the post office.

721
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,950
You don't have time. Sorry. Do you go
to the post office traffic parking.

722
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,370
It's going to be packed with everyone.
Mailing holiday gifts, some packages,

723
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,950
so do what I do.
All right.

724
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:22,270
You stamps.com instead with stamps.com
you can avoid all the hassles, man.

725
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,970
I go into the post office
during the busy holiday season,

726
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,550
everything you would do at the post
office you can do right from your desk.

727
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:31,180
So there's no reason to go anymore. Well
what can I do on my desk? I don't get it.

728
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,240
Well you can buy and print official US
postage using your own computer printer,

729
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,353
um,

730
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,550
print postage for any letter or
package the incident you needed.

731
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,250
Then the mailman picks it up
so it's easy and convenient.

732
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,520
I use stamps.com to send out
all my posters, whatever.

733
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,430

734
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,010

738

741
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,790
And I am out of fucking, oh,
for fuck's sakes. Tackle a guy.

742
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:23,080
Jesus Christ.

743
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,670
Okay.

744
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,140
Oh God damn it. This fucking parody wine
or we got a lot of injuries and shit,

745
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:30,380
but Jesus Christ is fucking parodies.
Killing me.

746
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:31,660
Okay.

747
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,280
They're killing me, killing me. So the
other night I went to a bar, surprise,

748
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:40,690
surprise after, um, after the,
uh, the king's Blackhawks game,

749
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,760
um, I took the subway back. I
love taking the subway out here,

750
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,340
you know what I mean?
And it's like a real subway now.

751
00:43:48,341 --> 00:43:52,290
Like there's all kinds of fucking
vandalism on it and shit. I remember when,

752
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,600
you know, when I first moved out
here in 2007, you went down there.

753
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:56,680
It was just like,

754
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,570
okay,

755
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,810
you went down that subway.
It's like, wow, this is what

756
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:02,430
okay.

757
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,840
The world would look like if there was
a like a massive plague. Yeah, yeah.

758
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,370
Let them turn the corner and get a first
down and a touchdown. There you go.

759
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,330
Great defense guys. Where to go?
Yeah. Fucking Christ second. Um,

760
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:14,630
anyways,
I was thinking like,

761
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:17,990
this is must be what the world's going
to be like after a giant play gets right.

762
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:21,620
And then we start all over again and
we still know how to do shit right.

763
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:28,160
We still have some reason the
scientists fucking survive. Oh fuck.

764
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,260
Some other scientists survived.

765
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:33,600
That would be the ultimate thing if
the scientist survives. So you like,

766
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,480
you had the same amount of
people on the planet that, um,

767
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:44,730
that existed, you know, when we were
just running around in caves and shit.

768
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:46,623
MMM.

769
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,560
But you have all that, that new technology
then that, that would be perfect. Right?

770
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,510
And,
but you need ditch diggers too.

771
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,780
We fuck is going to plow the
street and pave the roads.

772
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:01,820
Come on miss the extra point.
You fucking cut 21 to 14. Um,

773
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,550
am I the only patriots fan that actually
thinks it's a good thing to, um,

774
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,690
to maybe lose a game and go into the
playoffs and like the panthers be

775
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:14,690
undefeated? Oh yeah, they'll a little
always. I'm just thinking, you know,

776
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,330
get a little less attention.
Just one year.

777
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:21,440
I would love to be treated like the
Indianapolis Colts. You know what I mean?

778
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:21,931
Well,

779
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:26,120
your owner could literally be abusing
drugs and fucking around with everyone,

780
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:30,650
you know? And nobody gives
a shit heavy. Tremendous.

781
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,980
Just live in that quiet time out there.
Wouldn't that be nice?

782
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,900
All I think it would be.
You know,

783
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,750
I also think it'd be nice if I could
get some fucking questions over here.

784
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,020
I don't know what else I'm
supposed to do with myself. Well,

785
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:45,710
what am I up to here for
45 fucking minutes and me
running my Yap and trying to

786
00:45:45,711 --> 00:45:48,290
read out loud. This is getting
ridiculous. You guys won't listen to me.

787
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:50,510
Send a text. This is pathetic. You know,

788
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:52,910
I'm gonna start my fucking Christmas
shopping. I know. I was going to say,

789
00:45:52,911 --> 00:45:55,700
so I fucking came back on the, I know
I'm all over the place. Fuck you.

790
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:58,160
It's how my brain works.
So I'm on the fucking subway.

791
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:01,730
I get off and I meet Jay
law had it this fucking bar.

792
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,900
And it's just one of these cool fucking
bars they're not a lot of people know

793
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:08,390
about. But enough people know
about that. It stays open.

794
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,100
You could fuck a chill out in there,
man. He could have a good time.

795
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:15,890
And it was perfect.
It was a perfect old man fucking bar.

796
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:18,530
I apologize for yawning if I'm
making you tired at work. Um,

797
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,760
and everything's going good.
And then out of nowhere,

798
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,791
this cool bar,

799
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:30,740
they started having karaoke and all these
fucking nerds are going up there and

800
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:34,220
just go and just go in full out singing,

801
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:38,210
horrific saying it, dancing,
just absolutely awful.

802
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,380
Just a horrible display of
communication was going on.

803
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,190
And it was annoying the shit out of me
cause I just wanted a peanut quiet place.

804
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,260
Ah, drinking. Why am I young? And all of
the places drinking of fucking, you know,

805
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,240
a bear or something. I just want to be a
nice quiet fucking place. Right. And um,

806
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,003
the fucking

807
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,770
halfway through them singing
and dance is everything.

808
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:10,810
I actually fucking tap la head and I go,

809
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:16,060
I go look at them, look at them,
law ahead, look at them. I go,

810
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:18,130
that's what's heckling
you on Twitter right now.

811
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,680
Look at, I'm trying to dance. Look at
these fucking animals. Trying to sing.

812
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,950
Look at them. These are the
people. These are the, that blog.

813
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,020
These are the people that get offended.
Oh, look at colors. What? That mail,

814
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:36,640
Michael's bald rock and the scarves.

815
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:38,410
I never understand why
they have the scar or they,

816
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:40,450
are they inside or are they outside?

817
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:45,610
They always make them look like
they got the window open. I had to,

818
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:48,040
I need to take a nap. What the fuck
just happened? You know what it is.

819
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:51,760
I'm getting sleepy waiting
for these fucking rage to
come over here. Um, you know,

820
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:54,790
I'm interviewing Pete Corey Ellie this
week, uh, for the Thursday afternoon,

821
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:59,740
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast where I check in on you. And uh,

822
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:01,780
he has a new special out on showtime.
I believe.

823
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:06,550
This is one of my favorite comics that,
uh, not enough people know about. Um,

824
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,020
great storyteller. And I've known him.
I've known this guy for 20 fucking years.

825
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,240
Back when we used to, um, I worked
in New York comedy club together,

826
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:19,360
late night spots and all that.
Who the fuck is that guy?

827
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:24,250
Brady keeps throwing to the Anti Gronk.
Who is that guy?

828
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,573
Yeah.

829
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,370
Oh yeah. We get a pass interference. Ah,
he comes up first. Loss of the year. Oh,

830
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,950
well what the fuck are you going
to do anyways? Um, you know what?

831
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,080
I'm gonna hit pause again. I'm going to
wait for these things. I swear to God.

832
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:37,690
This is, this is the most fucked
up podcast I've ever done.

833
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:38,770
I'm going to wait for these,
these,

834
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:44,140
I'm coming back reading people going
to prepare your right now. All right,

835
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,440
I'll be back. Well, you know,
if the technology help you
back in a second, right?

836
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,520
Yeah.

837
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,080
All right, I'm back. I don't know if
that's right word that I say. All right.

838
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:56,140
I'm back because it didn't seem like I
left with the fucking editing. Right.

839
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,290
Shut up bill. We get it. He hit pause. Um,

840
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,860
I can't find it. I
guess. I don't remember.

841
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,210
My reads aren't coming through this week,

842
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:08,260
so I'm just going to fucking pick some
shit out here as I go from old email.

843
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:12,250
Somebody sent me something because I
mentioned that I went to chipotle and they

844
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:16,120
had all these signs on the wall about how,
Hey, we don't put any shit in our food,

845
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:19,180
which may be fucking weirded
out. Like, well, you shouldn't,

846
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,480
but I guess so many people do. I
don't know. So I thought, you know,

847
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:28,540
made them seem shady to me. Right? By the
way, it's 2117 at this point in my world.

848
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,380
All for fuck sakes. He gotta
catch that is behind him though.

849
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,900
Um, anyways. Yeah. It says, Hey, bill,

850
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:40,180
just want to drop you a
line about chipotle a,

851
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,640
which you've mentioned
on Thursdays podcast.

852
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,160
Check out this recent article in La Times.

853
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,270
Chipotle is being harassed by a bogus
consumer watchdog group that is actually

854
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:52,480
funded by restaurant alcohol,
tobacco in energy companies.

855
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,870
They are spending millions of dollars
harassed and companies that do or say

856
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:59,200
anything, which goes against the
interest of their clients. Chipotle,

857
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:03,610
a stance against antibiotics in meat
has apparently incurred their wrath.

858
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:08,950
Uh, this firm is engaged in a very
public ad campaign smearing chipotle ace.

859
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:13,030
So I think probably this
think this probably has
something to do with all of the

860
00:50:13,031 --> 00:50:17,260
sides you saw in chipotle a the other day
touting their product and what they do

861
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:19,510
differently. Thanks for the
podcast. Go Fuck Yourself.

862
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:23,320
So I clicked on the link there and um,

863
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,690
and it says, why is it nonprofit shill
for business interest attacking chipotle?

864
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,700
So as the US Department of Health,

865
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:36,650
and you mean human services says that if
you're being pushed around by a bully,

866
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:39,100
walk away and stay away.
Don't fight backs.

867
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,390
Chipola has taken this message to heart.

868
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,550
Evidently they're not fighting these guys.

869
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,040
Chris Arnold is spokesman
for the Burrito chain,

870
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:50,180
told me Chipola has no plans to tangle
with the food industry front group that

871
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:53,600
has run a series of ads critical
of the company's health claims.

872
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:57,800
Uh, the guy says, Chris says
this is a smear campaign,

873
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,840
but we've chosen to take
the high road position.

874
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,650
Most recent ad appeared last week
in the New York Post. It said,

875
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:06,800
chipolte lay is scaring the
public and tricking people.

876
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:11,930
And to thinking that change
meat is healthier because
it's quote antibiotic Free

877
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,960
Blahblahblahblah so
allegedly this is just some,

878
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,230
this is a group that's pretending to
be a watchdog group, but it's actually,

879
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,340
you know,

880
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,290
a spokesman for probably corporations that
put antibiotics in their fucking food.

881
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,813
Um,

882
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,460
okay.

883
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,750
And all of this other shit.
Jesus,

884
00:51:28,751 --> 00:51:31,940
Tom Brady is just acting
like a fucking lunatic one.

885
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:34,720
Are they going to throw a flag and a guy?
I know he's got seniority,

886
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,450
but even as a patriots fan,
what is, yeah, he's, you know,

887
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,190
he's fucking flipping out.

888
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:43,860
Okay.

889
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,830
Yeah, he's losing his cool.
Okay. Like Tommy, Tommy, get
the fuck outta here. Okay.

890
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:48,530
You're the face of the Goddamn leak.
We,

891
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,130
we can't give you a fucking
Gronk seems frustrated. Oh,

892
00:51:53,131 --> 00:51:57,360
are the Broncos cheating? God, it's
all right. That's okay. Are they,

893
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:00,660
are they doing little fucking underhanded
tech days to get an advantage?

894
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:04,320
That's okay. You're in
Denver. It's fine. It's fine.

895
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:10,230
No cheating. No underhanded shit there.
Tom Brady, throw a date out of fucking,

896
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:13,870
what the fuck?
Boy,

897
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,540
this doesn't seem like it's our night now.
It does it 2117.

898
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,200
Now it's fourth and 15. I don't like
it. I'm already drinking already. Good.

899
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:24,650
I heard you got a beer here. So anyways,
these fucking guys, I guess. Um,

900
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,210
I don't understand how
these groups are legal.

901
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,780
Just had been around for years where,

902
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:31,000
okay,

903
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,330
you can put together a fake group.
Like Rick Berman,

904
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,410
executive director of the
center acknowledged that the
organization is funded by

905
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,340
part, by food and beverages company. Um,

906
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,670
he declined to name any of the
contributors and he and the guy goes,

907
00:52:45,671 --> 00:52:49,690
it doesn't matter who pays as long as
what I'm saying is truthful and I'm

908
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:53,950
telling the truth. What a crock
of shit. Um, you know what?

909
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:56,080
I guess so who knows?
I don't even know what to believe now.

910
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,900
I guess now I'll go to fucking Chipola.
Yeah,

911
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,170
I don't fucking know. I, oh,
what is it a belief? I mean,

912
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,320
if you're going to have fucking,

913
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,940
you don't understand this genetically
altered salmon now. Like why?

914
00:53:09,941 --> 00:53:14,440
Like why were we allowed to vote on that?
Why don't they put that to the people?

915
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,360
Why is that the fucking
center? Oh, that's right.

916
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:19,870
Cause they got them all paid
off right now. It works.

917
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,150
Jesus Christ. Do I have to hit pause
again? I do got to find another letter.

918
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,380
This is like fucking a,

919
00:53:27,381 --> 00:53:31,010
this is like what podcasting in the 18
hundreds must've been that been like,

920
00:53:31,011 --> 00:53:34,920
right. I got a bad feeling. We're
going to lose his fucking game.

921
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,690
I built to the Patriots. Help you pay
your bills. Oh, but I mean, you know.

922
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,210
Okay.

923
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:46,040
Did the football team of my city
be back in a minute? All right,

924
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,190
so I guess there's going to
be no reads this weekend.

925
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,340
I don't know what to fucking tell you.
I don't know where the fuck they are,

926
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,880
but I'm not waiting around all night.
All right. There's four minutes left.

927
00:53:55,881 --> 00:53:59,900
We had off the ball and a fucking Taggle
is again right at the line of scrimmage.

928
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,750
Um, some of my drum teacher got
me into tears for fears this week.

929
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,720
I couldn't stand them in the 80s. I
just hated the guy's face. You know,

930
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,690
he, the way he sort of launched his
face at the fucking camera as he sang.

931
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,650
Well,
go to Ma.

932
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,540
Right. And I just couldn't
get past if fucking face.

933
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,370
So first day out.
So he fucking

934
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,740
three and a half minutes left,
come on Patriots, hang in there,

935
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:45,850
get a fork and vehicle vehicle over there.
Um,

936
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,980
that's still won't help us that way.

937
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:51,940
I feel go put out up by fucking seven
points. I like it. So anyways, um,

938
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:56,550
he goes, listen to this, uh, tears for
fears and I was like, oh, like, oh my God.

939
00:54:56,551 --> 00:55:01,320
Tears for fears. Every, every body
wants to rule the world and fight.

940
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,090
You know how many times I've
heard that fucking song?

941
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:06,480
Like now I don't mind tears for fears
because it reminds me of the 80s when I

942
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:10,020
was young, had a full head of hair my
whole life in front of me. You know,

943
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,020
you know, my pants were all puffy.
I was lifting weights every day,

944
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,280
but only the upper body.

945
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:17,840
Okay.

946
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,550
The way you supposed to, oh
no, to Gronk just get hurt.
And he took it. Oh No. Oh No.

947
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:27,290
Oh No, no. Oh No. Ah,

948
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,660
fuck
dude.

949
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,660
Everybody who's even remotely
good on the team, his heart now,

950
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:40,830
except Brady. I shouldn't
have just said that. Oh Jesus.

951
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,300
Oh, they just went to commercial.
Just went black. Ah, fuck. Anyways.

952
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,500
Um, so he says, listen to this
tears for fears. You know,

953
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:51,510
everybody wants to rule the world.
I might get the fuck, you know,

954
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,430
so I'm listening to it for years.

955
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:57,210
I never heard what was going
on with the high hat. You know,

956
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,890
the guy's playing triplets, but he's,
he's playing them in groups of two.

957
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:06,790
He accents every other one.
Listen to it.

958
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,120
I always thought was just dumped
on the talk. I thought it was sad.

959
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,170
I didn't know like the high
I was going to get, get, get,
get, get, get, get, get, get,

960
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,250
get right. Only drummers understand what
I'm talking about, right Juan. And uh,

961
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,670
it's kind of like a, the way you, when
you first learned how to jerk off, like,

962
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:23,620
you know, you just try and
dat, Dat, dat, Dat, dat.

963
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,450
It's the same fucking thing except he
threw it on the high end. But anyways,

964
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:30,190
there's a point in the story that
maybe you guys can relate to this,

965
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:32,430
the most fucked up podcasts,
um,

966
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:37,590
that I've done is he then played the song
about the ladies at some fucking song

967
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:42,550
about women set them free and quit fucking
around with them or whatever the hell

968
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:45,850
it is. Where is it? I downloaded the song,

969
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:48,880
but this is sick ass fucking Phil.

970
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:50,740
Okay.

971
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,650
Towards the end of the song. And, uh,

972
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,260
my drum teacher showed it to me.
You know,

973
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,640
if it goes over the bar line comes out
on the end of one. It's fucking unreal.

974
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,890
And who is it? Who is it
on drums? Phil Collins.

975
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:07,410
Yeah.

976
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:08,670
And I go,
you gotta be kidding me?

977
00:57:08,671 --> 00:57:12,630
People on my podcast is shitting
on Phil Collins talking about,

978
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:17,190
you know how we sucks this sad look at
Gronk. He's down a fuck. This is bad.

979
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,490
They keep saying how he sucks in all
that, you know, and he was going, you,

980
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,740
we talk about, this guy's a fucking
monster. Hear this shit. He didn't, uh,

981
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,790
was it brand x? Oh No, we got
hit right in the fucking knee.

982
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,230
Um, all of that type of stuff. Um,

983
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:41,010
Oh God, that's bad our guys,
I'm sorry I'm watching them.

984
00:57:41,011 --> 00:57:42,030
I'll never do this again.

985
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:46,370
This is like fucking ridiculous that
I'm doing this at the same time.

986
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,580
Um,
but anyways,

987
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,820
I'm covering my eyes cause I don't want
to fucking see his leg knee wiggle like

988
00:57:52,821 --> 00:57:56,980
that again. This is, this is
why people hate Phil Collins.

989
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:58,200
Okay.

990
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,033
All right.

991
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,670
It's because they don't take the
time to act like this is a guy.

992
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:05,850
He's such a fucking
talent that he actually

993
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,083
yeah,

994
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,700
blank and he could go to Berkeley,
play drums.

995
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:12,970
I mean I know he's had health problems
but at the height of his popularity and

996
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,700
the height of his skills,
I should say before he got hurt,

997
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:18,980
like that guy could fucking force health.

998
00:58:18,981 --> 00:58:23,770
I'm looking at Gronk for, for his
health got fucked up. I'm sorry guys.

999
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,500
This fucking guy would have like,

1000
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:30,850
like musicians at Barkley with their
jaws on the fucking ground. All right.

1001
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:34,270
And they're into all his prog rock shit.
But then he was so good,

1002
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:38,620
he could actually fucking write songs
that made 14 year old girls dance around

1003
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:41,800
like Molly Ringwald and breakfast club.
And the problem is,

1004
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,050
is your average jackass,

1005
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,100
classy bronco fans clapping right there,
class act right there.

1006
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,550
The fucking year average jackass
isn't going to listen to the,

1007
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:52,780
to the prog rock stuff.

1008
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:55,690
So all they're going to
listen to his studio and all
that. I remember in the 80s,

1009
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:59,860
I fucking hated Phil Collins. Mid
Eighties. I couldn't stand the guy.

1010
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:03,160
And then when I started playing drums
and I started paying attention to who was

1011
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:06,540
drawing on what, I was like, wow,

1012
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:11,040
this guy dropped on the tears for fear
things. He drums for this in the 80s.

1013
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:12,000
Robert Plant,

1014
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,880
Eric Clapton Zeplin got together,
he played with them.

1015
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:23,340
Um, if he really, I don't think that
they would be bringing this guy along.

1016
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,600
What'd Ya? So I would say listen
to, uh, some of his oldest shit.

1017
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:29,370
That's all I'm saying. I, you know what,

1018
00:59:29,371 --> 00:59:32,660
I'm going to put a clip up of
him just fucking playing, uh,

1019
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,270
just playing drums and uh,
people probably still say that he sucks,

1020
00:59:36,271 --> 00:59:40,140
but I think he's the
shit. Um, but anyways, um,

1021
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,590
can I bail now guys? Can I just
say that? That's the podcasts.

1022
00:59:43,591 --> 00:59:46,300
I'm sorry I didn't have the fucking
materials I need it, but I got a, uh,

1023
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,640
I got an early day tomorrow.

1024
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:51,540
I'm starting to get ready hyping
the F is for family by the way.

1025
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:56,220
I'm getting great feedback on that. And
uh, I just wish it would come out already.

1026
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,160
And uh, we got a premiere
coming up out here in la,

1027
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,550
which I'm really excited and nervous
about. Um, is this weird feeling

1028
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:10,430
when you watch something that you did
and it's being shown on a screen and you

1029
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:12,620
can't fix it and it's
just going to be played.

1030
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:17,621
It freaks me the fuck out because I'm
used to performing live and if it's going

1031
01:00:17,901 --> 01:00:20,600
Shitty, I can speed up, I
can slow down this, this,

1032
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,760
I can make at least try
to make some adjustments.

1033
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:25,970
But like if you're in something and
it's not working with the crowd,

1034
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:31,370
you just got to sit there and
write it out. And um, you know,

1035
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:33,920
it's a, it's a helpless feeling.
So I'm excited about that night,

1036
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:38,000
but I'm also nervous, but I'm going
to be coming back east to do some, uh,

1037
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:42,950
to do some press and then I come out
here and do a few more than I go to the

1038
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:47,240
premiere. But, uh, once again,
it comes out December 18th. Uh,

1039
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:48,080
also as I mentioned,

1040
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:50,870
thank you to everybody who went
and bought Felicia Collins new,

1041
01:00:50,871 --> 01:00:55,490
a blues album off of
iTunes. Uh, what else?

1042
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:59,270
They would want to have all of the
great stocking stuffer for 2015.

1043
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:04,460
His tickets to the, uh, the fourth
annual Patrice O'neil comedy benefit,

1044
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:09,390
um, that's going to be going
down Tuesday, January 26.

1045
01:01:09,391 --> 01:01:11,450
Did I say go and down? I
think I did. You know why?

1046
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:14,930
Cause I was trying to focus on what I
was saying here and not the fact that we

1047
01:01:14,931 --> 01:01:19,220
just had a punt. The fucking ball
away again, um, makes a great gift.

1048
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,160
It's obviously in remembrance of,
um,

1049
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:25,940
one of the great friends I
ever had in life. And, uh,

1050
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,360
I was talking to his mom the other
day and it reminded me of, uh,

1051
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,340
so fucking Patrice O'Neal story.
He called me up one time, right.

1052
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,450
This is back when we were both still
living at home with our parents.

1053
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:43,020
Yeah.

1054
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:47,550
And I pick up the phone, he's like, Bill,
he goes, what are you doing as like,

1055
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,750
I'm not doing anything? He goes,
yeah, let's go up to the, uh,

1056
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:53,040
the square one mall.

1057
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,050
Yeah.

1058
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,050
And I'm like, all right, where's that?
And he's like, it's up near Saga,

1059
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:00,210
sub near the, uh, the cow loon.

1060
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,310
And um, I go, all right,

1061
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:08,860
why the fuck would I go? What do we have
to go up there for it? He goes, well,

1062
01:02:08,861 --> 01:02:10,990
you know, they, they,
I, I need to get a mop.

1063
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:12,463
Okay,

1064
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:17,330
I got you needed a mopey goes. Yeah.
And granted, this fucking mall is like,

1065
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,990
dislike three miles between where
Patrice lived and where I lived.

1066
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,740
And he wants to go all the way out of
his fucking way to go up to this God damn

1067
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,574
mouth.

1068
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,240
Okay.

1069
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,020
And I like what the fuck kind of mall
but kind of mop do they have at this

1070
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:32,280
square one mall and he's like,

1071
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,390
oh he goes one of them square
one mall mops motherfucker.

1072
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:39,750
And he starts flipping out
on me. So I go, all right.

1073
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:41,550
I just finally got it out of him.

1074
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:45,810
He wanted to go up there cause it was
right when they first put cheese in the

1075
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:48,360
fucking crushed a pizza and
he wanted to try it out.

1076
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:56,390
He started laughing when I finally
got it out, he goes, I got to try it.

1077
01:02:56,391 --> 01:02:58,010
I got to see what it's all about.

1078
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,180
So we drove up in the
middle of the fucking day,

1079
01:03:02,181 --> 01:03:07,181
sitting in traffic on route one to buy a
fucking mop and so he could try stuffed

1080
01:03:07,431 --> 01:03:08,264
crust pizza.

1081
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,840
I don't know why I told you that.
I'm just trying,

1082
01:03:13,841 --> 01:03:16,370
I'm trying to fill up the fucking
hour here. If I'd done an hour,

1083
01:03:16,371 --> 01:03:20,240
is it mercifully over g? You guys
saw my Kryptonite right here, man.

1084
01:03:20,241 --> 01:03:21,260
If I don't fucking,

1085
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:22,590
yeah,

1086
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:26,490
if I don't have any questions,
what do I do for that last half an hour?

1087
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:27,871
I have no idea.

1088
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:31,770
In order to realize is how few people
email me and give a fuck everything on

1089
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:33,510
there was just bullshit about uh,

1090
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:39,310
it was either spam or it was
shit about a f is for family,

1091
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,560
one of the other, you got to do
this, you got to do that or a,

1092
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:43,830
it's just a bunch of horse shit.
I,

1093
01:03:43,831 --> 01:03:45,750
I I thought I could scroll
through a couple pages.

1094
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:48,570
I could find something I guess cause you
guys send them to the other email and I

1095
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:52,110
don't even know how to get to it. Oh,
is that what you think bill? All right.

1096
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:55,230
That's been the Monday morning podcast.
This is a completely fucked up one.

1097
01:03:55,231 --> 01:04:00,231
I apologize profusely for
this awful free podcast.

1098
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:00,691
All right.

1099
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:03,450
Before you guys start blogging about
it and you're telling me that you're

1100
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:07,620
offended. Um, anyways, hey,

1101
01:04:07,621 --> 01:04:08,880
if anybody sees that movie creed,

1102
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:11,220
let me know if it's good enough cause
I actually want to see that. Uh,

1103
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:15,630
on two levels. One, uh, I'm a big
fan of Sylvester Stallone and to,

1104
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:19,750
uh, I need to get back in shape. So I
figured whoever's playing, you know,

1105
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,720
still owns always in shape. Even it's
70 fucking 70. He's still in shape. Oh,

1106
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:27,060
how about the fucking Bruins, by
the way, when in five in a row?

1107
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,580
Is that what happened? I think they
did. All right. That's the podcast.

1108
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:32,750
Go fuck yourselves. Uh, Pete
Corey, Ellie this Thursday,

1109
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:37,680
and thank you once again to a Joe Rogan
for me on the Joe Rogan experience to

1110
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:42,000
help me promote the F is for family.
I really appreciate it. All right.

1111
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:43,710
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you next week.
