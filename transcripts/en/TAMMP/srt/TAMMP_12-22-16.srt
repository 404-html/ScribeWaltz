1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,470
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,470
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,503
Dan,

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,260
just checking in on you.
How are you?

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,520
We've got the lovely kneel with
me. Hello. What's going on?

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,410
Oh it's Christmas needy.
I know. Shady sidewalks.

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,420
Pretty ladies.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,840
Everybody walking around
spending money on p Bull Dad.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,530
I know them.
Yeah.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,190
Take Your Dick out and a charger game.

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,610
Robin up.
Bad fucking no,

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,870
I feel so bad for that kid.
Why? Why do you feel bad?

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,730
Cause I have a dick and I know how hard
it is. You know how hard it is? No, sorry.

14
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:56,650
No Pun intended. He was in public. I know,

15
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:58,290
but he just looked like that kind of guy.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,820
He did not talk to look if
he's a fucking like seriously.

17
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:04,540
I mean if he's fucking like you can't
control rubbing his dick and public.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,580
It was entrapment dad,

19
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:11,581
like 12 fucking scantily clad
women and the whole thing to me,

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,570
I should question,
he was at a game.

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,530
There's cheerleaders there and how were
they dressed? Oh, so it's their fault.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,520
How are they dressed?
Cheerleader is the way she leaves.

23
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,560
And always waitress that this,

24
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:25,561
why can't you guys ever be flattered
when a man flash and shit fucking woman

25
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:31,990
never just whipped her who
are out? Because I look so
good. No fucking tee shirt.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,810
It would just fucking make my day long.
She stayed away from me. I mean, he was,

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,740
she was doing his own thing.
You know what's hilarious?

28
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,840
The way you bring in a public?
You know what?

29
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,600
I loved the way he had his arms
crossed. He was like, well,

30
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:47,480
I can't see what I'm doing.
That means no one else can get an idea.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,880
Get a fucking the new technique,

32
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:53,881
and I haven't tried the overhand before
God across the crossover overhead.

33
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:58,870
That's like a Olympic level jerking
off through his pants. You know, look,

34
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:03,790
everybody you know you, that's how
you get caught. You know, you fucking,

35
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,670
you can't shoot you. He got greedy is
what happened. Do you know what I mean?

36
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:08,250
He thought he could. He, you
know, he thought he could do,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,560
I was like fucking 20,000 people
staring right at them yet.

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,190
Yeah. But you know, okay, look what
I'm talking about. Those cheerleaders.

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,510
Why are they out there near?

40
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,670
Why are they really out there to
stir the crowd up to cheer more now?

41
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,030
They're not spreadsheets.

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,760
They dress him like fucking
like just shy of who is.

43
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,210
That's what they're out there for.
They got their cleavage,

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,930
they got their butt cheeks hanging out.
Everything's barely covered.

45
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:42,640
Everything's all shiny, glittery,
glittery and shit. You know?

46
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,480
Hey, what? What? What the fuck
was he supposed to do? You know,

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,820
not touch his dick in public.
That's what he was supposed to do there,

48
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,000
but for the grace of God go,

49
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:56,680
I really try to say that you would be
in a position where you would just be

50
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,470
jerking off through your pants
in like that. I have 300 shoes.

51
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,180
I've never stood next to 12 women all
dressed in the same sparkly outfit

52
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,490
touching their toes in front of me.
Wearing some very user friendly slacks,

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,040
actions, Laxmi Action slacks. They were,

54
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,540
and in art you're saying you
wouldn't be able to control yourself?

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,890
I would say half to touch.
If I have to take my my life savings,

56
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,230
if I have to take my life saving says
no way. I'm betting on black slacks.

57
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,620
I'm not, there's no way I'm
going to put it all on one thing.

58
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:36,130
I don't know what I would do if I had a
couple drinks in me. You know? Who knows?

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,470
Might do the old law. Who knows?
Who Know? Every guy's done that.

60
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,110
Don't watch your common blah.
Oh, absolutely. Now they have to.

61
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:48,520
At some point they did something. They
were in their car. They rubbed one out.

62
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,420
They did something. They weren't a porch.
Well, guys are always talking on a plane,

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,690
on a plane. They went to the bathroom and
just rubbed one out. The amount of men,

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,330
I'm just saying the amount of
fucking men have done it. Yeah.

65
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,240
You got to understand when weight
and when you eat. What's that?

66
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,160
Are you saying that you've gone to a plane
like a bathroom on a plane and jerked

67
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:14,020
off? I swear. No, I have not done that.
What are you going to do? I don't know.

68
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,240
Scold me. Yes. Gold's you,
Shane. I know. Listen guys,

69
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,980
I've talked to other guys, Shit that
they've done or whatever, you know, hey,

70
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,950
we've all done stuff we're not proud of.
You know,

71
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,820
didn't Jesus say he was not fucking
rubbed what out to a fucking cheerleader?

72
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,090
You fucking cast cast the front.
You know what I hate?

73
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:37,720
Is it that that's the worst
at that kid does. Okay.

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,410
Which is basically all he did was
completely humiliate himself. All right?

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,250
And his life is fucking over it. I mean,
isn't that enough? I feel bad for them.

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,730
I do.

77
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,090
Unless he's like really a pervert and
he's running around grabbing women and

78
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:51,220
he's ruining people's lives,
then yeah, then you know,

79
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:54,970
put the kid down like a rabid dog without
a doubt. But if his worst fucking,

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,760
you know, I love about it is
they say men can't multitask.

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,480
There was a man clearly
operating as a security person

82
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,810
while rubbing one out that is
multitasking and one hand free.

83
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:10,270
So I don't really feel like he was at
his full capacity as a security guard

84
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,210
while a lot of securities just presence,
just people seeing you,

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,440
seeing you with the, or taking your
hand. He had his gun in his hand.

86
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,600
I feel bad for them. Don't feel
bad. Just hear those sleigh bells.

87
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:27,040
Ring a link. Tink, tink tingling too.
He's like, you know a homeless child.

88
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:32,041
Come on and rub one up a fucking
cheerleader or to keep it rubbing.

89
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,340
Keep the rubber wild.
Everyone watches. Oh my God,

90
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,440
they're poor bastard. A tweet
that this person has Sunday, man.

91
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,550
I Dunno. Can you stay focused
here? Can I tell you my top?

92
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,700
Can I tell you my story today? I
went out my hair. I went into, oh,

93
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:50,740
you don't have to be here. What are
we watching on TV? Nia. It's the,

94
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,180
it's The Washington capitols first.
The Philadelphia. Oh wait, now I don't,

95
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,270
you know,
said chargers.

96
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,140
Philadelphia fucking fly fly is,

97
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,880
this is rivalry Wednesday. That's
weighing sadness. I can't get up.

98
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,860
I have my feet up and I'm pregnant
and I'm the size of a house.

99
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:13,820
That's why I'm here. No, you're not.
You'll go get an Igloo more than a house

100
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,840
that's you look like asshole.
Oh, just the shootout.

101
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,650
What do you think of the awe? That
was a nice movie. He had him too many,

102
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,310
skipped off his stick.
I don't like the flyer.

103
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:29,050
I don't like the gold numbers on that.
Why you'd fly.

104
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,520
He's got such a great uniform that
kind of fucks it up a little bit.

105
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,440
You know somebody's got to buy it.

106
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,280
You know that guy just paints his
room fucking orange and white. Oh,

107
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,610
biggest fair number. You know, you know
if you dedicate your whole bedroom,

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,230
you know painting it,
your team color,

109
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,980
there's no way you could judge that kid
on the charges because you definitely

110
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,400
wear slacks and you rub one out in public.
Oh sheet.

111
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,000
Just fuck you.
That was a fuck you.

112
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't respect you as a goaltender. Did
he even do a move? He just stared at him.

113
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,160
I was like, this is going
in the net bitch. And that's
exactly what the fuck cap.

114
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:04,660
Look at this Jesus Christ.
Yeah. Dee Dee on it,

115
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,540
right? Yeah. Fred. Fuck you. That's one.
Nothing in overtime. Oh, sorry. Two, two.

116
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,260
All right, here comes another
flag comes down. He Dempsey.

117
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,750
I'll little handbill hot. Too many
fucking Moe's. See what he did.

118
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,970
Claude Euro I liked, I loved the
head fake and hockey. I mean,

119
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:24,810
it works in basketball and fucking
if you're a wide receiver, but he,

120
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:29,470
you're gliding and it just never seems to
work. Uh, he stayed home. He stayed home.

121
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,160
All right. No one wants to
listen to this shit. So anyways,

122
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,110
so I go to target today. You literally
just had your arm over your eyes.

123
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:38,740
Like it was the most torturous thing
ever to listen. I'm exhausted, you know,

124
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,500
I'm fucking tired. Exhausted. Yeah.

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,950
I have friends way fatter than you
and they're doing much more stuff.

126
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,880
I Dunno what you're complaining about.

127
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
I have some few friends that
have like morbidly obese. Okay.

128
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,440
And they're more active than you are?
I think you'd be.

129
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,690
Are they just dating life? Hmm. I Dunno.

130
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,700
It just dating means do they have
another human being and as a nice goal,

131
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,970
Holy Shit. Taking all their food.
We miss sucking all of their energy.

132
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,630
Huh?

133
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,630
Do they have that increasing their
blood flow and their water retention and

134
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,090
there, no, but they probably have a woman
in their life. Fucking Yammer. And Adam,

135
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,760
that was a goal.
I don't think I put the fucking number of,

136
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,540
I don't want to be a part of this podcast.
Oh you don't?

137
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,550
No I don't cause I don't like your
attitude right now. Oh okay. I'm sorry.

138
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,863
How about this?

139
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,010
You don't hear what you're doing right
now is one of the most special things

140
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,110
that has ever been done on the planet.
Granted most of the people on the planet,

141
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,750
we'll do it at some point cause more.
Most people are women,

142
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,410
you know in gas.
Don't like wearing rubbers.

143
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,910
Sorry. Um, all right,

144
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:57,810
so I go to target today was Jesus Christ.
Wade Simmons.

145
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,160
When you told me that earlier,

146
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:03,000
I just couldn't even imagine you
going into target on your own accord.

147
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,690
It just doesn't seem like something was
buying you a Christmas gift from target.

148
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,670
Yeah, from target. And I couldn't
walk and fine what I wanted.

149
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,870
Why are you buying Macra?
You know what?

150
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,620
Let me stop cause I'm
about to sound really.

151
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,390
You're going to sound like what you are.
Well I'm an asshole to twos.

152
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,320
The final score. I'm fucking old.
I can't see what, what's the,

153
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,570
the overtime score we have to
get our eyes examined this year.

154
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,910
I mean 2017 and we both have to
go to the optometrist. Listen,

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,510
I think we have enough
activities together. I already
went to the optometrist.

156
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,050
It's together. It's not an activity.
Then I also said I already got,

157
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,580
I got fucking four and I fly.

158
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,010
I got glasses so I can see the radio
channels and glass. I'd Glenstone.

159
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,280
I got the, I got the half moon things
where like I'm regular. I'm a freak.

160
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,660
I'm regular. I'm a freak. Bye Bye bye
focal. Yeah. I don't know what they are.

161
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,310
Yeah, they're fucking great. I've
never seen you in these glasses.

162
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,310
It's cause you won't fly with me.
You lie with me.

163
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,030
I'll take you over the ocean.

164
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,060
I did fly with you and we'll see some
people sitting on some surfboards as they

165
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:14,820
wait for a fucking wave.
When you fly with me,

166
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,840
I'll fly you wherever.
The Santa Monica Pier,

167
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,870
I entered the whole
snapchat story. It. Yeah,

168
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,520
but she won't go unless some
with an instructor of course.

169
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,810
Well that right then all that
does is motivate me. Goes,
you're a comedian. Yeah,

170
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,510
a pilot and you're a comedian.
That's like saying, I'm a comedian.

171
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,930
I don't have a license to
drive a car. No, it isn't.

172
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,260
What do you mean it's the same thing?
I'm not a professional driver.

173
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,440
I don't drive at the Indy 500 I
don't fly for American Airlines.

174
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,330
You get me in a Robinson 22 where the
old 44 then I'll take you for a fucking

175
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:47,550
ride legally.
Okay.

176
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,670
I don't know if I have enough hours
for 44 but the 22 the two seater.

177
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,450
Yeah. You can try this fucking
woman thing that you guys all do.

178
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,580
Did fuck that yanking on the
fucking range that you guys all do.

179
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:06,060
Anytime you see a guy doing something
new, you got to have that. Hmm. Well,

180
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:09,270
he thinks he fed her, but he'll always
shitting on our fucking hobbies.

181
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,750
That's what you guys do. I would love
for you to get a hobby. Excuse me.

182
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:14,550
You know what? I'm going to get
you. I'm going to get you a flight.

183
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,000
Listen to me when I speak.
I am the man in this relationship.

184
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,410
I'm going to get you a widow and kit.
I'm not shitting on your hobbies.

185
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:27,411
I'm just saying like I would feel more
secure with there is a person there who

186
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:32,040
is a professional flying with us.
Fair enough. That's so bad. It isn't.

187
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,190
It's fair enough. But there's this also
part of it. It, it did. It motivates me.

188
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,350
Motivates me. That's all. Okay.
Wow. All right. See you then. Okay,

189
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,030
well what does that, what do you want
me to do for me? You always say that.

190
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:47,610
What do you want from me? Hey,
what do you want for, you know,

191
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:48,960
I'm going to get you a
little woodwind on the kit.

192
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:51,660
I'm going to get you a fucking hobby.
Know,

193
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,270
know what my hobby is dealing with you.
Oh snap.

194
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,480
When we return near with
more fucking snappy answers,

195
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,260
just tell your target story. Now I'm
going to find you a hobby. What about,

196
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,550
what about, uh, what's that thing that
had happened to Bobby and ghost? You know?

197
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,360
Oh God. Oh. Tibo Marlow.

198
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,970
When Patrick Swayze sat on Whoopi.
Oh,

199
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,250

Well,

200
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,080

You can feel Patrick Swayze. No, no,

201
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,630

202
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,630
there's one a sick. Fuck
it. It's one of those boots.

203
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,060
One of those stupid fucking
songs is one of those songs.

204
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,110
Is it woman and read and
you're talking about what?

205
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,020
She's parts with me while singing the
soundtrack to another Patrick Swayze

206
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:50,680
movie. You've got near to Patrick
Swayze movies. Yeah. Reside there.

207
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,230
That's still pretty good.
I'm in the ballpark.

208
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,490
Patrick Swayze and made a lot of movies.
Um,

209
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,370
you're talking about when the night
no. Here's cool. No, he wasn't.

210
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:04,020
And there's a body by the train tracks and
stand by me. Was He in San by me? Yeah,

211
00:13:04,021 --> 00:13:06,330

with key for Sullivan. Hey,

212
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:10,020

216
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,000

sad. So I'm not going to do that one.

217
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,070
And then the other guy, hey, I'm going
to fuck it. Then there's the other dude,

218
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,230
right? Who does the
Thriller Dance Still? Right?

219
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,640

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,020
But Hulu Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

221
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,050
It's fucking 2016 I'm still doing
when this stupid fuck a dance.

222
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,040
I feel like you're talking
about Corey Feldman.

223
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:52,400
If he wasn't not in stand by
me that he was was he was,

224
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,190
he was the dude with the fucked up here.
We wanted to fight with the glass.

225
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,640
Oh yeah. Yeah. I liked him.

226
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,790
So they would go originally you were
talking about goes and then you started

227
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,490
singing the song from dirty dancing.
Don't tell me cause I'm going to get it.

228
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,990
I'll get it by the end of the podcast.

229
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,010
You know what are my goals in
2017 I'm going to get a fake id.

230
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,300
I'm going to have fake id for all
those fucking times. I'm on the road.

231
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:19,440
I want to use a gym and they all can.

232
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,950
We need an ID and they want to
take a fucking copy of my life. No,

233
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,550
I had a fake ID is illegal.
Right? I'm going with,

234
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,110
my name's going to be frank Fallujah.

235
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,640
I like alliteration. Bill Burr, Frank
Falucia, right? Teddy pendegrass.

236
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,050
All right,
so I go and do I go into target,

237
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,190
right to buy you a gift that
evidently you, you're up above

238
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,600
that was going to get you a flan
off right next to the bicycles

239
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,080
targets so fucked up. It's like, what do
you guys want to be? I don't like target.

240
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,290
They like that person who just morphed
themselves into what they youth,

241
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,690
they think you want them to be
so they can be friends with you.

242
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,520
It's just like pick a fucking angle.
It's like you walk in,

243
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,560
you're looking at TVs in the
next to cereal. What the fuck is,

244
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,760
this is like a fucking yard
sale, but everything's, no, um,

245
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,880
all right, so I go into target and I'm
looking for your fucking shit and every,

246
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:22,340
you know what's funny about target is
everybody looks like they work there.

247
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:25,850
So you got to ask like nine fucking
people who work here and they get all

248
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,940
offended, but you look like you don't,
you don't find the clothes here.

249
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:32,840
Your ass all. If they're wearing a
red shirt, they work at target. Yeah,

250
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,060
but there's different levels.
It's like the military.

251
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:38,180
There's different kinds of red shirts
does the people with the Pete Carroll

252
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,630
dockers and then the red shirt
tucked in there like management.

253
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,830
Then there's the grumpy,

254
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:46,040
filthy people who got to like fucking
unload the trucks all day and they never

255
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:46,874
let them go home.

256
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:52,130
Then I'm going to answer shit and then
this sort of dumpy women walking around

257
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,080
like, I dunno. I Dunno
what they're thinking.

258
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,800
It's like they took a pot cookies and
every once in a while you meet that one

259
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:01,820
that's on the ball. Who's not going to
be there long scar that that was new.

260
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,200
Sorry.
That's a highlight.

261
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,980
That was a nice fucking wrap around goal.
Oh, you got to love the wrap around.

262
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,770
Oh, he saved it. He had saved that
fucking thing. Did he? That's a goal.

263
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,770
That's a goal. I would love to
review the flood completely.

264
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:23,570
Sleuths so like as I'm leaving,
I bought you a high end gift.

265
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,620
They're at target,
right?

266
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,260
I bet your floral apron with a
frozen burrito in the pocket and

267
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,780
I got to keep it in the
freezer until right before,

268
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,360
twice the night before Christmas
and all through the house.

269
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,370
Not a creature was stirring except for
this bald freckled fuck taken a frozen

270
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:47,540
burrito. I'm sticking it in the stocking
by the way. Underrated stockings,

271
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,700
stockings.
I don't know about you guys.

272
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:53,690
Like I know some people are like they
start with the stockings or that we always

273
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:57,950
end on the stocking and the stockings
always like the bump bump, a bomb, Bam.

274
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,300
Like you already got your cool gift.

275
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,570
Then you go over to the stocking and
it's like a, it's like a, you know,

276
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:05,900
a gift certificate to a book club and
you've got to sit there acting like,

277
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,040
oh yeah. Thank you. I get to read.

278
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,910
Awesome. What else is in
here? Oh, new socks. I mean,

279
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,860
who could use these gold toe? Oh,
you shouldn't have. Literally,

280
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,540
I would rather wear one stock and walking
down the street than a pair of gold

281
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,310
told socks just because
of what they represent.

282
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,290
There's a lot of blood in shame on
all those gold toed socks. You know,

283
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,290
DME hookers have laid on motel rooms.

284
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,860
And the last thing that
they saw with somebody,

285
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,500
bloody gold told sock
walking towards them so bad,

286
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,120
so bad during the holiday season,

287
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:47,121
silver bells leaving
your family going to get,

288
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:52,650
oh hooker,
the goose cools double life.

289
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,510
Serial killer.

290
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,470
Cops show up one day and you confess to
40 other killings and your wife says,

291
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,060
who the fuck are you?
What did I do with the last three decades?

292
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,060
And you stare at her with
no feeling behind your eyes.

293
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,970
Anybody got you? Go on this one.
They're Nini. You're egging me on here.

294
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,950
Like your dark holiday care off.
Cause I hate that song.

295
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,230
I hate silver bells.
It just goes on for,

296
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,650
it's like it's just song and a fucking
loop. There's no way. This is one song.

297
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,420
Oh, did fucking fish record
this fucking thing? It's like
20 minutes long. Then, um,

298
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,560
silver bells and I hate Jingle Bell Rock.

299
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,520
It's just such an attempt of like white
people trying to be here. You know,

300
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,980
we're going to, jazz is one, a Ginkgo,
managing demand. Jingle Bell Rock. Hey,

301
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,863
jingle bells.

302
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,370
It's that thing where you kind of just
shaking your head and your ass at the

303
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:05,910
same time. You know, as you're snapping
your fingers with your fucking loafers,

304
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,600
that's when somebody, you know, if
you're at a party and there's a piano,

305
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,270
when somebody knows how to play, they're
going to sing that at the holidays,

306
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,130
you know?
Oh yeah.

307
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:17,100
And then there's going to be the
undersexed fucking 20 year old,

308
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,150
20 years married chick with the red
wine teeth always start dancing.

309
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,450
And it's like, all right, all right,
let's get her outta here. Get a cow.

310
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:27,420
Caricom send her home.

311
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,700
I just don't know why they stay
together. Um, so I'm leaving target.

312
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,620
I'm leaving target and a,
it looks fucking confused.

313
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,440
He was getting interviewed here. Huh. Um,

314
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,930
so I'm leaving target
and as I'm walking out,

315
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,480
all of a sudden I just hear
this guy go on, get off me.

316
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,650
And I look over and there's two target
ladies there at the Pete Carroll level of

317
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,590
the target thing and a in a,
in a target guy.

318
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,050
Two women in a guy are just
fucking grabbing this dude
and they're dragging them

319
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:04,890
into like this windowless office and
the guys going, this isn't legal.

320
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,260
And they just dragging them
in and everybody's just
watching like what the fuck?

321
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,330
And then like the door starts to close
and then it opens your fucking clothes as

322
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:16,430
again and then another.

323
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,430
And then they finally got him to calm
down and they closed the door and this

324
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,770
older manager just closed
the door and he did that.

325
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,590
You know it's smile you do when you
walk by a stranger because you're hoping

326
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,440
they don't have an ax. You know that
little purse lip. We kind of do.

327
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,850
You lift your eyebrows up. He kind of did
that like well that's the end of that.

328
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:35,310
And it's like that's an
American citizen in there, sir.

329
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,910
What the fuck just happened?
But nobody said anything cause its target,

330
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:43,890
you just don't expect it.
So I said to the lady next to me,

331
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:47,710
I go, did he steal something?
She goes, no, I don't think so.

332
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,410
And then somebody else goes,
I think he's autistic.

333
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:51,880
And he was acting a little weird.

334
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,800
Drag them into this by
me. The back room. Yeah.

335
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:01,510
I don't think that that's makes sense. It
doesn't make sense. Does it make sense?

336
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:06,511
But I feel like why would they take
it upon themselves to drag him away?

337
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:07,900
Why wouldn't they call the police?

338
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,680
I know it looked like that Scientology
show that you're watching that the stuff

339
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:14,920
that they do to people, except
it was a target. You know?

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,310
I wonder if one of those people
were going to do a two TV show,

341
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,800
exposing target and what?
What really goes on there?

342
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,900
They probably wanted him to work
all three shifts on Christmas.

343
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,870
He said no, they just dragged them in
there. They don't fuck around at target.

344
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,930
I guess not.
Are you fucking kidding me?

345
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:36,700
Did that guy just score
from the other side of the,

346
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:39,640
I'm just watching the highlights.
That's pathetic. And that was it.

347
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,020
And that was the end of a,

348
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:46,021
and then I just sort of walked out and
I have to admit when he rolls of paper

349
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:48,700
towel. Yes. Merry Christmas Neal.

350
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,060
I'm expecting a lot of big tears
next year. Big Tears. Big Tears.

351
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,750
It's been someone who was,
I should probably read some
advertising here. I'm like,

352
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,120
oh, this is fucking, what a great
night we got the fire going. Oh,

353
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,550
tell them how much I like Eggnog.
A lot of people don't like Eggnog.

354
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,420
I like you love Eggnog. I
love now too. Well what it is,

355
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,340
this was always shy about
it cause I was like, yeah,

356
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,380
I don't know if it's my thing,
but it's delicious. Yeah,

357
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:18,990
but people pour you a giant fucking glass
of it. It's, it's like in a, it's a, uh,

358
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,300
like a, what are they not an aphrodisiac?
What'd they say? What's that shit?

359
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:26,950
You're drinking Italy after
year after year. That's what
it is. But with did Jeff.

360
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,860
Steve, that's it. Yeah.
Digestive. You have a big meal.
You sip on a little egg. Nog

361
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,380
It's like mountain ice cream.

362
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,293
And I like it.

363
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,260
Wait, hold up. The podcast where
I type in my fucking park, Jess,

364
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,170
it tastes like Malkin melted ice cream.
And I like it.

365
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,840
I know,
I'm sorry,

366
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,700
but can I spelled stocking that look
right to me now when I look back and I'll

367
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,550
be the dumbest person
ever. S T, O, l, K, I,

368
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:58,790
n stocking stuffers,
underrated.

369
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,330
Let's see, I wrote some ideas. Silver
Bells, kid jerking off Christmas break.

370
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:08,920
Stoeckle Stouffer's underrated. Oh, oh,

371
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,760
this is the one I wanted
to talk about when I was,

372
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,650
I went into best buy afterwards.
Oh,

373
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:16,940
I was hitting all the corporations
and I'm standing in line,

374
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:21,941
this pathetic line of fucking people just
waiting till the last minute to shop.

375
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:24,350
We're all fucking hate in
life and I'm still, you know,

376
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,230
and you going through like the Disney
world line where you got to fucking go all

377
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:29,650
the way back and forth, back and
forth. So I'm standing, I'm final.

378
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:33,710
The last rung and this guy walks up
to stand in line behind 18 people.

379
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,920
You know what his tee shirt said?
Wa do epic Shit.

380
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,890
First of all, what kind of a fucking
adult? Where's that stupid tee shirt?

381
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:49,470
Why would you wear it? Going to, to
stand in line at best buy, right.

382
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,840
That's a new fucking thing where people
try to motivate people with their

383
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:57,620
workout videos and shits, like get the,
you know, like they're doing it for you.

384
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,950
Like, what am I supposed, when I see
that guy with that t shirt like, wow,

385
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:04,340
that guy's doing epic shit and he's
standing in line at best buy. No,

386
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:05,570
he's taking a break.
He just,

387
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:08,360
he was doing that point break
shit earlier up in Santa Monica.

388
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,500
Like you got helicoptered out.

389
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:12,770
Just some sort of fucking a
burning man out in the ocean.

390
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:15,080
Whatever they do when they know
big waves coming, you know,

391
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,100
everybody else runs for cover. They
go, we got to go right out at it, man.

392
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,600
Another Patrick Swayze movie. Yes
it is. I saw the remake of it.

393
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:28,070
I enjoyed it, you know. Oh
yeah. Was it about surfing?

394
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,400
It's not about anything. It's
like fast and furious. It's,

395
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:34,370
it's just about fucking fast.
And fairies is about the cars.

396
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,170
A point break is about, you know, the
stunt man and everybody do, you know,

397
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:42,590
in the flying squirrel suits
and riding waves and shit,

398
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,190
that's all it's about, you know?
Yeah. I've never seen that movie.

399
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,140
Possibly hot women with mysterious
attitudes who can't walk a straight line

400
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,150
without crossing one foot
in front of the other.

401
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,190
They're always in some rainy alley.

402
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,030
Possibly. It went, it was
mysterious. Added to. Yeah.

403
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,430
They always fuck under
these fire escapes and Shit.

404
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,890
It's the same fudges alley,
whatever that is.

405
00:25:08,891 --> 00:25:13,580
It's like in every fits in
every fucking movie. Ah, hell

406
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,040
no. When a fog to next
to this fucking dumpster.

407
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,383
Oh,
uh,

408
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:27,220
so rad when you bend me over. No. Um,

409
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,400
yeah.

410
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,960
They fucking the same alley where that
dude from brothers got Scott his throat

411
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:36,180
cut in that fucking,

412
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,740
that movie where the guy who was always
screaming yeah. Goes everyone. No,

413
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:41,840
not everyone.
He goes up.

414
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,470
Remember that to Sean Penn?
No,

415
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,090
the guy who plays a commissioner
Gordon Gary Oldman. Okay.

416
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,900
He was in a, but it was based on
you talking about the professional.

417
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,440
It was just when he goes, no, no,
no. It's not that one I fucked up.

418
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:03,520
It's the one that was, it was based
on that book. The westies, I dunno.

419
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,300
Uh, who's Ed Harris was
fucking great in it. And uh,

420
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:11,410
this was before that dude did fucking
boogie nights. He's on, he's on,

421
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,680
he's on a adult swim. He's in like in
every fucking movie he played chest,

422
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:22,600
Roswell, bronzy railing, John C. Reilly,
when he gets his throat slit days.

423
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:24,550
Christ.
So low long fucking way to go.

424
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,540
That's the same fucking alley where all
those women get fucked in all those,

425
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,540
those movies, you know.
Okay. All right. What was,

426
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,580
what is this song when they make the,
make the pot

427
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,920
unchained melody.
Whoa.

428
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,410
Oh, they played that song.
Whether I'm making a pot.

429
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,120
No wonder I know fucking could get
through that movie. Ma. Darlene.

430
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,440
I just felt your head going down on my
shoulder while the movie's on. Just ugh.

431
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,070
I hate when women do that.
I always hate it when I was on a date.

432
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,370
And you deliberately took him to some
fucking Schmaltzy shit cause you knew they

433
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,910
wanted to see it and then it comes that
stupid fucking moment in the movie,

434
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:10,720
whatever. What's decided song go. It's
just sing the song. Well I tell you what

435
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,290
Manda right.
And then you feel it.

436
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,810
Stupid head starts going under
your shoulder and you know,

437
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,240
you're kind of excited cause
she's becoming intimate.

438
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:24,360
But there's another party that
just wants to fucking do what?

439
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:27,540
Tido me did the off Samuelson when
they were standing in front of the net.

440
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,303
All right.
That's it.

441
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,590
So slowly we're baking fun pot
making you don't tip it over.

442
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,940
I knew it was one of those things wasn't
will Ferrel's father and that band and

443
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:54,520
what van? The righteous brothers.
Is that the righteous brothers? Yes.

444
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,520
Are the righteous brothers
white? Yes. Oh, Jesus Christ.

445
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,120
Okay. I didn't know that. All right.
The white shirt, the white, just

446
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,830
the righteous brothers are white. I
didn't realize that. Okay. All right.

479
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,660
[inaudible] dot com slash burb all right,

480
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:23,190
distilled genes,
Dstl d.

481
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,810
All right. Uh, okay.

482
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,840
The problem with jeans is that the really
good parents cost two and 300 get the

483
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,480
fuck outta here is $300 for jeans.

484
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,040
What are you ric flair easily.

485
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:39,940
And the bargain brands just fall apart
or look terrible. That's dad jeans.

486
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:40,631
Distilled.

487
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:45,010
Pronounced distilled has revolutionized
the fashion industry by creating

488
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,710
timeless luxury grade denim.

489
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,270
So you get genes that would cost you
hundreds of dollars starting at 65 bucks.

490
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,460
How do they do it? By refusing to work
with it. The Guy, I know how they do it,

491
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:59,220
they scream at the kids in the sweatshop.

492
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Make a faster by refusing to work with
department stores and retail middlemen.

493
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,990
There's no markup, no bullshit, just
great jeans at an unbelievable price.

494
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:12,670
Just go to distill gene stock out,

even c list celebrities like me.

502
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,700
Look at that a little self deprecation.

503
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:50,430
I've got a pair of the raw denim
and that the fit as a mate you want,

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,480
You dig and you said they look good and
look great on you. Yeah, no bull said.

506
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,280
Okay. All right. Well,

507
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:01,030

512
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,690
What's that lumbar? What's the thing
in your vagina that begins with an Elf?

513
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,170
Dbs. Lavia there you go.
I never took a health

514
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,350
plan of the falls. I know how
to, um, I didn't want to say,

515
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,630
I didn't want to say, listen, I
know what to do with it. Okay.

516
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,090
How did I like Helix,
Helix and to

517
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,010
God, I cannot believe you haven't
learned how to pronounce this word yet.

518
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,680
Shut up. You're unique. You're, oh, I like
how they just butter you up right here.

519
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,630
Helix hate Nia. I don't know
if I ever told you this. What?

520
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,880
You're unique. You don't. You are. You
don't walk like everyone else, right?

521
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,530
Talk Lock. This sounds like a drill
sergeant. Good. I'll teach you to walk.

522
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:07,500
But everyone else talk like everyone
shoot shit or like anyone else.

523
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:10,950
So why is your mattress
one size fits all well,

524
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:14,250
because there's an average height of
human beings. They're mass produced.

525
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:16,830
It's a cost effective thick.
All right?

526
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:20,610
Because it truly customized mattress
will cost you five to 10,000 bucks right

527
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:22,290
now. Go to helix, sleep.com.

528
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,920
Answer a few simple questions
and they'll run a three d book.

529
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,240
Just read it. It was just funny.
The questions they're gonna ask you.

530
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,500
You know you actually have a unique body.
You don't have the ball.

531
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,830
Can you balls hang up and over your leg?
Okay,

532
00:33:37,831 --> 00:33:40,770
this bed mattress is going to
have to be a little wider. A,

533
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:45,771
they run a three D biomechanical model
of your body through the proprietary

534
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:50,680
algorithm they develop with the help of
the world's leading era Gomix and bio

535
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:54,810
mechanics. This is the fucking
Illuminati mapping your whole body.

536
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,970
It is. Words are too big for you, Huh?
Yeah, they are. What does era era go?

537
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,140
Nomics what does that mean?

538
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,680
Ergonomics.

539
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,670
Isn't that like how you have a chair
that's air denomic nominally correct.

540
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:09,040
Like it's,
it's good for your back.

541
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:12,580
Like it's supports all your back and like
the proper way all your vertebrae and

542
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:15,010
stuff.
Isn't that what it means?

543
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,800
What is biomechanics
mean? Oh, I have no idea.

544
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,500
I mean mechanics are

545
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,460
mechanics. Bio, it's like biology.

546
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:33,630
So the mechanics of the body, Ooh,
that's probably what it means. I'm like,

547
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,690
you sound like the fifth family member
on family feud when all the good answers

548
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:41,630
are gone and you just say
some dumb shit and like, hey,

549
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,050
you're right.
Show me mechanics at works in Bios.

550
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,780
Actually the biomechanics, they both
sounded right to me, but I'm a morning.

551
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,090
He looks, customers report a 30%
improvement in overall sleep quality.

552
00:34:56,091 --> 00:35:01,010
How do you know you were asleep? Um, and
for couples, they customize each matches.

553
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,430
Each side of the mattress though,

554
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:04,860
you're going to talk about
fucking your magister arrived.

555
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,390
Or if a couple of lady you're
bang on this fucking thing.

556
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,710
I'm common 30% faster.

557
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:17,420
Your mattress arrives at your door and

suits with those giant

Nia and I fucking threw it out.

deal for that game or show you want to go

00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,170

588
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,040
yes, this is one of my favorite times
of year because I get to, you know,

589
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,990
hang at home for once,
you know,

590
00:37:12,991 --> 00:37:17,991
sit by the fire and I got all the sports
packages [inaudible] asked me if I got

591
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:22,170
the NHL Center ice package. I yes, I do.

592
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:28,620
Ask me if I got the NBA hardcore,
whatever the fuck they call it of Cory.

593
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,010
I've got that toe

594
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,210
and asked me if I got an NFL
Sunday ticket. Nfl. Yes I do.

595
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,770
I got all three so I can watch my
patriots, my Celtics, and my Bruins.

596
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:43,590
And what I've noticed with the
Celtics and the Bruins. Okay.

597
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,190
If the Celtics Luiz Isaiah Thomas,

598
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,710
it's fucking over.
They lose,

599
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:52,450
like they lost like fucking three in a
row and he comes back and all of a sudden

600
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,390
when that Memphis game
was fucking incredible,

601
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,830
but my DVR shut off with like five seconds
to going over time. I think we want.

602
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,640
Um, and then the Bruins,
if Charlie goes down,

603
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:05,520
like that's been the thing the whole
time though. But, um, um, you know what?

604
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:08,700
I've been bitching about Michael Carneal.
When you rebuild a team,

605
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,380
it takes at least two to three seasons.

606
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,880
So we'll see which direction he's going
in. I don't know. I don't fucking know.

607
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:18,100
But it's been tough to watch him
this year cause I love him and, uh,

608
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,740
and I loved a lot of the guys they got
rid of and it's hard watching them on

609
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:24,660
other teams doing fucking great,
you know,

610
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:26,280
I know there's a salary
cap and all that shit.

611
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:30,150
I'm going to quit fucking
pitching. Um, so anyways,

612
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,840
I guess that's the podcast here
and you're going to fall asleep.

613
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,700
I know. Oh Jesus. Well, you know what?

614
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm glad I knocked this thing
out before you fell asleep. Um,

615
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,080
everybody has no energy. It's all
right. Everybody have a merry Christmas.

616
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,240
Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah.
Happy Kwanzaa. Happy holidays.

617
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,180
Jewish people. I help you have
the best fucking Chinese food.

618
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,760
That sounds great though.
Not spending all that fucking cash.

619
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:01,120
You just have Chinese food. Go to a
fucking movie. A great, does that sound?

620
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:04,300
That sounds great. I liked that. I
think we ought to add that celebration

621
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,780
on the 26th right. We'll do
that. Merry Christmas everybody.

622
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,900
That's it. Happy New Year. I'll
talk to you on Monday anyways,

623
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,430
but I hope you guys all have a great,
happy,

624
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:18,410
safe one and all that stuff and I thank
you for everybody who's been listening

625
00:39:18,411 --> 00:39:22,870
in all year. Uh, it is a privilege to
do this. All right. Go Fuck Yourself.

626
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,250
Get counts and I'll talk to you on Monday.
Okay,

627
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,330
please.
You

628
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:55,030
can,
as long as

629
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,790
you can sit around and wait for the phone

630
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,440
waiting.
Who's someone you

631
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,220
sit around and wonder what to mom?

632
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,563
Ooh.

633
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,873
Hmm.

634
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,520
[inaudible]

635
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,970
uh,
uh,

636
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,690
uh,

637
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,890
happy holidays.

638
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,870
It's the Monday morning podcast.

639
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:40,250
How did you like that little second
grade fucking recital? That was horrible.

640
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,160
I thought it was going to
get through it in one take.

641
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,700
I should have been asked and I shouldn't.
That's like the kind of guitar playing,

642
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:50,060
you hear it,
a benefit and whatever the benefit is,

643
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,950
like whatever the disease it's for.

644
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,730
Like if that guitar playing,

645
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:59,990
like I would have the disease that you
guys were raising money for and then in

646
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:02,570
the end they wheeled me out
and they'd be like, Hey,

647
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:06,440
here's a guy who has the disease that
we're trying to stop and now he's going to

648
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,380
play the guitar for you.
That's how I just played the guitar.

649
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,600
But I don't give a fuck.
You know,

650
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,440
I can't help it know I can't help it.
If from fucking,

651
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,850
not even going to say multitalented,
it's not the word.

652
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,890
What's the reverse of
multi one dimensional?

653
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,500
I can't help it if I'm a one trick pony.
Anyways,

654
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:29,210
this is the Monday morning
podcast for the, uh, uh,

655
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:32,840
the week of Christmas,
which is why I had my little recital.

656
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,140
Um, you know what's
hilarious is last year, um,

657
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,720
besides my guitar playing, um,
it was last year I took off.

658
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,560
I didn't do a podcast on the week of
Christmas or the week of new years and

659
00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:50,540
everyone thought it was, cause I, you
know, I was taking a vacation or whatever.

660
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:55,430
But the reality is is is because I was
traveling and holiday travel sucks.

661
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,110
So as many of you know, this year I
was like, you know what? Fuck this.

662
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,060
Fuck everybody.

663
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,200
I'm not going home for the holidays
because I'm not dealing with that planes,

664
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:08,360
trains and automobiles shit.
And I got to tell you, man,

665
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:11,090
it's the smartest
goddamn thing I ever did.

666
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,520
I don't know what that says about me,

667
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:17,150
but I'm not spending it with my family
and I am absolutely fucking elated.

668
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,180
You know,
I'm not saying I don't like my family,

669
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,950
I'm just saying I don't need to go see
them when everyone else is going to go

670
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:29,750
see their family because uh,
cause it sucks.

671
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,640
I had a buddy of mine see,
you know,

672
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,130
trying to fly back east with
all this snow and all this shit.

673
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:36,890
He's down in Orange County calling me up.

674
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,800
That same situation I was in last year.

675
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:44,790
Do you believe it would plea?
Go to two old blue,

676
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,730
blue, blue, blue, blue. And
I was like, thank God, thank
God I made the right choice.

677
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,500
Fucking excited. I got a
Christmas tree, I got stockings,

678
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,000
I got a Ukulele. I mean, what, what, what,

679
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,070
what do you need with Morty
of fucking neat? I don't know.

680
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,170
Some inner peace maybe, but I don't
want to get greedy. Um, I'm, I'm,

681
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:09,620
I'm two inches away from
getting a dog. People, I know,

682
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,720
I've said it for about
two years on this podcast,

683
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:15,230
even though I've only been doing them for
a little over a year, I'm freaking out.

684
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:19,880
I'm terrified to get a dog because
I'm like, you know, what, if, uh,

685
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,930
what if I want to take off for a
couple of days? I mean, I don't,

686
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,460
I've never had to take care of
anything in my life, you know, and uh,

687
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,610
never been at a movie going, Oh my God,
what if taking a shit in my living room?

688
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,360
You know,
I don't want to be thinking that,

689
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,510
especially at this time of year when
there's all these great movies are out,

690
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,180
you know, speaking of which, um,

691
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,050
somebody sent me a great email and said,

692
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:48,940
we'll get back to the dog thing.
I want to get a dog.

693
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:52,650
And if I get a dog and getting a fucking
bulldog and I'm going to a breeder,

694
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:57,300
I know a lot of people. I'm going to,
God, you should rescue a dog. You know,

695
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:01,320
I don't have time for you. You
understand me? That's your cause.

696
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,360
You go down there and you, you, you
get all those, you get all those dogs,

697
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:09,480
you go down and you get them that I've
already learned how to fetch and they're

698
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:13,380
just completely over everything.
Nothing's exciting anymore.

699
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,750
You know what I mean?
I mean,

700
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:18,850
why don't I just pick up a fucking
divorce waitress with three kids that hate

701
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:20,140
her, you know, and,

702
00:45:20,141 --> 00:45:23,910
and bring that into my life and I'll
just surround myself with people who are

703
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:26,850
just fucking over everything.
You know?

704
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,280
Sometimes I just really say stupid
shit. I don't, I don't feel any of that.

705
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:33,390
You know what,
I went down to the shelter.

706
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:36,800
I wanted to rescue all the dogs and
I don't fucking know. I don't know.

707
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,560
I'm talking about, I'm just
trying to kill time. People has,

708
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:42,620
I'm trying to find the thing
about the movie reviews. Yeah.

709
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,250
Somebody send me an email and they said,
hey bill,

710
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:46,800
I haven't heard movie reviews in a while.

711
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,100
Now some of my longtime
listeners of the podcast,

712
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,690
remember we stopped people
write in because I went and
I saw a shitty movie one

713
00:45:54,691 --> 00:45:55,820
time and I was pissed.
You know,

714
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,940
I lost my 10 bucks or whatever
the fuck they're charging now. Um,

715
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,200
so people started, you know,
thrown in that 2 cents. So
here's some movie reviews.

716
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,230
This guy said punisher war zone
and he gives it three stars.

717
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,660
Punisher warzone what the fuck is that?
Um,

718
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,220
evidently he says there's tons of
over the top violence and shooting.

719
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,640
It doesn't try to be realistic at all.
Like the last one,

720
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,770
the first punisher warzone tried to be
real. That's funny with that name. Uh,

721
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,540
the story was very basic
with no real twist. You know
what? I can appreciate that.

722
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,540
Okay. So it's like commando.
They fucked with them.

723
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,800
He gotten his Bronco and he kicks
ass and then he wins. I like it.

724
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,290
I'm going to, I'm, you know
what, I'm not going to go see it,

725
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:44,130
but I will watch it on. Um, that'll
be the new part of the movie reviews.

726
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,350
I'll let you know if I'm going to
see it. I'm going to see that. Okay.

727
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,840
You guys fulfilled.
Now does this make any holidays?

728
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,600
I'm going to go see punish
awards. No, no. I'm gonna,

729
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,610
I'm gonna sit on my fucking huge
couch and I'm going to watch it. Um,

730
00:46:56,611 --> 00:47:00,750
the next review he did, the day the earth
stood still, he gave it three stars.

731
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:04,260
Sky's very, uh, it's very
liberal with the stars here.

732
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,430
Some people who were in the theater
with me were pissed at it when it ended,

733
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,830
but it's a remake and I
knew it was going to happen.

734
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,600
It isn't really supposed to be an over
the top independence day blockbuster.

735
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:17,460
It's more story oriented.

736
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,730
And there was some surprise stars
that I didn't know were in it.

737
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:23,790
Like so and so and so and so.
Well, thanks for ruining it for me.

738
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,150
And I give a fuck.
I'm not really into those cameos.

739
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,980
I hate when people get
excited about cameos.

740
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:35,870
Tom Cruise Kid, I had no
idea he was in it. Yeah.

741
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:39,160
What are the more surprising if like
one of your relatives walked in?

742
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,820
It's not like Tom Cruise isn't an actor.
You know,

743
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,880
it's not like he hasn't been
doing movies for 25 years.

744
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,170
I can't believe that actor all of a sudden
showed up in a movie and was acting.

745
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:55,300
I W I was really blown away.
Um, oh, I'm in a pissy mood.

746
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:59,240
Um, let's see. Oh, this is the two
movies I saw this weekend. I saw a,

747
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,740
the wrestler with Mickey Rourke,
which was fucking awesome.

748
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,890
And uh, any, if you're a fan of wrestling,
if you're a fan of Mickey Rourke,

749
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,670
you got to go see it. He's
fucking great. And it, and uh,

750
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:16,570
they really capture the
more ronic wrestling fan,

751
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,850
which I was perfectly.

752
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:24,390
And then I also saw that movie milk
starring Sean Penn as Harvey Milk.

753
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,940
And I got to admit,
I was shying away from that movie.

754
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,850
I wanted to go see it because
I love Sean Penn, but every,

755
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,950
a male friend of mine was
saying, I was like, yeah,

756
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:38,800
I want to go see that movie milk. Uh,
did you see it? And they'd be like, yeah,

757
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:42,130
I saw it, but I just to warn
ya, lot of male kissing,

758
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,760
which is not a,
uh,

759
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,690
that's not a selling point with
a lot of guys, myself included.

760
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,910
And I was sitting there going, but I
got to go see it. It's Sean Penn and um,

761
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,220
I don't know, there wasn't a
lot of kissing, but it, it,

762
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,960
after awhile you sort of get used to it,

763
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,190
which I don't know if that's a good thing.
I'm really on the fence about that.

764
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:09,700
I don't know what the fuck. You
know what I mean? It's weird.

765
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:13,870
If I was on like a youporn or to bait
and I was watching two guys kissing,

766
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,740
people will be looking at me like, dude,
what the fuck is wrong with you? You know,

767
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,690
what's your deal? You got something to
tell me. I can't just sit there. We, oh,

768
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:27,220
it's just a porno. You
know, this is a, you know,

769
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:32,380
this is the, then he go see a movie
and then all of a sudden it's okay,

770
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,850
this is art. This is art. I don't
know. It wasn't that big a deal.

771
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,050
It wasn't an Sean Penn was fucking
unreal and uh, it was an amazing,

772
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,720
it's an amazing movie with a lot of
male kissing. You know, I got to met,

773
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:47,650
that's the first time I've seen an amazing
movie that had a lot of male kissing.

774
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,840
I think they started a whole
new genre. Um, so I don't know.

775
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,000
You know what I'm,
because I have OCD,

776
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,000
I plan on seeing like fucking
nine more movies this week.

777
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,350
There's some mob movie I wanted to go see.
What the fuck was the name of that.

778
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,400
I'm going to rise here.
This is Mrs Typical me.

779
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:08,500
Like I haven't seen a movie
in about eight months.

780
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,250
And then I go and I see one movie. Then
I'm like, I'm going to go see everything.

781
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,430
It's like, I don't understand why I
can't. This is why I don't do drugs.

782
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,010
I'm going to go see a Gamora, g. O,

783
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:23,050
m. O, r, r, a. H.

784
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,440
Evidently it's a mob movie
cause I got to wash off that,

785
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:32,441
that male kissing to prove to myself in
a cinematic way that I'm still a man.

786
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,700
Um,
I'm going to go see this movie.

787
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,890
Evidently it's a mob movie that kind of
takes away all the Glam of being in the

788
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:42,200
mom. You know what I mean? I
mean, when you watch Goodfellas,

789
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:46,850
you don't really think like, wow,
thank God I never joined the Mafia.

790
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:52,440
You know, you, you, you know,
you want the cars. I don't know.

791
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,470
You want the fucking, I dunno. I
can't say the women, the women,

792
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,540
pretty fucking nasty and good fellas.
The,

793
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,720
you know what it was that girl with a
cold sore just ruins it for every woman in

794
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:05,151
that.

795
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:08,180
Then I just think they all have herpes
and then it just fucking ends it for me.

796
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,050
Can I just messed this up here?
Sorry guys.

797
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:16,040
Is this going to be another slow podcast?
Fuck yourselves. I'm on vacation.

798
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:20,600
All right, let's get to the
podcast questions, Sally.
Um, if you new to my podcast,

799
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:25,370
people send me podcast questions every
single week and I try and answer them,

800
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,860
add to the best of my ability.
Um, so here we go. Podcasts,

801
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,900
podcasts came and talk. Question
number one. Uh, Bill, uh,

802
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:39,320
I have a question for you as
a well-informed hockey fan.

803
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,020
What are your thoughts on the Chicago
Blackhawks chances this season? Um,

804
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,280
also what the fuck? Why the fuck
did the Bruins get rid of Thornton?

805
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,190
Uh, what did they get rid of? Thorton.

806
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,190
Cause they didn't feel like they key
could lead them deep into the playoffs.

807
00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:00,790
He played on a Bruins teams and that
people felt they didn't have any heart and

808
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,240
cause he was the big paid guy. They
blamed him, which was a, wasn't fair.

809
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,320
All I know is we didn't get shit from,
we didn't get shit for the guy.

810
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:13,160
How do I think the Blackhawks are going
to do this year? A transition year.

811
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,010
They're not going to do shit.
Speaking of that,

812
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:18,980
let's talk about the New York Yankees
and them throwing their fucking wallet's

813
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:23,120
around. Huh? It's Monday and I've
heard that. I haven't watched ESPN yet,

814
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:26,990
but I heard they had this
close to signing Manny Ramirez.

815
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:31,760
So they signed cc Sabathia that
white dude from Toronto, the pitcher.

816
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:36,800
And uh, I dunno, I fucking
love every, as a red sox fan,

817
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:40,070
I'm loving every second of it.
That's exactly right.

818
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,270
Go ahead and do the exact same fucking
thing. It's like watching an alcoholic,

819
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,500
just making the same fucking mistakes
over and over and over again thinking that

820
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:52,160
you're going to get a different result.

821
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:57,440
You've had a Rod Cheetah and Gian
be just in your fucking in field

822
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,140
for the last five years or whatever.
Or at least Jeter in Jambi,

823
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:07,880
that Combo you had for seven years. You
haven't done shit. You haven't won shit.

824
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,160
And Randy Johnson with those three
guys behind them. Plus, I mean,

825
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,610
look at the look at the list to
start when the Yankees were the shit,

826
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,840
they got it from their farm team,
I don't know.

827
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:23,090
And then they would pick up these fucking
nerds along the way. Paul O'Neill,

828
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,300
who knew Lee was great. Scott
Parotias, chuck Knoblauch, you know,

829
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:30,210
they just don't know.
I don't know what they're doing.

830
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:34,820
They always go out and they get the
fucking big swinging Dick and then you've

831
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:39,450
got, you got too much swinging
dick in your clubhouse house,

832
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:45,870
you're not going to win. You can't.
If it was just that fucking easy,

833
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:49,450
the Yankees would win it every year.
Wasn't they look a little bit over,

834
00:53:49,451 --> 00:53:51,930
not the fucking the red sox
try doing that one year.

835
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:54,900
I remember that year we got a Eric gynae.

836
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:59,190
That guy almost fucked up our whole
season last year we got that big bloated

837
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:04,170
steroid jackass. Remember that?
And we had already added a,

838
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:08,250
what's his face there in right field?
I swear to God the second season as,

839
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:09,450
I can't even remember anybody's name.

840
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:13,560
I was going to say Trot Nixon know the
new guy a fucking uh, junior Felix.

841
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,150
What the fuck is his name out there?

842
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:19,830
The guy everybody says is a cunt and he
doesn't do well during the season and

843
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:22,260
then he shows up. He shows
up in October. That guy,

844
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,060
I thought that's the red sox
last year were very, uh, 2007.

845
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:31,440
We're teetering on that
Yankee esque sort of thing,

846
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,490
but they still had like four or five guys
from their, uh, from their farm team.

847
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:39,630
I don't understand what the Yankees are
doing, but I hope they keep doing it.

848
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,101
I hope to do it.

849
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:46,101
I hope they have a fucking $500 million
team and they get bounced out in the

850
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:47,641
first round.

851
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:51,660
That's going to be fucking a list of my
favorite part of the year in baseball is

852
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:56,661
when they pan down that Yankee dugout
and you just see one fucking zillionaire

853
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,250
after one hall of Famer after another,

854
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:04,050
just fucking sitting there
with that look on their face.

855
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,210
And I got Jesus Christ.

856
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:11,980
It looks like we're going home
early again this year. I don't know.

857
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:13,470
Fucking though, you know, I don't know.

858
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:16,950
But I will say this many
is worth the money and uh,

859
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:18,540
he's definitely worth the fucking money.

860
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,470
Cc Sabathia only because he's 26,

861
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,540
but I gotta tell you, man, that
guy is built like Bartolo Cologne.

862
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:28,950
All right.

863
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,940
And you can't walk around with that
sack of potatoes hanging right over your

864
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:35,910
dick for too long before you
started having lower back pain.

865
00:55:35,911 --> 00:55:38,580
You can't pitch anymore.
It's like broads with big tits.

866
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,060
They can ride it out until like 35 37 and
after a while they're like, listen man,

867
00:55:43,061 --> 00:55:45,960
I, I can't go today. I
just can't do it. You know,

868
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,610
I'm fucking my arm shot and it's the
end of their career and they get their

869
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:51,720
titties reduced.

870
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,890
So cc Sabathia it needs to
stop going to the fucking,

871
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:58,920
what the fuck would he go

872
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:05,430
when it's cc Sabathia see an olive
garden guy. He's got the money though.

873
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:06,870
I Dunno what he's doing.

874
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:10,560
He looks like he just has like one
of those MTV cribs refrigerators.

875
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,690
You know what I mean? When
they got like, you know,

876
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:17,990
they got like a case of fucking Coca
Cola and every bag of fucking junk food.

877
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,980
You know what I'm convinced
fat people eat at night.

878
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,070
That's where they get fat because if
you hang out with a fat person, you,

879
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,810
you know,
you hang out with them all day long.

880
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:30,910
They just saw eating
when you eat and yeah,

881
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:33,520
maybe they'll get an extra fucking
cheeseburger at Mcdonald's,

882
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:37,690
but they don't go anything crazy.
I think it's at night, at night,

883
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:41,230
that's when they get up and they just
start going through the cupboards and they

884
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,630
just,
they just start throwing the fuck down.

885
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,410
I think that's what cc Sabathia is going
to be doing on the road with any luck.

886
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,230
Um, I dunno. What the fuck
you gotta do. Um, what else?

887
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,750
I'm gonna keep talking about sports.
I think I'm going to piss off everybody.

888
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:59,020
At least half in New York.
He got so many fucking teams met fans.

889
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:03,760
Probably enjoyed that. What about those
jets? Huh? Can you fucking believe it?

890
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:04,781
They choked.

891
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:08,710
It gets the Goddamn Seahawks and they're
the patriots right in the thick of it.

892
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,310
And I know what you're going to say. You
can say, Bill, you're fucking bandwagon.

893
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,060
Well, that's bullshit because I got
a bet with the shred and Reagan show,

894
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:18,580
which I'm going to fuck.
Fuck it in columns. Too late.

895
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,810
The shred and Reagan show out in Buffalo,
New York.

896
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,920
I bet them the fucking week
when Tom Brady went down,

897
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:30,550
Reagan was talking all this shit
and I hope he's listening to this.

898
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:34,630
He was talking all this shit.
Bill Bella, check is a punk.

899
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:38,740
He's never one without a superstar
quarterback, Yada, Yada, Yada.

900
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,130
All this fucking crap. And I said,
let me tell you something, Reagan,

901
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,750
let me tell you something.

902
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:48,100
And Reagan not only are the
Patriots can have a winning season,

903
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:52,690
they are going to fucking
win the division. I called
that after Brady went down,

904
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,550
called it. I bet him 50 bucks, if I
lose, I own 50 bucks. But if I win,

905
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,020
Reagan has to read an uh,

906
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,360
an on air apology to bill
Belicheck that I get to write.

907
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,490
It's going to be great.

908
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:11,290
Now he negotiated it down to only
six sentences. It can only be,

909
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,930
the apology can only
be six sentences long,

910
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:18,280
but he's not familiar with
my ability with conjunctions.

911
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,713
Alright,

912
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,960
that fucking thing is going to be a page
and a half of what a brilliant coach

913
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:29,530
bill check is there. Those guys on
ESPN was saying that shit. You know,

914
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,160
he's never worn with Dota superstar
quarterback and neither did Vince Lombardi

915
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:38,570
needed a chuck Noll needed at Tom
Landry. Neither did Bill Walsh. Did.

916
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,130
Those guys all suck.
Joe Gibbs.

917
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,650
Joe Gibbs never really had
a superstar quarterback.

918
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:47,280
Doug Williams was a superstar who
just played for the Buccaneers.

919
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,990
You know what I mean? So
maybe he did, but he had what?

920
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:54,640
Mark Repin and Joe Fat.
Joe Theismann was on the fence.

921
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,240
It was like a Apollo Neal level guy. I
didn't, what the fuck I'm talking about?

922
00:58:58,241 --> 00:59:02,200
All I know is next week, this is what
this is what I love about this situation.

923
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:07,120
Next week is New York can actually help
Boston have a great fucking new years.

924
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:12,570
If they can beat the shit out of the
dolphins, if they can show up, huh?

925
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,640
Your punk ass team will show up and when
a Goddamn game going out to Seattle and

926
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:22,160
lose, and you guys ought to be ashamed
of yourselves, why am I picking on jets?

927
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:26,030
Fans actually feel bad for you guys if
you didn't have man genie manned Genio

928
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:29,480
like, all right. He drove the
getaway car all those fucking years.

929
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,810
And then he read it out. Bill Belicheck.
Ooh, look, he's robbing a bank. Dude.

930
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,070
You're driving the car. Shut
the fuck up. Fucking baby.

931
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,820
All right.
Am I even doing questions at this point?

932
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:43,040
I'm just talking shit about sports.
How about those Bruins?

933
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,820
How about those Celtics? Huh? I
didn't need to go out for Christmas.

934
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:51,530
The fucking Boston teams
of bringing it home for me.

935
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:52,910
It got the NHL package.

936
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,970
I'm only watched the first period
of the Saint Louis Blues game.

937
00:59:55,971 --> 01:00:00,590
Don't ruin it for me. Don't be a spoiler.
All right, question number two, Bill.

938
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,180
What do you think of MTV switched?
Sweet. Jesus Christ. I can read out loud.

939
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:08,170
I'm fucking Moron, Bill. Let's go slope.

940
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:12,950
What do you think of MTVs sweet 16 show

941
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,290
and part two. What did you do
for your sweet 16? All right.

942
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:23,180
What do I think of the sweet 16
show? A it makes me angry. Um,

943
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,180
I try to keep my mind that there
are only 16, but I just really,

944
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,970
I don't like dumb cons,
you know,

945
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:31,360
I don't like them when I'm walking down
the street and I'm certainly not going

946
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,670
to watch your show about it. So,
uh, that's how I feel about that.

947
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:39,450
And what did I do for my sweet 16?
I went down to the DMV and I got my,

948
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:44,300
my learner's permit. That's what I
did was always a big deal for me.

949
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:48,440
Learning how to drive and uh,
what did I do?

950
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,670
I have no idea. I have no fucking
night. I don't remember that Shit.

951
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,930
It's fucking 24 years
ago. Uh, number three.

952
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,660
I like how I took that
question and literally like,

953
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:02,270
what did you do for your sweet 16? You
know, I guess I was supposed to be like,

954
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:06,710
well, I put ribbons in my hair. I
literally took it like straight up.

955
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:10,760
Like I have no idea what I did.
That was 24 years ago. Well,

956
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:14,900
thanks for sucking all the comedy out of
that question, Bill. Sorry about that.

957
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:16,650
Whoever wrote that, he
sent me up. Beautiful.

958
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:20,710
You loved it over the net and I took a
big swing and a miss kind of like a rod

959
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:25,090
in October. Oh, he's
killing the Yankees. I, Nah,

960
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,800
there's somebody right now who already
has a fucking Manny Ramirez poster

961
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:31,880
hanging over his bed,

962
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:37,220
fucking Boston to Townsel fucking lame
everything and closes the Focalin tool.

963
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:40,610
New Folk morning. What? The fork? Yeah.

964
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:43,100
We also go out at seven 30 at
night and we start drinking.

965
01:01:43,101 --> 01:01:47,330
You fucking jackass is still putting
on Cologne at 1130 at night. All right,

966
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:50,060
so fuck you and your city.
That open is open all night.

967
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,010
What a crock of shit that was.
You know what?

968
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:56,090
I'm first moved to New York another time
I took it literally like when they said

969
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:59,450
New York, the city that never
sleeps, it's open all night long.

970
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:03,770
I thought that meant everything.
Like banks, hardware stores,
you know what I mean?

971
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:07,640
Like I go, I could buy a lamp
at like three 30 in the morning,

972
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,450
but no, it does. It does shut down
and people do go to sleep and,

973
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,690
but their bars to stay up until four
in the morning. Other than that,

974
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,110
I fucked that. It's the greatest
Goddamn city. It's our Paris.

975
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,430
I'm not even gonna lie. It's
fucking awesome. I love it.

976
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,650
But I really don't like their sports
teams. Um, okay. If you didn't notice,

977
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:26,460
all right,

978
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,490
why don't you get back to the questions
and stop making it so fucking personal

979
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,181
with one city.

980
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:33,270
There's other cities listening and other
countries hello to all the people in

981
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:37,060
England that I've been getting
questions from lately. Um,

982
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:42,000
I'm going to be over that next year. You
mother fuckers. Um, so, uh, you know,

983
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,720
I dunno, whatever it is you do
to get prepared for comedy shows.

984
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:49,500
What do you do in English? Do you guys
really eat pork chops for breakfast?

985
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:53,100
Actually watch that show. You
are what you eat. You know,

986
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:56,430
which made me feel a lot better about how
auto shaped this country is when I saw

987
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:00,910
all those people over there. Like,
you know, w what do you start?

988
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:02,040
Do I start my day?

989
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,630
I have like I have a couple of fry
ups and for you Americans listening,

990
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,920
a fry up is rather than just
making an egg over easy, you know,

991
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,610
cooking it in butter, fried
frying an egg, they actually,

992
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:19,140
from what I gather from the
footage, because it's not
like they have the recipe,

993
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:24,170
they pour like cooking oil
into a pot and they boil it.

994
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,970
It's almost like you're
poaching an egg in Greece,

995
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,850
so they have like four of those to
start the day and then they have labor.

996
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,330
They have like these little fucking,
I don't know,

997
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:38,100
these little pork sandwiches and
they're really big on Indian food.

998
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:42,060
Why do you guys have so many Indians
over there? Literally people from India.

999
01:03:42,061 --> 01:03:44,010
Is that the whole Winston Churchill thing?
You know,

1000
01:03:44,011 --> 01:03:46,560
that's another book I started
reading and I never got through.

1001
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,830
I really wanted to get through that
book so I can sound intelligent at some

1002
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:52,440
point. It was a whole book
about the relationship between,

1003
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,510
or was it Winston Churchill and Gandhi

1004
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:01,770
gets fucking whacked. Just,
you know, it's unbelievable.

1005
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,940
All these people out there who think
that they're being dangerous on stage and

1006
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:08,310
type of, you know, if nobody's
made an attempt on your life,

1007
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,240
you're not saying anything.

1008
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:13,110
That's when you know that you're on
stage saying something I think is when

1009
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:16,830
somebody tries to fucking shoot you
in the back of the head at that point.

1010
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,530
Right.
Then you're saying something,

1011
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,760
but you know enough with
all these dangerous artists.
I really hate that shit.

1012
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:28,080
When people take, they had head
shots and they have like a, you know,

1013
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:31,740
they had like a piece of tape
over their mouth. Like, like the,

1014
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:35,460
the government put it, you
know, if he said duck taping,
let's stupid fucking like,

1015
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:39,300
Ooh, he's dangerous. He's
doing some spoken word.

1016
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:44,850
He figured out a word that rhymes with
Illuminati. Everybody run for cover.

1017
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,530
He's going to sing a song about the
work and man, you're not dangerous.

1018
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,730
Okay, okay. If you dangerous, they
tried to kill you and they do.

1019
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:58,950
All right. Okay. You know, did
fucking Martin Luther King,

1020
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,190
I have a poster of himself with the
fucking, you know, in, you know,

1021
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,210
piece of tape over his mouth and
shrugging his shoulder like, ugh.

1022
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:11,310
Well either whether they
go, hey, but the good day.

1023
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:15,590
All right. Um, let's get back to the
questions. Question number three. We'll,

1024
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:20,690
have you ever been dealing the case of
the runs all day and had to go onstage?

1025
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:25,420
Tough it out, cold sweats, bubbling
stomach, stomach, and all, you know,

1026
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:29,620
I love this question is he could've asked
me anything and I would have answered

1027
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:34,330
it. And he just basically said, yeah,
that go on stage and like, yeah,

1028
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:38,830
to take a shit and really bad, you
know, like, well, what was that like?

1029
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,570
Did that ever happened to me? Uh, yeah,
it's happened to me a number of times.

1030
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:47,400
Mean I've been doing it
for almost 17 years. Um,

1031
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,980
I've had an untimely fucking
salad that went right through me.

1032
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,140
Garlic is another thing
I don't do well with.

1033
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:58,120
And the amazing thing is the second
you go on stage, for the most part,

1034
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,460
it stops, uh, I don't know,

1035
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:05,110
some sort of survival adrenaline thing
kicks in that, uh, just says, oh,

1036
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:08,830
wait a second, we're not shitting.
No, we're not. No, we're not. Okay.

1037
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,540
So you just need to
shut down that thought.

1038
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:14,350
You need to sit there and wait until I'm
done with this stuff that I've had the

1039
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:17,920
hiccups right before I went
on stage going, oh my God,
I have hiccups. What am I,

1040
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,440
what am I going to do? And the
second I get out there, they go away.

1041
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,550
I don't know why, but they do. So
yeah, I've, I've got to do that.

1042
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:27,710
I've heard of stories of
comedians literally being onstage,

1043
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,260
stopping the show and just saying, I have
to, uh, I have to leave now. In fact,

1044
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:36,910
I want to say Dana Gould told a story
like that the other day on the Adam

1045
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:40,750
Carolla show. Um, I dunno.

1046
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,520
I Dunno. I can't remember. Anyways, let's
get back to the question says Shanell.

1047
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:49,420
Okay, here we go. Um, let's
see. Let's see. Let's see.
Question number four. Bill,

1048
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,260
if you could be with
the girl of your dreams,

1049
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,220
any girl marry her,
have great sex every night,

1050
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:01,030
everything was great and you were happy,
but she had to sleep with one guy.

1051
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,340
Any guy in the whole rural world,

1052
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,610
who would the guy be and
who would the girl be?

1053
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:12,550
Great fucking question. Let's get with the
guy. That's the easy one. That would be,

1054
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:17,590
um, one of those unbelievably
over the top gay guys.

1055
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,940
You know,
those guys who were just like this.

1056
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:28,000
So they're the ones who actually,

1057
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:32,680
they get gay bashed and the reason they
get gay bash because there's so putting

1058
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:37,150
out a female vibe,
it confuses the mail.

1059
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:41,920
That's why they, you know, and if you're
not, you know, if you're a psycho,

1060
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:46,270
you get so pissed. Like, why am,
why am, why am I feeling like this?

1061
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,610
This is a female.
When it's a guy you,

1062
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:53,440
you just start punching it because you
don't know how to, I don't know. Well,

1063
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:56,920
I don't know the motivation behind fucking
gay bash and all I could say, yeah,

1064
01:07:56,921 --> 01:08:01,810
I would find the most, uh, over
the top, but not like that dude.

1065
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,060
On will and grace because
he's still a dude.

1066
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:09,310
He's just sort of skipping around
I guess the most of feminine.

1067
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:14,920
I'm trying to think maybe like one
of those, uh, if it's like Filipino,

1068
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,240
some little Asian hairless dude,

1069
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,560
I go that way. You know what
I mean? Yeah. I go that way.

1070
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,820
Um, and if it had to be any girl
in the world, who would it be? Uh,

1071
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,700
Jesus Christ.
Um,

1072
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,230
I dunno.
Everybody goes with somebody famous,

1073
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,960
what would it be? You know,
what, how, you know what I do?

1074
01:08:41,961 --> 01:08:46,961
I would go back to my adolescence
when I was innocent and you don't,

1075
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:51,440
when you, back then when you actually
looked at a girl and you had like, uh,

1076
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:53,210
like remember that the way that,
uh,

1077
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:57,530
what the for that Biloxi blues
with our guide to describe that,

1078
01:08:57,531 --> 01:09:00,110
that little mini heart attack, you
know, when you lean back in a chair,

1079
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,080
I had a couple of girls back in
the day when I looked at him,

1080
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:07,070
I felt that like that lightening bolt,
which only happens when you're young,

1081
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,780
when you get older, you just, you just
went through it too many times. And again,

1082
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,750
look at those shoes. She probably
likes to get tied up. How old is she?

1083
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:19,190
28 probably on her second fucking
major relationship, you know,

1084
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,930
let's find out if her
parents are still together.

1085
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:23,480
That's always a good fucking
measuring stick. You know,

1086
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:25,280
you start thinking like
that and you just lose it.

1087
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:27,980
So I would go back then and uh,

1088
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,110
yeah I would do and I'm not
going to say the girl's name,

1089
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,020
probably a girl back then.

1090
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:36,320
Well one of the two or three girls back
there that fucking made me out of a

1091
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:38,870
heart attack. I would hook
up with them. You know what?

1092
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:41,030
That was actually a very sweet answer.
I've been,

1093
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:44,760
I have a lot of females going ah,
really sweet.

1094
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:48,980
He does have a this side. There's a
bunch of guys. What? I'm fucking queer.

1095
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:55,010
Um, alright. Question number five bill.

1096
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,390
I was searching,

1097
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:59,990
I was searching through youtube and
I found this interesting video file.

1098
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:04,990
It was Jesse Ventura talking about how
most of September 11th was caused by our

1099
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:09,680
government. And I'll fill
you non wrestling fans are
political people out there.

1100
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:14,600
Jesse Ventura used to be a professional
wrestler, went by Jesse the body Ventura.

1101
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,800
And one of my favorite things,
they used to call Tito Tito Santana.

1102
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:22,850
Santana used to call them Chico Santana.
And uh,

1103
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,240
he was part of the tag
team champion who was,

1104
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:29,570
it was Larry's Abisko Bisco Tony Garcia.
Who the fuck was Tito Santana?

1105
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:34,070
Was he would Ivan pushkey
and Tito Santana. Let me,

1106
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:37,310
I don't care about no Chico Santana.
He was awesome.

1107
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:42,070
And then he also said that Song Jessie's
girl was about him. Um, but anyway,

1108
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:46,850
I think he was also a fucking,
was he a senator in Minnesota?

1109
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,030
So anyways, that's the guy's background
with my fucking digression there.

1110
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:54,860
Say a former wrestler, former senator I
believe, or a representative of Minnesota.

1111
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,091
And anyway,

1112
01:10:56,091 --> 01:11:00,680
he was talking about how most of September
11th was caused by our government and

1113
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:03,800
how we blew up the two World
Trade Center towers towers.

1114
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:09,280
He said from his experiences in the navy
seals that buildings don't fall at the

1115
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:13,320
rate of gravity. Your
thoughts, thanks again. Um,

1116
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:18,350
my first gut feeling is they don't teach
you how to implode a skyscraper when

1117
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:22,890
you join.
The navy seals and um,

1118
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,920
buildings don't fall
at the rate of gravity.

1119
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:28,260
I don't feel that they teach you that.
The navy seals,

1120
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:31,020
I think they teach you
how to swim underwater,

1121
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,610
how to cut somebody with a knife from ear
to ear and not have any guilt over it.

1122
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:39,720
How to move stealthily, how to kill
people. I don't think at any point,

1123
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:44,070
I'm trying to think of anything that
the navy seals were accused of any

1124
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:47,640
skyscraper implosions
that they were accused of,

1125
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:52,110
but our government denied any sort of
knowledge of granted it would be top

1126
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:53,460
secret.
Um,

1127
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:58,270
I'm guessing he went on
youtube like me and a watch,

1128
01:11:58,271 --> 01:12:03,050
the same conspiracy
theories that I watched, uh,

1129
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:07,530
those same videos and now he's trying to
act like he came up with it himself to

1130
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:11,040
make himself sound a little more
intelligent by throwing in the navy seal's

1131
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:15,480
thick, you know, from my
experience in the Navy Seals, uh,

1132
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,470
buildings don't fall at the
rate of gravity. Really.

1133
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,770
Did they teach you that when
you were putting on your
flippers, you jackass when,

1134
01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:27,390
when the fuck did they teach you that,
you know what I mean?

1135
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,410
I'm sure they taught you how to climb
up the side of a building, but you know,

1136
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:33,180
I don't really think it's
in, you know, we have,

1137
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,540
we have [inaudible] means
to take down buildings.

1138
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,110
We don't have fucking eight guys
in frog suits do that. You know,

1139
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,440
I think he's just throwing it out there
that's like, well, you know, a bill.

1140
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:47,710
What do you think about September
11th? Well, my experience as a,

1141
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:52,711
a headlining comedian around the country
leads me to believe that a building's

1142
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:57,420
don't fall at the rate of
gravity. So a, yeah. Oh,

1143
01:12:57,421 --> 01:13:02,070
excuse me. I have a third show tonight.
You know, if, if he was an architect,

1144
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:03,650
I would believe that.
Um,

1145
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:07,320
I guess you're asking me what
am I thoughts do I think,

1146
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,380
I dunno what happened on September 11th.
I know there's a lot of,

1147
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:13,830
there's a lot of questions and I don't
feel like we're being told the whole

1148
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:17,700
story. And I'm not saying our government
did it, but I don't know what happened.

1149
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:19,020
But I know it's not what they told me.

1150
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:24,090
I think they told you some
of what happened and then
other stuff they felt like

1151
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:25,080
they couldn't tell you.

1152
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:28,980
And then other shit they use to manipulate
shits so they could do some other

1153
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:31,860
shit, which is why we're all in a
big bag of shit right now. All right,

1154
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:36,180
question number six. Bill parents
named their kid. Uh Oh yeah.

1155
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:39,930
I saw this story to parents named
their kid, one of their kids,

1156
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:44,820
Adolf Hitler and another one Arion nation.
I think it's great.

1157
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,630
Now we can keep an eye on the
little fuckers. Oh, wait a minute.

1158
01:13:48,631 --> 01:13:53,070
That's my response. I was like, wow,
this kid agrees with me. Um, yeah,

1159
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:57,990
I do think it's great. I think
it's, it's for that exact reason.

1160
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,513
You know what I mean?

1161
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,760
The next Adolf Hitler is not going to
be named Adolf Hitler or Arian nation.

1162
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:10,140
His name is going to be like Mike
or Jason. You know what I mean?

1163
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,480
You know? I don't know. I don't
know how the fuck he explain it.

1164
01:14:16,481 --> 01:14:18,070
It's like anything,
anytime somebody comes along and look,

1165
01:14:18,071 --> 01:14:22,090
they will do what he sees the
next Jimmy Hendrix, you know,

1166
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,020
it's like there's never
another Jimi Hendrix.

1167
01:14:24,021 --> 01:14:25,090
There's never going to be another eight.

1168
01:14:25,091 --> 01:14:27,000
I'm not gonna be another
fucking guy with the same name.

1169
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:30,860
You named the Kid Adolf Hitler. Joseph
Stalin. They're not going to walk.

1170
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:36,430
They're not going to do anything.
You just, you gave them a tattoo.

1171
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,340
You know Adolf Hitler came to power.

1172
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:43,600
He actually ran for office when new,

1173
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,430
nobody knew of the name Adolf Hitler.

1174
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:47,980
And he got in there and once
he got in there with his guys,

1175
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,630
that's when he started doing shit.

1176
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,560
So if this little fucker rubber
runs for all for office, he can't,

1177
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:58,150
you know, it's, it's great.

1178
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:02,650
They're just hung a sign around
him. Pay Attention. My, uh,

1179
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,850
my parents were fucking maniacs
and I'm filled with hate.

1180
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,860
You know, he can't run for
office. Who? You, who you
voted for. You vote for Obama.

1181
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:16,060
You voted for a fucking John Mccain.

1182
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:19,930
Are you voting for I Adolf Hitler
and his running mate, Arion nation.

1183
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:25,050
I think all racists should name their
kids. Stuff like that, you know,

1184
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,710
just, you know, name. I'm
fucked up. Names like that.

1185
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:31,360
And then they can all giggle about it.
Hey,

1186
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:35,490
there's a little laid off and then
we'll, you know, it's like the, you know,

1187
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:38,160
I don't know how many times can I make
the same fucking point and that's around.

1188
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,230
I really don't give a shit. Um, I
don't think it's offensive either.

1189
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:43,930
I think those people can name their kids,
whatever the fuck they want to name. Um,

1190
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:48,070
and, uh, like I said,
it's a major red flag.

1191
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:54,830
Dad, can I go my friend's house? Yes. Uh,

1192
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,730
well what will we go over? You
don't know if Steve's house? No.

1193
01:15:57,731 --> 01:16:01,970
Adolf eight. His kids'
names. Adolph. Yeah.

1194
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:07,300
What? What's his last
name? Hitler saw y'all.

1195
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:11,770
Can I go? Ah, no, no,
you can't. Why not? Well,

1196
01:16:11,771 --> 01:16:12,760
I'll explain it to you.
Like,

1197
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:16,350
why don't we sit down and watch the
history channel together. I know. Wanda,

1198
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:21,130
what's boring? Shut the fuck up. You
Little Brat. Question number seven. Um,

1199
01:16:21,131 --> 01:16:24,430
since you've been traveling across
the country for the past decade or so,

1200
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,180
what's the best urban
legend you ever heard of?

1201
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:34,690
Okay. Urban legends. Uh, I've
heard so many good ones. Um,

1202
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,520
I, well, I grew up in the 80s,

1203
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:42,180
so there was a lot of fear
about a during that time.

1204
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:47,740
And um, I remember there was
an urban legend about a guy.

1205
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:50,140
He's in a bar,
he makes this chick,

1206
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:52,930
she's totally smoke and looks
like a fucking supermodel.

1207
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,200
They go back to her place,
you know, whatever, her hotel,

1208
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:58,900
she gives him the best
blow job ever that bang.

1209
01:16:58,901 --> 01:17:00,940
And I've invited the
greatest fucking night ever.

1210
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:06,450
He wakes up the next morning she's gone
and he walks into the bathroom and then

1211
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:10,730
on the mirror is written in lipstick.
Congratulations.

1212
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:15,170
Now we both have age because
evidently he didn't use a condom.

1213
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:19,130
And I remember being in a room,
in a warehouse believing every word going,

1214
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:23,990
really do what we do. Where
did that happen? I don't know,

1215
01:17:23,991 --> 01:17:25,820
Dude.
I think it was in Rhode Island.

1216
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:30,860
I was a moron. I liked
that one. And I liked a,

1217
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:32,870
there was another one
out there about a guy,

1218
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:38,000
he meets a girl in a bar
and uh, she says, hey,

1219
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,910
and she's totally smoking. And
she says, Hey, this is the deal.

1220
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:44,990
You can come back to my place,
you can do whatever you want to me,

1221
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:48,660
but in the end I get to do whatever
I want to you. I was like, yeah,

1222
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:50,870
fucking let's go.
So you know,

1223
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:55,220
he does anything you could possibly do
with the woman you know, has an orgasm,

1224
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:58,400
everything's great. And she
goes, okay, now it's my turn.

1225
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,810
And she ties him down to
the bed. So he's like, okay,

1226
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:07,100
she's under this freaky Dominic for Shit,
whatever. She walks out of the room,

1227
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:08,070
you know,

1228
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:13,070
closes the door and all of a sudden the
door fucking kicks open and there's a

1229
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:17,930
black dude dressed like Batman and he
comes in and he fucks the guy in the ass.

1230
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:24,100
And I actually believed it. Like that
totally made sense to me. I was like,

1231
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:29,090
once again, 1819. When did that happen?

1232
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,660
I don't know.
I think it was in Chelsea.

1233
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:38,250
Um, yeah, probably that one.
And then, then anyone, any,

1234
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,810
any of the firecracker,
urban legends, you know,

1235
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:45,620
somebody put an mat in somebody's
back pocket and blew half his ass off.

1236
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:50,450
Always liked that one. Um, yeah,
I would say that. All right.

1237
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,340
And it's the second part
of the question also.

1238
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:56,840
Do you believe in Spooky
Supernatural Shit? No. Yes and no.

1239
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:02,240
I believe in outer body experiences.
I believe in some sort of,

1240
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:05,940
uh, I dunno, I don't even afterlife,

1241
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:09,830
but so just some shit that we don't, we
don't understand and we can't happen too.

1242
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,690
I definitely believe in that,

1243
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:17,180
but I don't believe in ghosts
like there that you know,

1244
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:21,110
that they're going to haunt me. I
just don't get what it goes. Can Do.

1245
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:26,180
You know, it's invisible.
I can't see it. Okay.

1246
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:30,680
So what does it rattles a land
and it goes boom. All right.

1247
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:35,300
Now that I get used to
that, and um, you know,

1248
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,660
the worst he can just be as a pain in
the ass, just knock shit off my dresser.

1249
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,870
And I said, really? And I can just fuck
with him mentally. Just torture him.

1250
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,850
Spec really when maybe that's why.
Maybe that's why you're a ghost.

1251
01:19:46,851 --> 01:19:47,600
You ever think about that?

1252
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,870
Maybe you're just a content life in
your punishment is you don't get to go

1253
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:55,010
anywhere and now you're
trapped in my awful apartment,

1254
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:59,210
you know,
kind of a fucking loser ghost.

1255
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:03,350
Are you weighing when you out there
looking up women's skirts and we get gay

1256
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:06,670
ghost, why don't you go fucking
float over to Wa West, uh,

1257
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,810
west splitting a dudes over there,
you know,

1258
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:16,110
he'll get their balls. I know what
I'm talking about here. All right.

1259
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:19,980
Um, anyways, he said my girlfriend
is obsessed with that show.

1260
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:23,190
Goes Hunter Hunter hunters.
And I find it ridiculous.

1261
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,840
Uh, yeah, I find that shows
that shows it's fucking stupid.

1262
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:31,380
It's all all in the editing and they
act like they're going to find something

1263
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:34,950
and they don't, and they never quite
get like a good angle on the ghost.

1264
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,030
You know? It's like if you
had a good angle on the ghost,

1265
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,810
you would kept the footage and you
would have just could've sold it to any

1266
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:45,870
network out there for millions of dollars.

1267
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:49,220
We finally have proof that goes to exist,
but they never do it.

1268
01:20:49,221 --> 01:20:54,000
So we shaky handheld. Blair witch.
All right. Question number eight.

1269
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:58,290
Um, bill doing sets every week, do you
ever get bored of your own stories?

1270
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,470
Jesus Christ? Yes, absolutely.

1271
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,880
Which is Wa and thank God I do. If I
didn't, I would never write any new jokes.

1272
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:10,260
Absolutely. Absolutely. And what ends up
happening is if it's a seven minute joke,

1273
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,090
it becomes a five minute joke.

1274
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,570
It becomes a two minute joke and then
it just becomes a joke that disappears.

1275
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:17,220
It's kind of like,
you know,

1276
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:20,610
you have it like break your arm or
something and someone's like, dude,

1277
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:21,510
what happened to your arm?

1278
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,600
And you tell the first person you tell
in total detail what happened to your arm

1279
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:30,420
and it takes like fucking 10 minutes.
The next guy you tell,

1280
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:33,360
you start telling again, you can fuck
you going over the same shit again,

1281
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,700
becomes eight minutes and then the
very end, it's just what happened?

1282
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,580
How I'm doing,
I fucking fell down and go fuck yourself.

1283
01:21:38,581 --> 01:21:39,414
What do you think happened?

1284
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,890
It bent in a way it wasn't supposed
to bend in a broke. All right,

1285
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,730
what happened to your face? All
right, question number nine.

1286
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:51,120
How far into this podcast all we,
how many moms funny.

1287
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:54,000
Shorten these things because
they're getting ridiculously long.

1288
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:59,940
41 minutes. Jesus Christ. I should
sell cds at the end of this. All right,

1289
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:03,570
question number nine, and I'm going
to wrap this up real quick. Um, Bill,

1290
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,410
are there any movies that you,
that you know are God awful,

1291
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,820
but for whatever reason you love them
anyways? Oh, I like this. This is a,

1292
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:15,810
this is a good story here. Listen
to this shit. He says for me,

1293
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:20,790
it's John Claude van Damme bloodsport
and kickboxer reason being is as about

1294
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:23,970
nine or 10 when those movies came
out and they were the first movies,

1295
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:28,440
my dad let me stay up and watch with
them even though my mom disapproved and I

1296
01:22:28,441 --> 01:22:33,180
saw kickboxer for the first time in a
while the other day and it really might be

1297
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,860
one of the worst movies of all time,

1298
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:39,330
especially the power van Damme gets
punched square in the face about 15 times

1299
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:43,980
and rapid succession at the end of the
round. And at the end of the round,

1300
01:22:43,981 --> 01:22:48,930
the bad guy tells van dam that he fucked
his girlfriend at which point vent damn

1301
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:53,931
spends the rest of a in between rounds
demanding to know the truth about his new

1302
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:57,420
girlfriend.
He says,

1303
01:22:57,421 --> 01:23:02,250
if I were in the middle of a fight with
a grand champion of underground death

1304
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:03,084
matches,

1305
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:07,900
would you actually give a shit at point
who some girl you met two weeks ago.

1306
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:12,010
Fuck exactly. And I'll never
forget the part with a bad vet.

1307
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:16,570
Bad Guy's boss finally gets what's coming
to him because my dad would always be

1308
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:19,480
going and take that you
Cambodian son of a bitch.

1309
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:24,840
I don't even think the guy was supposed
to be Cambodian, but I, if I see them,

1310
01:23:24,841 --> 01:23:28,390
movie's going to be on, on
Cinemax 20 years from now.
Still sit down and watch it.

1311
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:32,380
Yeah, I got movies like that. Um, I think
I already talked about this one airport,

1312
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,520
1975 if he ever get a
chance to watch that movie,

1313
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:41,140
that's the movie that basically the
movie airplane was making fun of,

1314
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,380
I believe.
And believe it or not,

1315
01:23:44,381 --> 01:23:49,150
air as funny as the movie airplane
is airport 1975 is even funnier.

1316
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:52,780
Just to give you a quick recap
of what the store, what it is.

1317
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:56,950
It's a commercial airliner. You
know, some guys in a private plane,

1318
01:23:56,951 --> 01:24:00,580
he has a heart attack and has a
head on collision with like a DC 10,

1319
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:06,060
which sucks one of the pilots out of the
front and blinds Efram Zimbalist Jr at

1320
01:24:06,191 --> 01:24:10,630
which point a stewardess who
I swear to God has a lazy eye,

1321
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:16,020
has to fly the fucking plane and
it stars and unknown Erik Estrada,

1322
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:21,660
who plays the character of I believe
heck door and has one line in it.

1323
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:26,440
It's that fucking good. All right,
what am I going to end with here?

1324
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,460
Um, let's end with a wishing all
you guys are merry Christmas. So,

1325
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:34,780
because you know, you're Jewish,
had a happy Hanukkah. Um,

1326
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:36,340
if your a,

1327
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:41,650
is it just black only black people or is
it African Kwanza Happy Kwanza curation?

1328
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,440
I Dunno what you do there.
Uh, oh, Jewish people, uh,

1329
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:49,150
have Dolby up excellent Chinese food on
Christmas Day. I learned that little,

1330
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:54,120
uh, that little tradition the other day.
Oh, here's a question I have for any,

1331
01:24:54,121 --> 01:24:57,670
any, you technically savvy guys out here
cause I really want to up the quality of

1332
01:24:57,671 --> 01:25:02,290
these podcasts. People keep talking
about this tapping, wait a minute.

1333
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:07,150
Is it, is it this noise?
Is that the noise?

1334
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:13,120
If that's the noise. Yeah, that's
me scrolling down on my computer.

1335
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:16,330
I think we solved it.
Um,

1336
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:20,890
son of a bitch anyways, so I
want to up the uh, the quality.

1337
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:25,370
So let me know if that's the tapping
sound because some people were saying it

1338
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:28,750
was my last saying I left like Popeye
in and annoyed them or is it this,

1339
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,090
is that really annoying you guys?
Anyways, this is my question.

1340
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:37,420
I saw something, I was
listening to a, what's his face?

1341
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:41,100
Little Stephens underground Christmas.
If you guys ever listened to his show,

1342
01:25:41,101 --> 01:25:44,080
it's on Sunday nights.
Checkout locally.

1343
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:48,670
He's just said please on this underground
music plays great music and I love the

1344
01:25:48,671 --> 01:25:52,630
way he talks.
Lou Stevens underground Christmas,

1345
01:25:52,631 --> 01:25:54,730
we got the remote moves.

1346
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:57,850
I can't even do what he's just fucking
the coolest dude ever. But anyways,

1347
01:25:57,851 --> 01:26:02,110
he was talking about this shit on
there called the uh, the Olympus ls 10

1348
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,100
and evidently it's this fucking
unbelievable recording record.

1349
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,550
12 hours with a shit on it.
Bands can use it.

1350
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,880
Like that's how much quality is that.

1351
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,560
You can just set it in the middle of
the room and it picks up everything.

1352
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:19,040
Like that cheesy guitar playing that
you heard at the beginning of this,

1353
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:22,040
you could have really
told how awful it was.

1354
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:25,700
If I get one of these devices
and any tech geeks out there,

1355
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:27,260
I want to know if this thing is worth it.

1356
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:31,550
The ls 10 if I start recording my
podcasts on this, then uploading them.

1357
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:35,330
It's really adding in whole extra step
to the process. But I would like to,

1358
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:37,820
you know, I'm getting a ton of
listeners, I'm not going to lie to you,

1359
01:26:37,821 --> 01:26:41,120
the podcast that kind of
starting to blow up. You know,

1360
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,910
I think I'm in a triple digits at
this point. I don't even joke in San,

1361
01:26:44,911 --> 01:26:48,170
only have 14 listeners,
but I really think I got a,

1362
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,450
I think I have about 106 at this point.

1363
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,710
So I'm gonna we're going
to try to, well, you know,

1364
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:58,970
try to up the quality here in 2009.
Um,

1365
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,990
and with that I got an idea.
How about for next week's podcast?

1366
01:27:02,991 --> 01:27:05,210
You guys send me in some
New Year's resolutions.

1367
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,260
How are you going to turn your lives
around you now you do this every year.

1368
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:13,790
You lie to yourself, you're going to make
your life a little bit better. You know,

1369
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:18,980
send me those in. And with that I'm going
to end this podcast here. I'm going to,

1370
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:23,510
well actually hype a couple of dates
I have coming up. Um, all right,

1371
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:28,040
this is the big one. Um, at the
Improv and Tampa, Florida and I,

1372
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:30,950
last time I was there, you know, I dunno,

1373
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:33,020
I didn't do so well as
far as drawing people.

1374
01:27:33,021 --> 01:27:35,510
I know it's kind of off the
beaten path down there in Tampa.

1375
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,610
Maybe the hangover a year.
Fucking devil rays,

1376
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:43,960
which kicked the shit out of my red sox
while we took you to seven games that

1377
01:27:43,961 --> 01:27:46,550
you guys are definitely the better
team. Maybe you guys, you know,

1378
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:48,830
the lightening aren't doing so well,

1379
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,100
that kind of an okay team come out to
one of my shows is what I'm saying.

1380
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:57,140
January 8th, ninth, 10th. If you
saw my uh, last hour special,

1381
01:27:57,141 --> 01:28:00,860
I wrote well brand new hour of stuff and
I'm also going to be at the Improv and

1382
01:28:00,861 --> 01:28:05,630
Houston,
Texas on January 22nd through the 24th.

1383
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:10,910
And then I'm making a hometown stop in
Boston at the Wilbur theater on February

1384
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:14,390
the sixth. I really hope
you guys can come out. Um,

1385
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,690
I'm going to be really
rested up over the holidays,

1386
01:28:17,691 --> 01:28:22,670
so I'm going to be extra funny.
I guaran fucking tee it and uh,

1387
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:26,870
and that is it. I didn't quite get a
chance to get to some of this shit.

1388
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,210
I got a couple of Nice reviews

1389
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,680
on my podcast here.
This is all garbage time.

1390
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:35,000
You don't even have to
listen to this ship it.

1391
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:38,270
Here's a couple of Nice reviews I got.
And then I have another one,

1392
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:41,750
another segment that I like to call it
back down to earth where somebody trashes

1393
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:45,500
me. So here we go. Here's
a couple of Nice one. Um,

1394
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,300
thanks for making me laugh all day long.

1395
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:51,530
I just finished listening to all of your
podcast. How the fuck did you do that?

1396
01:28:51,531 --> 01:28:53,330
I'm trying to get my
wife to listen to them,

1397
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:56,420
but she doesn't think it's
as funny as I think they are.

1398
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:59,960
Anytime I have my headphones
on and I'm laughing, she says,

1399
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:04,560
are you listening to your boyfriend
bill? Too Funny. Keep up the great work.

1400
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:09,120
Don't you love when fucking women do shit
like that? Fuck her that she's jealous.

1401
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:11,910
She's jealous that you're
year Gig. I, you know what?

1402
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:15,450
You should play this part for her. What's
her name? Give me your name next week.

1403
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:18,720
I'll, I'll have, I'll give her
a little talking to, you know,

1404
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,240
and I'll be nice even though she doesn't
think I'm that funny. You know this.

1405
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:25,800
Look, if you want to hold on, you know
I'm gonna do a right now, sweetheart.

1406
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:29,580
If you want to hold onto your boyfriend,
he can't suffocate them. All right?

1407
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:33,840
If he likes walking around, listening
to another man and his headphones,

1408
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,990
you know us a little gay. I
understand that. You know,

1409
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:39,230
he's got in touch with his feminine side.
All right?

1410
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,600
But what you need to do is you
need to be an adult here, okay?

1411
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:46,380
You have to understand that no
matter how stupid you think it is,

1412
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:50,010
it's one of his hobbies. And
you have to respect that. Okay?

1413
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:54,510
Don't do what Jennifer Lopez did to Ben
Affleck during their year and a half

1414
01:29:54,511 --> 01:29:58,020
relationship. What are you going to do?
Dress him up like a little Ken doll.

1415
01:29:58,021 --> 01:30:00,310
Stick him in a Tuxedo.
Huh?

1416
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:03,240
He can walk around smiling,

1417
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:07,380
pretending he's happy and everybody sees
the misery behind his eyes, you know?

1418
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:11,340
And then one day, you know, you
just, he's just, I don't know,

1419
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:15,780
you just see him crouched over in front
of his laptop looking at porn or just

1420
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:18,240
something, something awful
and you're gonna blame him.

1421
01:30:18,241 --> 01:30:21,150
You're going to blame his childhood.
You know what? It's you lady. All right.

1422
01:30:21,151 --> 01:30:25,050
So why don't you back off during
the holidays. Okay? All right,

1423
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:26,970
next one.
Hey Bill.

1424
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,880
I think your podcast should come
with the public service disclaimer.

1425
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:33,990
Since I fly a lot, I catch up
on your podcasts during flights.

1426
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:37,530
I get such a kick out of this that people
are actually downloading these things

1427
01:30:37,531 --> 01:30:39,990
and listening to them. It's just
really cool. And so anyways,

1428
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:40,860
on a plane and he says,

1429
01:30:40,861 --> 01:30:44,430
I sat next to this older lady during
a recent flight back from Portland.

1430
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:48,300
It was your podcast about
chips and the 20 car pile ups.

1431
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,870
I was frigging laughing so hard.
I couldn't breathe.

1432
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:55,230
I thought I was going to be escorted
off the flight by air marshals.

1433
01:30:55,231 --> 01:30:59,620
This poor lady must've thought I was
a some psycho. All right. So yeah.

1434
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:03,180
That's awesome. That makes me feel
good. Next one. One more good one.

1435
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:05,730
And then I'm going to bring myself back
down to earth with somebody who trashed

1436
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:10,570
me. All right, Bill. Then yesterday,
uh, it was the same one. Yes.

1437
01:31:10,571 --> 01:31:12,870
That was with my older daughter
and we were listening in the car.

1438
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:17,910
This was a podcast about being a boxer
and reacting to punches by shrugging your

1439
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:20,370
shoulders and turning your head. I, yeah,

1440
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:22,740
that's how I react to when somebody
tries to punch me in the face.

1441
01:31:22,741 --> 01:31:24,060
I don't try to slip the punch.

1442
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,020
I just bring my shoulders up to ear
level and then I turned my head away

1443
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:32,880
to, I never want to fight
anyways. He said, uh,

1444
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:34,950
we were both crying and gasping for air.

1445
01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:37,980
I could barely see the car in front of me.
Good God.

1446
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:40,410
Warn people they should not be in public,
uh,

1447
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:43,980
or operating heavy machinery
when listening. All right,

1448
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:45,840
so that's the good review section.

1449
01:31:45,841 --> 01:31:49,170
Now here is the back down to
earth section of the podcast.

1450
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:55,260
Bill, glad to see you've been working
on, you're reading out loud skills.

1451
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:59,530
You sound like a special ed kid that
didn't bother getting out of the short bus

1452
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,660
when it arrived at school.

1453
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,250
I wonder how many times you've been in
public places reading out the podcast

1454
01:32:06,251 --> 01:32:11,110
questions into your phone and people
have walked by and thought, oh, how nice.

1455
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,990
The mentally challenged man
over there is learning to read.

1456
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:16,630
I guess he's really
coming along because he,

1457
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:22,060
he's only sounding out every other word.
You know what's great about that?

1458
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:26,050
Not only is that absolutely correct, I
actually had difficulty reading out loud.

1459
01:32:26,051 --> 01:32:29,780
The thing that he said,
insulting me, saying I can't
read out loud. Well, to shade,

1460
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:34,960
to shade at Buddy. Um, anyways, happy
holidays everybody. Merry Christmas,

1461
01:32:34,961 --> 01:32:37,930
happy Hanukkah, happy Kwanzaa. And
if you don't celebrate any of it,

1462
01:32:37,931 --> 01:32:39,130
I hope you have a good break.

1463
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:43,660
While the rest of us are spending money
on people that we resent on some level,

1464
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:47,140
um, that is it. Um, let me know
your New Year's resolutions.

1465
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:52,141
Please keep the podcast questions coming
and I hope in January I can have some

1466
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:56,330
sort of update on my European tour
that I'm going to be doing, um,

1467
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,030
next year.
So for my seven listeners in the UK,

1468
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:04,540
um, I dunno if you guys celebrate.
You guys have Jesus over there.

1469
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:09,310
I know you have Mcdonald's. All
right. God bless. Take it easy.

1470
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:10,820
Talk to you next Monday.

1471
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,670
Maybe somewhere down the road,

1472
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,760
maybe somewhere down the road with

1473
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:03,923
car.

1474
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,620
I'm just glad to

1475
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:22,180
be of

1476
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:25,550
your dad.
