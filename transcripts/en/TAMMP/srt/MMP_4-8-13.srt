7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,370
Bill. What the Hell is ting? What is it?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,530
You can't just bring up a product and, and
I don't even know what it is. You know,

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,980
it's got that ambiguous name.
What's going on with it?

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,040
While Ting is a new mobile service
that brings clarity, usability,

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,540
and significant monthly savings to
us small businesses and families.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,370
So basically if you're tired of paying
an arm and a leg for your cell phone bill

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,380
every month,
you should check out ting.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,360
They just sat at a new three g slash four
g. Why Max Hotspot to the Ting lineup?

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,250
The Sierra wireless overdrive pro can be
had and refurbished for only 30 bucks.

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,330
In February,

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,250
they added the option to purchase used
devices via their partnership with glide.

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,220
The option to bring a sprint
device has been around for a while,

19
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,750
but there was a limitation. No Lte
devices could make the move. Well,

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,770
they've been working to have this
limitation removed and now many LTE sprint

21
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:24,720
devices are able to make the
move to Ting port your home port.

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,590
I don't even know what that means.

23
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:30,090
Port your home phone number to Ting
and save a mint if you like us,

24
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,240
barely use the home phone but
aren't quite ready to let it go.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,140
This $100 device can bridge
the gap and save you a ton.

26
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:39,540
Verse Traditional Wired
Home Phone Services.

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,140
You don't actually might check that out
because I barely use my home phone but I

28
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:45,420
refuse to give it up.
You know why?

29
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:49,980
Because I'm part of the old school I am
when I'm on the phone or wear a headband.

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,450
You get it. Fucking old school. Sorry. Um,

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,990

support. Anytime you got a problem,

standard time.
And believe it or not,

34
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:09,540

36

There we go. I almost got through without
stuttering. All right, so here we go.

37
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,070
This is the Monday morning podcast.

38
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:27,780
Everybody and I am in Atlanta
Hatton and had baby. How you doing?

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,610
Um,
I uh,

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,050
got here last night. Uh,
I'm a day early before my,

41
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,710
my big show down in
Athens, Georgia. And uh,

42
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:45,330
you're probably wondering, Bill, why did
you come in a day and a half early? Well,

43
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,970
I'll tell you why because tonight
I'm going to the basketball game.

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,890
Michigan Versus Louisville. All
right. The NCAA championship game.

45
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,830
Why wouldn't ya?
You're in town.

46
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,410
Does still tickets to be had.

47
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,880
Could you believe that there's
still tickets we had, dude,

48
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,881
Atlanta has to be the worst fucking
sports town on the face of the United

49
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,750
States. I didn't say the earth. Okay.

50
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,140
I'm not going to be arrogant and act
like I know sports fans from here to

51
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,680
Timbuktu.
I don't even know where Tim Buck two is.

52
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,120
I don't even know if that's
a real fucking place.

53
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,480
I don't know if that's an expression.
I don't know who shot at.

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,130
I don't know who's not.
Um,

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,750
but they fucking suck here in Atlanta.

56
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,960
Okay. In Atlanta, they
suck George bulldogs.

57
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,070
That's a whole different story you
gave me. No Damn dogs. I'm in there.

58
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:40,320
I'm between the hedges.
Okay?

59
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm not talking about the SCC college
fucking sports fans down here.

60
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,220
Those people are fucking lunatics.
All right?

61
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,320
They're out there making
moonshine before the game.

62
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:50,940
They're out of their fucking minds.

63
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,290
The read that full on fucking redneck
or they're like that. Um, oh, Belvedere,

64
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,300
they'll come here and all,
they have that fucking plantation vibe.

65
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,810
One of the other, just talking about
the white people down here. All right?

66
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,660
So, and the drug addicts
are all in the waffle house.

67
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,010
All right?

68
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,420
If you want to score some meth and get
a delicious breakfast and you're in the

69
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,710
south, I have to recommend the fucking
waffle house. That's the place to go.

70
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,240
If you'd like to maybe get into a fight.

71
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,790
If you didn't even know that
you wanted to get into a fight,

72
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,960
that's what you want to fucking go.
Waffle houses basically.

73
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,080
That would be the south.
That's Kinda of their end.

74
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:34,770
What the fuck is the equivalent
to that up in the north?

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,060
Just someplace we could go out and get
some food and maybe get the shit kicked

76
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,700
out of you.
Maybe get a prostitute.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,410
Yeah.

78
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,930
Maybe you have a heart attack. What
does that, the cheesecake factory.

79
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,380
You know what? I'll have to get
back to you on that one. Anyway,

80
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:51,090
so I'm here and I'm going to be going
to the, uh, the basketball game tonight.

81
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:55,890
What the fuck is what? This chair,
it's one of these fucking chairs.

82
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,030
Oh, I keep hitting the adjustive
thing with my calf. Sorry.

83
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,850
It's not the chair's fault.
It's my fault. All right.

84
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,640
You know what's great about this
chair is it's not a live person,

85
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:08,460
so I don't really have to apologize to it,
even though I just did it.

86
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,740
This was a woman I have to be like,
you know,

87
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,330
right now she would have her arms
crossed looking out the window. You know,

88
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:18,270
I just,
I understand that you know,

89
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,350
you have a lot of pressure because
you've been traveling a lot lately. Okay.

90
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:24,760
But this snapping and,

91
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:29,460
and just immediately going to
the anger. No, no, let me finish.

92
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,700
Okay. I think you've said enough
for them. Morning. You know,

93
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:38,020
they just say that shit just
gets you fucking going. I'd
have to apologize to it,

94
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,850
you know, and buy some flowers
by it. Some stuff, you know,

95
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,920
sorry,
chair.

96
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,590
My Midi calf actually was hitting the
adjustment thing, so it wasn't your fault.

97
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:54,250
It wasn't a design fall flaw or
whatever the fuck I'm trying to say.

98
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,741
What am I trying to say?

99
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:59,480
I'm trying to say that I'm going to the
NCAA championship came tonight here in

100
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,910
Atlanta and it's not
even fucking sold out.

101
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,580
How fucking hilarious is that?
What is wrong with the city of Atlanta?

102
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,500
You know what it is this too much. This
too much pussy in the city, that people,

103
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:17,300
they just don't go to the fucking too
much pussy in too much. Jesus. Yeah.

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,390
Both sides of the fucking rainbow,
you know?

105
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,920
And they just don't go to the Goddamn
Games was the last time I Braves games

106
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:24,754
sold out.

107
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,463
You know,

108
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,240
if I ran the Braves,
you know what I would do?

109
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:33,560
I'd put a fucking stripper pole out
there in the goddamn bullpen, you know,

110
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,730
so the people out here could make it
rain in between innings and then I think

111
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:42,350
maybe I could get the stadium
half fucking full. Oh,

112
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,570
fuck you.
What the fuck is this?

113
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,920
South Carolina? This is like a fucking
phone or I got to do, I, I'm doing that.

114
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,680
Um, the hell was I titled
the Stripper Pole. Yeah.

115
00:06:56,681 --> 00:07:00,330
Do you know what kills me about
the fucking Atlanta Braves?

116
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,780
Is they still do that
Tomahawk chop that shit.

117
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,300
Okay.

118
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,110
And there's no passion behind it is

119
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,370
ah,

120
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,630
ah,

121
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,540
what kind of a fucking asshole does that?

122
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,670
How many tribes have said how
fucking offensive that is?

123
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,080
You know what I mean?
That's what I,

124
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:29,130
that's when I really fucking hate people
when they're just like, you know, Whoa,

125
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,090
what are the eight got nothing
to do with that. You know,

126
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,430
that's stupid. Just, you know, it's like
people like Erin to the confederate flag,

127
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,150
you know,

128
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,620
and they tried to say that it has nothing
to do with fucking slavery and just

129
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:47,220
has to do with southern pride.
Give me a fucking break. You know,

130
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:50,070
just be a fucking racist.
Just man up and be a racist.

131
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:54,480
Just get a nice fucking swastikas
swastika tattoo right on your forehead.

132
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,280
Stop being passive aggressive.

133
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,460
Probably gonna get kicked out
of this hotel for saying this.

134
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,010
I'll fuck you Steve jobs with your
fucking noises. I heard it. I heard it.

135
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,710
I grabbed the phone.
I fucking reacted to it.

136
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,100
You can't from the gravy,
still a cunt.

137
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,020
I wonder whose idea he stole for that
fucking thing and then passed it off as

138
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:19,380
his own as he goes out and tries to
fucking levitate with one of those cheesy

139
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:20,280
fucking magicians.

140
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,830
Okay.

141
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,290
Goddamn fucking phone.
I hate this fucking thing.

142
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,680
You know what kills me too is you
put it on, you put it on vibrate.

143
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,070
I mean there's no way to shut it up.
I'm sure there is.

144
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:35,360
If I read the fucking manual,
you know,

145
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:38,560
but I don't have time for that and
read a fucking cell phone manual.

146
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,080
Finally figure the thing out
and then what? It's obsolete.

147
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:44,920
And eight months bill quit
yelling. You just lazy. All right,

148
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,980
maybe I shouldn't be
going off on the dead guy.

149
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:53,050
You know that Douche bags on the cover
of fucking Time magazine with like Albert

150
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,690
Einstein as far as people who changed
and shaped the world the way it worked,

151
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,340
this stupid advertising where they lined
themselves up with Gandhi has actually

152
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,660
fucking worked. Cause now the dude's
dead. And on the cover of life magazine,

153
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,490
they had, you know, Jesus didn't even
make the fucking cover or maybe did,

154
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,410
I don't know, but what the fuck, you know?

155
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,010
Okay.

156
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,140
They actually had a really good
picture of Albert Einstein.

157
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,270
They had a younger version of him,
you know,

158
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:23,800
where his hair wasn't all fucking gray
and he didn't have that sad look on his

159
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:24,590
face.

160
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,790
You know that look he had on his face
after he fucking showed those psychos how

161
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:32,260
to, how to blow up all of Japan.
All right. This is the cover.

162
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,300
The cover is Abraham Lincoln. Jesus,
Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King,

163
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,380
the Beatles, Hitler, some old
broad with fucked up teeth.

164
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,200
Uh,
Mother Teresa

165
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,110
fucking a Gandhi. Uh, Jesus.

166
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:55,060
What the fuck is the name of that guy
who spent all those years in prison for,

167
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,820
in apartheid or whatever the fuck his
name is? Was it William William H Macy?

168
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,770
The fuck is that guy's name.

169
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,310
You finally got out and his wife stuck
by him and then he fucking dumped her.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,070
And then the guy who came up with the
phone that angry look on his face with the

171
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,113
Edison.

172
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,670
Okay,

173
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,700
the fuck is a guy's name here.
Sidney Poitier.

174
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,620
I'm the worst. I don't fucking
know who anybody is. And anyways,

175
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:23,670
they got Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs, rubbing
elbows with all those fucking people.

176
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,820
Fucking stupid ass God damn nerds.
Cause he did what? He invented a phone.

177
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,650
Did he even invent it?

178
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,070
Having already talked about this
on stage up on this silver screen.

179
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,590
Um,
so anyways,

180
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm out here in fucking Atlanta and
I'm going to that Goddamn game tonight,

181
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,340
this stupid concert. They don't even
fucking sell the thing out there.

182
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,330
Still doing that Tomahawk Chop.

183
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,420
Okay.

184
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,060
It's like why? Why, why would you do that?

185
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,250
Yeah,
that and they got the fucking drum.

186
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:00,420
Bowden Dum, Dum, Dum, Dum, Dum, Dum.

187
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,400
I was just talking about this on
the regular guys morning show.

188
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,140
My brother took a tour one time somewhere
in Arizona and they were talking about

189
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:13,100
how native Americans played their
drums and they will be like,

190
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,410
they play it like this.
They play it like that.

191
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:19,930
But at no point did they ever go banner
dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump.

192
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,770
That's just some fucking Hollywood shit
where they hired a white guy with the

193
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,170
Tan, maybe have a little
bit of a sunburn, you know,

194
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,400
to give them the reddish tinge that they
thought they, the fucking Indians have,

195
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,300
which I've never understood.
If you see a real native American,

196
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:38,600
there's nothing read about
their skin, you know, you know,

197
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:42,620
it was a fucking red skin.
I am God damn fucking redhead.

198
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,330
You put me out in the sun, I will fuck
with any native American. A patchy.

199
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,030
I don't give a fuck who you are.
My skin will be redder than yours.

200
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:55,090
I should be offended by the Washington
Redskins. They make fun of me, not Yo.

201
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,900
All right. Just the fact that your
face is on the side of the helmet,

202
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,750
that's just a misdirection.
All right?

203
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,590
It's just another group of people
coming at us, fucking redheads,

204
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,590
and you know what? I want to
get sick of it. All right?

205
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm sick of conch coming up to me,
telling me that I'm going to be extinct.

206
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,990
Like I'm some sort of fucking white rhino.
You know you're going to do,

207
00:12:15,991 --> 00:12:20,810
you guys are going to be gone by 2040
it's like I'm going to be 72 in 2040 it's

208
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:24,600
still going to be here. You cunt. You
know why? You know why? I'll tell you why.

209
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,860
Cause they go out to these hotels.
All right. Oh, there's another plane.

210
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,520
Where are those people going?
God,

211
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:37,050
I always wished I was on a plane
going to some place. Exciting.

212
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,320
Sorry. That was the inner monologue
of a woman who got married at 22. Um,

213
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,510
anyways,
plowing ahead here.

214
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,800
This is why I'm going to live to
be 72 cause I don't stay in motels.

215
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,460
I don't fucking make speeches
about how to change the world,

216
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,040
at least on my podcast. Maybe I do. Okay,

217
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,770
but I'm not standing in front of
fucking a zillion people. All right?

218
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,000
So no one's going to whack me. All right?
I got good genes. And you know what?

219
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:06,390
Today I go downstairs, they got the
fucking continental breakfast down there.

220
00:13:06,391 --> 00:13:09,270
They've got the breakfast buffet and they
also got the whole thing you can order

221
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:12,410
from the menu. All right?
And what do I see down there?

222
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:17,400
I see all the mantated fat fucks who
got the corner office and they're down.

223
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:21,960
They're getting themselves in the all
American breakfast, two, three eggs,

224
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:25,230
any style, the fucking bacon,
the potatoes just, well,

225
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,230
you know what they are when they're
fucking grabbing their heart by the,

226
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,890
by the lapels grabbing and just
go, hey mother fucker. Right.

227
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:34,740
And then just need it. Right. If
they keep, if you're hardhead balls,

228
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,930
that's what you're doing with that
breakfast. The all American, you know,

229
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:44,010
and I did. I went down there like a
little fucking twinkle toes. All right.

230
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,170
I was up on my,

231
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,320
on my tip toes and I did a little dance
move when I slid into the booth and the

232
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:51,840
lady,
you know,

233
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,060
the lady came over,
you know,

234
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:57,894
it's a waitress.

235
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,230
Like I think all waitresses
should be female.

236
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,320
Even the waiters.
That's just a broad job.

237
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,440
I'm a hungry man.
I want food to be brought to me.

238
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,180
This should be a woman involved in that.
Okay, I'm traditional. I'm old school.

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,380
I pay for the movie.

240
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,590
I want my sandwich made by a woman
that's a man and a fancy hat.

241
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,450
Some poor excuse for a
fucking pope hat dude.

242
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:36,280
How far down is the fucking Catholic
religion fallen now that we're all over

243
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:40,360
there, all the way down there
in there, in like south,

244
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:41,770
they had to leave this country.

245
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,060
They're gradually moving to the
third world just because they,

246
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,620
that's the last place that people are
still believed that some bearded dude on

247
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:55,760
water. Talk to a fucking
Bush and then, uh, you know,

248
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,110
died and then came back three
days later, you know, Oh shit,

249
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:04,340
the fire engines are coming up.
I think there's a plane on fire.

250
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,860
That is my big fear.
My big fear is not dying in a plane crash.

251
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:14,090
It's surviving the plane crash and then
being soaked in jet fuel and burning up,

252
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,760
you know, for a nice four second
death of, and then that's it.

253
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,620
You know, you'd probably be even higher,
much higher pitched. I wonder what the,

254
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,840
I mean,
how many decibels you can,

255
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:30,580
you can actually create if
you're burning and jet fuel.

256
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,790
It's so fucking terrifying when you go
to takeoff, you literally just, you're,

257
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,740
you're in a tube of gasoline.
Yeah. Belt. We get it.

258
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,900
We understand that you
need a lot of Gath GI bill.

259
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,040
Do you need a lot of gas to fly across
the country while your podcast is so

260
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,070
informative? Oh, so anyway,

261
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:52,990
so I'm down there and I get
the fucking breakfast. Okay.

262
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:55,150
And I could've got the fucking three eggs,
any style.

263
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:59,020
I could've got the pancakes or the
waffles. You know how they do that shit?

264
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,340
When they turned it into a dessert,

265
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,040
they got everything but fucking
chocolate frosting on him now. I said,

266
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:07,360
fuck all that. And I said to
the lady, I said, you know what,

267
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,850
let me get the cold cereal

268
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,370
cold called like fucking
Margaret Thatcher's knees.

269
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,000
And I'm not saying that
because she's dead. Okay.

270
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,480
That fucking shape shift and rectal,
you know,

271
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,550
I actually think that she's George Bush
like that.

272
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:33,420
That's like his altar regrow is,
he's actually actually ego ego.

273
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,110
He's actually also Margaret
Thatcher. You know, just the theory,

274
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,800
just something to kick around in a bar.
I think they're all the same person,

275
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,970
you know, and they shoot all the world
leaders all in the same living room.

276
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,430
And uh, maybe it's, maybe
he, he's not a shape shifter,

277
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:50,640
but he's got some excellent
like Hollywood makeup, you know,

278
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,390
and then like when he was supposed to be
in America and nat can debt, and then,

279
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:56,840
you know, then when they cut
to him over and fucking be,

280
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,520
and Margaret Thatcher
and he's, oh, Johnny,

281
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,950
he just fucking just changes his voice.

282
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,720
He's like the Mel Blanc of like the
Illuminati. That's what I think.

283
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,240
And I actually voted for the
mother fucker. I liked him. He was,

284
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:13,320
they supposed to vote for that fucking
squinty Polak fucking riding around in

285
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:17,190
the God damn tank. Oh, was he a
Greek dude? You guys know Copernicus,

286
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,370
the guy who figured out that the
fucking earth didn't go, you know,

287
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:23,250
it was going around the sun and that
the sun was the center of the universe.

288
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,730
That guy was a Polak. All
these Polish jokes, you know

289
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,950
Copernicus, that doesn't sound like a
Polish name to me. That sounds Greek.

290
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,840
But I digress. So I go
down there. What do I get?

291
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:41,450
I get the fucking raisin bran
with the 2% milk there, right?

292
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,540
I get the milk from that cow.
That was probably fed another cow.

293
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,980
So God knows what kind of fucking,
uh, poisons are in me right now.

294
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,400
That's only 2% of it as opposed
to 4%. You understand that, right?

295
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,820
Um,
2% of what I have no fucking idea.

296
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,760
I actually read something one time
or how they do, do the fat count.

297
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,480
It's bullshit. It's kind of like how
they do the gas mileage on the cars.

298
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,780
When they drive the car like two miles
an hour with like a fucking hurricane

299
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,020
wind behind you,
it gets 60 miles a gallon.

300
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,310
Um, and then you get it, you only get
20 and you're like, what the fuck?

301
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:17,070
They're like, well, you're
stepping on the gas pedal too much,

302
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,020
but how do I make it go without doing
that, sir? Why are you being hostile?

303
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,860
Cause you're a cunt. That's why.
And then you're out of that,

304
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,240
then you're out of the showroom
and that's it. That's it.

305
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,320
Do you ever go into a showroom and you
see the fingerprints on the glass and you

306
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,030
see 1 cent where it's,

307
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,040
they're really indented in the window
and then they kind of slide to the right.

308
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,200
That's the guy who used the c word.
He said cut in the showroom,

309
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,080
then was dragged out. Um, yeah. I
don't know. I'm talking about, so yeah,

310
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,850
so I went with raisin brand,
then I've got a banana,

311
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,760
put it on top and you know what?
I'm fucking full, you know,

312
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,690
filled up the fucking stomach.
And I didn't go down there
and, and, and just, just,

313
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:57,901
you know,

314
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:02,820
just starting your day with fucking
1200 calories to your ass and now you're

315
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,410
down to 800 and you know,

316
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:08,310
you're going to do that at lunch and
then you'd done and then the rest of the

317
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,660
day, all it is, is just fucking overflow
spillage for your fucking arteries.

318
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:15,780
And you got damn muffin top.
All right.

319
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,490
Why am I yelling at you guys this week?
I don't know. I'm fucking know in a,

320
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:22,710
I'm in a great mood. I'm going to
go to this fucking game tonight.

321
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,150
It's going to be tremendous. I'm going
to have the whole road to myself. Why?

322
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,980
Because it's a sporting event in Atlanta.
I'm telling you,

323
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,920
if they put stripper poles down there,
they would have fucking sold it out.

324
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:38,520
And what? It costs me like nine
grand a ticket. Um, so I actually,

325
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,110
I have an amazing week.

326
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm going to the basketball game
tonight and then I do a run a theaters.

327
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm in Athens, Georgia on
Tuesday. I'm an Alabama,

328
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,730
which Georgia actually looks down on,
which is fucking hilarious.

329
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,350
If you're not from this region,
you know,

330
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,960
it's like you fuckers are
all the same to me. You know?

331
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,070
And I don't mean that in a bad way,
but I don't mean it in a good way either.

332
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,540
Um,

333
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,010
Alabama at the star Dome on Wednesday
and then Thursday I'm over in South

334
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,120
Carolina, South Caca Lackey and then, uh,

335
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,660
no, Tuesday, Athens, Wednesday star Dome,

336
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,420
Thursday South Carolina.

337
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,500
And then Friday I got two shows in Atlanta
and then Saturday I go to the masters.

338
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,630
You see that people,

339
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,420
you too can live the dream when you never
get married and don't have any kids.

340
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,590
You can live selfishly like I do,
you know,

341
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,370
and go to all these wonderful things and
brag about her on your own podcast and

342
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:38,610
then go to bed at night and cry
yourself to sleep. What the fuck?

343
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:42,000
I keep hitting this goddamn thing and
this fucking chair, it's driving me nuts.

344
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,571
You know what?
You know what?

345
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:47,190
It's almost like the chair knows
my ego's completely out of control.

346
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,330
Just keeps it live. It, let's,
let's bring him down a little bit.

347
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,070
They'll closer to the floor a little
closer to the regular people. All right.

348
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,140
Just to show you what a whore I am.

349
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm going to read a couple of a couple
of ads here. Legal Zoom. Everybody.

350
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,660
Do you have a job that you hate?
You know you want to get out of it.

351
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,310
Do you want to start a business?

352
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,380
But you don't want to sound like
you're just starting a business.

353
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:11,680
You want to sound like you're actually
making money already. You know,

354
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,800
this is what you gotta do. You
gotta go to legal zoom. I'll wait.

355
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,510
That's easy voice with the hell.
Am I talking about?

356
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,290
I can't even keep these damn
things straight. Legal Zoom. Oh,

357
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,400

white. This is it, right? Is this it?

358
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,000
Legal? Zoom is the one where you, uh,

359
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,360

right off the bat, right?

You do financial planning, you get
insurance. But to get real peace of mind,

363
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,110
you have to make sure your
family is legally protected. Um,

364
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,330
so where do you turn for
affordable legal protection?

365
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:59,380

The post office is always
crowded. Who's could know?

387
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,750
Okay, now it will be even more crowded
with people mailing in their taxes.

I'm going to hook you guys up with a
youtube video and I know what already has

40 something million hits and people will
be like, wait to be on new gut nudge.

00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,650
Oh Youtube
for all you dumb fucks out there.

411
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,690
40 million hits, 40 million people is
not even 1% of the world population.

412
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,273
Okay.

413
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,610
So any sort of of recommendation
for a goddamn video is fine.

414
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,670
All right. It go fuck yourselves.
Hey, what do you guys think
is worse? Uh, the, the,

415
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:08,504
the,
um,

416
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:13,510
Atlanta Braves fans doing that
Tomahawk Chop or red sox fans singing.

417
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:17,870
Sweet Caroline.
I'll let you think it over.

418
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:22,670
I have to be honest with you just because
it's offending of fucking group of

419
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:27,290
people that were victims of genocide.
I got to go with Tomahawk Chop,

420
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,870
but I have to say,
um,

421
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:34,190
sweet Caroline is a close second.
I mean,

422
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:38,270
that's literally stopped me from watching
fucking home games at the Boston Red

423
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,900
Sox, that and the whole steroid era.
I stopped watching it. 2010, you know,

424
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,390
once like fucking half the
red sox tested positive.

425
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,530
Was it really half bill or was it two or
three key guys? Two or three key guys,

426
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,480
you know,
and one guy,

427
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:55,760
oh think escape town via Chicago for
never fucking got caught for anything.

428
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,680
Um, that's just, you know, just
speculation. Pure speculation people.

429
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,100
But, um, yeah, so I was kind of at
that point I was like, all right,

430
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:08,180
they either need to make steroids legal
or get it out of the game because I'm

431
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:10,610
sick of getting excited
about shit. And then, uh,

432
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,300
four years later you're telling me
that it doesn't really count. You know,

433
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,710
I don't fucking know.
Um,

434
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,880
this is how long it's been since
I've watched the red sox game.

435
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:24,710
I'm looking at the USA Today sports page
and it's got a picture of a Boston red

436
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:29,711
sock who I don't even recognize and it
said Middlebrooks shows clout with three

437
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:30,860
home run day.

438
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,900
Evidently there's a guy in the red sox
called will Middlebrooks who was four for

439
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,520
five with three home runs in four rbis
Sunday and he's batting three 20 for the

440
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:43,470
season.
I have that guy could fucking,

441
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,653
yeah,

442
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,200
you can be sitting down next
to me in a fucking restaurant.

443
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:51,020
I'd have no idea who he was. I'd be
like, who's that really in shape?

444
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:54,170
Tire salesman.
He's not a tire sales me.

445
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:56,780
Why that stats fucking will Middlebrooks

446
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,490
okay.

447
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,180
Middlebrooks it's not
Middlebrook Middle Brooks.

448
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,510
Okay.

449
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,860
The Middlebrooks the middle.
Brock's family. Everybody.

450
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,950
Subsequently we got a guy
named will Middlebrooks.

451
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,740
I'll tell you right now if y'all,

452
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:14,080
you know I gotta tell Ya
from the Yankees right now,

453
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:16,540
I gotta be worried about
that will Middlebrooks.

454
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,063
MMM.

455
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,280
I don't even know what's,
I have no idea what's going well,

456
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:24,470
what is going on in baseball right now?
I,

457
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:29,390
they finally done building
all new stadiums and sing
a dumb ass fucking songs.

458
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,280
Just make the roids legal.

459
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,123
Okay.

460
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,220
Just let everybody take them and
then it'll, it'll be all right.

461
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,040
And then we'll all take them. Everybody
takes them. Everybody's jacked.

462
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:49,110
Everybody's got a short fucking temper,
you know? I guess that would suck, but no,

463
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:53,960
you don't do really get that
anymore. Well, Bill, who knows you.

464
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,380
It's not like you fucking read about it.

465
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,833
MMM.

466
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,290
Let's get it. Let's talk about a sports
that maybe I know a little bit about.

467
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,280
Let's talk about hockey.

468
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,170
I'm telling you fucking cunts right
now who roll your eyes at hockey.

469
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:10,740
First of all, if you don't want to be
a fat fuck, take up the game of hockey.

470
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,490
It's the, it's I'm telling you, I've
seen, I say this weekend and week out,

471
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,820
it is the greatest old man's sport.

472
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:23,340
There is all these fucking old white
dudes go out there and they still playing

473
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:25,320
fucking hoop. What happens?
They come in Monday,

474
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:28,050
they blew out the fucking Achilles,
you know,

475
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,500
constantly fucking up your
knees, your hips, your feet,

476
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,730
cause you'll run it up the court. Right?
And you got on your fucking Steve Jobs,

477
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:40,230
new balance. You know that the, the,
the official old white guy sneakers,

478
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:44,220
which I just bought a new pair of them
with the inserts. That's when you know,

479
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:48,840
you're old. I'm constantly
getting fucking hurt, right?

480
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,110
Okay.

481
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,760
Baseball.
Nobody plays baseball.

482
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,570
You play softball and that's just really
an excuse to get absolutely fucking

483
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:58,570
hammered and eat hot dogs.
You actually softball leagues,

484
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,560
you actually fucking gain weight playing
the fucking game. So that's no good.

485
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:05,620
Now you're walking around with
this big fucking gut, you know,

486
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,110
with your coaching shorts,
one size fits all.

487
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:10,780
You look like you're in your third
trimester, that's fucking out.

488
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,580
You sure as hell not going to play
football and any sort of capacity.

489
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,480
And that leaves hockey. Hockey is
great because you're running around,

490
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:21,430
but she had gliding,
you know,

491
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,813
I'm telling you,

492
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,280
you fucking workup and unbelievable sweat.

493
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,700
It's great hand eye coordination and uh,

494
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,540
I'm completely 100% so I don't
even go to the fucking gym anymore.

495
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,650
I just go out and I get involved in a
pickup game. I'm actually to the point,

496
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,540
I'm at the upper level of sucking.

497
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:43,480
I can actually stick in a little bit and
keep my head up before somebody takes

498
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,320
the puck away from me.

499
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,620
But I'm getting a good sweat
and it's a beautiful game.

500
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,890
Um,
you know,

501
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,600
it's funny they have all these different
drills and I've been skating with this,

502
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:57,820
a comic on Nick Craig,

503
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:02,821
who I fucking brought out on tour when
we went through a Wisconsin in fucking

504
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,250
Michigan and he was showing
me a couple of drills.

505
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:09,640
You went to one of these stick
time things and it's just,

506
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:14,260
there's no hockey drill that is
an absolutely fucking exhausting.

507
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,400
Every fucking one of them.
It's like you do three reps of it and you,

508
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,390
you feel like you're going to absolutely,
you're going to die. You know,

509
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,760
you ever see baseball players before
fucking game, just sort of limbering up,

510
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:31,190
you know, just tossing the
ball, flicking the wrist.

511
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,310
That's a fucking sport you want to play,
I think.

512
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,430
But then you gotta do you
gotta do it 162 fucking times.

513
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,230
I would love to get a
professional baseball player
on this podcast and just talk

514
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:47,090
to him about July and
August and like how much,

515
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,710
even though you're making
millions of dollars,

516
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:50,090
how much you want to kill yourself,

517
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,590
how many fucking times at that point
you've heard the song take me out to the

518
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:58,390
ball game 125 fucking times.
Jay,

519
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,480
Mary out go though game.
He just sitting there like,

520
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,530
I'm going to fucking kill myself and
you're standing out there in the Goddamn

521
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,330
son,
right?

522
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,110
And now you got to try to figure out
who this fucking guy is on the mound and

523
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:16,930
what the hell he's putting on
the Goddamn ball like baseball.

524
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:20,650
It to me is literally, it's like going
to math class every fucking day. I just,

525
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:21,484
I wouldn't have the,

526
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:28,330
there's no fucking way I could ever get
smart enough to play that game at any

527
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:32,420
sort of fucking level. I just can't,
like when you played football,

528
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:36,710
you just fucking walk up when you
just play. Right. I don't get to,

529
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:39,620
I guess you have to figure out
the guy across the line from you,

530
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,560
but not to the level of
that these guys have to,

531
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,710
yeah.

532
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,580
You know what I mean? Like maybe you
figured the guy out for part of the game,

533
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:51,610
they don't come in and you know all
of a sudden bringing a fucking new

534
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,820
cornerback out of nowhere.
They do that with these hitters.

535
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,520
All of a sudden you got a new fucking
picture. What the fuck is this guy doing?

536
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,090
What's his deal? What's his release
point? Can I pick it up? It's,

537
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:05,800
it's coming off his fingers. It's no
fucking way. There's no fucking way.

538
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,800
The only way I would ever make it
in professional baseball is if I,

539
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,080
if I was a really good third base coach,

540
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,240
I really knew how to
give the fucking signs.

541
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,870
That's the only way I could ever make it.
Even if I had the god given ability,

542
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:21,871
I don't have the mental
stamina to give a fuck.

543
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,630
When another guy comes like,
I just fucking did this.

544
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,490
I just figured out a guy, now you're
bringing in another guy. Fuck this game.

545
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,450
Fuck this.
I'm going to be an announcer.

546
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,510
Okay.

547
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:36,660
You know,

548
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,400
I'm going to say I stole this story from
a this morning cause they didn't get to

549
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:43,790
it on the, uh, the wonderful program,
the, uh, the regular guys here in Atlanta,

550
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,250
some fucking asshole spent over
200 grand on a star Trek Ray gun.

551
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,003
All right?

552
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,120
200 fucking grant over 200
grand from some rare ray gun,

553
00:32:58,181 --> 00:33:00,160
I guess used on the Star Trek episode.

554
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:05,161
And this is why I want to know how
much crooked shit has the baby boom

555
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:08,500
generation done that they can afford
to throw their money around like that.

556
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:14,320
You have watched those Barrett Jackson
auctions and like a Mustang will come up.

557
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:17,770
Well this is an actual be,
this is the real deal.

558
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,890
We're gonna start the
bidding at honor and $80,000.

559
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:25,270
Who the fuck as 180
grand to buy a Mustang?

560
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,080
You know this sitting there fucking
been on those fucking Ferrari's come up,

561
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,600
that one from Ferris Bueller's
day off comes up, but whatever.

562
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:39,520
And then if they could spend like 9
million bucks on it too, right there,

563
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,260
you should be fucking thrown in a
black van and fucking take it down and

564
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:46,660
underneath the Pentagon and they
figured out what the fuck you did.

565
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:47,860
Where did you get your money?

566
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,683
Five.

567
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,270
They probably know you, you
know something. If you've got,

568
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,330
if you have enough money,

569
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,920
well you can blow 9 million bucks on a
god Damn Ferrari that you're not even

570
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:00,260
going to drive because it's
worth so much fucking money.

571
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,020
Your wife doesn't give you
shit at that point. You Ha,

572
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,510
you know people at the Pentagon,
right?

573
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,550
You walk into the Federal Reserve
and they shout out your name,

574
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:11,260
like your fucking norm on cheers.

575
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,440
That's all I think of when I
watched those auctions. I'm like,

576
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,080
this is all filthy fucking money.
Nobody has this kind of money.

577
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,760
Yeah.

578
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,680
Barrett Jackson.
Do you have see a rod there?

579
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:25,330
A Rod doesn't even have
that kind of money.

580
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,720
Yeah,

581
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,700
a Rod.
My favorite Yankee of all fucking time.

582
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,830
I Dunno. But any other red sox fans?
I'm sort of a former red sox fan.

583
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:39,330
I think eventually
they'll get back into him.

584
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:42,300
I kind of like last year where
they sucked in everybody, you know,

585
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:45,980
just kind of burn off all the pink hats,
you know? But now, like I said, good.

586
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:47,850
So everybody's jumping
back on the bandwagon.

587
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:51,510
I've got to figure out when's a good
time to jump back in with those guys,

588
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:52,344
you know?

589
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,583
MMM.

590
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,050
Anyways, you know what? I'd probably
do it this year. At this point.

591
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,490
It makes me feel bad as a fan that I don't
know who fucking or will Middlebrooks

592
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,640
or did you just get the new will?
Middlebrooks Jersey.

593
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,150
I have no fucking idea who
he is. This is terrible. Um,

594
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,560
anyways,
what the fuck was I just talking about?

595
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,530
Just talking about no one
people in the Pentagon.

596
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,540
Oh my favorite Yankee ball time.
Alex Rodrigues watching the Yankees,

597
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,960
trying to shame a rod into demanding a
trade has been one [inaudible] and him

598
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:30,820
not taking the bait,
you know,

599
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,050
sending him in the ninth inning of the
playoffs and he just stills just like, ah,

600
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,940
you know,
we want whatever's good for the tape.

601
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,680
Hey, New York Yankees, front
office, just settle in.

602
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:48,490
You're going to have to
pay him every fucking dime.

603
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,410
I bet that they have his contract out
on the dare fucking giant walnut tables.

604
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,390
Every fuck is walnut expensive? I
Dunno. Every God Damn Day just pouring,

605
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:00,280
they probably have a team of lawyers just,

606
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:04,840
just specifically designed to pour over
that guy's contract to try and figure

607
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:08,440
out how the fuck they can get out of this.
I swear to God,

608
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,030
if a rod was abroad and
fucking the Yankees,

609
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,890
what we're, we're, we're a,
we're his husband. All right.

610
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:21,490
This story where to already been on
the first 48 because a rod woulda got

611
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:25,900
whacked. That's Desta type of financial
fucking situation there. You know,

612
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:29,890
when the guy just is like, there's no
way out of this. I just have to kill her,

613
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,700
you know, which is always the
dumbest fucking move ever.
You know what I mean? You,

614
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,290
you're gonna, you're gonna go to
hell forever. If that Shit's true,

615
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:42,190
sons got to happen. Something has to
happen, I think, you know what I mean?

616
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,820
Cause some people get away with murder
so there has to be some sort of fucking

617
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,990
something.
Right.

618
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,940
Okay.

619
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,560
In another world
or do they just put that in your head?

620
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:55,870
Because if there really
was no ramifications,

621
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,080
they didn't make that shit up that people
would just be walking around killing

622
00:36:59,081 --> 00:36:59,914
people.

623
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,490
Okay.

624
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,310
Can you imagine if you just had no
fucking conscience that you just did that?

625
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:05,780
Anybody who is just annoying you,

626
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:09,770
you just fucking killed them and you
were so good at it, you never got caught,

627
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,413
you know,

628
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,430
with that.
Could you still enjoy life?

629
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,940
I guess if you don't have a conscience?

630
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,860
I'm trying to think how many
people I would actually like.

631
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:30,740
Seriously what a killed. I don't think
I ever would have killed anybody.

632
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,600
It's an interesting question.

633
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,500
Nah, I don't think I could. Oh,

634
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:43,180
but there's been a few I'd want it to.
All right,

635
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:46,000
let's give us the questions this week
before I fucking start incriminating

636
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:49,120
myself. Um, when it rains,

637
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:52,660
it pours a redheaded bass did.

638
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,600
So I know this is going
to be a horrible email,

639
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:59,350
but I listened to your podcast every
fucking Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

640
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:02,590
or whenever you get it up here were you
guys stopped saying fucking Wednesday.

641
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:04,480
It's not even Tuesday.
It's late Monday.

642
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:08,260
You fucking wine and [inaudible]
for the last fucking time.

643
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,400
I take it Monday morning my time.
It's not about you. It's about me.

644
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:17,460
So go fuck yourselves fucking bitch
in about a free God damn podcast,

645
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:21,120
you guys.
The Internet is a bunch of whiny cunts.

646
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,810
Whiny on original content, by the
way. All right, you people out there,

647
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:28,690
you got to set up. You gotta
fucking step up your Twitter game.

648
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,450
Stop using StockX fucking lines.

649
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,570
I want the last three minutes, 28
seconds of my life back. It's just like,

650
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:39,970
isn't that the most
unoriginal fucking thing ever?

651
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,050
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

652
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,460
Like you've read that a
million fucking times on,

653
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,720
on fucking Twitter and
you're gonna write it again.

654
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:57,210
Let it like you're going to get a laugh.
Get Out.

655
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,040
Has anybody ever come up to you,

656
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:03,210
told you a fucking street joke and then
right after that told it the you again

657
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,610
now because it's only funny once,

658
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,820
but you fucking Twitter hacks the same.

659
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,830
Fuck that feeling when, wait, what?

660
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,130
That's like the fucking hacky tag.

661
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,030
Yeah,

662
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,390
same fucking people will then bitch that
there's no fucking original TV shit out

663
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:25,960
there. And then that just sees unoriginal
conch and you know, it's funny,

664
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:26,980
they're all,

665
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,620
they're just repeating shit that they've
heard and then they're all laughing

666
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:34,150
their fucking asses off at their
own shit. It's fucking annoying. Oh,

667
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,570
I forgot to bring up the hockey
thing while I was going to say, uh,

668
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,300
you know what's killing me right now is
I think because of the injuries that the

669
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,340
penguins have and the fact that the
fucking Bruins can't score more than two

670
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,630
goals a fucking game.

671
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,040
I actually think that the Canadians or
the team to beat right now in the east,

672
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:54,040
and it fucking kills me that those cons
are looking like they actually have a

673
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:58,870
shot at winning a cup this year because
there's nothing I enjoy more than the

674
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:02,200
fact that the Montreal Canadians
are just not a factor anymore,

675
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,670
but they're never going to be
a factor ever again. You know,

676
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:11,170
the way that they were. I mean, it's a
fucking 30 team league now, you know,

677
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,330
I mean, dominating a fucking six
team league. It's, it's really,

678
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,960
it's really the of all like, you know,
they look back at the Yankee Dynasty,

679
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,930
the Celtics, the fucking packers and
Steelers, and then the Canadians.

680
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:26,350
The Canadians is the most,
that one has the most fucking holes in it.

681
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,491
You know what I mean?

682
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:32,380
You dominated a 16 fucking Lee had to
beat five other fucking teams. Okay.

683
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,130
Four of which were in the
United States of America.

684
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,960
A country that could give
a flying fuck about hockey.

685
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,640
Nobody wanted it to be the
next rocket Ryszard down here.

686
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,910
They wanted to be the next Mickey Mantle.
Nobody gave a fuck.

687
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,450
So four out of the five teams, all you
had to be Pete was the maple leafs.

688
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,340
And in fact, up until 1967 as
far as Stanley cups went, it, uh,

689
00:40:57,341 --> 00:41:01,440
the Canadians and the maple leaf for
going blow for blow. They didn't want the,

690
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,630
this is, this is how much hockey
didn't mean shit in this country.

691
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,140
I saw a story one time on,
um, on the NHL channel,

692
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,770
the radio morning radio program where
they were talking about how the rangers

693
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:15,870
finally made it to the Stanley Cup
finals and Madison Square Gardens.

694
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:20,871
So didn't give a fuck about hockey every
year they booked the circus in Madison

695
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,480
Square Garden during the time
when the Stanley Cup finals was.

696
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,830
So the fucking rangers make
it and they're like, fuck you,

697
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:32,140
we already have the circus. And
they're like, but wait a minute,

698
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:35,990
we're in the Stanley Cup.
And they go, yeah, but we got
elephants. Go Fuck Yourself.

699
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,750
So the Rangers had to
play their home games.

700
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:41,600
They put them in Toronto because they
were playing Detroit and they figured to,

701
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,920
Toronto was the closest, you know,
I guess, I dunno to fucking Detroit.

702
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:48,830
So maybe you'd get some
Toronto fans and hated Detroit.

703
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,520
I Dunno why they just didn't send them to
Chicago. Who the fuck knows? But that's,

704
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,930
that's, that's how much hockey meant,
you know, so that's what I'm saying.

705
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,220
I look at that dynasty like it's fucking
bullshit. Not Bullshit. I respect it,

706
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:05,810
but it's kind of like, you know. Okay.

707
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,010
Five other fucking teams. Wow. Did
you go on a run? That's amazing.

708
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:14,720
You had a one in five fucking chance
of winning it. How did you do it?

709
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,280
Um, so my name's bill. Hey, you read it at
best, so I know. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

710
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,860
Anyways,
um,

711
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,680
I've been riding on a high point for the
first time this month and I wanted to

712
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:26,030
get your opinion on this matter.

713
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,180
I was on a low point when it came to the
ladies and I couldn't bag a 300 pound

714
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,220
baldy for the life of me.

715
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:35,690
Okay.

716
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,860
Uh, baldy you're talking about
a woman here. Same with a fatty,

717
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,450
with a shade putsy what
are you talking about?

718
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,140
All of a sudden I've been landing every
hot broad I've been interested in for

719
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:48,770
the last past six months and I just
don't fucking get it. Well, don't,

720
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:51,890
don't overthink it.
It's like golf.

721
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,270
Don't get your head just
fucking swing away. Um,

722
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,000
how does it work that nothing about me
has really changed besides I bought a new

723
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:01,730
shirt and maybe did a few
more pull ups the normal,

724
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,640
but it just seems like when it's raining,
it's pouring pussy.

725
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,330
The women's smell it on you or what?
I'm not exaggerating this man.

726
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:12,680
I've landed two of the hottest girls
I've ever met in my entire life this past

727
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:15,740
two weeks.
I just wanted to ask the age old question,

728
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:19,400
why in the fuck does
this all happen at once?

729
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,110
Why can't life space this out?

730
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:24,500
So I can ride the wave for a year or two
and be happy instead of having it all

731
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:28,730
happen at once and life sucks eight
out of 12 months of the year. Um,

732
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,410
because getting pussies, it's like
playing golf. It's a fucking mental game.

733
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,700
All right, and if you have a bad shot,
you got to block the last one out.

734
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,960
It's like a relief pitcher.
He let up a home run. Fuck it.

735
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,520
Give me another ball and you just block.
You got to block it out.

736
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,360
But what happens is,
is you know,

737
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,070
you start to feel like you're in a slump
and then you get desperate and fucking

738
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:55,670
women just stay, smell it on
you. You come in in there,

739
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:59,810
you know you're trying too hard extra
splash, a cologne, you're, you're fucking,

740
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:00,770
you're right in their grill.

741
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,390
Like Louisville full court fucking press
your write up on that fucking pussy and

742
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:06,290
then that's it.
It's over.

743
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,630
They get all nervous and they
pick up the ball and they go home.

744
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,683
You know,

745
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,160
you can't give a fuck the only,
I've only golf a few times,

746
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:17,390
but like I don't keep score.

747
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:21,230
I refuse to give a shit about that sport
and I have a great time and everybody

748
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:23,780
else's fucking throwing their
clubs and getting all pissed off.

749
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,780
I don't give a fuck. I'm having
a great time. You know what?

750
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:28,670
I'm going for the hall.
I'm going for the pin,

751
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,160
you know,
I fucking

752
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,950
miss and I suck, but I'm having a
good time. That's all you gotta do.

753
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,190
You gotta go Phil Mickelson
on these bitches. All right.

754
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,060
They'll fucking trying to plot
and get par. Go for the Birdie.

755
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,430
You don't want, if you
miss it, who gives a fuck?

756
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,430
You got to stay in that zone
and not giving a shit, sir.

757
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,940
And even then you still going to, there's
going to be feet, feast or famine.

758
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,410
That's it's just how it is. If I
knew the answer to that, you know,

759
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:04,360
I would have done much better in my, uh,
my pathetic trying to get some career.

760
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,970
Um, all right. Book of job.

761
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,330
Okay.

762
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,930
God is the glory of Vegas.
Okay. Hey, hey belt.

763
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:14,810
Listening to the podcast and religious,

764
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,820
the religious douche giving his douchey
impression of the story of Joe pissed me

765
00:45:19,821 --> 00:45:23,160
off. First of all, the phrase he got.

766
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:24,590
Yeah.

767
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,700
Jobbed is actually derived
from the story of job. Oh,

768
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:33,170
we just pronounce it right.
Is it, is it job or jobs?

769
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,030
I don't fucking know.
Here's why. First of all,

770
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,200
Christians condemned gambling and yet
hold bingo parties in the church parlors

771
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:45,530
every week. But the book of
job actually reveals that God,

772
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,690
God is all for gambling because not
only did God make the very first way,

773
00:45:49,691 --> 00:45:54,691
Joe God was also the first pit boss
and heaven was the first casino.

774
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,410
I like where this guy's going.
Um,

775
00:45:57,411 --> 00:46:02,411
the Bible story is that job was
so devastated to devote it to God.

776
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:06,860
Sorry that there was no way he
would ever curse God's name.

777
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,940
The devil went to heaven and said to God,
uh,

778
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,380
no shitty won't curse you. He's rich
as fuck. He's got a hot wife. Seven,

779
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:20,381
no non gay sons and three
great looking daughters.

780
00:46:20,391 --> 00:46:21,650
Who Will,
who don't date?

781
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,370
Give me five minutes with that piece
of shit and I'll get him to curse you

782
00:46:25,371 --> 00:46:30,080
upside down till next Tuesday.
And God said, uh, yeah,

783
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:32,120
you want to make no fucking way,
Jeff.

784
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:33,950
Okay.

785
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,040
See God, new job. God made job.

786
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:41,900
God knew 100% for certain that
he would win this, this bet.

787
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,340
Uh,
Bingo.

788
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:47,900
God is now the first casino boss because
God has an inside knowledge of the game.

789
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,600
God even gave the devil the odds.

790
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:54,050
So they shook on it and the devil goes
out fucking over, job's something fierce,

791
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,120
raped and killed his kids. Holy.
She kids raped and killed his kids,

792
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:02,570
really burned all his house and crops,

793
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:07,790
killed all his livestock. But the worst,
the devil essentially gave Joe Herpes,

794
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,790
but not just to job's wife.
Ah,

795
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,450
what the fuck to herpes,
but not to job's wife.

796
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,160
Try explain that to your wife without
at least cursing God a little under your

797
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:24,870
breath. But Joe never caved, so God
won the bet. Of course, God won.

798
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:28,920
It's God. God did give Joe
Ball his stuff back, but now,

799
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,050
but how stupid was the devil dead?
He bet against God.

800
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,050
Okay.

801
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:37,590
The same as all of us when we go to
Vegas and come out saying, I got jobbed.

802
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,230
Ah, Jesus Christ. That
was so fucking clever.

803
00:47:43,231 --> 00:47:47,180
It made my fucking head burst.
I think you're absolutely right,

804
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,321
but I,
I just,

805
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:51,900
I got halfway through that story and
it's like there's no way that someone

806
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:56,570
wouldn't, wouldn't freak the
fuck out rate is fucking kids.

807
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,720
Why is the Bible's is so
fucking violent like that.

808
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:00,890
Okay.

809
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:05,530
And you just have to sit there and unlike,
you know why?

810
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:10,531
Because they want you to
be just completely 100%
devoted to the bullshit that

811
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:11,861
they're giving you.

812
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:15,370
That the invisible guys saying their
version of what the invisible guys saying

813
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,060
to the point that someone
can come and rape your kids,

814
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,660
burned down your houses and your
crops kill all your livestock.

815
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:28,300
And at no point you're not supposed to
be like God data at any point in that's

816
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:29,660
supposed to fucking say that.

817
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:30,990
Okay.

818
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,630
And if you don't,
God's going to give you everything back.

819
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:38,631
He isn't horrible shit happen to people's
families like that and the [inaudible]

820
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:41,790
and God doesn't come back and make it
fucking better, but fucking idiots. We'll,

821
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:44,700
we'll go to church and they'll hear that
fucking story and they will believe it.

822
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,141
Sorry.

823
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:48,970
So you mean you made a great but it almost
seemed like a very common one s kind

824
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,040
of bit there.
Um,

825
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:52,070
okay.

826
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:55,520
Sorry. It's just my fucking
opinion on a organized religion.

827
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,880
I get a little flustered. I get a
little hot under the collar, um,

828
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,540
law school or bust.
Hey bill loved the podcast.

829
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:07,400
Nobody really [inaudible] so my question
has to do with the law school. Um,

830
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:08,350
okay.

831
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,560
Oh with law school,
my brain is not fucking working today.

832
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:17,490
I'm going to be done my first year of
law school in three weeks and I hated it.

833
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:21,820
I have never found anything I like
to do in my life other than you.

834
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,140
The usual under achievable things
like my love for hockey and football.

835
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,850
I hate every job I've ever had and I
thought law school might be the answer but

836
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:33,010
it's not well but it's not bed.

837
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,910
I cannot stand law school and I cannot
stand the thought of the career in law.

838
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,170
These professors always talk about
all the rules, all the restrictions,

839
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:44,950
all the dealing face to face with
people's problems. It sounds exhausting.

840
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:48,130
It sounds not fun at all.
And I have zero enjoyment from it.

841
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,150
I already know the answer to your problems
here, sir. Or at least I feel I do. Uh,

842
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:54,350
you said,
my question is this,

843
00:49:54,351 --> 00:49:58,190
my friends and family all say this is
just part of life. Nobody loves their job,

844
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,090
nobody likes school, et Cetera. But I
see these people who love their jobs.

845
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,210
I see people in my class that
loved their law school stuff.

846
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:09,470
I don't know whether I should stick it
out in school and just pray it grows on

847
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:13,310
me. The debts from law
school are insane. Um,

848
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,590
hope it grows on me like
everyone says it might.

849
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:19,100
Or should I take the plunge and
change direction completely.

850
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:22,190
Completely look for something
else that pulls my excitement.

851
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,200
I do not know what to do and it weighs on
me daily. Thanks. And go fuck yourself,

852
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,640
dude. You're ignoring your
inner voice, which is saying,

853
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:36,170
I don't like this shit. Okay.
And what you're going to,
but it's a safe way to go.

854
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,040
You get a law degree, you get,
you become a partner, right?

855
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:42,830
And all of a sudden you make money
and you fucking hate your life.

856
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,550
And you know what,

857
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:47,390
you're going to bring that home to your
wife and your kids and you're going to

858
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:51,920
be an asshole husband and father and
because you hate your fucking job.

859
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,010
All right? Or You could
possibly do that. Who knows?

860
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:58,780
You could come home and just fucking
leave it at the front door. Look too.

861
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,840
All right. You said you have a
love for hockey and football.

862
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:04,580
Do you know how many
fucking jobs there are?

863
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:05,940
Yeah.

864
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,230
Why don't you go into that?
You know,

865
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,270
if you're going to stick with law school,

866
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:15,200
I become a sports agent so you
at least around it. But, um,

867
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:17,780
if I was into hockey or
football, I don't know. I would,

868
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:22,370
I would try to get into broadcast
and get into journalism.

869
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,630
Um, maybe become a sports
trainer or something.

870
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,170
There's all kinds of jobs at the cup.

871
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,010
Highschool where can weigh up to college
and all that type of shit. You know,

872
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,160
I would go that route.
If you like sports and you're into that,

873
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,121
you know that this,

874
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:38,870
this philosophy by a lot of people who
don't go after their fucking dreams,

875
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,880
that if you, if you, that
those aren't real jobs.

876
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:44,840
Like getting an in,

877
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:48,800
in any sort of entertainment or having
any sort of any exciting fucking job.

878
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:53,660
Like it'd be, I don't know, be one of
those, those Whitewater rafting guides,

879
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,910
those fucking people you know,

880
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,350
who get all kinds of fucking pussy because
he got these people who this is their

881
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:03,650
one week vacation from the job they hate
and they see this person who is totally

882
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:08,510
free love and life, you know, women.
Oh my God, that looks, that looks fun.

883
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:10,220
I needed inside me.
Right?

884
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,720
We've seen they're getting banged up
against some rock right next to the cores

885
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,970
fucking factory.
Um,

886
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,200
that's what I would do, sir. You
sign absolutely fucking miserable.

887
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:22,940
It seems like you love
hockey and football.

888
00:52:22,941 --> 00:52:27,140
So I would try and find a job in hockey
and football and I know that sounds

889
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:31,730
fucking insane, but you know, so
was telling jokes for a living.

890
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,530
I wasn't the funniest guy in high school.
I was funny, but I wasn't the funniest.

891
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,910
I just went to a fucking open mic and I
turned everything that I used to get in

892
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:45,680
trouble for until now I make money and
now I'm here in Atlanta two feet from a

893
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:49,460
fucking airport, breathing in jet fuel,
going to go to the NCAA championship game.

894
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:52,940
Cause I tell jokes for fucking living.
You too sir, can live your dream.

895
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:55,430
If a dumb fuck like me could do it,
you can do it too.

896
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,250
It sounds like you absolutely fucking
hate being in being in law school.

897
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,383
All right.

898
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,570
Okay.

899
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,680
It's going to be terrible dude.

900
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,840
Then you become a lawyer and
then because you hate it,

901
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,900
you're going to be looking for a big
score. You know when you get to do some,

902
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,160
you know,
some sort,

903
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,160
some sort of corruptible fucking thing
to get your fucking money so you can

904
00:53:14,161 --> 00:53:15,510
parachute your way out of there.

905
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,820
You can be sitting in you stupid
office with your cufflinks.

906
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,840
See a little tie tech just
counting down the days,

907
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,410
you know to when fucking have a vacation.

908
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:26,621
Dude,

909
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:30,130
you're going to be a trial lawyer and
somebody is freedom is going to be on the

910
00:53:30,131 --> 00:53:32,500
line and you're not going to
have any fucking passion for,

911
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,600
you're going to be sitting
across someone going, oh my God,

912
00:53:34,601 --> 00:53:36,520
if I listened to listen
to one more person,

913
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,380
tell me that drugs were planted
on them. I mean, I've telling you,

914
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,160
don't fucking do it. All right? You
can have a fun job and make money.

915
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:49,580
It's one of the biggest fucking lies
that's told by the generation. And,

916
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,510
and you know, if your parents are fucking
miserable and they hate their job,

917
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,310
they don't know.
They don't know.

918
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,310
So that's telling you what they know
that you know what? Life's tough.

919
00:53:57,311 --> 00:54:00,010
And you go and you'll sit
there and you hit the books.

920
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,610
You have this fucking miserable fucking
existence. You don't have to do it.

921
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,390
Look at all these fucking
people writing blogs.

922
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,870
He's fucking people out there
who like they're into food.

923
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:12,850
I'm a foodie and they
go around and Oh my God,

924
00:54:12,851 --> 00:54:15,700
the apple had a so much sediment
on it and they take pictures of it.

925
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,940
It makes me know they've
got an advertising and then
making money sitting there

926
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:22,510
in the fucking pajamas, eating fruit
loops, reviewing it, making money.

927
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,140
You can't make money in
fucking hockey and football.

928
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,830
I, you're, you're out of
your fucking mind, sir.

929
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,440
Yeah,

930
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,610
I felt the weight of your fucking life
reading that thing. All right. So please,

931
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:38,480
for the love of God,

932
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,850
for all the innocent men that you're going
to defend halfheartedly in the future,

933
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,110
please tap out of that fucking industry
and go someplace that you give a fuck.

934
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,750
All right? And that's it,
sir. And you know what?

935
00:54:50,751 --> 00:54:53,900
That's one to grow on a meet and greets.
Hey Bill,

936
00:54:53,901 --> 00:54:57,590
I'm curious what you think about the meet
and greet, taking pictures, et Cetera,

937
00:54:57,591 --> 00:55:00,410
with people who attend your shows.
Is it completely awkward?

938
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,320
I fucking hate that word.
Stop using that word.

939
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:09,200
Such a fucking overly used God damn
word and the whole fucking generation,

940
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,370
the sun is shining awkward, laughing
my ass off, shaking my head, tweet.

941
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,560
Um,
do you enjoy it?

942
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,460
Is it nice to hear people tell you how
funny you are or does it just become

943
00:55:21,461 --> 00:55:24,520
ridiculous? I see pictures
that fans take with artists.

944
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,410
And I always wonder if
the artists are thinking,

945
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:30,370
kill me now or if they appreciate someone
wanting to take a picture with them in

946
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:33,930
that setting, have a great
day and go fuck yourself. Um,

947
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,480
the meet and greet is like doing a
whole other show. If you're tired,

948
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:42,680
it's a fucking pain in
the ass. Um, but you know,

949
00:55:42,681 --> 00:55:46,280
if you go out there, you, you, you know,

950
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:49,800
you put a fucking smile on your face
and you take pictures with people. Um,

951
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,620
it's really what it is. What makes it
exhausting is, is 15% of the people,

952
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,780
85% of fucking cool.

953
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,220
It's the 15% that are
fucking hammered and, uh,

954
00:56:01,221 --> 00:56:04,730
this slapping you on the back and if
or they've got their fucking sweaty,

955
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,880
there's a bunch of like,
you know, I understand why,

956
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:09,530
how he Mendell does the fist bump.

957
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:16,250
But, um, generally speaking, you
know, I like going out there.

958
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,530
I like going out there and
having people say, Hey, you know,

959
00:56:18,531 --> 00:56:20,540
I had a bad day and listen to the podcast.

960
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:22,940
And I've had people come up to me and say,
you know,

961
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,710
their mom has cancer and like, she
watched all three of your specials and,

962
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:29,950
and you know, it put a smile on her
face. I mean, that, that's like,

963
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:35,050
that's worth going out there and
dealing with, you know, when, you know,

964
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:39,700
one of my pet peeves is when somebody
is much taller than me as a guy and they

965
00:56:39,701 --> 00:56:42,190
put their arm around
me and they're sweaty.

966
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:46,510
Fucking warm armpit is resting on one
of my shoulders. I fucking hate that.

967
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,040
All right. But, you know,

968
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,730
it makes it worth it when you hear
stories like that or you got, you know,

969
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,090
people who are going off to
war or came back or whatever,

970
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:57,610
and they say they listen to you
a joke. So it's, there's always,

971
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:03,290
there's always a couple of
cool conversations that, uh,
that makes it worth it. Um,

972
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,020
what makes it annoying is when people
don't have their cell phones ready or they

973
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,590
hand them to somebody
they don't even know,

974
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,240
and then they don't know
how to use the phone.

975
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:16,150
And then they get upset because this
complete stranger doesn't know how to use

976
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:20,140
this phone. That's not even
theirs. And, um, at that point,

977
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:23,530
you already have your arms around these
complete strangers and then that gets a

978
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:28,090
little weird. Uh, but you know,
it's a part of it, you know,

979
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:32,050
you don't like fucking doing that,
then, uh, you know, don't, don't, uh,

980
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:37,840
don't jump on stage. You know,
it's how I look at it. I mean,

981
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:39,010
sometimes I don't go out there.

982
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:41,440
If I'm fucking exhausted and
I feel like I'm getting sick,

983
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,720
I won't go out there because,
you know,

984
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,830
I'm going to go out to a shaken all
these fucking hands and I'm getting

985
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,010
everybody's germs all over me.

986
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:51,760
Then I'm going to get sick and then my
next show is going to suck because I'm

987
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:53,810
going to be sick. And it's,
you know, I had, that's the,

988
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,560
my first obligation is you
paid a ticket to see me.

989
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:58,680
Give you a great fucking show.
And if I don't do that,

990
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,433
mmm.

991
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,420
You know, what's the point? All
right. So there you go. All right.

992
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:08,320
Single man advice. Oh, I'll still, but
I gotta be honest with you too. Um,

993
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,390
when I first used to go out there,

994
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,290
you mean it's a skill to know how
to actually talk and interact.

995
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:17,340
It's like a whole new skill
you have to learn. So, um,

996
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,120
I wasn't good at it at first.

997
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:21,023
MMM.

998
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,660
I just be like, hey, how are you?
Did you like the show? You know,

999
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:27,340
I was really bad at it and um,

1000
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:31,860
through launching certain people
who are just naturally good at it,

1001
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:35,500
like I always thought Dane
was really good at it. Um,

1002
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:36,790
yeah,

1003
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:37,421
Kevin Hart,

1004
00:58:37,421 --> 00:58:40,240
I thought it was really just naturally
good at it and I would just kind of watch

1005
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:42,640
how they interacted with people and uh,

1006
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:44,250
okay.

1007
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,860
Tried to use that as a,
I don't know,

1008
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:51,610
it was a guideline on how to
fucking do it, you know? So anyways,

1009
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,980
but I have to admit like it, people
never used to do that. Like the, the,

1010
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,240
the interaction that
you guys have now with,

1011
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:02,080
with people that you see it shows is
fucking insane. You know, I went to,

1012
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,320
I went to a no doubt concert and
she was like taking pictures,

1013
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,920
like grabbing people's cell phones
and taking like fucking selfies,

1014
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,830
I guess is what they call them
with people in the fucking crowd.

1015
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:16,150
And I actually found that annoying.
It's like I came here to see you guys.

1016
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:18,280
All right.
You know,

1017
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:22,940
I know now you have to kiss the crowds
ass to like some fucking unbelievable

1018
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:26,010
level. But I just think it
like knocks down. It's like
you're a fucking rock star.

1019
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,480
Be a rock star. You should
be that accessible. You know?

1020
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,480
I don't fucking know what, whatever.
Here we go. Single man advice. Hi Bill.

1021
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:40,550
Uh, okay. Me Just Bill. Maybe
a little more than that.

1022
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:45,440
No, just bill. I'm keeping the intro
simple. I'm single and need advice.

1023
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,240
I don't know what soup to choose.

1024
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:52,130
I'm really fond of clam chowder or
these euphemisms for different kinds of

1025
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,030
women. Really Fun of Clam Chowder,
right? So you're like a pasty redhead,

1026
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,810
but know that chicken
noodle soup would be better.

1027
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,620
Paint the picture of the
classic bachelor role. What?

1028
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:06,940
Okay,

1029
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,361
you guys,

1030
01:00:07,361 --> 01:00:11,050
why do you guys leave out like four words
in a row and just make me sound even

1031
01:00:11,051 --> 01:00:11,890
dumber than I am.

1032
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:12,940
Okay.

1033
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,810
Which soup would look better spilled
on the plain white t shirt also.

1034
01:00:16,811 --> 01:00:20,080
I just cleaned my apartment after
letting the dust build for a while.

1035
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:24,790
Is this a problem? Thanks for the
advice. Thanks for any advice.

1036
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,740
It worked. Single man advice I've do. I
really have to answer this fucking thing,

1037
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:32,040
which we'll look to.

1038
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,160
Clam chowder is like Crustacean Jizz
Clam Chowder is fucking disgusting.

1039
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:43,580
It's fucking gross. It's
like lobster puke. Ah,

1040
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:47,110
it's just warm at that chunks is shit.
Now all the women are turning this up,

1041
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:49,750
but it's fucked.
Clam chowder is,

1042
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,820
it's octopus Jizz.
Okay.

1043
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:58,530
An octopus that's taking Propecia and is
having a reaction to it and that's what

1044
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:03,250
those jumps are. Um, chicken noodle soup.

1045
01:01:03,251 --> 01:01:07,600
Come on, man. That's hard.
That's good stuff. That broth
is barely going to show up.

1046
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,720
They would, if you
fucking, you know, if yeah,

1047
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:11,560
you get clam chowder on your tee shirt,

1048
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:14,980
people are going to think you took
a fucking hot one to the face.

1049
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:19,720
Dribbled off you'd goddamned Chin.
Wow. Disgusting Lobster Puke,

1050
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,360
Octopus,
ges,

1051
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:27,790
and then a fucking male on male
facial to end the fucking podcast.

1052
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:32,390
How do you like that up right there.
Fucking two point minus two points.

1053
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:35,430
So the desk mount, um,
I think that that is,

1054
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:38,830
I mean we are we going to end with that?
Let's type some of my shows here.

1055
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:42,400
Everybody. Um, oh by the way, by the way,

1056
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:46,720
I almost forgot to bring up
the hard copy version of you.

1057
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:51,220
People are all the same for all
the old school media consumption,

1058
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:53,290
summers,
whatever the fuck you say out there.

1059
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,190
If you're old school like me and
if you really like something,

1060
01:01:57,191 --> 01:02:01,110
you just don't want to download it.
I don't like doing that cause I, I,

1061
01:02:01,111 --> 01:02:06,070
if I can't fucking hold on to it,
you know, it's in the air man.

1062
01:02:06,071 --> 01:02:08,260
I don't fucking like that
stuff where you know,

1063
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:13,480
it's on my iTunes and it's in,
it's in, it's on my fucking, uh,

1064
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,970
my phone or my iPod or whatever.

1065
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:20,970
I don't like that shit because of those
things all die back in the day when you

1066
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:24,480
stereo died, you didn't lose
your whole record collection too.

1067
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:26,130
So I am a big fan if you like to have,

1068
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:29,430
it's like having the gold
behind you money. All right.

1069
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,440
If you'd like a hard copy version,

1070
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:36,710
either come out and see me live
or a buy one off of the website.

1071
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,660
It's right underneath where,
uh,

1072
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:42,210
you can either download it for five bucks
for the kids, that's the snowboarders.

1073
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,870
And if you still ski, if you're old
school and you want the hard copy,

1074
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:50,090
it's available bill bird.com right
on the merchant page. And uh,

1075
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:53,580
slowly but surely I am working
on some podcasts, tee shirts.

1076
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,890
Um, and that is it. That's the
podcast for this week. Let's, uh,

1077
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,470
let's quickly go to
[inaudible] dot com here.

1078
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:04,300
Who Do you guys liking the game tonight?
Hodie alike.

1079
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:09,090
I have family from the Midwest, some kind
of pulling from Michigan, but you know,

1080
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,880
Louisville has got the
whole broken leg story.

1081
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,980
So I don't know who to vote for
here, who to root for. But, um,

1082
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,910
I have to tell you that,
that Michigan seems to win on talent.

1083
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:26,100
You know, like, I kind of fucked
they beat Syracuse was beyond me

1084
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:31,520
because Syracuse had this insane fucking
zone defense and they will all the way

1085
01:03:31,521 --> 01:03:33,920
out by the three point line. So
immediately I'm thinking, what?

1086
01:03:33,921 --> 01:03:37,600
Just fucking fast break.
Don't let him get set up.

1087
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:42,160
Don't let the ball touch the fucking
court. Do some Magic Johnson, showtime,

1088
01:03:42,161 --> 01:03:42,994
Lakers Shit.

1089
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:46,510
Get it up there and get some easy fucking
layups and make them adjust to your

1090
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:47,830
fucking game.
And they didn't,

1091
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,850
they would just dribble it up the court
and let these fucking guys get set up.

1092
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:52,870
Okay.

1093
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,410
They couldn't beat the double team. Like,
I feel like Michigan is getting, like,

1094
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,160
because they're so young,
they just kids,

1095
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:03,140
I really feel that they're just kind
of getting away on raw talent and now

1096
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:04,850
they're going up against Rick Pitino

1097
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:11,160
who's just a monster coach. Um, I
think Louisville is going to take it.

1098
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,620
That's what I think.
But my hat,

1099
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,340
I'll be rooting for Michigan
hail to the victors value in,

1100
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,710
you know, I also like Ohio. Hi. Oh state.
That's because I come from Massachusetts.

1101
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:29,550
We don't really have any pro shit other
than Doug Flutie fucking stupid share

1102
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:34,110
went down again. Fucking con.
All right, so this is the deal.

1103
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:38,130
I'm going to be at the Georgia theater
