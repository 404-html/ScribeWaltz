Hey, what's going on?
Hey. Oh, what's going on?

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,010

just checking in on you.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,040
Just check all I'm eating
my balls do to, to, to,

7
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,640
to do on a damn stage Bob.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,730
Oh, freckles is paying the fucking
price. He's paying the price.

9
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:35,730
Every comedian that has a
special coming up, you know,

10
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,100
in the next couple of weeks,
whenever the fuck they're putting it out.

11
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,530
I believe the rumor I heard a rumor.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,550
Bananarama oh yeah. When are they
going to get back together? Huh?

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,970
Fuck.
Every year that goes by,

14
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:54,270
everybody was talking about when's guns
and roses going to get back together.

15
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,060
When's axl and slash going to,
but what about Banana Rama?

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,430
Okay,

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,790
I hear a room and they were getting back
together for a summer. Fucking tall.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,340
Um, I'm paying the price.
Every God damn. Oh look,

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,930
a job are paid.
Uh,

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,170
who have a special coming out is that
you just go on stage and you have,

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,950
you know, you got nothing.
You got one little fucking,

22
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:23,060
you got one little pea shooter and then
you've got a slingshot and a fucking

23
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,600
whatever,
two months earlier you had a Howard sir,

24
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:29,330
have a fucking act and it's
the weirdest fucking thing.

25
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:31,010
Just imagine if a whatever,

26
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:34,910
if you're an athlete or something like
every couple of years he had to relearn

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,810
that, all the mechanics, but you just
couldn't hit the jump shot anymore.

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,560
He had to fucking, ah, that
that shot was in my repertoire.

29
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,840
Now I've got to relearn how
to fucking do this in a sense,

30
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,070
but in a different way.

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,800
I've got to do it and then I got to shoot
it with my left hand now because they

32
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,950
already saw me do it with my right hand.
And then the more you fucking do it,

33
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:54,520
the more hours you put
out. Right. Then you go,

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,300
when I got to bounce
it off my fucking head,

35
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:59,810
cause you know you can't keep doing the
same shit or everybody's there more or

36
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:03,470
they say, dude, that reminds
me of this day, your day.

37
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:07,100
Oh no other guy with this person. Right.
You just got to fucking deal with that.

38
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:11,930
So last night, you know, and of course
they have to go on after Ian Edwards,

39
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,680
I a n Edwards who's won like lack guy.

40
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:19,370
All he has is a level fucking
material just up. They're murdering.

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,410
And uh,
I went up there with my look book,

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,890
but the total basic fucking horse shit,

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,320
I was in a really fucking dark place.

44
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,120
It's funny to be in a dark place and then
like, you know, mentally just like, uh,

45
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,500
and then to be talking about the
shit that I was talking about and um,

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,180
yeah,

47
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,040
I dunno, but I, I got to plow
through this shit as far as like, uh,

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,980
I got to get past my anger and I'm telling
you this fucking exercise that I did

49
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,860
that I'm really starting
to think my shoulders.

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,560
How fuck do you put your shoulders up?
Remember that bit I used to do,

51
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:56,930
I think I was stuck in
a defensive posture,

52
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,150
like shell shocked,
you know what I mean?

53
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:04,230
There's only so many times you can get
slapped in the back of the head by bigger

54
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,120
kids before your shoulders
are just naturally up.

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,420
Like you're already beginning to block
whatever's coming at you fucking head.

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,610
And I think I was kind of
stuck in that and um, you know,

57
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,830
I was talking to some people about
that and it was like, well, you know,

58
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,160
there's physical ailments and then
there's the emotional fucking trauma of

59
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,330
what's going on with your life.

60
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,130
And there's certain people
that think they're related.

61
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,530
I don't know if you guys
are into that Hippie,

62
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,360
but you look up to stuff,
you know,

63
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,430
this is like one of these things
when you go to look this up,

64
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,390
you completely leave the
medical profession in the
United States of America.

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Like you start like the doctors slowly
start wearing less and less shoes as you

66
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:49,030
start to go further east with your, your,
you're looking for medical solutions.

67
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,380
You know, if you're looking for a
medical solution in the United States of,

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
of the Americas,

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,080
it's going to be a guy in wingtip
shoes with fucking dark socks,

70
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,620
you know, fully clothed being
like, okay, yeah, you got a,

71
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,680
your rotator cuff is taped up though.

72
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:08,470
We need to go in and operate
and take the Metal Carlo,

73
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,910
all the fucking MCL and all,

74
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:13,480
they're going to give you this
straight fucking how the body works.

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,290
We've done an MRI. This is what the
fuck is going on with your body.

76
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,620
But then as you start to go,
you know,

77
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,280
you start to step away from that shit
that the pharmaceutical companies and all

78
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,390
that,
not saying it's all bad,

79
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,700
not saying it's all Ben was the
last time we had a plague. You know,

80
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,940
for as much as the pharmaceutical
companies allegedly
allegedly created a heroin

81
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:37,300
epidemic in this country by handing
out opiates like Flintstone vitamins to

82
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:40,660
fucking adults. Uh, you
know, there's also, you know,

83
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,870
because nobody's walking around with
scurvy, so that's something, right?

84
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,090
I guess no one really walked
around with scurvy bill.

85
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:49,150
He had to be on a fucking
boat, lost at sea, you know,

86
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,660
with no wind in your sails and
iron maiden singing right the car.

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,230
Um, so, uh, yeah,

88
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:03,520
but the further you go down that rabbit
hole, like, uh, the, the fucking,

89
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:07,660
the longer the hair gets,
then there's like, you know,
more loose fitting clothes,

90
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:11,470
then it becomes sandals.
And then just sort of the more,

91
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,690
you know me and even then we should,
I can,

92
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:17,480
I can like this and then I get
all fucking uncomfortable. Um,

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,381
I'll look up some stuff.

94
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:20,770
Let me hit pause her and I'm going to
look up some shit about like the memories.

95
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:25,360
Let me, let me see what this fucking
doctor looks like. Our of perfect,

96
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,900
perfect fucking perfect.
So I looked up memories held in,

97
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,920
in the meeting that came up was in body.

98
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,390
So of course Wikipedia has something
that's just going to be like, you know,

99
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,240
the old right there, Fred. So the
first thing I scrolled down too,

100
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,860
that was not Wikipedia was tiny Buddha.
All right.

101
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,180
And I swear to God,

102
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,810
it says how to release the painful
memories and emotions stored in your body,

103
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,730
uh, by Jennifer Sterling. Of course, now
they're going to let a woman do something,

104
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,710
right. They're not going to
let her in the wing tip world.

105
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,980
So the picture you see is some
Antonio Banderas looking guy with the,

106
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,840
uh, I call it the gay cut tee
shirt. You know, you know the,

107
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,770
you know the v Neck t shirt
that the fucking gay guys were,

108
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:08,720
cause they're all fucking in crazy shape.
You know what I mean?

109
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:10,490
It's not the dad bod cut.

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,240
It's the gay male fucking cut where they
have chess cleavage because they have

111
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,960
0% body fat.

112
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,790
So the guys dressed white on white
with the gay cut t and yoga pants,

113
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,160
no fucking shoes. And he's
on the beach, not a half.

114
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,880
He looks like fucking a good look.
And Tom Hanks in castaway,

115
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:36,860
if he didn't give a fuck that he
was cast away, cast away. Yeah.

116
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,290
And he didn't need to talk to a soccer
ball because he was so fucking centered

117
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,910
and he breathed his way through.
How the fuck did he become a castaway?

118
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:45,750
I can't even remember.

119
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,410
Okay.

120
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,310
It must've been his ship sank, right?
What was he flying with? Amelia Earhart.

121
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,200
I Dunno.

122
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,960
Was it one of those Tarantino movies
where he kind of fucks with history?

123
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,200
All right.
The cure for pain is in the pain,

124
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,310
says somebody named Rumi and then it says,
free download,

125
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:07,060
Buddha desktop wallpaper.
That kind of kills it.

126
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:10,780
You know when you have a good Jesus
or Buddha or Mohammed like wallpaper,

127
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,920
you know what I mean? Kind of cheeses it
up a little bit. Then you think, okay,

128
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,530
it's all right. Let me read
it. My Best Yoga voice,

129
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:21,100
your body keeps a physical
memory of all your experiences.

130
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,570
You have lots of memory stored in your
brain that you can recount at any given

131
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,250
moment, even called names. Faces. Yeah,

132
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,990
get out of my fucking brain works what
you're fucking sandwich smelled like,

133
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:36,460
but over time these memories fade or
change as time passes as and we mature.

134
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,870
However, even when the memory
begins to fade from your rang,

135
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:40,990
get to the fucking point.
It lives in your body,

136
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,990
in the form of a physical
sensation and behavior patterns.

137
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,570
The body doesn't forget now, Jesus,
what's your body from Hell's kitchen?

138
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,680
And I was for fucking 20 years ago.
You fucking piece of shit.

139
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,180
Your brains all forgiving
like, hey man, like you know,

140
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,980
not going to lie. I didn't enjoy it
when it happened, but you know, God,

141
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:06,720
I mean just the sunny day, just
go out and enjoy it. All right.

142
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,960
The events of our lives leave
physical imprints in our bodies,

143
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:13,380
especially when we experience trauma care.
I okay.

144
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,600
Stress and all this shit that
caused the body to fight, flee,

145
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:21,160
or freeze in order to cope. This is what
I'm saying. I think I was all fucking,

146
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,780
I was in a a,
you know,

147
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,190
after you take a couple of fucking right
left to their head, you just Kinda,

148
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,160
you just walk around. I
just thought I, you know,

149
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:34,840
I have like fucking 40 years ago,

150
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:39,610
whatever the fuck I was in high school
40 years ago

151
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,410
was I 18 now. That was 30 years ago.
30 years ago. It was fuck at 18.

152
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, I'm a, you knew
that phone was gonna ring.

153
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,760
Who is this? Who the hell is this?
I should have put it on pause.

154
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,793
Who is this?

155
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,120
Hello?
Hello.

156
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,490
Yeah,
for Fuck Sake.

157
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,630
Can you believe someone would
pocket down me during my podcast?

158
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,050
You know what's funny is I don't
even know who the fuck that was.

159
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,120
I have no idea who the fuck that was.
They have no idea who the fuck I am. I,

160
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,590
that's what's always fascinated
me about when you just fucking,

161
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,490
you just dial a wrong number.
I've said this before, right?

162
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:30,440
You dial a number and somebody says hello
and you're like, yeah. Hey, is a is is,

163
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,520
is frank there? And they're
like, whoa. And you're like,

164
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,800
and they're like, oh, I'm sorry.

165
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,670
They're like,
I'm sorry you have the wrong number.

166
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,260
Now I get wrong numbers.
Everybody gets wrong numbers.

167
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,360
Here's my question to you.

168
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:54,260
Do you think you've ever
accidentally called somebody famous?

169
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,230
You know what I mean? Like
you just fucking, uh, I dunno.

170
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,600
You just dial the wrong number and like,

171
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:07,400
Bill Clinton picked up or fuck it Obama.
Oh,

172
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:11,030
throw a Republican in there. George
Bush. Hey, she's Daddy, right?

173
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:16,031
He fucking picks up and you and he has
to go through the same shit is you like

174
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:20,840
is frank there? And he said,
[inaudible] know frank e F, g, H.

175
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,060
I love them. Then they'd read
the fucking number. T like,

176
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:26,140
you don't know what your number
is. It says plop. No it isn't.

177
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,830
That's why there's no frank here.
Anyways,

178
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,270
let me continue one. All right, well fuck
all this shit. How do I get it out of me?

179
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,600
Because my body, it never forgets.
It's like fucking Niamh. Listen,

180
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,670
if you punch me in the fucking
head, seventh grade, um,

181
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,460
wait a minute.

182
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,730
I love that they finally give Jamie
Foxx the fucking Liam Neeson Merle.

183
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,400
He has a movie coming out where
it's one of those movies like,

184
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:57,510
you fuck with my family. I'm gonna fucking
kill you. It's about time. You know,

185
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,530
they ran out a young white guys to give
that to and then they just kept going

186
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:05,430
over and like, Liam Neeson me, let me
know that guys. Like, what is it? Like 83,

187
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:10,160
then he play like fucking Obi
wan Kenobi or some shit. Um,

188
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,870
all right. The first tool to
put your emotional toolkit,

189
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,570
the first tool to put in your
emotional toolkit, and this is why,

190
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,690
this is why I've never been
able to get through this shit

191
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,060
because I was getting no,
because I'm fucked up.

192
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:33,061
But when I start to go down this road
of doctors who don't wear shoes like it

193
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,960
said, okay, the pictures
that they have, okay?

194
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:42,910
It says how to set New Year's goals
you'll actually enjoy pursuing and it's a

195
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,770
stick figure sitting on a rainbow staring
up at the sun with a big goofy smile

196
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:51,940
on its face. And uh, I
don't know about you guys,

197
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:55,600
but where I came from,
that sort of happiness was not allowed.

198
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,690
You basically were not allowed to be
happy and it was shamed. Fuck off.

199
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,610
Oh No, wait, why am I letting that
react? I, why am I reacting to that?

200
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,400
I have the power. I could,
you know it's funny,

201
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:17,230
right before I started this I was thinking
I should go into the settings and I

202
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:21,370
should just turn it off and I didn't.
So I created this situation.

203
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,030
Not a dead Steve Jobs.
Huh?

204
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,730
I guess I could get upset with Steve Jobs
with how fucking many times that thing

205
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,250
rings before it goes to voicemail.

206
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:37,090
But then I imagined that I could actually
go into settings and I could determine

207
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,840
that. I just don't have the patients.
All right. The first tool. Okay guys,

208
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,750
your first tool to put in
your emotional toolkit.

209
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,110
This is the type of class I would go
to with Nia and she would just feel me

210
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,890
either starting to get mad or just
laughing at the thing as she being the

211
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:01,220
fucking angel that she is. An open
fucking channel would be like, okay, get,

212
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,720
what is the first emotional tool?
It's cause she's a woman.

213
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:08,500
She gets to fucking do that. Being
like, oh my God, let's get some smores.

214
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,020
They get to be like that.
We're not, you know,

215
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,480
you don't have a fucking bottle opener.
You've gotta use your teeth, you know,

216
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:17,130
and said stupid Guy Shit.

217
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,770
And then if you don't know how to fucking
do that thing where you bring your

218
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:22,050
beer up to the counter
and fucking slam it down,

219
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,620
you know you're somehow less of a man.
Um,

220
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,560
I like how I'm putting all of my issues
onto you guys. All right, let's say we go,

221
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:28,771
okay.

222
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:33,771
The first tool to put into your
emotional toolbox nonjudgment ah,

223
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,640
fuck. I mean, there goes
my standup career. I mean,

224
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,050
my entire fucking life is judging people.
All right?

225
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:44,760
When you feel emotionally triggered
and tempted to turn to food or other

226
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:48,630
addictive behaviors for comfort, I'm
not f well, I'm, maybe I am a drunk.

227
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,370
Try not to judge the reaction. Our
bodies are programmed to seek pleasure,

228
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,750
not discomfort.

229
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,830
So it's natural to try and find something
to soothe the pain and make yourself

230
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:01,470
feel better.
The need to suture yourself with food.

231
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,760
I'm not a fat fuck or other means.
Doesn't make you a bad person.

232
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:10,250
It makes you human. Oh
God, this is so gross.

233
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,740
The second tool permission, the third
tool release. I can't even read this.

234
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,670
The fourth tool.
Forgiveness. Finally time.

235
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,130
Oh my God,
I'm going to the wrong website.

236
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,710
Jennifer sterling is an
emotional eating coach.

237
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,100
Well, what the fuck is this?
Have met the wrong website.

238
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,960
She helps women to stop eating their
feelings and released the physical and

239
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,300
mental emotional weight that keeps
them from feeling the absolute best.

240
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,700
Download the cravings decoder guide and
uncovering the hidden hidden emotional

241
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:47,950
meeting behind your food cravings.
I don't know.

242
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,190
I don't want to be a
fucking negative person,

243
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,160
but doesn't that sound a fucker generic?

244
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,410
I was craving a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich. Okay. What that means is this.

245
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,490
All right, where do you
store your emotions? Where
do you store your emotions?

246
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:04,220
So right now,
this person has a phd.

247
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:06,380
So imagine there they're going
to be wearing more clothes.

248
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,910
They don't even have a picture,

249
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,530
okay?

250
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,190
It may surprise you then. Motions are
not the sole product of your brain,

251
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,050
but our [inaudible]
might be surprised you.

252
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:18,530
This isn't gonna say the same shit as the
last website and these emotions can be

253
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:22,870
triggered through your body
work, meditation, breathing,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

254
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,220
Use one half. All right. You
know, evidently I'm never
going to get cured cause I,

255
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:33,050
I can't get through this
shit. Well certainly not
while doing a fucking podcast.

256
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:37,280
You Moron. Why did you just call
yourself a more on there? Is that,

257
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:41,240
is that really what you thought or is
that what people told you when you were

258
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:41,601
younger?

259
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:44,540
That's the type of shit where you just
want to grab the person by their ankles

260
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,910
and drag them out of their chair
and they just walk out of the room.

261
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,450
You know me from that session,
uh,

262
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,030
Jesus Christ, I'm up against it, dude.
This is what it's like to become a parent.

263
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:59,360
You just suddenly become hyper aware
of how unqualified you are and what a

264
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:00,081
fucking moron.

265
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:03,500
You weren't like someone's gonna be
looking at me like I have questions. Hey,

266
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm like, we talked to my
kid like, Hey, join the club.

267
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,940
You think any of this shit makes
sense to me? At least you're a kid.

268
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:13,130
And you can have the comfort of, of,
of, it's okay that you don't know shit.

269
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:16,160
Where do you get to be my age? And
you don't have an excuse, you know?

270
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,260
And there's that fucking, uh, uh,

271
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,530
whatever the fuck isn't the
Micheal Ray Richardson, Tyson,

272
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,080
Sicily to whatever the fucking name is.
Quiet Leaf Tyson.

273
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,880
I forget what his name is. You
get like fucking the, the, the,

274
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,160
the guy who looks like the,
the cop on the black cop on Barney Miller,

275
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:35,760
who fucking knows about black holes
in the universe and is a fine wine

276
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,594
connoisseur.

277
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,303
MMM.

278
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,530
You know, that's the kind of person
you need is a debt. That guy,

279
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,210
that guy's got fucking answers. You know,
I was reading a thing on him. I'm fine.

280
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:49,850
I got it. I can never remember
this guy's fucking name.

281
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,710
Last name is Tyson de Grasse Tyson.

282
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,640
Tyson scientist. Tyson
sites. We'll go with that.

283
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,700
Mike Tyson's foot worth Neil degrasse
Tyson. This is why he's the shit,

284
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,360
because that only is the unbelievably
intelligent and he knows that we came from

285
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,630
trees or some shit, whatever the fuck
he was saying. You know, thank God.

286
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,770
I don't do heavy drugs. When I
watched that guy show, alright,

287
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,560
he also was talking about how he's into
wine and he was talking about how when

288
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:21,050
you, you had whatever, you
finish a bottle of wine,

289
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,660
you fill it up with water or you go to,
you know, and you're pouring it out.

290
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,730
It does that Glub Glub glub thing.
He was just going,

291
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:28,910
what'd you do is you just turn
the bottle as you turn the bottle,

292
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:32,930
it causes a swirling effect. And uh, uh,
basically because it's swirling down,

293
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:37,200
then there's that hole in the middle,
lets the air go in. So as, as the, uh,

294
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,860
liquids coming out in the
air can freely flow in

295
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,370
to take up the space that the liquid
once had. And it just flows right out.

296
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,500
Plus it looks,
it looks fucking cool as you do it.

297
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,100
So the next time you pour a big fucking
glass of wine for some real housewife,

298
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,880
you know,
gets,

299
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,580
you can't wait to hold her botox
face in your hands. You know,

300
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:03,030
you don't want to fuck it up by Glub glub
glub in it into a giant glass because

301
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:06,720
it might go all over a fucking dress
that she's going to wear once, you know,

302
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,060
they look, you know, that's what
I get out of Neil degrasse Tyson.

303
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,800
I watch that show and I'm
like, God damn it. You know,

304
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:18,801
as much as this guy just told me where
we came from in the universe millions of

305
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,770
years ago or whatever, thousands, I don't
know. You're going to go back to Jesus.

306
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:25,160
That was only what, a couple
thousand years ago. Um,

307
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,870
as much as he's teaching me about that,

308
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,650
he's also on the side showing
me how to bang a real housewife.

309
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,880
Um,
anyways,

310
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,170
so I've continued to uh,
get rid of shit and I'm,

311
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:42,300
I'm still in my office.

312
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,820
That's how much shit I had had two
closets and everything in my room and I've

313
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:47,654
fucking,

314
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,270
I've gotten rid of everything and I might
even do another pass cause I have to

315
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:54,990
tell you, I fucking walk in
there now and I'm relaxed.

316
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,730
I had no idea that when you walk
in and there's a ton of shit,

317
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,200
uh, the level of stress that was
bringing me up, fucking relaxed.

318
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:08,700
And like there's my drum kit, there's
my guitar, there's where I keep my pens,

319
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,960
you know, get it out of here and
anything that's coming in the house,

320
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:17,130
get it the fuck out it. So then yesterday,
of course, you know, you know, women are,

321
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,640
you know, you know, you know, they are,
I mean, if, if, if they're not fucking,

322
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:24,440
you know, watching a real housewife show,
if they're not eating something there,

323
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,550
they're on Amazon buying something.
They just, they, they, they,

324
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,900
they fucking consume
shit. So, um, you know,

325
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:35,130
it's spend the holidays. So we've had a
bunch of boxes, people sending US stuff,

326
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,870
we're sending them shit
and it by my front door,

327
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,300
every day there's these fucking boxes.
Okay.

328
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,580
So what I always do is I
take our fucking address.

329
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,390
Often I put it through the paper,
right?

330
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,960
Then I cut the boxes up and then I take
them over this fucking place that, uh,

331
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:51,870
you know, one of those mailboxes separate
places, you know. And I say, Hey,

332
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,380
go is some free fucking boxes.
They take it now.

333
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,070
I don't know if they throw
it out like goodwill,

334
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,830
but I feel like I made the fucking effort,
you know,

335
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,460
but I can't fucking keep the God damn
door clean and I cut up like fucking 20

336
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,490
these God damn boxes, you know? Did
you went to, you have a fucking baby.

337
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:13,080
Everybody sends your shit. Everybody's
sending your shared socks, shoes, swings,

338
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,820
follow this shit. And
it's just like, you know,

339
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,970
I just love the amount of socks
that they send you. It's like,

340
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:22,080
it's not gonna be able to walk for like
the first fucking, I dunno, six months.

341
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,250
What does it need socks for?

342
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,150
We didn't get me a hang glider.

343
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,550
I mean just that doesn't
even make any fucking sense.

344
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,430
I know you get the baby's
got to keep its feet war,

345
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:38,310
but does it have to have one pair
of socks for every fucking day,

346
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,160
but six month life, you
know, and then what?

347
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,040
You got all these little socks,

348
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,030
it's going to grow out of him and like
fucking Ted's out used to see what level

349
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:52,310
of a con would you have to be to
look at the cutest thing ever.

350
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:56,500
A little baby socks and, and it still
makes you upset. See what I'm saying?

351
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,880
Oh, tell your freckles needs
some help here. Um, all right,

352
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,440
let's get to some of the, uh, let's
get to some of the announcements. Oh,

353
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:08,280
by the way, everybody, I keep
forgetting to promote this, uh,

354
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,340
the Patrice O'neil comedy
benefit, the fifth annual, well,

355
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,980
uh, Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit. I
still have a nice photo on the wall.

356
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:19,630
Somebody did his great painting of him,

357
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,830
the perfect size and all that that I will
never get rid of. Now having said that,

358
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,030
I don't need any more. Um, all
right. Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.

359
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:32,140
This is the fifth annual one at the
New York City Center. All right,

360
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:36,720
we're going to post the link and all
of that. There's a, it's a 2000 seater.

361
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:40,080
We got a couple of hundred
seats left. Yeah. And um,

362
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,030
it's a great way to
start your year. And, um,

363
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,540
it's one of my favorite shows of the year.
Um,

364
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,960
just get to see all of the,
uh,

365
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,110
just all my friends and now it's becoming
like newer guys that were influenced

366
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:56,600
by Patrice and they come and
they talk about, you know,

367
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,900
the amazing comic that he was. And, uh,

368
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,570
I got to tell you that will never not be
in the back of my head cause I love the

369
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,630
guy to death. But it's also like
whenever someone will come up to me and,

370
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,100
and give me a high compliment,
you know,

371
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,570
as far as where I am in the comedy
world right now is a standup comedian.

372
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,830
I always think that's,

373
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:20,030
cause Patrice isn't here right now and
Mitch Hedberg and Geraldo and all these

374
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:23,900
other monsters that we lost. So, uh,

375
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,740
this is an incredible
benefit. And it, uh, you know,

376
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,900
through the money that we've raised,

377
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,470
his mother's been able to get a
condominium and she's living great.

378
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,180
She doesn't have to worry about
anything, you know, you know,

379
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,841
the only thing,
you know,

380
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:43,190
and that's am I really a belief of mine
that when somebody passes and their

381
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:44,960
family members are,
you know,

382
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,000
the only thing they should have
to deal with is the grief of it,

383
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:49,040
which unfortunately you
never totally get passed,

384
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,410
but they shouldn't also have to
deal with all this other stuff,

385
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,240
which is why we continue
to do the benefit.

386
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,280
Because I always hated
when I was coming up,

387
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,960
when there was an unexpected death and
the person had a family and all of that

388
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:04,040
type of shit. You know, it's like you
do one benefit and it's like, okay,

389
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,610
here's your bag, a loop, you know,

390
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,270
trying to make this last for the next
20, 30, 40, 50 fucking years. Um,

391
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,260
I dunno. So that's why we continue
to do it. Plus it keeps the,

392
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,800
the memory of him alive and all of his
comedy out there. Uh, that is the hope.

393
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:25,240
Anyways. Okay. Now I want
it to the advertising,

394
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,080
the Black tux.com.
All right.

395
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:34,081
Looking great for a wedding or a special
event has never been easier with black

396
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,430
Tux dotcom

397
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,150
with high quality rental
suits and Tuxedos.

398
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,790
Why is this itchy
delivered to your doorstep?

399
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,610
The Black Tux is giving guys
a new to rent and get this.

400
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,290
The Black Tux offers free home triathlons.

401
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,140
Try Ons so you can see the fit and feel
the quality of your suit months before

402
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,230

companies. Man, this is like,

403
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,270
you're not going to have to
leave your house anymore.

404
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,560
You can get food sent to
your house. Wine, Cindy,

405
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:06,440
a house and a fucking Tuxedo.
You know,

406
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,190
and God knows horrors have always been
willing to come to your fucking as you

407
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:12,980
eat it right there.
This is the list is the final.

408
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,730
This is a final piece of the puzzle
like you putting together a championship

409
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:20,790
team. All you were missing was the
fucking Tuxedo. You go to blue apron,

410
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,790
he gets you fucking food,
right?

411
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,390
You go to fucking loot crate to get
your t shirt that you're going to wear

412
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:30,590
underneath all the bullshit. You go to
fucking something and me undies, right?

413
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,810
To get your sexy Greg Louganis sign,
right?

414
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,990
And then you got the fucking Roger Roger
Moore, right Sean Connery Tux. I know.

415
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:41,810
You know, how do you do this? It's the
best part is just done completely online.

416
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:45,590
No trips to the Tux. Tuxedo shop
required. The Black Tux start doll.

417
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,360
That's the worst.
When you go to the Tuxedo shop,

418
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,050
there's always that guy who's been
there for like forever and he's got dead

419
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,910
fucking tape measure
around his fucking neck.

420
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,070
Whatever the fuck you call that thing.
You know the,

421
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,280
you know those people don't clean their
ears to the point that everything just

422
00:24:58,281 --> 00:24:59,330
turns black in there.

423
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,830
It looks like somebody lit a firecracker

right. That was disgusting.

545
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,991
It was disgusting.

546
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:17,320
It wasn't socially redeemable and I don't
think anybody became a better person

547
00:32:17,321 --> 00:32:19,930
listening to it. Um, all right, so

548
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,230
is that the podcast? That is the podcast.
Um, now when I get off the podcast,

549
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:29,650
I'm going to go look at these
barefoot doctors. You know,

550
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:33,610
I can't fucking believe they, you know,
the misrepresentative, that fucking site,

551
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:37,480
you know, they have some guys sitting
there, right with the gay cut tee shirt.

552
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,740
And I'm sitting there thinking like,

553
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:40,910
all right is going to be
for angry Fuckos like me.

554
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,530
And it's for a bunch of women who, uh,
every time, uh, their boyfriend says, hey,

555
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:48,110
you know, I don't feel like getting
a, going to see that movie tonight.

556
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:49,160
I'd rather stay in.
And they go,

557
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:52,430
oh they go when they eat a fucking
death by chocolate fucking thing.

558
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,110
I Dunno. I don't even want to complain
about anymore. I really don't.

559
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,830
I'm just freaking out
cause I got a kid coming.

560
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,320
I would just like the kid to show up
already so I can get on with that part of

561
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,840
my life. I suppose this is what,
this is literally what it's like.

562
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:13,841
Sometimes this reminds me obviously too
much emotionally heightened state than

563
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:15,441
this,

564
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:20,441
but I always remember when I would be
standing the side of the stage and it was

565
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:26,180
just a fucking brutal crowd and I knew
that they were going to scream and yell

566
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:30,440
the entire fucking show and it was just
going to be 45 minutes of pure fucking

567
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:34,850
hell. I always remembered just the
worst part was not going out there.

568
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,720
It was waiting the second I got out there,

569
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:42,230
I didn't give a shit because it's
just like every second I'm out here

570
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,540
is one less is I am a second
closer to this fucking being over.

571
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,770
It's like doing cardio,

572
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,080
getting on the fucking thing and doing
it is not a fucking problem. It's,

573
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:57,410
it's the stretching beforehand,
you know,

574
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,160
putting on the workout clothes,
dragging your ass over to the machine.

575
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,130
The second you get on the thing,
I'm in literally 30 seconds into it.

576
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,220
You listen to your tones,
you having a good fucking time.

577
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,660
Everything is fucking great. It's, it's
the getting, it's the getting there,

578
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,630
at least for me.
And you know what?

579
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:18,560
I think that that's something
that we can all relate to, is it,

580
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,480
I don't fucking know. Anyways, uh,

581
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,880
I started to watch the Celtics
last night against Utah. Uh,

582
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,530
I got to watch that one cause I
think the Bruins a plan today and uh,

583
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:28,370
I'm trying to do this.

584
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:31,310
I'm going to watch every Bruins and
every Celtic game that I possibly can.

585
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,101
It's fun.

586
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:37,460
I got to tell you something I never
realized because I haven't watched it so

587
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:38,750
long.
When you watch NBA hoop,

588
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:42,320
it's so easy to start to get to know your
team because they got a starting five.

589
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,530
You know what I mean? Patriot's, you got
11 guys on offense. 11 guys on defense.

590
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,510
Basketball has five five starters.
Their play,

591
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,290
they start both ways. Offensive
Defense, run down the fucking court.

592
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,010
Now you're on defense,
you know,

593
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,030
I guess the Bruins just to have a
starting line and then they're starting to

594
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:05,190
defensemen. That's five. And then they got
a goalie. But thing about what, how many,

595
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
you know, I don't know how many
fucking players are on a hockey team.

596
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,201
How fucked up is that?

597
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:13,580
All these years of watch and I don't feel
like football is like 41 42 people you

598
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:17,900
know of which if you know like 10 of
them, you kind of know your fucking team.

599
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,230
What do you guys think?
I'm going to say there's like 25 guys.

600
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,970
Well let's see this for fucking lines.
Four lines.

601
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,170
Three guys in a line.

602
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:32,150
That's 12 you've got two goaltenders
that's 14 and then you've got like what?

603
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:36,890
Eight defensemen? Something
like that. Six to eight. Yeah.

604
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:39,240
I'm going to say about 25 and then you
got like the guys who don't get in the

605
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:43,080
game, you know with the, with the WHO's
hockey stuff doesn't smell it off.

606
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,510
At least their, their practice
stuff probably smells. I'm sure.

607
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:51,170
How many players on a hockey tea?

608
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,950
I'm gonna say 25.

609
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,200
Yeah.

610
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,430
Uh,
under the NHL rules,

611
00:35:56,431 --> 00:36:00,060
each team is allowed to have up to 18
players with additional two goalkeepers

612
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:03,150
for a total of 20. That's
it. Well, there's really no,

613
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:07,770
excuse me not knowing I was only 20
players. Right. That's when you're on a,

614
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:12,771
on a crazy level of a sports fan is if
you can name all fucking 20 players on

615
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:16,950
your hockey team and all what
11 guys on the basketball team.

616
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,330
Just for the simple fact that they fucking
overlap, I would say. And by the way,

617
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,590
my, my wife taped off the sports jeopardy
set. We're hosted by Dan Patrick.

618
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:30,330
But judging by some of the questions, it
was a little dated, but uh, I was like,

619
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:32,130
finally a jeopardy.
I'm going to do well on it.

620
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:36,480
And I still got my fucking ass kicked
because it was, it was fucking hard shit.

621
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,680
Like who is he like they had like,
uh,

622
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,260
yeah,

623
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,130
uh, bankrupt teams, teams that went
bankrupt yet to know the owner's name.

624
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,990
If you know the owner's name,

625
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:49,080
it's like you're watching fucking
sports talk radio and all of that shit.

626
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,890
Give me a fucking break. Wait,
what? What's wrong with you? Yeah.

627
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,760
I'll tell you right now our specialty
fucking coach, you get to that level.

628
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,850
You know what? I'm just babbling here.
I don't have fucking time to do this.

629
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,700
All I was doing was checking in on you
and that, that's, that's the podcast.

630
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:07,350
Have a great weekend yet conch and
um, no, no, no, no. Why am I, why?

631
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,280
You know what? Why do I say that?
You know why I fucking say that?

632
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,610
Because of defensive. If I actually
said something nice to you, I'll be, ah,

633
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,500
what are you a fucking show up date,
right? Then my shoulders start coming up.

634
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,080
I hope you guys have a wonderful
rest of your week. I can't do this.

635
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,240
I can't fucking do is have a great
weekend. You fucking cuts. All right.

636
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,870
Can I see that in the most
loving way possible? All right.

637
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:35,280
Did that make you uncomfortable? Good.
Welcome to my fucking world and a here.

638
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:40,110
Let's do a little bit of music and
then afterwards we'll play some, uh,

639
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,190
some clips from a podcast
scarred by Thursday.

640
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,350
Then we'll just want to fucking half
maybe on Monday. Who knows? Alright,

641
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,310
go fuck yourself.
So talk to your mother.

642
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,470
Hey, what's going on? Uh, Bill
Bar and this is the money. Hey,

643
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,560
morning podcast, the first one for 2009.
So I want to take some time to waste.

644
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,440
So I tried to, I tried to,
I tried to come out nice.

645
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:58,960
I tried to start it by being a, I can't
do it. I just can't say something nice.

646
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:03,750
Why can't I just start my podcast to be
like, hey, happy new year everybody. Hi.

647
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,830
Hope you had a nice Christmas. You
know, even though I feel that I,

648
00:39:07,831 --> 00:39:11,590
I can't get myself to say it.
I have to market,

649
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:16,480
I have to say happy new year.
And it's silly voice, you
know, I can't just be like,

650
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:20,290
hey, happy, happy. I can't
even do it. Happy New Year,

651
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,640
you know,
that doesn't sound happy or sad or angry.

652
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,410
It just sounds like I'm
reading it off the cue cards.

653
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,090
We tried to give it the
feeling it deserves. Hey,

654
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,180
let me try again. Uh, oh. Oh, I got
a phone call. Hang on one second.

655
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:45,280
Hang on. Hang on one
second. Hello. Hey Dan.

656
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:49,660
What's going on man? Uh, uh, I'm actually,

657
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm finishing up a podcast. Can I, can I
call you right back in like, uh, oh, I do.

658
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,960
I do buy, yeah. Okay.
That's the fucking tax man.

659
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,030
So it's the goddamn tax man. It'd
be fucking year, I think. Hey,

660
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:05,590
I actually got ahead a little bit and
then what did they do to come out?

661
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:06,424
And they just fucking,

662
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,000
why I make the perfect amount of
fucking money in this country.

663
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:11,770
You know what I mean?

664
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,180
I'm not rich enough to fucking afford
somebody to tell the IRS to go fuck

665
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:20,020
themselves and I'm not broke. So, um,

666
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,590
I'm the fucking, you know what I am? And
when you watch the discovery channel,

667
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:27,610
you know that that fucking a
gazelle that's walking with a limp.

668
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,340
That's what I am.
The fucking lines.

669
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:33,610
Their ears perked up and they try to
separate me from the fucking hurt.

670
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,890
That's who I am on the tax man comes
around. Some God damn fucking assholes.

671
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,950
All right. Sorry. You know potholes
all up and down my fucking street.

672
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:45,784
You know what I mean?

673
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,450
Why don't I pay you when I just go
down a fucking home depot and buy some

674
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:53,800
Goddamn tar and I'll fell. Can you buy
car at home depot? I'm sure you can,

675
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:56,870
but God knows there's nobody
there to help you find it. Huh?

676
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,470
50,000 fucking square foot store with
200 foot ceilings and they got like three

677
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:04,060
people with aprons walking around.

678
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,860
You ask him any question they
don't know where the fuck

679
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,490
fucking bitch shut up. Just
go hang yourself with your
right. But no, don't need,

680
00:41:13,491 --> 00:41:16,630
you're not, you're not the problem. You're
not the problem. You get a poor worker.

681
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:20,110
Sorry about that. Do you know what they
actually did get those automated? Uh,

682
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:25,170
they got those automated cashiers out
here at the grocery store and you know,

683
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,180
I get out and there's a whole
bunch of people just lining up,

684
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,430
lining up doubt.

685
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:33,980
The corporations fire other Americans.

686
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,110
I swear to God,

687
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:41,110
if you're one of my podcast members and
you go to the grocery store and you can,

688
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:43,340
you stand in that automated line,

689
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:45,950
I want you to delete yourself
as one of my friends. Okay?

690
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:50,090
I have a zero fucking
tolerance for that shit. It's,

691
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,110
it's unbelievable how stupid people are
and I love how they have like the one

692
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:58,580
employee where his job is literally
to stand there and teach you how to

693
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:01,280
basically do his job so
that they can then fire you.

694
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,770
And I know what the corporation
is going to do. They had,

695
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:08,420
it's going to help cut costs on
food. Really. You got eight people,

696
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:12,410
they're making $8 an hour.
That's 64 bucks an hour.

697
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,590
You've got a thousand people in
here buying cornflakes. What?

698
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:19,460
What do I save half a cent on my
fruity pebbles? You fucking cunts.

699
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,000
That was the first concert
of 2009 right there.

700
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,220
People stand in line,

701
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,900
help keep a fellow American at work.
Huh?

702
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,460
Blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah,
blah. Do it. I'm not even joking.

703
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,620
Don't do that.
Don't do that shit.

704
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:40,490
These fucking parking structures
with their pay stations.

705
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,380
Now I have to be the parking attendant.
I don't work here. I got to be for free.

706
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,100
I got to do this for fucking free and
put another guy out of work who now is

707
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:50,860
walking around trying to find a job.

708
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,300
Find a job for all I know he's
going to start writing jokes.

709
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,760
You know don't do that shit. Don't, don't.

710
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,990
Okay. You know me? Yes.
Actually you don't know me.

711
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,880
You think you know me cause he
listened to me every Monday,

712
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:07,340
but I'm telling something about myself.
I don't give a fuck what you do.

713
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:11,900
This is the one time where I'm going
to get up on my goddamn soapbox. Okay.

714
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,320
Which is really difficult for me because
I've got a big head and my equilibrium

715
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:18,050
starts to fuck with me when
I stand up on soap boxes,

716
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:21,770
which is why I don't preach, but I'm going
to preach on this one. Do not do that.

717
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,030
Go to the grocery store.
Stand in line. Okay,

718
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:31,220
let that mother of three
keep her job. Okay. Or that,

719
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:34,670
that fucking convicted drunk driver who
was fine to put his life back together

720
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:38,030
again.
Let them keep their jobs.

721
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,190
Do not stand in and learn how to do it.

722
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,800
You're going to do their job for fucking
free and it's not quicker and in the

723
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:48,470
future you're going to have,
she didn't have to fucking stand there.

724
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,600
And you know what happens when you need
a price check on a fucking cantaloupe.

725
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,480
You have to go do it.
I don't,

726
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,540
I just fucking blows my mind.
We're already pumping our
guests around gas people.

727
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,280
When's it going to stop? Huh?
Okay. I had a hell of a week.

728
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,260
All right. Actually, you know what?

729
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:12,770
I want to know how you guys feel about
that stuff. Am I, am I, you know,

730
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,060
do you feel like I have a really good
point there because I feel I do all my,

731
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:17,810
you know,

732
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:22,250
if I was living in the 18 hundreds would
I be the guy going stop churning butter?

733
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:26,930
No. Keep churning butter.
Don't let them do this for no,

734
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:31,530
but that's not even the fair example
because it's not like there was maybe that

735
00:44:31,531 --> 00:44:32,880
has a bunch of butter charters.

736
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,570
If they could somehow come up with
automated buttered butter churning.

737
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,840
You know what? I really paid my pay
to myself into a corner with that,

738
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:42,290
that reference, I really had
nothing. They're all right,

739
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,650
but I still think I made a
good point there. All right,
let's talk about my week.

740
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:49,650
I had a fucking insane week and,
um,

741
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,220
I went to the rose bowl with
a fellow comedian and uh,

742
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,690
I'm not gonna name his name. Usually
I'll do that. Maybe it gives somebody,

743
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:00,810
you know, bump up their
friends or that type of stuff,

744
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:04,620
which I'd love to do for this guy,
but not behavior was so,

745
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,030
uh,
colorful.

746
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,930
That's the word I'll use that you know,
just in case, you know what I mean?

747
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:14,250
I'm old school.
I don't name names.

748
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:17,130
When I started talking about a
semi crimes that I committed,

749
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,430
not really committing, well I guess
being drunk in public is a crime bill.

750
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,850
Why don't you shut the fuck up and get to
the story and we'll, I'll be the judge.

751
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:28,530
Fine, fine. Look you guys with all the
tension beginning of 2009 you know,

752
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,070
so you guys be more relaxed this year.

753
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,770
You know things going to be
fat and 2009 may the love bit,

754
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,720
they gonna Rhyme, you know, just
make it rhyme and then, then, then,

755
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,520
then I'm supposed to feel good.
You know,

756
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,830
and I'm not supposed to
notice that last year it was,

757
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:48,060
things are going to be great in 2008 and
now you've, you've knocked it down, outs,

758
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,330
things. It'll be fine things. It'd
be great man. I think he'd be fine.

759
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:53,983
No,

760
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,450
don't freak out in 2010 Ooh.
Did they combine this with Canada in 2011

761
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,360
why am I fucking checking myself out at
a grocery store and I'm not getting paid

762
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:10,610
for it? Okay, so my name is,

763
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:14,520
I go to the rose bowl with a a comedian.
We're just going to call him Joe.

764
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,760
All right.
Cause that's the classic alias name.

765
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,970
When you don't want to get somebody
in trouble, you just call him Joe.

766
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,540
But the ironic thing is this
guy's name is actually gel.

767
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,691
So me and Joe,

768
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:30,690
we go to the a fellow comedian and now
you can try to figure out who the fuck he

769
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:35,530
is and it's not fisco. Um, we
go to the Rose Bowl and, uh,

770
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:39,030
we had great intentions. Okay. And
let me paint a picture for you. Okay.

771
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,200
When you go to the rose bowl,

772
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,680
it's one of the great
tailgating experiences you'll
ever have. First of all,

773
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:46,080
you're going to the rose bowl.
Okay?

774
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:50,670
The granddaddy of them all home have a
bunch of Superbowls Superbowls with fully

775
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,250
that, that Super Bowl, uh,

776
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,110
if you see that famous Lynn Swann
catch that wasn't made there,

777
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,800
I actually realized that was made
at Temple University, wasn't it?

778
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:02,030
I don't fucking know.
There's been a oh nine,

779
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,890
although the Jackie Slater one where
he dropped the ball, that's right.

780
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:09,510
That that cowboy Steelers won
the greatest fucking, I dunno,

781
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:14,160
clash of two powerhouse
teams I ever saw was the, uh,

782
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,470
I dunno, whatever. They played
a bunch of fucking things there.

783
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:19,050
And I don't have any information front
of me and I'm really killing the momentum

784
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:22,840
of the story. So anyway, so
we go there, right. And uh,

785
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,860
you get right behind the Rosebowl is
what I'm assuming is an 18 hole golf

786
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:30,574
course.

787
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:35,080
Cause God knows that's how big it felt
at the end of the game when I was two

788
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:38,080
shit faced and we couldn't find the
car and we walked for four hours.

789
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,930
But that, that I'm getting ahead of
myself. You know what I'm foreshadowing,

790
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,940
I'm doing what all great movies.
Do you know what I mean?

791
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,030
You go see a movie whenever they
show movie about a guy who dies,

792
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,570
everybody knows he's going to die. So
they show them, died in the beginning,

793
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,230
and then the next thing is they go back
to his childhood. You know what I mean?

794
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,290
Except they never do that
with the Elvis movie.

795
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:03,310
Cause then they'd have to start the movie
with some fat fuck dying on a toilet

796
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:07,240
and no one wants to do that.
I'll just,

797
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:12,370
but it was that my pancreas plop.

798
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:18,040
Um, anyways, so Jesus Christ,
let's get some momentum here.

799
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:22,270
So we fucking, we go to this tailgate.
All right. And this is the deal.

800
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,070
Basically, there's just two
of us and amongst us, we
have four hamburger patties,

801
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,750
two bags of chips, hamburger
buns, 12 pack of Bud Light,

802
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:34,510
12 pack of Budweiser,

803
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,200
and a Clint Eastwood canteen,

804
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,900
size of fucking crown royal,

805
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,700
and to Cuban cigars that I
snuck back from fucking Canada.

806
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,100
So we're ready to go. I got my
sunblock, we load it up into the Prius,

807
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,730
which is, uh, which was just fucking
hilarious. You know, everybody,

808
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:58,210
everybody tries to outman people
at the, uh, at the tailgates,

809
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,000
people coming up there with, they
have their fucking, you know,

810
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:04,480
for two or pickups with the lift kits,
you know,

811
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:09,610
their generators, skydive fucking
satellite dish in a flat screen TV.

812
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,960
You know, I came there with a
little Hibachi, but whatever.

813
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,190
We had the big thing of crown royal,
so people and Cuban cigars.

814
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:19,840
So no one fucked with us, right?
So we're having a great time.

815
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,280
All of a sudden this lady comes
walking by and she's like, Hey,

816
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:27,070
do you want to buy a little ticket
holder for your ticket? I'm like,

817
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:31,360
absolutely sweetheart, 10 bucks a
whack. Let me get, let me get that.

818
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:34,390
Two Times they had baby, you know,
you got a cigar in your mouth,

819
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:35,650
you start getting a little swagger,

820
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,170
some reason when your leg
starts rocking back and forth,

821
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:40,600
like you've got to sing it like
you're going to sing an Elvis song.

822
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,860
I was failing it and the great thing was
I didn't give a fuck about either team

823
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,240
USC, all Penn State. I was just
happy to fucking be there, you know?

824
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:52,780
But I quickly realized most
people were for the Trojans.

825
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,770
So automatically I'm a con second cons
of the year. I'm like, you know what,

826
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:57,580
I'm going to root for the,

827
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,720
I'm a roof a Penn state because this
gives me way more chance to annoy people.

828
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:06,700
Plus I, I've never liked USC and uh, most
of it has to do with back in the day,

829
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:11,200
I used to be a Notre Dame fan before
Lou Holtz. What? They're holier,

830
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:15,670
holier than thou. We don't do steroids.
Shut the fuck up. Yes you do. Alright.

831
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,920
I had acne when I was fucking a teenager.
Right? But it wasn't all over my back.

832
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,190
And I also couldn't pick up a
house. Okay, so you fucking,

833
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,530
people are doing steroids anyways.

834
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,240
And also I always hated
the Trojans fight song.

835
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:34,010
They play it every three seconds bad,
you know, they came like half a yard.

836
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,480
And it also reminds me of Fleetwood Mac
who I never liked. So fuck the Trojans,

837
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,520
right? So anyways, so we're sitting there
and we'd drink and party and would eat.

838
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,850
We eat burgers and a,

839
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:47,360
then we break up the crown royal after
we had polished off a good half a case

840
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:49,760
between the two of us.
It's probably nine 30 in the morning.

841
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,120
And we just started
pounding this crown royal,

842
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:57,530
which is going down like fucking Koolaid.
I was really impressed with my ability,

843
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:02,960
or at least the, the makers of crown
royal. That is some smooth shit. So,

844
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:03,351
uh,

845
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:08,351
so basically we start walking towards
the stadium and the alcohol slowing

846
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,950
through me and that's when I go into the,
my transformation.

847
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,920
I don't know what happens
to me at sporting events,

848
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:19,240
but instantly I just become the loud guy.
I feel like I'm,

849
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:20,480
I'm doing a comedy show.

850
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:25,010
I want to make the people around me
laugh and I also want to irritate as many

851
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:26,330
fucking people as I can.

852
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:31,590
So I start walking in there
and I quickly notice, um,

853
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,580
well I know I went to go buy a program,

854
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,480
I'm trying to put this all back
together cause I was pretty drunk. I go,

855
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,510
just to give you an idea of,
of the mood that I was in,

856
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,540
I get to about a hundred
yards from the stadium.

857
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,730
This lady's selling programs
and she's like, yeah,

858
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:51,810
I get you probe the ad pack America gets
a Parker Hanson. Like I fuck it. I want,

859
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,410
I want a souvenir. So I'll walk up and
Mike, how much are they? She's like,

860
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,510
10 bucks, my car, I find,

861
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:59,480
so this other guy comes walking up
because how much for the programs?

862
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,210
And The lady's like 10 bucks,
right? And the guy starts bitching.

863
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,990
Be Kidding me, right? So I'm standing
there, I got a Cuban cigar, I go,

864
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:12,920
you know what, let me get another one,
two times. Let me get two of those.

865
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,820
All right, one for you over there.
And the guy's like, really? I go, Hey,

866
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:19,640
I go take a look at me. They
know, you know you're looking at,

867
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:22,310
you're looking at a big shot.
Take a good look. There's not a,

868
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:26,240
there's not a lot of us left. I swear
to God, I said that and I was so drunk.

869
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,490
I was only half joking.

870
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,700
Like I knew I was being an asshole,
but like I was only half.

871
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,240
I had a fucking Cuban cigar. Go
Fuck Yourself. I'm a big shot.

872
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,490
Let's get a program
for this fag over here.

873
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,810
Who's bitching about 10 pool still
Roseville and bitches about a $10 fucking

874
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,370
program.
You know what I mean?

875
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:50,180
He should have been de pants and he
should had his tickets removed right there

876
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,950
and sent right back to wherever the fuck
he keep key came from, sent to an apple.

877
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:56,480
Bee's watch the game there.
All right.

878
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:02,170
Kind of fucking behaviors that is the
granddaddy of them all take you fucking

879
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:06,800
money out and play the Goddamn game. All
right. So anyway, saw him Hammock, right.

880
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:11,630
And we're fucking, we're walking.
And uh, I don't know what happened.

881
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,850
We got into the stadium,
everything was cool.

882
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:16,670
And then they have this weird
sort of like they funnel you in,

883
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,570
cause it's a really old
stadium. It's like, you know,

884
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:23,060
it's like trying to go through the
Lincoln tunnel like five o'clock at night.

885
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:24,830
It's a pain in the ass.
So I'm standing there,

886
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:28,080
I'm getting frustrated
because it's getting close
to kickoff and I hate missing

887
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:32,040
kickoff. So I'm getting pissed. And
I noticed that the Penn state fans,

888
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:35,850
they got this chant where one of them, I
don't know where it just yells, we are.

889
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,790
And then all the Penn
state fans go Penn state.

890
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,350
And then the dude yells again we are and
they'll go Penn state and they say it

891
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:47,730
like five times and then the end, the
guy who starts to chant goes thank you.

892
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:49,800
And then everybody screams Yo,
well cub.

893
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,280
And I immediately noticed that it annoyed
the shit out of all these USC fence.

894
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:57,061
You know,

895
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:59,460
cause they kind of felt like it was a
home game cause they were out there.

896
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,300
So next thing you know, I don't
even think it. Next thing you know,

897
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:07,790
coming out of my mouth, I'm
going, well I'm not here.

898
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,580
I'm not from Penn state. I don't know
Shit, right? But I just start going, we,

899
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:15,420
everybody starts going Penn state,
Penn state,

900
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:18,780
and I'm like, thank you. And
they're like, Yo, welcome. I'm like,

901
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:19,920
this is fucking awesome.

902
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:25,320
I can do this the whole game and annoy
the shit out of people around me. So

903
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,800
like it took us 20 minutes,

904
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,790
20 minutes to get through the tunnel
and I swear to God, I was like,

905
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:36,000
perfect timing light.
As we got through the tunnel,

906
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:41,690
this check is finishing singing the
national anthem as we just take in the

907
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,600
Roseville on a sunny California day,

908
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,870
everybody's wearing their Trojan colors.
Everybody's wearing that Penn state.

909
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:54,570
There's pawpaws people are going
fucking nuts. And this lady's like,

910
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,780
and no home of the brave.
And what is,

911
00:54:57,781 --> 00:55:00,540
she finished a fucking stealth bomber.

912
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,790
Flies right over the God damn
top. I'm shift, right? It's
like a fucking acid trip.

913
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:11,010
I almost passed out. Right? So now,
you know, we've got end zone seats,

914
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,220
you know, evidently I'm not a big shot
and we'll wait at the top of the stadium,

915
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,970
which is a really rough thing to
negotiate when you're a redhead drinking

916
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:19,170
whiskey in the sun,
right?

917
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,580
We get all the way up to like row whatever
fucking triple f and you know it's an

918
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:30,810
old stadium. Okay. And you know, back in
the day, like you were tall if you will,

919
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:34,230
like five foot six when the stadium
was built. And now you know,

920
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:37,110
with fucking growth hormones and
all the preservatives in the food,

921
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:39,000
we basically outgrown the stadium's,

922
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,450
not to mention the cheesecake factories
that have these fucking people go to

923
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:46,560
every other day.
So I'm trying to walk a tight rope down.

924
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,840
I'm really acting this out
of my bedroom by the way.

925
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:50,580
This is how into the
stories I get to tell.

926
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:55,560
So I'm literally walking a fucking tight
rope trying to get down to my seat and

927
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:59,310
I just become that guy.
I fell, I didn't fall.

928
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:03,030
I sorta like,
like [inaudible].

929
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,480
It was like almost like I was on a show.

930
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,910
I was the only guy in a ship that was
in a fucking perfect storm and all of a

931
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:11,250
sudden the whole thing just
lifted to the right side.

932
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,640
And I landed on this like 55 year old
lady back then like land like I was doing.

933
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,390
I was on one foot and I,
I put a nice forearm,

934
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,290
oh I'll Samuelson in front of the
net fucking action right on a pack.

935
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,970
And I was so drunk it took me,

936
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:32,971
I swear to God that at least 28 seconds
to get offer in the entire time I am

937
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:38,311
apologizing with my fucking cigar whiskey
breaths just gone Psi Phi and I just,

938
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,310
I couldn't get off it cause I,

939
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:49,270
the only way to get off of was to put all
my weight on my forum and use her as a

940
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:54,070
banister to push me back up because
nobody's fucking helping me cause I'm

941
00:56:54,071 --> 00:56:56,020
obviously the drunk guy.
You don't want to touch me.

942
00:56:56,021 --> 00:57:01,021
So 28 seconds to trying to figure out if
I have the quad strength to pull myself

943
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:04,960
up without pushing off the
back of this old lady's neck.

944
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:09,370
I finally just say fuck it
and just drive my, the Meta,

945
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,160
my forearm right between her
shoulder blades and I get up,

946
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:18,190
I apologize profusely and I don't
know what Joe is doing at this point.

947
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,610
He was fucking probably just
standing there watching the game.

948
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:27,460
But basically we finally get to our seats.
It was unreal.

949
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,270
I didn't know what, we got to
our seats and I, we turn around,

950
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:34,630
we faced the game to watch the game and
next thing you know this lady is just

951
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:35,770
screaming at us.

952
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,960
She's like that screaming
and she's yelling,

953
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:43,930
you can't smoke in here. And I'm like,
what the fuck is she talking about?

954
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,920
Because I put my my cigar out.

955
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,520
I'm going to tell you to do the
fucking Cuban is sweet too, man.

956
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:50,680
I smoked that thing all the
way down like a Goddamn Roach.

957
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:54,820
It's like burning my fucking fingers
and she's yelling, stop smoking.

958
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:58,270
I'm like the fuck she talking about
do I smell like a cigar? And I turned,

959
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,050
I looked,

960
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,910
I looked to my right and Joe is standing
there with the fucking Cuban cigars

961
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:08,290
still lit and his mouth. I don't know
how the fuck you got a past security.

962
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,080
I think it's, cause we had
our tickets, those tickets,

963
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:15,430
things I bought arrived on neck. I don't
know if he had it down by his side,

964
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,230
but he's sitting at chomp on, on
it like fucking Archie bunker. So

965
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:25,540
you know, in defense of me, if she just
turned around and she had just said,

966
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:28,240
hey guys, um, you know that, you
know, I don't know if you know,

967
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:31,090
but there's no smoking in here.
Yeah, I would have been, you know,

968
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,710
I'm a happy drunk. I swear to God,
I'm angry when I'm sober, but I sorta,

969
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,150
I'm a happy drunk. I just would have
been like, Hey, aside bought that,

970
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,040
we didn't know. Oh, what do you for you?
I see. All right, good luck. Bye. Ha Ha,

971
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:44,410
whatever. I would've kept it at that,
but she fucking was yelling at us.

972
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:48,370
So I don't like being yelled at.
And I like being,

973
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,640
I like fucking with people and I'm
shit faced and Joe is of the same ilk.

974
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,630
And then that's when it all started.

975
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,830
She just based, she's like, Hey, she
goes, there's no smoking in here.

976
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:07,660
And then immediately I just go
and I just go. I'm just like, Hey,

977
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:10,360
said.
So she goes to California,

978
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:15,250
I had a smoke and doors were
like, we're outside. And she goes,

979
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,770
you're not allowed to smoke here.
And I go, you're not my mother.

980
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,260
This isn't our section. This is in
your section. Turn around. Right.

981
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,930
I just kept being an asshole.
And then finally she goes,

982
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,310
I'm going to call security. And
I'm like, call column. She goes,

983
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:31,910
I've got to call him. I go, go ahead
and call him. And then in my head,

984
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,860
my brain is going, Bill, shut up, shut up.

985
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:39,080
You're going to get,
we're 90 seconds into the game,

986
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,470
you're going to get kicked out.
And I just couldn't stop myself.

987
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,860
I just kept saying
column, column, and then,

988
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,170
then she made some sort of comment,
I think about the size of Joe's knows,

989
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,150
and then he said, hey, he goes,

990
00:59:56,151 --> 01:00:00,450
you need to lose a hundred pounds
to talk to me, bitch. He said,

991
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,860
the guy to the left of us turns
around and he's like, Hey,

992
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,750
I got my kid, I got my kid
here, what do you cursive?

993
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,020
And then Joe goes, well then don't
bring them to a fucking football.

994
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,450
So now I'm doing that last, you
know that laugh. We're like,

995
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:24,020
your mouth is wide open but
there's no air coming in or out.

996
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,980
I'm having the time of my life
and then the fucking guy goes,

997
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:33,050
he goes, I'm going to call security.
And then I'm just, then at once again,

998
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:37,970
I'm going, God, I'm going to
call it God and call up call.

999
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,930
I was just calling that bluff because
we were so fucking jam packed and I knew

1000
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,730
they weren't going to walk
down there and go do that.

1001
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,660
So that lady makes
another fucking comment.

1002
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,100
At which point Joe makes another comment
about her weight and then she just

1003
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:56,810
turns down and it's like mark and yells
down to a husband and next thing you

1004
01:00:56,811 --> 01:01:01,130
know this fucking dude comes running over
and he starts screaming at us as he's

1005
01:01:01,131 --> 01:01:05,570
screaming at us. This spray is coming
out of his mouth all over his wife.

1006
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,710
So it was easy. I had a fucking,
Nah, I was just going, sir, sir,

1007
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,330
you're spitting on your wife and once
you know, I hope it was pathetic.

1008
01:01:14,331 --> 01:01:19,050
He was like 53 but like,
and I'm 40 and I'm thinking like that.

1009
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:23,320
I'm not too old to fight this guy.
You know, it was just, Oh God,

1010
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,720
I'm front pieces together. And so when we
all sit down, right? So then we sit down.

1011
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,440
I think Joe had put out the cigar.
Maybe it was just holding it down.

1012
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:31,730
I don't know what was going on.

1013
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:36,470
But now by this time we'd
already missed the kickoff.

1014
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,660
The Trojan's get the ball and I think
this is the basically the one good play

1015
01:01:41,661 --> 01:01:45,950
Penn state made all day. They Trojans
their first play. I think offense,

1016
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:50,570
they handed off the ball and they tried
to do like some sort of sweep the Penn

1017
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:55,571
state defense strung out and just stuck
this guy either for no gain or for like

1018
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,840
lots of one yard.
And then Joe go,

1019
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,180
I forgot to mention is
a good six foot four,

1020
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:07,210
just a huge guy just starts screaming
like an inch from the back of the Lady's

1021
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:13,010
head who's a Trojan Fan. He just
starts screaming life, not the head.

1022
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,900
Not that,

1023
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,950
not that I can't believe
like her hair wasn't,

1024
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:22,820
he was yelling so loud as she,
I know.

1025
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:26,940
She turned around and she'd had that shift
of noxious. That's just, it was, it was,

1026
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,580
it was great.
It was fucking great.

1027
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:32,490
And then basically what would
have for the rest of the game,

1028
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:37,170
shit would calm down and then we would,
we would,

1029
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:37,951
I don't know,

1030
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:41,640
we would mumble something about her and
then she would fucking yell down to her

1031
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:46,440
husband and that he'd come
over threatening to kick
our ass and we would just

1032
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:50,700
laugh at them. And then, I dunno,
I just realized I was so drunk.

1033
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:53,820
I can't even remember the rest. I
remember it was the very end of the game,

1034
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,670
uh,
somebody Joe us,

1035
01:02:58,671 --> 01:03:02,460
somebody said something about the score
and then the lady in front of us goes,

1036
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:04,980
yeah, I'm surprised you can
count that high. I go, yeah,

1037
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:09,030
why don't you try counting calories?
Right. Something real me like that.

1038
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:11,940
And then once again, she's like
mark. And then at this point,

1039
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,220
half the crowd and left
because it was such a blow out.

1040
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,730
This too comes over and he
starts fucking screaming at me.

1041
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:21,150
It doesn't scream at Joe
because Joe six foot four,

1042
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:25,200
he yells at me cause I'm fucking barely
five 10 and I'm a fucking redhead. Right?

1043
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,930
Even with the shaved head,
I still look like fucking howdy doody.

1044
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:31,200
So he starts yelling at me
and he keeps telling me, yeah,

1045
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:33,550
I'm going to fire you down on the field.
That's why he kept saying,

1046
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:36,720
he kept telling me he's going to grab me
and fire me down on the fucking field.

1047
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:40,710
And I was just, you know, and
I was just being an asshole.

1048
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,930
That did do it. I'm gonna fight. Are
you said that you already said that.

1049
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:50,130
You already said you already said
it. You fucking cunt. All right,

1050
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,233
if you're going to do it,

1051
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:54,930
you would have and you didn't see you're
not so sit down and shut the fuck up.

1052
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,030
Which is funny.
Cause by the end of the game,

1053
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,520
everyone in the stands somehow
liked us and hated those people.

1054
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,450
I mean path of it was cause they
were assholes. The other half was,

1055
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:09,570
they couldn't hear the shift that we
will mumble him at this dude's wife

1056
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:14,970
Poo. I know at this point he might
have a little bit of sympathy for it,

1057
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:17,820
but I mean I'm telling
you she was, she was, uh,

1058
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,010
she was an asshole and she's the
one who made it personal first.

1059
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:24,270
She made the comment
about Joe's knows she, uh,

1060
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:28,080
oh she was doing real hacky lines too.
She's told me I was ugly.

1061
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,710
She goes and I always can lose
weight, you know, which, uh,

1062
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:36,690
I believe I saw during the second
season of def jam and um, you know,

1063
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:37,681
and I thought,

1064
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:41,190
well we will come in with was a lot more
clever and if it was a battle of the

1065
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:45,420
bands in a standup situation,
I think we want. So, uh,

1066
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,400
basically what ended up happening,
I know this is a long ass fucking story.

1067
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:54,660
I don't even have time for questions
this week, but long story short,

1068
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,930
we ended up walking out. Um, I want,

1069
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:02,880
I believe that somehow the lady in front
of us to who was being a jerk had a

1070
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:06,840
bunch of these dark streaks on the
back of a shirt towards the end of it.

1071
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,840
I don't know what it was and almost
look like a ashes from a cigar.

1072
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:15,930
But um, I know that that didn't happen
because there's no smoking in there.

1073
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,440
But anyways, we go to leave
and we're basically so drunk.

1074
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,500
I don't know, man. It took
us like fucking nine hours,

1075
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,670
literally took us 50
minutes to find our car.

1076
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:32,710
I think it was calmer for being such
assholes in, in, in, in the stadium.

1077
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:36,730
And I don't, I don't know who
the fuck set up the parking lot,

1078
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,290
the things out there.
But they basically,

1079
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:43,270
the way they do the sections on this golf
course is they have like balloons that

1080
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:46,900
they just have numbers, number
one, number two, number three.

1081
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,120
But they're not lit up.
So you can't really seem at night.

1082
01:05:50,121 --> 01:05:53,860
So you walk out of the stadium
drunk and you look up and you see,

1083
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:58,630
I saw the number to where we were,
where we were parked and, but you know,

1084
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,600
you've got to follow the path because
you can't walk through the sand traps and

1085
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:04,330
shit like that.
So you look down for half a second,

1086
01:06:04,331 --> 01:06:07,810
then you look up and it's like a big
fucking oak tree in front of you and now

1087
01:06:07,811 --> 01:06:08,740
you don't know where you are.

1088
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:12,610
It's like the end of the shining without
the shrubs. It's a fucking golf course,

1089
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:13,900
right?
So,

1090
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,470
and you're far enough away from the
stadium where you can't get your bearings.

1091
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,410
And we just wandering around and around
and around and it's getting to the point

1092
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:28,000
like, you know, like hypothermia is
becoming an issue because it's a desert.

1093
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:32,230
It starts getting cold,
was shit faced and we just can find a car.

1094
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:34,120
It was like the Blair witch.

1095
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:38,440
We kept coming back to the same goddamn
ladies' teas, whatever the fuck we were.

1096
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,790
And then I lost all confidence in
my ability to find the damn car.

1097
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,310
So I started following Joe,
who is convinced,

1098
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,670
even though we both know where
we're parked in section two,

1099
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:52,240
we went from section three to section 40,
section five,

1100
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,990
and he keeps telling me to go in that
direction because for some reason he

1101
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:59,110
thinks numerically it's going
to go three, four, five to,

1102
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,710
I dunno, it took us an hour to
find the fucking car. And uh,

1103
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,350
at that point I started sobering up and
I started thinking about our behavior

1104
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:12,490
and I was starting to thinking like,
and I kinda kinda feeling an asshole.

1105
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:13,900
Yeah.
You know,

1106
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,500
I shouldn't say I shouldn't taken the
higher ground even though they'd throw was

1107
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:20,380
a content, you know? And he was just
like, what are you talking about?

1108
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,950
What are you talking
about? You, she was a con.

1109
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:26,890
We treated her like one
and a half and that's it.

1110
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,080
It's quite a lot about that guy.
He just,

1111
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:33,490
he just breaks it down to
the simplest fucking point.

1112
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,780
Hey Buddy, I got my kid here. What don't
take your kid to a fucking football game,

1113
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,870
which you know, I know that's
harsh, especially if you have kids,

1114
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,540
but think about it.
Think about it.

1115
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,300
Why would you bring your kid to his
professional, so to sporting event?

1116
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,130
Not only that,

1117
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,060
that the guy with the kid is
being hypocritical because
he was me before he had

1118
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:55,210
a kid. All right? He was having the
time of his fucking life and what now?

1119
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:57,670
Because he has a kid now all
of a sudden I'm supposed to,

1120
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:01,510
I'm supposed to fucking act my age.
You know,

1121
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:03,370
it's like the fucking
baby boom generation.

1122
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:07,120
They Bang so much the fucking in the
mud Woodstock that by the time I come

1123
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:10,420
around there's herpes and aids and all
this shit and then these, you know,

1124
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:13,990
and then they come around with their
don't do drugs where a condom shit after

1125
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:15,560
they had the time of their fucking lives.

1126
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,490
I'm so glad all of them and getting
that whole generation is getting hip

1127
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:23,120
replacements now with their fucking cause.

1128
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:27,260
They all had that fucking Olivia Newton
John High impact aerobics tape that they

1129
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:31,100
did try and to stay in shape and
it's the one good fucking thing.

1130
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,400
Consider I got to fuck with the God
damn trash bag around my dick my entire

1131
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,830
career. Right. The very least,

1132
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,650
I at least knew to stretch
before you lifted weights.

1133
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:44,330
And I also dangers of high impact
aerobics. Okay. When I did my aerobics,

1134
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,940
I definitely was rocking the leg warmers,

1135
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:50,990
but I did not let my feet
leave the ground. Okay.

1136
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,620
So anyways, so that's
my rose bowl story. Um,

1137
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:59,810
it's a fucking law when I know that, but
I think it had some nice moments. But um,

1138
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,010
yeah. But getting back to that, what do
you guys think about that stuff? You know,

1139
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:09,950
sporting events are not for children.
Okay.

1140
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,890
And I know they always try to talk
about the good old days of sports.

1141
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:16,190
The good ole days of sports is bullshit.
Okay.

1142
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,570
When I was a kid, first football game
I went to, I was fucking terrified.

1143
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,110
I was terrified.
It was not a place for kids.

1144
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:27,650
It was a place for adults who hadn't
achieved what they thought they were going

1145
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,980
achieve in life to get their
fucking anger and frustration out.

1146
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:35,720
People with in loveless
marriages, you know, people,

1147
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:36,554
you know,

1148
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:40,370
people who could tell they were going to
get laid off the next week or maybe the

1149
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:44,390
rd got laid off and they just wanted to
get it out. Okay. And they, you know,

1150
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:48,950
they've now turned going to a fucking
football game into like you're standing in

1151
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,550
line with a bunch of people waiting
to get their kids, you know,

1152
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:55,460
photo taken with Santa Claus.
You know,

1153
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:58,400
and even if you go further back than
my childhood, which was seventies,

1154
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:00,110
early eighties,
um,

1155
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,620
you go back to the 1950s
they talk about that. Oh,

1156
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:06,630
the good old days is sports or what
do you mean? What, what, when, uh,

1157
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,530
when they finally let a black guy
playing baseball and they said,

1158
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:12,530
we'll fucking black cat on the field and
all that racist shit that was going on.

1159
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:15,920
Can you imagine the shit
that was getting yelled in?

1160
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:19,280
The stands when Billy crystal was going
down to la to go down and go and watch

1161
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:23,450
the mic boy, Oh boy, I've got myself a
hot dog and assessed Barilla. You know,

1162
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:26,840
they always tell us stories about how
great it was back then. It wasn't,

1163
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,670
it wasn't great. They were
way more racist, way more
ignorant, way more sexist.

1164
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:35,090
And people went to the games and
they saw Johnny Unitas. Okay,

1165
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:37,880
so now for some reason,

1166
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,540
now it's my turn to be an asshole and be
a drunk and have a good time and all of

1167
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:45,880
a sudden I have to take everything down
a level, you know, not now. Now it's,

1168
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,980
it's Chuckie cheese time. It isn't.
And I know you guys are saying,

1169
01:10:48,981 --> 01:10:52,250
well that's because you don't have a
kid right now. No, fuck that. Fuck that.

1170
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,980
I wouldn't bring my kid to the game.
Or if I brought to give to the game,

1171
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,450
I would prepare him. I prepare them, you
know, this is what's going to happen.

1172
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,160
Okay, you might see a fight, you know,

1173
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,360
hey dad might even get in one. No, I'm
not. I never took it to that level.

1174
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:12,560
But you know what I mean?
I think, uh, I dunno,

1175
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,410
it just felt guilty.
I am for my,

1176
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:21,330
my behavior that they actually pulled
up a quote from George Orwell who,

1177
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:23,490
uh,
granted this is from Wikipedia,

1178
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,610
which the other day I looked up something
that I knew something about and was

1179
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:30,510
completely inaccurate.
But this is according to
Wikipedia, George Orwell said,

1180
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:34,620
serious sport has nothing to do
with fairplay. It's a bound up.

1181
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:37,380
It's bound up with hatred,
jealousy,

1182
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:41,340
boastfulness disregard of all
rules and sadistic pleasures,

1183
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:44,820
pleasures in witnessing violence.
In other words,

1184
01:11:44,821 --> 01:11:47,640
it's war minus the shooting. Exactly. Now,

1185
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:50,880
why the fuck would you bring a
child to that? And not only that,

1186
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,770
when was George Orwell alive
a long fucking time ago?

1187
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:00,000
I don't know when he was alive. When did
you write? 1984 he didn't write it in 83.

1188
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:04,740
I know that he wouldn't like the 30.
Stinney I'm just saying. And See,

1189
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,940
that's how he described sports
back then. So guys, like, you know,

1190
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:12,000
these Billy crystal guys were always do
those little heartwarming stories about,

1191
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:12,834
uh,
you know,

1192
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,440
their baseball cards and going down to
the baseball stadium and acting like it

1193
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:20,910
was this fucking, you know, this
time that was lost, you know,

1194
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,760
George Orwell right there,
according to Wikipedia,

1195
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,690
the guy proved my point.
I'm a moron,

1196
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,050
but I did have a good time and I'm
gonna tell you like this right now,

1197
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:33,590
if you ever get a chance in your
life to smoke a Cuban cigar,

1198
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,500
definitely do it all right.
Because I'm not even a big smoker.

1199
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:42,530
And I could tell how fucking amazing
that cigar was because I've drank fine

1200
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,720
wines and I can't tell the difference,
you know?

1201
01:12:45,721 --> 01:12:49,110
And it took me a long time to be
comfortable with myself. You know,

1202
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:52,530
when you go through the whole long
process of spinning the big red wine glass

1203
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:57,120
around, I see red up on wine
to try to learn. So I, I,

1204
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:57,990
you know about it.

1205
01:12:57,991 --> 01:13:01,440
So I wouldn't feel so fucking stupid when
they bring a nice bottle of wine over

1206
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:04,890
and I'm like, you know, this tastes like
the shit I used to drink in high school.

1207
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,740
You know, I learned
that, you know, red wine.

1208
01:13:07,741 --> 01:13:11,250
The reason why it's in a bigger glass
because I'm about the oxygen and you want

1209
01:13:11,251 --> 01:13:13,290
it to breathe more and how to,
you know,

1210
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,980
move it around the fucking table and
then you shove your fucking nose all the

1211
01:13:16,981 --> 01:13:20,580
way in it and yet put it in.
You switch it all around your mouth.

1212
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:23,790
I got all the moves down and
I'm like swallowed up Mike. Yes.

1213
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:28,500
This tastes like every other fucking
red wine I've ever had. That's not true.

1214
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:30,190
I can tell the difference between like,
you know,

1215
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:31,950
a Cabernet or low or something like that.

1216
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:36,951
But like I can't tell like the
difference between a 1499 bottle and a,

1217
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,900
a $60 bottle and uh,
you know,

1218
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:47,670
I guess I'm trying to say
with this podcast, I'm not
that culture. Okay. All right.

1219
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:52,230
Well, so why don't you guys chime
in with that. Okay. Like, well,

1220
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,270
do you think David,
they should have a kids section.

1221
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:57,810
Should they just have a Chucky
cheese section? It's not my fault.

1222
01:13:57,811 --> 01:14:00,480
You're knocked her up and you can't
go to a game and have a good time now.

1223
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:04,920
You know, you want to be getting drunk
with me. See what I just did there.

1224
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,750
That's how I made myself write, made this
guy who can't even defend himself, uh,

1225
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:13,970
actually be secretly agreeing
with me. That's how I do it. Um,

1226
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:18,330
did I mentioned I have a
rat problem. Um, I have, uh,

1227
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,240
I have a really nice apartment, but
the garage I have is a glorified shack.

1228
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:28,020
Like if they ever decide to do the
Hatfields and McCoys TV series,

1229
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:33,100
they could shoot it on location
in my garage. Okay. Is a
rotting out hunk of shit.

1230
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:38,350
And even though the door comes down, um,
the hole and the back of the garage, he,

1231
01:14:38,351 --> 01:14:40,270
granted you couldn't
drive my car out of it,

1232
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:44,500
but a fucking rat could crawl into it on
a rainy night and then crawl up into my

1233
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:48,910
engine and sleep.
This mother Fucker,

1234
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:52,660
I took my car down to get it service
and they took out the air conditioner

1235
01:14:52,661 --> 01:14:57,661
filter and it was rat shit in there
and I got to for everybody going,

1236
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:02,440
Oh God is good. So you
know, being a man, I'm like,

1237
01:15:02,441 --> 01:15:07,180
okay, operation kill the
fucking rat is now in motion.

1238
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:12,310
And I sat there and I thought,
how can I kill this motherfucker?

1239
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,680
And basically what I did was I went to um,

1240
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:22,510
a smaller hardware cause fuck home
depot in there, eight people in aprons,

1241
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,183
um,

1242
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:29,310
and I bought $114 worth of those rat glue
traps and I got a couple of really big

1243
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:39,721
cardboard boxes and then I took some duct
tape because when you don't know what

1244
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:42,580
the fuck you're doing,
duct tape is always a solution.

1245
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,810
And I duct taped 28 of
these motherfuckers,

1246
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,760
I think over 30, I think I lost count
how many I did on all these boxes,

1247
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:55,210
two big boxes,
side by fucking side.

1248
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,100
And I split them underneath my
car. Okay, you want to get dry?

1249
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,140
Why don't you try to get,
try and get by that now?

1250
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,140
I don't know cause rats are intelligent.

1251
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:10,210
I don't know if what I have in my garage
right now is the star wars plan that

1252
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:14,050
Ronald Reagan always dreamed of.

1253
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,290
I don't know if I have the red version
of that or if I have the Maginot line,

1254
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:23,020
you know, national line. Anybody, any
man you want to read up on that one.

1255
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:25,660
That's one of the classic
military blunders of all time.

1256
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:30,730
Basically Germany invaded
France in world war one.

1257
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:35,680
It was trench warfare, ton, ton of loss
of life. They came in, they got invaded,

1258
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:38,080
they got overrun and all that,
blah blah, blah, blah blah shit.

1259
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:41,620
So they wanted to make sure they would
never happen again because they were

1260
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:44,680
worried about Germany, you
know, and why wouldn't you Ben?

1261
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:50,160
So they decided to build like this
is called the Maginot line and it was

1262
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,990
permanent trenches with these,
these fucking basically built in.

1263
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:00,020
I don't live like an anti,
it wasn't anti aircraft.

1264
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,820
That was the problem that killed him. It
was fucking, uh, like machine gun nest,

1265
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:08,200
like permanent all the way around. And
they spent all this fucking money on it.

1266
01:17:08,201 --> 01:17:11,750
And what's hilarious is by the time
they went to war with Germany again,

1267
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:17,200
they had perfected the aircraft and they
basically just flew right up and over

1268
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:20,570
all the fucking trenches.
You don't drop bombs on him and shit.

1269
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:24,140
And they once again took over fucking
France. And I'm so, I don't know.

1270
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:28,060
I don't know if the rat laughed
at it, brought in the, you know,

1271
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,320
a couple of friends over
to shit inside of my car,

1272
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,570
but I'm going to kill that fucker.

1273
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:36,890
And all you animal lovers can go fuck
yourselves because I'm not losing a

1274
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:40,880
$23,000 automobile to a fucking road.
All right,

1275
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:44,310
I'm going to show him why I live inside.
All right.

1276
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:48,170
And I don't have to shit on an air
conditioner filter filter. Okay,

1277
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:51,380
let's get the podcast questions,
Shelly people.

1278
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,690
Um, I'll let you guys know how
it goes if I kill the rat or not.

1279
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,580
All right. Podcast question number
one. Bill since you're a patriots fan,

1280
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:06,030
I got to ask you, what's your honest
opinion on the Tuck rule game? Uh,

1281
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:09,980
I'm a raider fan and I think that was
hands down the biggest bullshit call and

1282
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:12,890
the history of sports.
And still to this day I carry it with me.

1283
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,430
The fact that the eight ne charges
made the playoffs over the 11 and five

1284
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:18,170
patriots made me happy inside.

1285
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:21,110
And while I respect Tom Brady
is one of the great all time.

1286
01:18:21,111 --> 01:18:25,100
Qbs if he snapped his leg in three places,
places I'd be a happy man.

1287
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,150
Okay. Um, for those of you
who aren't big sports fans,

1288
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:33,830
the Tuck rule was basically is
basically a rule where the quarterback,

1289
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:38,870
if he goes,
I basically goes into the passing motion,

1290
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,920
doesn't throw the ball and if
he brings it back to his chest,

1291
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,260
if somebody whacks the ball out,

1292
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:50,290
then it's a considered an
incomplete pass or something.

1293
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:55,220
I really should have looked up the
tuck rule and um, and you know,

1294
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:59,450
basically the Raiders slap the ball
out of Brady's hand. They fell on it.

1295
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,250
They had thought they won the game because
it was a fumble. And then the, the,

1296
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:06,740
they brought out this the top rule,
which nobody had ever heard of,

1297
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:09,760
including probably Tom Brady.
Um,

1298
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:12,410
when he wants to know what
is my feeling on that? Um,

1299
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,800
I don't feel it was a big relax,
let me finish.

1300
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:19,580
I don't feel it was the biggest
bullshit call in the history of sports.

1301
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:24,620
I think it's the biggest bullshit
rule in the history of sports.

1302
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,820
That's the thing. They made the right
call. The rule needed to be changed.

1303
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:31,820
I think it's a bullshit rule. I think
that that should have been a fumble.

1304
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:36,110
It is a fumble. He didn't talk and he
was going to throw it and he didn't.

1305
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:39,710
And then he pulled in, he
got slapped. It is a fumble,

1306
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,180
but that's what it should be.
But because of the Tuck rule,

1307
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,980
it was actually the right call.

1308
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:49,520
But it's a bullshit rule and
I'm big enough to admit that.

1309
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,310
But the reality is,
you know,

1310
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:56,600
why that happened to you and why you
carry that with you. Oh, poor baby.

1311
01:19:56,601 --> 01:20:01,100
You've had to carry that since.
What, 2001 Aww. Poor baby.

1312
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:04,610
You know what I had to carry for almost
20 years was that roughing the passer

1313
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:07,650
call. You're probably too
young to remember this,

1314
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:12,651
but we basically beat the fucking Raiders
in 1976 we had you guys beating sugar

1315
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:18,870
bay. Hamilton is coming in against Ken
Stabler. He jumps in the air. Once again,

1316
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:19,830
I'm acting this out.

1317
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:24,570
He jumps in the air as stabler
is going to release the ball.

1318
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:26,970
He's in the fucking air.
The ball is released.

1319
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:32,210
He slams into Ken Stabler and they call
roughing the passer like he was supposed

1320
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:36,090
to change mid air. Now, I don't
know if you guys know this shit,

1321
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,600
but back then roughing the
passer was not a yardage penalty.

1322
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:44,700
They basically put the ball where they
were trying to complete it and it was the

1323
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:48,180
end of the game and they threw
a fucking 50 yard hail Mary.

1324
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:52,080
They called roughing the passer,
so they gave him the ball.

1325
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:57,030
Now it's not on the 50 they put it on
like the fucking three yard line and the

1326
01:20:57,031 --> 01:20:58,860
Raiders went in to go score that.

1327
01:20:58,861 --> 01:21:03,861
My friend was the biggest bullshit call
of all time because that was a complete

1328
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:08,100
wrong interpretation of the rule.
Do you understand the difference?

1329
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:11,580
The top rule is a bullshit rule
that was interpreted correctly.

1330
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:15,180
So the guy made the correct call.
He did make the correct call,

1331
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,350
but I feel for you because
that was a bullshit that was a,

1332
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:22,260
it's a bullshit rule and the
Raiders should have won that game.

1333
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:27,090
But that was paid back because the
Patriots should have beat you in 1976 but

1334
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,070
because a lot of you rate
of fans are a lot younger,

1335
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:31,590
you don't remember it or maybe
you don't want to remember it,

1336
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:36,060
but I carried that from
1976 to 2001 all right,

1337
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:40,260
so that was 15 years. All
right, youngster, you're
only seven years in the yard.

1338
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:45,180
Bullshit. So I have no
sympathy for you. Okay. Sorry.

1339
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:49,250
I get heated when it comes to sports and
he said something that was the next one.

1340
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:53,070
What's your, what's your opinion
on the field goal guy? You know,

1341
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:55,920
every bunch of guys.
I don't want to fucking read this one.

1342
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,950
I only went too long and that when I
get get tickets and some other people,

1343
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:03,060
I don't mind field goal kickers by the
my, sorry. I still got my old laptop.

1344
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:07,380
I'm trying to not hit this
button too much. All right, Bill.

1345
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,950
Um, I want your can be
comedic opinion on something.

1346
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:15,300
I was talking to a coworker of mine
about a girl that I had been seeing. Oh,

1347
01:22:15,301 --> 01:22:19,650
I love this question. This is a great
story. Everybody just settle in,

1348
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:23,700
settle in and turn this, turn this down.
Turn this down because I think this has,

1349
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:29,010
does this have the word continent? A
mature. Okay, here we go. All right, Bill,

1350
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,570
I want your comedic opinion on something.

1351
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:35,520
I was talking to a coworker of mine
about a girl that I had been seeing that

1352
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:36,600
I've been kind of seeing.

1353
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:42,020
I was telling him that one thing I
really like about her is how he wrote the

1354
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:47,040
song, how her, how good
her smell, her hair smells.

1355
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:52,620
Um, well there's Twat of a girl
that works with me, overheard us,

1356
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:56,310
and decided to chime in by
saying shit like she wants,

1357
01:22:56,490 --> 01:23:01,260
she wants to meet the girl who would go
out with a guy like me and how she would

1358
01:23:01,261 --> 01:23:04,500
actually be nervous to be alone with me.
All right.

1359
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:06,460
I know my reading out loud skills suck.

1360
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:09,310
So let me just sort of paraphrase
what happens. This guy's at work,

1361
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,210
he's kind of seeing this girl and he
says to a friend of his gay, you know,

1362
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,480
seeing this girl, you know, I really
love him. Her hair smells really great.

1363
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:18,400
That's all we have in the
send instant conversation.

1364
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:23,050
And then this other girl who's not even
in the conversation as a guide, let,

1365
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:25,990
I'd let them meet the girl out like you,
you know,

1366
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:30,310
I'd be nervous to be alone with
you. Right? Completely uncalled for.

1367
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,110
And he goes,
et cetera.

1368
01:23:32,111 --> 01:23:37,111
So now we recently found out that that
girl who chimed in just had an abortion

1369
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:43,690
like a week and a half ago.
Jesus brought, I brushed her off.

1370
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,410
I saw I brushed her off,
but the bitch didn't stop.

1371
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,150
She continued on by asking,
Ugh, another female worker,

1372
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:56,800
if she'd be nervous to be alone with me,
which my response was,

1373
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:02,230
why don't you ask, why don't
we ask someone what it's
like to be alone with you.

1374
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:06,910
Oh, wait a minute. That's
right. You killed it. Wow.

1375
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:12,040
Wow. Wow. Dude. You said that at work.

1376
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:18,040
Wow. Okay. Okay. And he basically says,

1377
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:23,020
which shocked half of the people at
work and made the other half crack up

1378
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:27,670
laughing. She called me an
insensitive asshole. Yeah. Okay.

1379
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:31,120
But I could care less. To
me. She was asking for it.

1380
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,140
It's not like she was just sitting there
minding her own business and I walked

1381
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:38,800
up and said, what's new fetus
killer? What do you think bill?

1382
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:42,250
Was I out of line or was it a kick ass?
Come back.

1383
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:48,070
Okay. Let me wrap my fucking
head around this. Um,

1384
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,460
all right. First of all, it
was an unbelievable come back.

1385
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:59,920
It was a game set and match come back.
You know,

1386
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:02,860
it was literally,
you know,

1387
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,200
I dunno, she didn't even
bring a knife to a gunfight.

1388
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:11,290
She was sitting there with a water
pistol and you took out a machete and you

1389
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:14,890
fucking chopped her head off and I dunno,

1390
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,980
held it up for everyone to
see and then you swung her,

1391
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:22,550
her fucking head around by the ponytail
and threw it across the offices.

1392
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:27,230
Basically what you did. Um, well
what do you think was I Adeline?

1393
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:32,110
Yeah,
I'm going to have to say yes because

1394
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,760
I totally understand why you went there.

1395
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,730
Like why you wanted to hurt her back
because what she was saying to you was

1396
01:25:42,731 --> 01:25:43,241
fucked up,

1397
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:48,241
but she was fucked up on like level two
and then you went right to the penthouse

1398
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:52,720
level. You know what I mean? I might
even say level two, she was a good,

1399
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:56,530
she was a good a third of the
way up the building. Okay.

1400
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:59,320
I don't know why I'm using a building
as an analogy, but I'm too deep now.

1401
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,020
I have to go with this.
But you,

1402
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:04,790
you went right to the penthouse suite and
you kicked her ass right off of it and

1403
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:07,500
you didn't even do it on the side.
You know where they have that,

1404
01:26:07,501 --> 01:26:10,990
that canopy thing with a bellman stance.
We're in a three stooges mover.

1405
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,080
You'd somehow live,

1406
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,350
you kicked her out the backside of the
building right down into the fucking

1407
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:20,240
alley with as a rat waiting to
crawl up into my fucking car. Um,

1408
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:26,510
yeah. What I would, what, I don't
know how old you are, but yeah,

1409
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:27,500
you kind of went,

1410
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:31,850
well you didn't have to go where you,

1411
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,050
what you have to do as you get older,
both men and women as psychologically,

1412
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:40,250
you have to realize where they're
coming from and you have to understand,

1413
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:44,690
especially knowing that she had just
had an abortion dude, which is fucking,

1414
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:48,650
is, is, that's brutal for a
guy to go through. You know,

1415
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,910
if you have any sort of a conscious,

1416
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:52,850
forget about a woman who's actually
carrying it, you know what I'm saying?

1417
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:58,540
And so the reason why she's saying that
she obviously is having difficulty with

1418
01:27:02,061 --> 01:27:07,061
her own relationships and it's so fucking
insecure that to hear someone around

1419
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:13,070
her actually maybe making some sort of
connection and be happy in that area of

1420
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:18,071
her life is fucking with her so much that
it wasn't enough just to say the mean

1421
01:27:18,681 --> 01:27:19,514
shit to you.

1422
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:24,790
She starts walking around the office like
trying to get people to like reinforce

1423
01:27:25,371 --> 01:27:30,050
her statement and to sort
of cock block you. And, um,

1424
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:36,050
I understand why,
why you did that,

1425
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:40,640
you know, you know, and you
gotta understand why you
went to that level. Okay.

1426
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:43,840
You went literally to that level
that had nothing to do with her.

1427
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:46,760
That adds some shit to do
the baggage you are bringing.

1428
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,970
I don't know what house you sound
like you came from a household like my

1429
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:52,760
household where, uh, you know,

1430
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,400
somebody makes fun of your
shirt and you're like, yeah,

1431
01:27:55,401 --> 01:27:59,430
at least my fucking uncle is in bed.
You know, you know, you just admit,

1432
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:04,430
you immediately go way beyond
what was just said to you. So,

1433
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:08,240
uh, was it out of line?
Definitely. Adeline. Dude,

1434
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,910
you shouldn't say shit like that at work.
I don't want you to lose your job,

1435
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:15,110
but you know, I'm not gonna lie
to you. It was fucking hilarious.

1436
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:18,710
And not to mention who to
fall after my rose bowl story.

1437
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:22,730
Who the fuck am I to say anybody was on
the line? I'm thinking, you know what,

1438
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:25,460
I'm and this is like your story.
Know I'm trying to break it down.

1439
01:28:25,461 --> 01:28:28,700
How you ended up there is where
I'm at as a human being right now,

1440
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:32,540
I'm still doing the what's
new fetus killer lines.

1441
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:37,490
But I'm trying not to do that. You
know, it's funny on a comedy stage,

1442
01:28:37,491 --> 01:28:39,280
but it's,
it's not funny at the Rose Bowl.

1443
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:45,560
All right? But dude, I got,
I gotta give you, you know,

1444
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:49,310
I gotta give you a fucking over the phone
high five on that one. That was just,

1445
01:28:49,311 --> 01:28:53,000
wow. Why don't we ask someone who's been
with alone with you? Oh, wait a minute.

1446
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:54,160
That's right.
You killed it.

1447
01:28:57,460 --> 01:29:00,650
There's no way people burst out laughing.
That's one of those things.

1448
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:02,790
If you've found it funny,
you made that, you know,

1449
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:05,970
you raise your eyebrows up like
holy shit and you gotta walk away.

1450
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,033
You know what I mean?

1451
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,470
Somehow there has to be a corner within
10 yards for you to walk around so you

1452
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:18,450
can let that laugh go. God Damn it.
That's, it was brutal. But that was funny.

1453
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:22,080
Come on, women. You've got
to laugh. You've got to know.
That's funny. I know. I know.

1454
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:25,050
It's brutal for, come
on. That was funny. Okay.

1455
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:30,090
Uh, where are we going? Where
are we going? All right,
Milena. Sports questions.

1456
01:29:30,091 --> 01:29:32,910
All of a sudden people are really liking
the sports. Okay, another question. Bill.

1457
01:29:32,911 --> 01:29:36,470
What happened to our beloved teams? This
is a Boston person. Do the Patriots,

1458
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:39,990
try and keep Matt Cassel
knowing Tom Brady is rehabbing.

1459
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:43,380
His Rehab is slightly behind.
Uh,

1460
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:47,370
do the jets offer back the second round?

1461
01:29:47,371 --> 01:29:51,150
They gain from spygate back for the
pets. Oh man, you gone real detail.

1462
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:54,320
I have no idea what's
happened to our beloved.

1463
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:58,440
The patients had an unbelievable season
and what I love about it is everyone was

1464
01:29:58,441 --> 01:30:01,050
questioning bill. Bill
Parcell, Bill Parcells,

1465
01:30:01,051 --> 01:30:04,800
Bill Belicheck because of
the spy gate thing. And uh,

1466
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:06,331
you know,

1467
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:10,680
look at this year after winning with
the six round pick three Superbowls,

1468
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,760
seventh round draft pick, he goes 11
and five and almost once a division,

1469
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:19,680
I think he's proven himself as a fucking
coach. And uh, people always be like, oh,

1470
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:23,340
fucking spygate. But they got nothing.
They don't have an argument. And a,

1471
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:27,270
the reason why I said bill Parcells is
because I really think that that guy is

1472
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:31,800
overrated. You know, I think he's
really good at making a team good,

1473
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,440
but he can't get them over the top.

1474
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,190
And he throws temper tantrums when he
doesn't get his way. And he totally,

1475
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:42,870
he's like the Larry Brown of football,
you know,

1476
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:46,290
he's only won two super bowls,
86 and [inaudible] 90.

1477
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:50,460
And who was his fucking defensive
coordinator? Bill Belicheck. All right.

1478
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,400
He got to the Superbowl
again with the Patriots.

1479
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:57,270
Who was his defensive coordinator?
Bill Belicheck. Right.

1480
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:02,520
You see bill Bellacheck has gone on.
It's won three Superbowls parcels has one,

1481
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:06,930
nothing, one, nothing. He
changed the colors of the team.

1482
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:09,570
He definitely gets a winning tradition
going on there, but he doesn't win.

1483
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:13,980
So I'd rather have Bella check you in
order to realize he's a great coach.

1484
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,020
I'm just still pissed that he'd,

1485
01:31:15,021 --> 01:31:18,180
he announced that he was leaving our team
a week before we were going to play a

1486
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:21,660
Superbowl for his own selfish reasons.
I really annoyed me. All right.

1487
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:26,430
Question number was even on four.
Okay. For those of you not into sports,

1488
01:31:26,431 --> 01:31:29,550
here we go. Here's the non
sports stories. Uh, Bill,

1489
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,820
when you do an appearance on a
big show like Letterman or Conan,

1490
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:35,610
what's the protocol for
meeting the other guests?

1491
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,080
Does the show hooked that up automatically
or the guests isolated from each

1492
01:31:40,081 --> 01:31:44,040
other and the dressing
room and green rooms? Uh,

1493
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:47,760
the reason I ask is NBC just
recently had a replay of your cone,

1494
01:31:47,761 --> 01:31:51,900
an episode that you appeared on with
Keira Knightley was the headliner.

1495
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:54,900
I assume one of the perks and doing the
show is getting to check out a famous

1496
01:31:54,901 --> 01:31:58,260
chicken person, right? Um, no you don't.

1497
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:03,290
You are on a entirely different
floor than the actual famous people.

1498
01:32:04,091 --> 01:32:08,320
You're just the comedian. So I don't
know what it's like to do panel.

1499
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:09,340
I've never done panel.

1500
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:14,700
That's kind of one of my goals here for
2009 maybe I can do pony a panel on one

1501
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:16,420
of the later,

1502
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:19,420
later shows like Carson Daly and I
just have to have something to hype.

1503
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,840
Maybe I can do that then I'd love to
do that. But I've only been a comedian.

1504
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:26,470
So basically, you know, you're
on kind of on your own floor.

1505
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:31,930
Um, on Letterman you're aren't, you
have like your own Florida yourself,

1506
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:35,860
which is cool and kind of creepy.
And then on Conan, you're,

1507
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:41,080
when I did call in and you know what,
I def you definitely more,

1508
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:43,780
I don't know where they put the famous
people because I'm not near them.

1509
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:47,680
But I did walk out and after
Chuck Norris did his sketch,

1510
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:51,280
I made sure when he walked by
me, I shook his hand, you know,

1511
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:53,830
thinking like that hand ship Bruce
Lee's hand, you know what I mean?

1512
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:59,490
Or at least blocked his fucking kick or
some shit and whatever movie that was a,

1513
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:04,060
but no, no, you don't get to
meet those people. Some, some
people are cool. You know,

1514
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:06,750
I remember once the first time we did
Conan, Mary Tyler Moore walked by,

1515
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,660
looked into my room,
smiled and said hello. Um,

1516
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:14,440
you know, I think a lot of times
people are sitting back there thinking,

1517
01:33:14,441 --> 01:33:16,390
what stories am I going to tell you?

1518
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:19,540
Get your head together and you already
have your crew of people, you know,

1519
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:23,030
people who book you and
that type of stuff. And um,

1520
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:27,640
cause personally before I go out and
do my set, like literally, you know,

1521
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:32,080
once the show starts after the first
segment, I kind of send, you know,

1522
01:33:32,081 --> 01:33:35,500
all my people out of the room so I can
kind of just basically remember what my

1523
01:33:35,501 --> 01:33:39,760
opening joke is. So
they go, all right, um,

1524
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:42,040
question numbers or whatever we're on.

1525
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,020
I have these numbered wrong
for some reason, says three,

1526
01:33:44,021 --> 01:33:46,250
even though oil and it's like five.
Uh,

1527
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:48,340
I have a question about
your storytelling ability.

1528
01:33:48,341 --> 01:33:51,040
When you told the story about
getting the hot dog from pinks,

1529
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:53,560
it was not only hilarious,
but I felt like I was there.

1530
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:57,370
I suck at being able to replay
the funny shit that happens to me,

1531
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,380
my family is and friends.

1532
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:02,800
Does your story ability come naturally
or is it something that you've worked on?

1533
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:05,680
How do you put together a good story?
Um,

1534
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,410
I'm actually not the greatest storyteller.

1535
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:13,440
I digress a lot and I'm trying to get
to get to the meat of it a lot better.

1536
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:18,520
Um, but yeah, just kind of comes
from telling a lot of stories,

1537
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:21,370
but uh, but don't beat
yourself up man. You know,

1538
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:23,260
there's a lot of people
who can't tell a story,

1539
01:34:23,261 --> 01:34:27,820
but it's more like they are the
story, you know what I mean? Like,

1540
01:34:27,821 --> 01:34:30,310
um,
I dunno,

1541
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:35,200
I got a good friend of mine who he does
the funniest shit ever and he as you on

1542
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:37,930
the ground, he does shit
offstage. I wouldn't do onstage.

1543
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,890
And he has you on the ground laughing,
but he read, tells the story. It.

1544
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:47,320
It doesn't sound like anything funny
happened, but like in the moment,

1545
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:50,080
he's like the funniest guy
ever. Like a, it's weird. Like,

1546
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:51,580
I don't know how I told
that Rosebowl story.

1547
01:34:51,581 --> 01:34:53,320
I was just trying not to get
the other dude in trouble,

1548
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:57,890
but the other dude kind of was the story.
Joe was fucking hilarious.

1549
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:03,560
Um, I dunno. And then afterwards I'm,
I'm telling the story. I'm the story guy.

1550
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:06,940
I tell the fucking story, but I'm
not the fucking story. All right.

1551
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:10,850
I'm just a sad little man we
telling shit that I didn't do. Okay.

1552
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:14,420
Question number six.
Um,

1553
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:19,430
all right. Hey, what's the
word? Uh, Oh, you know what?
I got this one totally wrong.

1554
01:35:19,431 --> 01:35:20,830
The, I, if someone asked me the other day,

1555
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:23,780
a couple of weeks back about what I
think about the Chicago Blackhawks,

1556
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:27,140
I was only mildly paying attention to
them. I didn't realize how good they were,

1557
01:35:27,141 --> 01:35:29,660
the sheer, and I started
watching them. Um,

1558
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:34,250
I think that they're going to go maybe
a couple rounds into the playoffs this

1559
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:37,430
year. And, um, I'll see.

1560
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:42,400
You asked me why the flux or the Bruins
get rid of the Thornton and I, you know,

1561
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,200
was saying why, you know, they kind
of blamed our shortcomings on him,

1562
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:48,560
but I forgot that we got,
we got Phil Kessel in that trade.

1563
01:35:48,561 --> 01:35:51,410
So we did get something sort of a

1564
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:54,560
trying to correct something there.
All right,

1565
01:35:54,561 --> 01:35:56,950
let me try to get to the
rest of these. All right. Uh,

1566
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,670
here's the new year's
resolutions. People, I know.

1567
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:03,080
This is getting long new
year's resolutions. Um, I
never, yeah, you know what,

1568
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:07,280
why do I hate my shit? This we can go be
at the Improv and Tampa, go to Improv,

1569
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:10,730
the number two.com for all the information
where you can click right on my

1570
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:13,700
homepage. Please come out to
see me at the Improv in Tampa.

1571
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:17,930
I got a whole new hour is shit.
And um, yeah, come on man.

1572
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,570
Can't be just listening to
me for free and my podcast.

1573
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:22,530
I know it's a tough economy,
but for the Christ sake,

1574
01:36:22,531 --> 01:36:26,120
come out and fucking support me. All
right, New Year's resolutions. Um,

1575
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:30,050
all right. Fill a lot of people who were
against him. Here's a guy I have. No,

1576
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:33,470
I never understood the logic of new
year's resolutions that's turning 64 other

1577
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:36,800
days a year when one can decide to
do something better for themselves.

1578
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:39,290
Perhaps it's another marketing
scheme for capitalists.

1579
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:43,250
Bloodsuckers I'm hoping that we will make
another hoping that we'll make another

1580
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:46,340
irrational decisions. It's not
really a, it's more of a statement.

1581
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:50,000
I kind of agree with that. Um, I
absolutely hate new years resolutions.

1582
01:36:50,001 --> 01:36:52,790
People trick themselves into believing
that the best time to make changes and

1583
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,380
start things is at the
beginning of the year.

1584
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:57,650
I don't make New Year's resolutions
because they are an unnecessary.

1585
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:02,360
I start every new year off with what I
refer to as my three golden rules. One,

1586
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,820
laugh my ass off.
Every chance I get

1587
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,400
to after I have done what I can,

1588
01:37:10,401 --> 01:37:15,260
I walk away from those things that
I cannot fix or resolve. And three,

1589
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:17,120
I surround myself with people,

1590
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:22,121
places and things I love most
and support who I am as a person,

1591
01:37:22,521 --> 01:37:26,240
Jesus Christ and somebody
who's healthy. Huh? Um,

1592
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,890
all right. What are, where we
go in here, where are we going?

1593
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,950
Let's wrap this fucking thing up
with a quick overrated, underrated.

1594
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:36,980
And I'm actually going to pitch it because
you guys have been doing such a great

1595
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:41,150
job here. Um, I'm going to say
overrated is the movie 300.

1596
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:46,850
Um, that's, it's just
that it's laugh out loud.

1597
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:49,640
Awful.
The second time you see it,

1598
01:37:49,641 --> 01:37:51,740
the first time you see it
visually it's really interesting,

1599
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:56,360
but it's just the stupidest fucking
thing ever. It's the complete meathead,

1600
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:00,900
what it means to be a man. And you
know, the, the, the kid, you know,

1601
01:38:00,901 --> 01:38:04,770
it was crying for his mother and they
fucking stick them in a loin cloth out in

1602
01:38:04,771 --> 01:38:06,720
the wilderness.
It's snowing out.

1603
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:11,810
He's walking around in his bare feet and
he kills some sort of hybrid wolf slash

1604
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:16,290
alien with a stick. And I'm
supposed to believe that. And,

1605
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:17,490
and you know,

1606
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:22,260
and then they had the fight club moment
where he murders another fucking half

1607
01:38:22,261 --> 01:38:22,621
naked,

1608
01:38:22,621 --> 01:38:27,621
six year old with this kid who's spout
Taj and they kick them down that fucking

1609
01:38:29,551 --> 01:38:33,650
man hole. And that one guy does the,
the beautiful backflip as he goes it,

1610
01:38:33,651 --> 01:38:38,130
it's fucking gay. All right. And
they take on an army of 20,000.

1611
01:38:38,131 --> 01:38:39,780
You know what I mean?
You know what that movie is.

1612
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:45,170
That's the fantasy every man has after
he pussies out and a bunch of women som

1613
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:48,600
pussy out in like a bar
fight or something like that.

1614
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:52,200
And then when you're driving home and you
start dreaming of the man you wish you

1615
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:56,040
were and how you looked and
fucking, you know, mood lighting,

1616
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,420
fuck that movie movie sucks.
It really sucks. Okay.

1617
01:39:00,421 --> 01:39:04,230
I think half those apps were painted on
once I saw that Janet Jackson does that,

1618
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:08,280
you know, that you can actually do some
shadowing there on the stomach. Okay.

1619
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:12,750
Um, if somebody is, say some
old rate on rate overrated,

1620
01:39:12,751 --> 01:39:15,990
I losing your virginity. Uh, but God,

1621
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:19,950
but God SEC's rules when you
figure it out later in life. Also,

1622
01:39:19,951 --> 01:39:23,960
my guitar playing to my friends
is underrated. Uh, Bill Burr,

1623
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:27,240
the funniest men alive and chicken
wings are also under underrated.

1624
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,450
The greatest food ever. Chicken
wings are great when you're younger,

1625
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:33,330
but once your stomach is so full of
grease, when you're in the middle ages,

1626
01:39:33,331 --> 01:39:37,560
you can't eat them anymore.
So enjoy underrated jerky.

1627
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:41,460
It's a good source of protein, low in
fat and it's tasty. Great snack. Yeah.

1628
01:39:41,461 --> 01:39:44,730
But you've got to go to a
truck stop to get it. And uh,

1629
01:39:44,731 --> 01:39:49,590
there's always the danger of being raped
there, man or a woman, um, underrated,

1630
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:49,980
uh,

1631
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:54,980
being in familiar enough company to talk
some serious shit and do some serious

1632
01:39:55,471 --> 01:39:56,304
ball busting.

1633
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:59,400
There's nothing worse than going out
with some people you kind of know,

1634
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:01,230
but you don't know enough
to know their limits.

1635
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:05,910
So you can't mix it up verbally with
my friends at bars watching a game,

1636
01:40:05,911 --> 01:40:08,070
it's great knowing I don't
need to censor myself,

1637
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:11,490
but with my girlfriend in general
quite insists on couples nights,

1638
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:15,450
it feels like I'm eating with my
grandparents. It's all smallest talk,

1639
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:19,740
no substance. And I'm constantly censoring
myself. It's a psychological prison.

1640
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:22,290
Exactly.
I'd have to agree with you on that one.

1641
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:25,620
Totally would have to agree with you that,
uh,

1642
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,520
less couple of things.
I think that's basically it.

1643
01:40:29,521 --> 01:40:33,660
That's the podcast for this week. I hope
you enjoyed my long ass fucking stories.

1644
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,040
Happy new year to everybody.

1645
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:37,530
I hope you guys have a great new year
and I hope you can stick with you new

1646
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:42,150
year's resolutions. Personally,
I've been doing what I always do,

1647
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:47,151
getting myself in shape the first half
of the year before I completely get back

1648
01:40:47,821 --> 01:40:51,120
out of shape and nose dive with some
Christmas cookies at the end of the year.

1649
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:55,210
That's what I do. But you know,
bikini season is coming up.

1650
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,450
Um, yeah. You know, I did.

1651
01:40:58,451 --> 01:41:01,600
I actually bought that P90x thing that
they have late at night and I got to

1652
01:41:01,601 --> 01:41:05,710
admit, dude, it's the fucking shit.
Once you get past the guy hosting it,

1653
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:09,430
you know, I don't know if I already
talked about this. He's, he's kind of a,

1654
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:14,890
if you're doing a sketch about a personal
trainer and you imitated this guy,

1655
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:18,400
they think that what you were doing
wasn't realistic. He gives, oh yeah.

1656
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:22,810
P90X you know, talks about how he does
a nice shoes or almost as cool as mine.

1657
01:41:22,811 --> 01:41:25,850
Okay, let's drop down
and do some crunches. Um,

1658
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:27,910
but after awhile you get to
see that he's just, you know,
