1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,170
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:05,650
It's bill burr and it's the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:11,020
April 29th, 2013 how
are ya? How you doing?

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,760
I am in a fucking phenomenal mood.
Absolutely.

5
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:19,660
I'm in a great goddamn mood.
You know why? You know why?

6
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:22,780
Because I'm not even mad right now that
my cell phone is ringing this fucking

7
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:27,040
early in the podcast. I'm not. I'm not.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,920
Um,
you know what's funny?

9
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:32,920
That's cell phone just made me
completely lose my train of thought.

10
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:36,880
That's how simplistic my brain is. It goes
in a straight line. One fucking thing,

11
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:40,270
knocks it off track. And I just,
I, I forget where I was going.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,050
Why am I in a great mood? Oh, I know why.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,140
Because the Celtics showed that they
have fucking high and the Lakers lost,

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,910
got swept, disgraced, humiliated,

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,830
and I loved every God damn second of it.
You know? And you know why I am I okay,

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,390
I'm back on track. I feel fucking
vindicated after all these Laker fans.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,830
You know what? T tweeting me,
Facebooking me, my spacing,

18
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:13,720
me friends during me saying
that I'm just a hater, you know,

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,100
which is the classic thing that somebody
says when they can't refute any points

20
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,850
that you made. They go,
are you just a hater?

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Is when I told them that the guy that
they kept constantly sit there and call

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,720
and chant MVP yet is is a
fucking cancer on that team,

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,960
so fucking cancer and they just can't see
it because I'm not saying all of them,

24
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:41,950
but just because they see that everybody
plays. He's fantasy fucking football,

25
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:45,190
baseball, bullshit, all
they look at his stats.

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,353
All right,

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,080
let me tell you something. Laker
fans, when you're not eating your pot,

28
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:55,830
cookies and body fucking boogie
boarding or whatever the fuck it is,

29
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:59,220
you guys do get up when you're not
laying back at the chair with the fucking

30
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,530
dental office getting
botox in your fucking head,

31
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,360
even though you're only 19 years old,

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,580
why don't you just put yourself in the
position of the other players on the

33
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:09,414
Lakers?

34
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,643
All right.

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,180
To wake the fuck up,
get out of the sun,

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,090
stopped frying up your goddamn brain.
It just use a little bit of common sense.

37
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,820
Listen,
I know after the games,

38
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:25,910
when Colby walks off with 10
seconds left during a loss,

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,190
cause he got his 37 points,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you know that afterwards when they asked
the other Lakers in front of the camera

41
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:37,520
and they go, Oh, you know,
how did you feel about that?
And then they just go, well,

42
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:40,670
you know, uh, Colby, he's uh,
he's a competitor. You know,

43
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:45,320
he's one of the best that I ever played
the gay bed. Uh, I mean he wants to wait.

44
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,970
I mean,
we all do add a,

45
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:50,840
that didn't happen tonight on fortunately
and all we know what to do is to just

46
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:51,950
keep it.
I can fucking do it.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,270
You just keep working hard and
digital law have any sort of a,

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,620
did it annoy you at all? We walked off
core. Nope. No, it didn't bother me. Uh,

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,850
you know, every guy has a
different personality. I mean,

50
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:08,851
you can just fucking gracefully navigate
that minefield and just say all that

51
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,983
bullshit.

52
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I would fucking give $1 million if I
had it to listen to the other liquors on

53
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:19,360
the team,
their cell phone conversations,

54
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:23,270
when they leave the staple center
talking to their fucking Bro,

55
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,340
you know, going all Paul Mccartney
and John Lennon, fucking sick sec.

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,380
You know that coming out of there and
they fucking range rovers and they fucking

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,260
$100,000 Mercedes just driving outgoing.

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,620
Can you fucking believe that mother
fuckers? Why they get fucked?

59
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,590
You know I'm wide open. Wide Open
coffee. Write it. Write it. Yeah.

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,640
Fuck God takes a turn around jumper
with three guys hanging off on 10 feet

61
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,570
behind the arc.

62
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,440
Okay,

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,310
I don't care.

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,230
I'm telling you right now, do
what the fuck would you do? Okay.

65
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:07,040
If you were at some four h club and
you're supposed to build a tree fort,

66
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,630
you know, and you hold up the board and
you're supposed to hammer in both sides.

67
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:14,510
One conscious hammers and his side,
they just fucking walks away.

68
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,170
The whole thing collapses out of the
tree and he just walks away and everybody

69
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:21,880
else at camp is laughing at you during
the loss and he's fucking already backing

70
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,920
the popsicle stick in the fucking
log cabin. How would you feel?

71
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,830
What would you be saying?
You know?

72
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:29,820
Okay.

73
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,181
I'll tell you,

74
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:34,980
if it was televised around the fucking
world to all the four H's and your goal

75
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:38,910
was to continue being in four h is you
do exactly what the other fucking lake or

76
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:43,040
people do. You just sit there
going like, well, you know, uh,

77
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,190
he's uh,
he loves building tree forts and a,

78
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:51,390
it's really in his heart and when things
don't go well, he gets upset and uh,

79
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:51,751
you know,

80
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:54,840
all we know how to do is just to get out
there tomorrow actually you put voice

81
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:55,674
would be way higher

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,170
and I try to build a tree fort.

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,190
I love it. So the guy, he
gets injured. All right,

84
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,630
now you can actually sit down.

85
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,560
It may be watched the Lakers you get
maybe get to watch Steve Nash do what the

86
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:14,311
fuck he does.

87
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:18,240
Distribute the Goddamn ball rather than
pass it to Colby and then sit there.

88
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:22,740
You know, I dunno what, what do you do
with that after you've passed it to Colby?

89
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:24,570
I mean, your wives, we'll
just fucking sit down.

90
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,030
You don't take a little
cat nap or whatever.

91
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,060
I was actually looking forward to that
shit. And what happens? What happened?

92
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:36,480
What is the cancer? Have it
big. What does this guy do?

93
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,910
He starts tweeting during the game,

94
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,160
criticizing the fucking coach like a
fence. You can't read through the lines.

95
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,430
When his coach said, uh, he's
a fan now. That's what fans do.

96
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,140
And then Colby like laughs it off.
That right read between the lines.

97
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:55,860
He's saying this guy's one of the biggest
cons I've ever had a coach in my life.

98
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,290
Even when he's on the court, he's still
fucking up the chemistry of the tape.

99
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,863
All right.

100
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,880
Did Bill Russell ever tweet during
his Celtic career? All right,

101
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,060
you get the point. You know what
I'm saying? I feel vindicated.

102
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,240
And how about those Celtics,
about those old ass Celtics?

103
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,020
I was really nervous
that they were going out,

104
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,630
that they were going to get swept and uh,
I dunno,

105
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,760
I, I, I gotta be honest with you. I didn't
watch one second of the Celtic series.

106
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,350
I've, I, I can only pick
one sport, you know,

107
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,770
so I've been watching the Bruins
and I gotta tell you, man,

108
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,490
I have never been so fucking
frustrated with the team in my life.

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,830
Jesus Christ, the first two periods would
come out. We play great play, great.

110
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,920
We always score every
fucking game I watched,

111
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:49,921
we score to fucking goals and we look
phenomenal until right towards the end of

112
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:53,720
the second period or the third period
and the whole thing just falls apart.

113
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,600
I don't know what's going
on. I, I'm actually,

114
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:01,250
I just think it's one of these years,
one of these years where you can, I,

115
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,800
there's no way.
I can't figure out what the problem is.

116
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,580
Nobody can figure out what the problem
is and unfortunately somebody is going to

117
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:11,120
have to pay for it because when
you don't get where you want to be,

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,530
either the coach has to lose his job
or somebody has to get fucking traded.

119
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,050
Um, I dunno, it was like watching the, uh,

120
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,270
I mean this is obviously not as bad,
but a few years ago when the Red Sox,

121
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,470
when the wheels fell off with them and
rather than everybody just sitting down

122
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:29,450
and being like, all right,
we won to world series.

123
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,720
We obviously know what the
fuck we're doing. Okay,

124
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,280
let's try to figure this thing out.

125
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,490
Everybody started pointing fingers and
the whole fucking thing disintegrates.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,240
And it was like watching
van Halen breakup, you know,

127
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,680
David Lee Roth left van Halen brothers
go over this way, you know, and,

128
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,900
and are they better for it?

129
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,280
Did they ever make a better
album than those first? What,

130
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:56,990
four or five they never did. They never
did cause they fucked with the chemistry.

131
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,120
Um, so anyways, this is
the Monday morning podcast.

132
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,650
I'm your wonderful house bill burr and a,

133
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:10,570
I got a buddy of mine up and coming
comedian Danny Lobell has an, uh,

134
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,880
has a new comedy album that's coming out.
This isn't a commercial,

135
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:17,330
this is just some, just a nice little
promotion for a friend of mine. Uh,

136
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,950
the name of the album's called some
kind of comedian, um, April 30th,

137
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:25,730
tomorrow. The album, unless you
listen to this years in the future,

138
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,900
then it's already out. But if you listen
to it today, April 30th, tomorrow,

139
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,240
Tuesday 2013,
April 30th,

140
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:37,160
the album is out in stores and it'll
be on iTunes, amazon.com, et cetera.

141
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,610
It's recorded in Scotland,
which I think is cool. You know,

142
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:45,290
it gives it a nice different flavor
at the, uh, Glasgow Comedy Festival.

143
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,310
Danny labelle's called some kind of
comedian. Uh, check it out if you want.

144
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,860
What's great? It's as if it's on
iTunes. You can listen to some tracks.

145
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,770
If you like it, you could download
it. If you don't, you don't have to,

146
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,970
but either way,
don't fucking start bitching at me.

147
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,980
I liked this guy and I think he's funny.
Okay, go fuck yourselves. All right.

148
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:06,300
Back to the podcast.
Um, where the hell am I?

149
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,680
What's the hell would I want to talk about

150
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,910
after going on and on about that?
You know,

151
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,650
I've been reading this Daily Mail thing.

152
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:18,570
You guys go on this website wants
to deal with Daily Mail. Um,

153
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,280
did I already get rid of
it? Oh No. There it is.

154
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,640
This is the most insane fucking website.
They just got it.

155
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:32,700
They got it. I love it.
They've got stories all around.
They got one here. This,

156
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,370
this is a bad one.
Boy.

157
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:39,371
Two and 10 month old brother died after
exhausted Australian mother left them in

158
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:44,690
the shower and fell asleep for 10 hours.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck was she on?

159
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,613
Huh?

160
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,360
I was really tired and I slept for 10.

161
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,350
You don't sleep for 10 hours unless you've
been doing what? Blow for three days.

162
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,190
I guess some people could sleep that long.
That's fucking,

163
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,530
I mean, I know. I shouldn't
be laughing at this shit.

164
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,290
That's a bad one. Then they got this
other story. It says you've got a,

165
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,870
you've got a friend in me,

166
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,870
Xena the warrior puppy rescued
as it was starving to death.

167
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:17,980
Now changing the life of an autistic boy
and you got to see this picture of this

168
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:19,930
dog when they found it starving.

169
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,350
It looks like a fossil with fur on it.

170
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,960
It already looks like it's dead.

171
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,280
Somehow this thing comes back to life
and is now helping this kid that has

172
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:34,750
autism. All right, so there's
one for your cat people.

173
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,270
You have a phone and a, she created
fossil looking fucking cat. All right.

174
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,740
And you nursed it back to health,

175
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:46,710
giving it milk and whatever and a little
box for it to shit in the house and

176
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,040
give you that look like, yeah, you deal
with it like cats always do. All right.

177
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Do you think at the end of that journey
that it would then fucking help out some

178
00:10:56,441 --> 00:11:00,280
autistic kid you think a cat cat doesn't
have a fucking ability to do that?

179
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,430
You know, they don't cause
there were a bunch of cops.

180
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,510
So there you go to the two
debates have ended today.

181
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,240
Dogs are better people than cats.

182
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,160
And the Celtics have more heart than
the Lakers. That's just it. Okay.

183
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:20,020
And I'm also gonna, I'm also gonna fucking
checkoff. Colby is not the fucking MVP.

184
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,220
All right? Colby is if it fantasy
football, fantasy basketball,

185
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,560
that's the fucking guy you
want your God damn team.

186
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,880
He's not even in the game.
Any still affecting.

187
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,490
He's got to sit there and
tweet and criticize his own
goddamn coach. Oh my God,

188
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:41,410
that guy earns the K, you know, and can't,

189
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,430
um,
all right onto some other shit here.

190
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,830
And I know it's been a lot of,
oh, it's been pretty much nothing.

191
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,160
Nothing but sports talk this week.
Uh,

192
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,600
this one actually transcends sports to
show that everybody in sports is not a

193
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:06,430
fucking meathead NBA star.
Jason Collins comes out as gay,

194
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:11,200
making them him the first
openly homosexual athlete
on a major American sports

195
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:16,040
teeth. Now other people have come out,
but always after their careers. And uh,

196
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,330
and I think it's fucking great.

197
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,680
I've said for years I wanted it to be a
football player who was the most fucking

198
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:26,560
like,
like a ray Lewis level guy.

199
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:31,140
I always thought that that would
be fucking hilarious just because,

200
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:31,591
not all,

201
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:35,910
because it's just an extra level of way
to talk shit to fans of the other team,

202
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,530
you know,

203
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,860
which I guess is probably homophobic
to be like even at gay guys kicking the

204
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,880
shit out of you. You know, like this
is not some tough Gig dudes out there.

205
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,440
So look at this. I'm learning
things too. Here it is. NBA start.

206
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:53,070
Jason Collins came out as gay
today in a revealing interview,

207
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,260
but how many people are
going to lose their jobs?

208
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,900
Trying to write a Twitter
joke about this one, um,

209
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,630
or their endorsement with some
fucking insurance company,

210
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,510
making him the first professional
athlete in American sports, uh,

211
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,200
to come out as gay. I want
somebody else's as a soccer player.

212
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:12,440
Come now. Oh Jesus. That's
an easy joke right there.

213
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,770
I'm not going to step in that fucking
minefield. I'm not going to do it.

214
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm going to be mature.
Throughout this entire story.

215
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,670
The 34 year old basketball player opened
up an interview with sports illustrated

216
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:26,240
amid much speculation about rumors that
the major athlete would be coming out of

217
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:27,680
the closet.
Uh,

218
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,040
the initial reports came from the
national football league as a number of

219
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:35,060
straight players said that they would
support a teammate should they reveal they

220
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:36,140
were gay? Yeah. Why wouldn't you?

221
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,970
I got to tell you the showers gotta
be a little weird then, you know.

222
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,630
Okay,

223
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,180
it's this, is this fucking dumb. Should
they have their own showers then?

224
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,420
Or at least play pay a cover if
they're going to go into the shot,

225
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,440
should they have to, I'm going to
open this debate with my own moron.

226
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:04,120
Should they have to pay a cover charge
when they go into the shower with

227
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:07,240
everybody else, with all the other
dudes and the team, you know,

228
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,190
I mean, what the fuck? What
if I was playing in Wnb Ba?

229
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:16,380
They wouldn't let me go in the shower.
He's gonna walk in there with this.

230
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,110
Right.
They would all be flipping out.

231
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,900
Yeah.

232
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,370
That's a fucking very ignorant yet.
Interesting point.

233
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,830
You know,
everybody on your team is in shape.

234
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,180
They're all got their abs and that pex
go and you can't tell me that's not a

235
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:36,950
fucking enjoyable experience.

236
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,290
They would like be like me if I got
to walk in and shower with all these

237
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,810
Victoria secret models
and they'll be like, whoa,

238
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,740
I'm just like,
Yo.

239
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,870
I also like wearing high
shoes with fatness. Right?

240
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,030
I Dunno. Either way. I'm fucking
around. I think it's great.

241
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,130
It's about God the up time and uh,

242
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,930
I think it's fucking hilarious
because there's so many morons.

243
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,760
They're to sports fans that I
wished that I was in a sports bar

244
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,290
when this came out and just watching
fucking guys eyebrows and fucking getting

245
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,840
all twisted up. Well, it's sports.

246
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,630
You're not supposed to be gay. Um,
I think it's great. Good for him.

247
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,670
Good on him. Who's he play
for right now? I never 30.

248
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:35,890
All the Washington wizards come
out as gay. Oh my God. Did they,

249
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,820
they didn't make the playoffs or not?
I have no idea.

250
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,090
I have no idea. But I can
guarantee fucking tee you somebody,

251
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,500
somebody is going to lose their job.

252
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,040
Trying to make a joke
or somebody going to a

253
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,471
out Jesus,
you know,

254
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:57,610
all those Bible belt people via ever
plays a game down in like fucking,

255
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,140
he plays the grizzly. They going to
be standing outside the team bus.

256
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:07,030
You are going to hey l,
that's when you know you're a moron.

257
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:13,040
When you, when you're fucking,
you make one syllable words,

258
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,310
two syllable, you're going to hey. Oh,

259
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,950
he's in yard.
Um,

260
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,330
what's the one? And then I always
do the one about the chick.

261
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,710
I can't fucking remember
my is fried people.

262
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,730
I've been on the road this entire month.
Actually,

263
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:38,170
this entire fucking year I figured
it out and I can't even remember.

264
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:42,940
The numbers were like something like 17
or 18 weeks into this year and I've been

265
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:47,380
to like 20 cities. All right. I really
don't know what's going on in the world.

266
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,200
This is how fucking out of the loop I am.

267
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,310
I knew that there was an explosion
in Texas and it took me two,

268
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:55,450
three days before I,

269
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,310
I read something that let me know whether
it was an accident or another fucking

270
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:04,960
Timothy Mcveigh Psycho.
All right. So I do the,

271
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:09,340
um, I do the, uh, what did I do?

272
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,960
I did Dallas. I'll take you through
my week. What was it Wednesday?

273
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,070
The fuck is today. My, I don't even know.

274
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:21,220
So Wednesday or Thursday
I went to Las Vegas, um,

275
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,110
and I did a private show.
They to go,

276
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,220
you've got a private show in uh,
in Vegas.

277
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,650
And I didn't even ask who the
fuck it was for. I was like, Oh,

278
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:36,360
I'm making some money. Yeah, I'll
go to Vegas. Oh, walk around.

279
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:39,030
I'll take a fucking steam.
It's one of my,

280
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,120
the only time I ever take a steam is when
I go to Las Vegas cause every fucking

281
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:44,260
casino has one.
And

282
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,950
it's the greatest fucking experience
of your life. You know, you walk in,

283
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,110
first of all, everybody in there was
always like 80 years old. For some reason.

284
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,030
Old Guys love taking it to stay. The
only time you have a fucking go in there,

285
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:03,300
right?
So I always go in there and uh,

286
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,221
you got to go in there.

287
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:09,240
Also would like an extra towel because
as you're sweating the impurities out,

288
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,340
all the impurities are
sitting on your skin.

289
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,790
And if you don't fucking white towel off,
you just absorb them back in.

290
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,730
Or a lot of them, the ones that
don't drip off of you or whatever,

291
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,550
so you fucking go in there,
you have a great God damn time,

292
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,630
you in some other like fucking guy looks
like Mr. Hooper from fucking sesame

293
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:25,830
street,
you know?

294
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,910
Yeah.

295
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,710
And uh, you come out, you
fucking pores are open,

296
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,000
your fucking shave.

297
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,550
You're not gonna have to shave for like
another three days unless you're one of

298
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:40,870
those Harry Apes. And uh, then he'd
go upstairs, you take a fucking nap,

299
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,080
you sleep like a goddamn
baby. Right. Unfortunate.

300
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,390
I came in too late so I wasn't able
to do all this. Um, so anyways,

301
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:51,790
typical me like an asshole.
I'm one of those,

302
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,190
some comedian comedians
are really organized.

303
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,320
And then you have other comedians like
myself where as I'm going to the airport,

304
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,700
any the NEA or the taxi guys go on. What
airline? I'm looking it up in my phone.

305
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,530
Um, so I get there and I go,
who am I doing this, this, uh,

306
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,440
this private show for?
And they said, oh, it's a,

307
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,690
it's a poker tournament
with a bunch of oil men.

308
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,020
Yeah,

309
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,640
there's like 10 billionaires.

310
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,920
The rest are millionaires and there's a
couple of bankers there. Right. So we are,

311
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:24,830
I am now feeling like fucking Beyonce,
you know,

312
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:29,831
when she performed for those dictators
after all my time talking about,

313
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:35,240
uh, you know, blood money and all
that shit. Here I am going out there,

314
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:39,260
I should have put on a little glitter
dress and dance like a fucking whore and I

315
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,000
go out to go do this benefit.

316
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,380
Okay.

317
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,780
Right. Cause I just said
yes because I saw the money.

318
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,200
So right now all my credibility,
you know,

319
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,740
beyond me being a moron is out the window
at this point because I still did the

320
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:56,360
Gig, right? So I go down
and I do the Gig and uh,

321
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,350
I got the funniest,
weirdest fucking applause break.

322
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,390
I actually had a great time and I enjoyed
afterwards I was shooting the shit

323
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,040
with a couple and they
will fucking hilarious,

324
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,810
like just their whole perspective being
in Hollywood that is so God damn liberal

325
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,430
to then perform for these oil men. And
you know they're talking about, you know,

326
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:19,880
I was making fun of him talking
about fracking and lack what

327
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,960
it works. I don't give a shit, you know,

328
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,370
poisons the water Ziploc.
I drink it

329
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,060
and they're all laughing and I made some
sort of reference to a bird covered in

330
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:38,881
oil and then I just started
doing this rednecky character.

331
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,690
Well what the fuck?
You know what a flag get out of the oil.

332
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:46,170
You dumb mother fucker dude.
Applause break.

333
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,210
I love they are going to get mad.
I was going to break in their balls.

334
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,850
They thought it was fucking hilarious.

335
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,250
And this doesn't make them any worse than
anybody else that just like everybody

336
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,150
I meet on the road,

337
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,210
they are 100% immersed in the deal that
makes them still be able to put fruit

338
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:12,450
loops on the table. So anything positive
about it, they fucking love. And, and I,

339
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,510
that's what I've found.

340
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,490
That's what I've learned to traveling
is that people love their own deal and

341
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:21,850
they think that their deal is the only
deal. And it's the only way to go.

342
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,440
And anybody who's against it is a
fucking cunt. And that includes clouds,

343
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:28,960
the most liberal fucking
people on the planet. You know,

344
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:32,140
if you listened to liberals talking about
police officers and that type of shit,

345
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:37,030
like they, they do like
reverse Fox News, you know.

346
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,510
So, so I did that Gig and, uh,

347
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,590
had a fucking great time.

348
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,550
And then I flew to Dallas the next day.
Did,

349
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,700
um, did a youtube video, made one of
those tours of the city, had a great time.

350
00:21:55,701 --> 00:22:00,170
They're fucking show was amazing.
Crowds were unbelievable.

351
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,350
It's combinations of crowds being
unbelievable. And I've done so many shows,

352
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:07,760
so I'm really on my fucking game, you
know, I'm not like going up there,

353
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:10,400
shaking the rust off,
trying to figure out what comes next.

354
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:13,670
I've just been on my fucking game and,
um,

355
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,420
okay.

356
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,150
So he, okay, wait,

357
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,300
I remember what I was talking about trying
to get to like how out of the loop I

358
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:24,220
am. So I'm driving down, it's
me versus me and Tom Lewis,

359
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,450
the guy, oh, films, all of
my, uh, tours of cities.

360
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,760
We're driving down to Austin,

361
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:35,710
Texas going down the 35 east bound
and down loaded up [inaudible] um,

362
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,760
okay.

363
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,680
And Tom, Tom's like this fucking
like, he just researches everything.

364
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,560
So we're on our way
down. He goes, he's like,

365
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:48,370
this is insane bakery cause me and dumb
Paul Versey we were just going to go to,

366
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:52,470
when I hop, you know, get
pigs in a blanket, it's just,
you know, whip cream Montes,

367
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,830
dumb shit. You could get 10 feet
from your own house, you know.

368
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,390
So he goes, no, he goes,

369
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:00,910
if you guys can just hang in
there another 10 minutes away,

370
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,670
it's this place called the check shop,

371
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,170
like checklists Vivaki and they
have these fucking insane, um,

372
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,280
breakfast foods and all this type of
shit. Right. So we go down there and, um,

373
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,740
okay,

374
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,790
I walk in there.
Okay.

375
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,650
And I can instantly tell us not a chain
or maybe there's a couple left. I Dunno.

376
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,480
Maybe it is a chain. I have no
fucking idea. I go in there.

377
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:26,481
All I know is I see a bunch of locals
sitting there standing in line blinds out

378
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:29,280
the fucking door basically and I'm like,
all right,

379
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:30,690
this is going to be some good shit.

380
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,840
And they make all like these
little like breakfast sandwiches.

381
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,710
I'm trying to find this thing
here and this is what I ordered.

382
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,020
I ordered a hot chubby with cheese

383
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,280
and I have not been able to
say that without laughing.

384
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:50,120
I snickered when I ordered it.
It was a spicy sausage and like this,

385
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,270
this honey bun with like cheese in there
and a little checks bakery and this is

386
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:04,220
what, this is what it's right in Waco
or water Texas. I'm a fucking moron.

387
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,120
I'm sitting there and I'm watching all
these people walking in there like three,

388
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:10,190
four,
five people dressed all in black,

389
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:15,040
red ribbons and I'm going and I'm
sitting there eating with Versie. Right.

390
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,350
A couple of more on sitting there.
Girl.

391
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:19,370
These people either just came
from a wedding or a funeral.

392
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm guessing it's a funeral. Look at
that. Look at misery on their face.

393
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,140
And then Tom gets in the car and he tells
us that we're literally like an eighth

394
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:29,210
of a mile from where the
fucking place exploded.

395
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,560
I've never felt so
fucking dumb in my life.

396
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:35,930
Like this is like one of the
biggest stories in the country.

397
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,840
I'm sitting here an
eighth of a mile from it.

398
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,190
People will come in from funerals for
loved ones and I'm eating a fucking spicy

399
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,420
chubby would cheese go?

400
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,320
That guy looks kind of sad.

401
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,860
My face actually turned
red from embarrassment,

402
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,740
embarrassment of my own fucking stupidity.
Um,

403
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,410
fucking horrific. There's
no, there's no really,

404
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:07,030
there's nothing funny about that story.

keep saying it. People sit down today,

431
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,440
look in the mirror and
ask yourself one question,

432
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,680
why do I keep going to the post office?

433
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,480
Why would I keep going to the post office
when I can do everything at home with

434
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,670
what bill?

ber. All righty. That was
painless and he said was,

453
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,810
well you had to listen to my reading, so
I guess you know, and I go fuck yourself.

454
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,340
Uh, let me close this out here. Yes,

455
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:20,700
I don't want to save that.
And when you download stuff like this,

456
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,230
does it slow down your computer after?
Well,

457
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,940
should I be like a racing these
reads every week? Um, all right,

458
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:31,230
let's get to some questions for
this week. Everybody. Um, dear bill,

459
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,040
really enjoy your humor in the podcast.
Well thank you very much.

460
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:35,970
That's very kind to you.

461
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,500
But please stop telling people to pay
off their homes and to not refinance when

462
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:44,310
the bank calls with the new loan vehicle
that saves them money and is a no

463
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:48,050
brainer. I am a real
estate appraiser. Oh what?

464
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,340
Of course you are you
country or in the business.

465
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,390
If these people stop refinancing,
I'll be out of a job. Oh I get it now.

466
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,120
I just turned 50 and have no other skills.

467
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,840
So unless that I can open for
you on the road. What he say.

468
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:04,740
We take it easy on this fragile economy
and keep a lid on the unemployment.

469
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,520
Thanks.
So to save your job,

470
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,260
you want me to look the other way and
tell all these people to fucking refinance

471
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,250
and even though this six,
seven years into their mortgage,

472
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:22,251
you want me to start them right back at
the beginning at payment number one for

473
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,540
30 years,
you know,

474
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:29,130
at least there with all that front end
had loaded interest started all over

475
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:33,480
again. You know, you kind
of blaming the victims here.

476
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,470
I don't understand how we all ended
up under the thumb of these bankers.

477
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,513
I could,

478
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,090
if they initially started off with a
mixed martial art training and then after

479
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:52,680
they won the championship,
they then got into banking.

480
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,870
Then I could see why everyone
would be so afraid of bankers.

481
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,970
But the fact that they're just a bunch
of pencil pushing Jack was the last time

482
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:04,080
you saw a tough banker.

483
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,600
And I'm not saying they're not out there
cause I know I'll get emails. Dude,

484
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:09,810
you see this guy down at the local branch.

485
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,280
This kid could glide pro at left fucking
tackle, but he blew out his knee.

486
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:20,560
Um, what are you actually
trying to tell me that,

487
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:24,880
that it doesn't save them money.
That's, that's the illusion of it.

488
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,140
It lowers your, your, your
mortgage payment for the month,

489
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,110
but it prolongs your interest
and in the long haul.

490
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,410
Okay.

491
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:38,410
You ended up paying way more money and
you're asking me to co sign off on like

492
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,200
years more of indentured servitude to
these banker cons. I can't do that.

493
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,490
I have ethics. I do private
shows for oil, men and bankers.

494
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,190
Listen, sir, if you could tell me, if you
can write me back. Let's, let's summit.

495
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,000
We'll make this a two pipe.
If you could write me back and tell me how

496
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,800
that's saving them money
and don't do that. Well,

497
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:04,790
they were paying two grand a month for
their mortgage and now their minimum

498
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:08,630
payment is 1700 so it's 300 off.
I want you to do, do the math,

499
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,200
go through the 30 years of it and
their interest and all that. Okay?

500
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:14,930
You're not going to be able to write me
back and say that they're saving money.

501
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:19,850
They're not. It's a fuck over and it's
a very easy fuck over to read that.

502
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:24,710
When the bank reaches out to you and says,
Hey, you want to save money? Hey listen,

503
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:28,190
we were sitting here trying to figure
out how we could make less money off of

504
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:31,040
you. It's a fuck over. All right.

505
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,230
I've already done my
filthy Dade this week.

506
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,910
Tap dancing for a bunch of
fucking oil men. You know,

507
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,110
I would've fucking my kid. What
am I supposed to do, you know?

508
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,890
Do you have I come up with some
sort of alternative fucking source

509
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,600
to help your car going?
I Dunno, whatever, sir.

510
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,990
I'm one of the biggest hypocrites you're
ever going to find. I know your deal.

511
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,120
You want people to refinance
so they could what?

512
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:59,630
Continue making their debt payments.
Listen,

513
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,730
whether I tell them to do that or not,

514
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,740
like none of the laws got changed and
the banks got these houses back to do it

515
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:10,330
all over again.
I told you that story a few weeks ago,

516
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,160
but the guy who sold me my house, he goes,
dude, you bought it the perfect time.

517
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,460
You can get like another 50 grand
for your house if you sold it today.

518
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,390
He goes to, market's exploding. And he
goes, I've never seen anything like this.

519
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,360
It's like, what are you talking about?
Even selling houses for 10 years,

520
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:27,900
you lived through the fucking
biggest bubble ever and I, you know,

521
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,920
Oh yeah. You think so? He doesn't
give a fuck. They don't give a fuck.

522
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,090
So don't fucking come at me with your
hat in your hand and talk about this

523
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:39,030
fragile economy when you know
what you're doing out there.

524
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,100
Right with your fucking
three card Monte Jesus.

525
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:47,750
That got a little fucking got a little,
a little chippy.

526
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,030
All right. Hair loss or sex loss bill,
I'm sure you've heard of Propecia.

527
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,620
Heard of it.
I used it.

528
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,730
I used it and when I ran out of it,

529
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,930
I just had that honest moment
with myself and I was just like,

530
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,670
there's no way. There's not going to be
a side effect. Okay, there's always this,

531
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,350
there's no way. There's just no way.
There's no way this thing, okay,

532
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:15,950
I'll save my hair but damage my liver.
You know,

533
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,470
what do I need more? You know, a full head
of hair or a functioning fucking liver.

534
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:25,820
You just, you know, you just got to bite
the bullet and turn it. Just turn old.

535
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,180
Just age gracefully, you know?
I try to keep my hair short.

536
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,110
I tried to offend as little people as
I go through the slow process of seeing

537
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:37,730
what my skull actually looks like.
He goes,

538
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:41,270
I have a lot of friends on it
that say it's sort of works.

539
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,170
Definitely slows down hair loss
by doing something. However,

540
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:49,910
apparently the drawbacks is no boner.
Oh,

541
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:54,200
is that, I don't know either way on that
one. That's a, that's some bar stuff.

542
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,830
I think that at that can,
that can happen to some people.

543
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,310
Yeah.

544
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,200
I have no fucking idea.
He said,

545
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:04,770
so do you choose hair to
get sex or choose no hair,

546
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,810
which might mean no sex.

547
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,080
Is this some sort of sick joke by the
pharmaceutical companies know you're,

548
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,660
you're fighting nature. Listen
Dude, I'll tell you right now.

549
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,450
All right, there's women out there
that think a shaved head is sexy.

550
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,960
Not all of them, but
there's enough. All right,

551
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,220
there's enough out there that you can
keep going up. Bang. And women, you know,

552
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,050
some women find a shaved head fucking
they lay like it turns him on.

553
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,790
So listen,

554
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:41,150
this is the great thing about women is
they could see beyond what you look like.

555
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,070
Okay?

556
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:48,290
If you come in there and you got a little
swagger and you're funny and you're

557
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:52,710
fucking, you know, shaved head shows
confidence, dude. You're like, fuck it.

558
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,180
Preemptive strike. You guys are
walking out on me. Well you know what,

559
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:00,480
I'm kicking you out the door
and you take out your clippers.

560
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,670
You know, I bust my head down a few
years ago. I fucking loved it, man.

561
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,550
I took all the jokes. When your kid's a
patient, a fucking make a wish. But bubba,

562
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,220
it Peters out after a couple of weeks,
you know,

563
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,170
I dunno, I go back and forth.
I go back and forth. I, I mean,

564
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,660
I go literally from doing,

565
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,350
maybe I'll do the fucking hair transplant
to all the way back to all fucking

566
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:27,280
shape my head again. I have no idea, but
I gotta be honest with you, dude. It,

567
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,510
it doesn't you, the vibe you're
bringing is going to be way more.

568
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,560
Listen,

569
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,410
do you really want to get with some
girl who's with you because you have a

570
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:39,180
fucking, a nice big cow lick
on top of your fucking head.

571
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,330
And if you didn't have it then she
wouldn't be with you. You know,

572
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,350
going bald is like driving
a piece of shit car.

573
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,900
It really keeps the horse away from you.

574
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,820
All these fucking idiots was full heads
of hair driving around flashy cars.

575
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,150
You see what happens to them
and what happened to Mel Gibson?

576
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,490
He should have just gone bald,
but he didn't.

577
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:05,820
He kept fighting it through and shit
up there. Drove around in a flashy car.

578
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,980
I had to give up my fucking
lacquer tickets, you know,
flipping out, flipping up.

579
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,730
You know what dude? Yeah.
Don't take those fucking drugs.

580
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:18,960
Those drugs are brand new and the side
effects that they're talking about,

581
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:22,800
I'm telling you is just the shit that
they're letting on to cover their ass is

582
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:25,410
that they said that there
was some side effects. Okay.

583
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,360
From what I've overheard bars,
the people on the FDA,

584
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,370
half of them used to work for these
pharmaceutical fucking company.

585
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:36,090
So they got the nuts running
the fucking nuthouse. All right,

586
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,860
and you're just going to be a gay,

587
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,130
you're going to be a little lab rat if
you start taking that shit. All right?

588
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:42,720
So I would suggest not doing it.

589
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,050
Let nature take its fucking
course and do what I'm doing.

590
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,100
Wait for the cure and our
guarantee at ain't going to come.

591
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,420
So just fucking man up and go bald your
fucking pussy gate. Do what I'm doing.

592
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,210
Just slowly let it happen.

593
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,990
A year from now,

594
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,630
I'm going to have fucking hair plugs
and I'm going to be performing for

595
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:07,700
dictators for New Year's
Eve, New Year's Eve. Oh,

596
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,180
it'd be best friends with Beyonce.
I didn't see my itinerary either.

597
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:13,320
I didn't know who it was.

598
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,280
I literally use the same excuse
for performing for oilman.

599
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,040
Um, anyways, loner a,
their red haired reindeer.

600
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,210
Um,

601
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,940
love everything you do and
listen to you as your, as you,

602
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:34,590
as changed my life. Oh Jesus. All right.
Now this one isn't going to be on.

603
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:39,360
Make love everything you do and listening
to you has, oh, has changed my life.

604
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,220
Sorry. That is on me. However,

605
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,330
although I am more comfortable being
myself now than I was before I listened to

606
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,850
you, I've got a dilemma. I don't know why,

607
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,590
but I don't leave a lasting
impression on people. Oh God, dude,

608
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,620
that's one of the saddest things ever.
You just said you're forgettable.

609
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,010
Hey, you know what you should do? You
should turn to a life of crime. You know,

610
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,791
don't hurt anybody.

611
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:06,060
Just going with an unloaded gun and
start robbing convenience stores, right?

612
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,330
Get the money you'd take off and
then fucking when the cops come.

613
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:11,970
Can you give us a description?
Yeah.

614
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:14,940
You know that this is a funny
thing about him. You know, he just,

615
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,700
I don't know if it's cause I was so scared
or the fact that he just was just so

616
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:24,090
forgettable. I okay. He,

617
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:27,760
I know he had an arm because he was
in a hand because he was holding a,

618
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,220
anyways, I go to a community
college and for some unknown reason,

619
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,370
my personality doesn't attract anyone.
I lost all my friends from high school,

620
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:40,300
they all moved on with their lives and
the people in my college don't notice me.

621
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,560
I'm very eccentric. Jesus Christ. Dude,

622
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:46,480
you sound like you should
be on some list here, man.

623
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,080
Please tell me that you're not going to
fucking start reading about chemicals.

624
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,600
All right?
He goes at work.

625
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:55,810
Everyone loves my crazy ass
personality and my spontaneity.

626
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,610
But these two spaces are such liars.
They always say, oh, we should hang out.

627
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:04,030
But every Monday I always hear about these
stories of them going out without me.

628
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,560
I've tried to make plans, but
they easily flake. Please, Bill,

629
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:13,360
your podcast keeps me sane and you
can only make sense of this. Um,

630
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,540
ps.

631
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,360
You know that polite fake personality
everyone has when they first meet someone.

632
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:23,980
What if a girl has that personality
only around you and no one else?

633
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,990
Is she uncomfortable with you
or likes you? Oh, Jesus. Dude,

634
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,300
Jesus.
All right.

635
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:34,763
Oh fuck.

636
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,900
How do I fucking cut?
Why do I,

637
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,650
how do I react to this fucking
atmosphere without burning up? Um,

638
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,280
listen, this is what you gotta do. Okay?

639
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:52,990
You can't give a fuck whether people
hang out with you, but not all right?

640
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:58,160
I, if I, if I had to guess, I'd say
maybe you're trying too hard. You know,

641
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,830
take a deep breath.
Just fucking relax.

642
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,400
Come in on Monday and say what's up
to people and go about your business.

643
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,810
That's what I would do. All right?
And stop trying to hang out with them,

644
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,770
you know, and take this new
fucking relaxed approach.

645
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,620
Go into a bar and just big chill.

646
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,610
Don't have a crazy ass personality
and be spontaneity spontaneous,

647
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:23,510
because I think I'm reading into that
you're trying too hard and you're freaking

648
00:40:23,511 --> 00:40:26,390
people out. Just fucking show. All right?

649
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,280
Just fucking chill out and relax. If that
girl is a fake personality around you,

650
00:40:31,281 --> 00:40:32,570
that does not mean she likes you.

651
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,790
I think you're freaking
people out a little bit.

652
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,190
I'm not trying to criticize you here.

653
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,860
I think he just trying too hard because
the fact that your friends from high

654
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:43,340
school took off from you. You might be,
you might be a little self conscious.

655
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,470
So now you're questioning who you are
and you're trying to fucking amp ramp up

656
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,300
to this energy level that
you're not normally at. So it's,

657
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:56,660
it's weird and people out. So I
would just fucking chill, you know?

658
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,600
But please do not fucking go to work
and do something crazy because there's a

659
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:05,770
lot of that shit in there that made me
fucking worried about you. All right.

660
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,220
Just fucking let me tell you. Just
like I said, that dude go and ball.

661
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:15,560
Just fucking go bald, you know, so he
makes a joke about it. Yell App. Yeah,

662
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,630
it's fucking awful.
God bless you.

663
00:41:17,631 --> 00:41:21,860
And your full head of hair
and then fucking make fun
of this shirt. There you go.

664
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,660
Um, I hope that helped
out sir. Alright. Alright.

665
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,320
Viking twins and oh, she's
viking twins in Jesus. Bill,

666
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,970
I know you're tired of
relationship advice, but this May,

667
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,590
but maybe this will be
different. Um, here's the deal.

668
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:41,090
I'm having God damn twins in
September. Wow. Congratulations.

669
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,030
Had been married for nearly six years now.

670
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,440
I love my wife and I'm definitely stoked
on having children with her. However,

671
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,090
while she's a Christian,
I am not and I am a little concerned.

672
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:54,990
Okay.

673
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,480
And then what he, what
does he write? All fucking

674
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,330
greedy. Oh, fucking ready. He wrote that.

675
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:07,440
He wrote that all as one word. Everybody.
If you think I'm dumb. And he wrote,

676
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,700
he wrote all his a l and those spaces.
Okay,

677
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,620
stop rolling your eyes feeling
that you're smarter than me. Um,

678
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,481
he says,

679
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:23,280
I'm a little concerned about what our
kids are going to learn if we decide to go

680
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:24,440
to church and whatnot.

681
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,150
I'm just not sure that I want my children
to learn about hell and sin and all

682
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:33,300
that other bullshit.
Um,

683
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,970
that's just not a story for fucking kids.
You know,

684
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:39,120
like you'll be bet you better
be good or when you fucking die,

685
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:42,630
you're going to burn for God damn
maternity. I want my kids to be happy.

686
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:45,960
I don't want them expecting a bitch
slap from some imaginary figure.

687
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,910
If they tell a fucking liar something,

688
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:52,290
kids should be innocent and full of wonder
and gay and all that shit. You know,

689
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,940
that's so funny.
I'll guys can't just write happy stuff.

690
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:01,290
You've got to somehow tap out,
you know, they should be happy.

691
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,200
They should go sledding and all that
shit. You fucking cunt. You know,

692
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:08,700
we always got to do that anyhow.
I'm not exactly sure what Nia believes,

693
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:11,340
but you guys.
But if you guys had kid,

694
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,080
would this be an issue for you to now
neither one of us goes to church. Um,

695
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,230
another well, so we're
going to go to hey yo. Um,

696
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:24,000
another problem is that either way sucks.
If they believe in how the live unfair.

697
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,100
If the little shit believe what I believe,

698
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,260
they'll think they're just
going to goddamn rotten,

699
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,780
the fucking ground and disappear
when they die. So there'll be bitter,

700
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:35,870
cynical and fucking miserable
just like their father.

701
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,470
Now I disagree with that cause I
think you just go onto the ground.

702
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:43,600
That's what I think.
But that's not why I'm bitter and cynical.

703
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:47,590
I'm bitter and cynical because of like
that fucking email that I got from that

704
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:52,591
50 year old real estate guy who wants me
to side with the bank cunts and no one

705
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:57,070
will pick up an ax and go into these
gated communities and get these pencil

706
00:43:57,071 --> 00:44:00,160
pushing pussies,
you know?

707
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,320
And every fucking week we work,

708
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,560
we got to take our fucking check and
take it down to the Goddamn Bank and give

709
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,790
it to him.
You know,

710
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,710
acting like this is a safer place to
have that stuffing in your mattress.

711
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,330
You know,
you might as well stuffing in a mattress,

712
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,140
you're never going to walk in and your
mattress is going to have a lock on it

713
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:25,070
and be like, yeah, fuck that's
closed. Go Fuck Yourself.

714
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,380
And I know what other people
saying, well, you know,

715
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,020
yeah.

716
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,490
What if somebody breaks into your house?

717
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,880
Does anybody look under
the mattress at this point?

718
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:36,570
It's such a cliched place to
put a couple hundred bucks.

719
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,740
You know, I had a fucking know you
can't win. That's why I'm cynical.

720
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,350
That's why I'm cynical.
Okay. Because you know, I,

721
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,890
I'll talk to hockey fans.
Okay.

722
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,410
And they'll have the biggest
dirt bag piece of shit,

723
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:54,920
intent to injure guy on their team.
But because he plays for them,

724
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,370
they don't give a fuck. And they'll
put them in their ring of honor.

725
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,500
And then if somebody does
something to their team,

726
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:04,080
then they're flipping out going,
that guy should be out of the league.

727
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,880
That's why I get bitter and
cynical is because it's depressing.

728
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:10,840
It's depressing that,

729
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,180
that the amount of people that just
look out their own heads and you know,

730
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:19,440
if it's good for me, then
it's fucking good and I don't
give a shit. And they, uh,

731
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:23,970
you know,
they lack empathy.

732
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,650
That's what, but now, because you're
going into the fucking ground. So I,

733
00:45:26,651 --> 00:45:29,620
I wouldn't equate it to that. Um, anyways,

734
00:45:29,621 --> 00:45:34,190
my solution thus far is just to go north,
you know?

735
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,530
No,
I don't die and fucking battle

736
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,390
Diane fucking battles sons.
And you'll get to be members of the,

737
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,920
and her, her jar. I Dunno. It's
just some Lord of the rings. Shit,

738
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,030
fight and die every day,

739
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:53,230
only to be resurrected at night
to faced with Odin and Valhalla.

740
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,760
I don't know what any of this is something
when you and your fellow goes for you

741
00:45:57,761 --> 00:46:02,440
is fight the fucking Wolf
fenrir until the end of time.

742
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,020
That's a Badass speech.
If I knew how to fucking pronounce it.

743
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,200
It's one of those things where you're
walking around with that thing on your arm

744
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:13,050
for a Falcon, the land on. And
when you go to shake hands,

745
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:16,920
you grabbed the other guy's forum. Um,
he goes, I think that's the way to go.

746
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,510
I have absolutely no idea how to really
relay these concerns to my wife without

747
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:24,840
offending her. Yeah. I mean,
considering you're writing me, I get it,

748
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,140
but I think I care enough about
my kids to make this an issue.

749
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,000
My kids are going to be complete,

750
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,150
completely mediocre and
never accomplish anything.

751
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,410
Then there's no need to heat. Oh, what?

752
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,140
My kids are going to be completely
mediocre, never accomplished anything.

753
00:46:41,141 --> 00:46:44,680
There's no need to heap hell on that pile.
What do you think?

754
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,120
All right, well I was with you until you
said your kids are going to be mediocre.

755
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:53,680
You can't say that to them.
You got to give them that head start.

756
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:56,040
You've got to build them up and seen.

757
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,110
I got and I got to talk to
you about two things. Um,

758
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:01,671
I mean, I don't know. You're,

759
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:05,050
you're really far down the fucking road
six years in and now you're having kids

760
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:07,390
to finally bring up the religious issue.

761
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,000
This is really something that should have
been discussed before you got married,

762
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:11,680
but I get it.
You fell in love with this person,

763
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,910
you can't pick who you fall
in love with as they say.

764
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,000
Um,
I,

765
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,570
I would just sit down and tell her what
you told me. And then when she was like,

766
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:30,280
well, why is you bringing this up
fixed years ago used line I just said,

767
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:35,590
just say, cause I love you saw. Yeah.
And I, I, there's nothing I could do.

768
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:39,370
I fell in love with you. I think
you're great. It, you know,

769
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:43,810
now I just want to discuss this with
you and I'd like to do it without you

770
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:48,310
crying and making me feel like
a bully because I, I, you know,

771
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:53,140
these are half my kids too.
So what if once a week, every,

772
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:54,970
every other week you
scared the shit out of him.

773
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,630
And every other week we go into the
back yard and I dig a hole and go,

774
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:00,970
that's what he ended up.
You can sort of balance it out.

775
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,233
MMM.

776
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:05,621
Yeah, do it. I don't know.

777
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:08,290
I don't know how to do it other than you
just have to sit down and talk to her

778
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,520
and just say, listen, I don't mind
spirituality. I don't mind, you know,

779
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:14,110
believing in a higher
power and everything,

780
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:18,370
but I really think it's a lot to heap on
the whole heaven and hell thing and uh,

781
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:20,290
I think when they're young enough,
when they go to church,

782
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,780
they're just going to be bored and not
know what people are talking about.

783
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,820
And I think it'd be a
great thing for their self.

784
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:29,821
Esteem's if you and I didn't drive away
and try to communicate all that hell

785
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:31,684
shit to him.

786
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,263
All right.

787
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,470
Maybe she can still take them to church,

788
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:40,770
but just keep reinforcing
that this thing loves them.

789
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,313
All right.

790
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,880
That is a fucked up thing to
just bring that into their lives.

791
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,980
You're going to burn forever.
Have Fun. Played Frisbee. Um,

792
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,570
all right. Pro Flowers. Everybody.
Mother's Day is coming up.

793
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:59,560
Ah. Who's better than your
mom? No one. All right.

794
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:03,760
Did you give your mom a hard time growing
up? Cause she did because she did.

795
00:49:03,761 --> 00:49:04,540
We like me.

796
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,720
Did you get into a fight with your brother
and went after he slapped you in the

797
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:10,540
back of the head and you grabbed the
garden hose and you tried to spray at them

798
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:14,260
through the fucking screen of the
kitchen. You flooded the kitchen, right,

799
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,020
and your mother came out with a wooden
spoon and beat it over your head until

800
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:21,400
it's snapped in half. Did you do that?
Of course she did. Isn't it time?

801
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,650
Did you take out the car and
wrap it around a pole and
then they got sued by the

802
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:29,440
family? That fucking makes the
telephone poles. Of course you did.

803
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,040
Don't you think it's time?
Something that may be a,

804
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,520
I think giving me suggestions here.
I know to make it funny.

805
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:38,861
Oh good.

806
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:43,620
He suggested is talk about how you're
making up for it by sending her profile.

807
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,190
I'm not going to talk about stuff
that's not going on in my life.

808
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:51,191
I'm going to talk about the fact that I
love my mom and I love my girlfriend so

809
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:54,680
I'm going to get them flowers.

podcast by reading this lovely email,

868
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,460
this lovely email right here called
getting cock blocked by Jesus. You know,

869
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:23,960
gee,
um,

870
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,650
that would be became walking in
performing miracles. Full head of hair,

871
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:33,660
Chris Christopherson beard. You know,
it's got that robe. All the check thought.

872
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:38,290
My God, you have anything
underneath it. Um, hate bell.

873
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:39,121
Love the podcast.

874
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:42,150
I really relate to hear your thoughts on
this experience I'm going through with

875
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:42,984
a lady.

876
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,270
Okay.

877
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:49,390
All right. At the end of last summer, I
met a girl and we hit it off immediately.

878
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,300
She's one of those girls, oh wait, I
forgot to add, I forgot to mention that a,

879
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:57,400
I'm going to do a Nia log this week and
Nia log and I in a lot of people are

880
00:53:57,401 --> 00:54:00,400
asking why is she not doing her podcast?

881
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:04,480
And it's because our house is gutted
right now and she's been an absolute

882
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:09,070
trooper and she's handling most of the
bullshit as I'm out on the road. Okay.

883
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,790
But she's going to come on and
do a Neil Ogg this weekend.

884
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:15,220
One of the topics is going to be the
first openly gay athlete. All right.

885
00:54:15,221 --> 00:54:18,530
I'm going to, I'm actually going to ask
her that question about the shower. Um,

886
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,620
shower love.

887
00:54:20,621 --> 00:54:24,410
Every now and then I get a little bit
something in or something and then or

888
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:28,520
something. Um, at the end of last summer,
back to this guy cock block by, hey Seuss.

889
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,320
I met a girl and we
hit it off immediately.

890
00:54:32,321 --> 00:54:34,690
She's one of those girls who's
not only gorgeous and sexy,

891
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:38,350
but she's really cool
too. Oh, top shelf. Uh,

892
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,570
we've got a lot in common
and I'm totally into her.

893
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:44,470
I've seen her regularly since then
and she stayed with me a few nights.

894
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,180
We've had apps.

895
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,150
We've had absolutely mind blowing
sex during those nights. Ah,

896
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,160
Jesus, dude, you're gonna fall hard for
this one. I'm already in love with her.

897
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:56,290
I don't even know her.
Uh,

898
00:54:56,291 --> 00:55:00,370
but most importantly we have fun together
and we connect on a personal level.

899
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:05,610
So I decided to take it to the next level
and see if she'd be into dating on a

900
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:08,860
wreck on the regular since we've
been hitting it off so well,

901
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:13,120
that's when it gets interesting.
She says she is a Christian.

902
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,240
I on the other hand,
am definitely not a Christian,

903
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,120
although I've studied religious
writings for many years.

904
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:23,170
I don't consider myself to be a religious
person, but since I'm not a Christian,

905
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:28,430
she's really reluctant to date.
But you'll fuck your brains out,

906
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:33,500
dude. I Dunno man. I think he, he
might just have to enjoy this one.

907
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,620
You know, it's like renting
a car. You can't afford

908
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,600
to go out and take it on the highway,
man.

909
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:44,630
Have a good time with it and bring it
back by Thursday. Um, but whatever,

910
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,493
I'll keep reading here.

911
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,770
The Bible says Christian should
only date other Christians.

912
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,240
The Bible says a lot of things that
don't make sense in society. Now. Uh,

913
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:57,050
my mother is a Catholic and my
father is non religious as I am,

914
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,780
but they've been happily
married for almost 30 years.

915
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:03,050
It irritates the hell out of me
that since I don't love Jesus,

916
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:05,450
that she thinks I'm an unsuitable partner.

917
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,890
I don't need to love Jesus to know
how to be a good gentlemen. Um,

918
00:56:09,891 --> 00:56:14,570
I treat her with respect and I'm a good
partner and a friend. What do you think,

919
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:19,250
Bill? Literally everything else about
this girl and how we get along is stellar.

920
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:24,010
It's a fucking shame to let that go.
Thanks, Bill. And Go fuck yourself. Um,

921
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,890
where's the deal?

922
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:31,600
I would present your argument and if she
still has a fucking problem with it and

923
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:33,610
she just won't do it,
then you know what you gotta do.

924
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,480
You gotta walk away until your heart
gets crushed by this girl. Or even worse,

925
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:41,410
you talk her into something by just
wearing or down into something she doesn't

926
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:42,244
want to do.

927
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,030
And then you six years into your fucking
marriage having twins like that other

928
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:48,430
poor bastard and you have
to have that other problem,

929
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,550
that big fucking conversation.
Okay.

930
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,060
She's getting older so you know
she's going to have a couple of kids,

931
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,970
she's not going to be rocky and you're
fucking world. You know what I mean?

932
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:58,900
You got a beer belly,

933
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:02,500
so all the looks and all the hot sex is
out the window and now you just fucking

934
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:04,990
with this person all right,

935
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:09,610
that you don't line up with
religiously. So that, that's,

936
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,870
that is a big one. That is a big
one. So that's what I would do.

937
00:57:13,871 --> 00:57:17,720
I would sit down and I would
present my argument to her and

938
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,650
just lay it out there. Just say, listen,

939
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,030
I really like you beyond a physical thing.

940
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,160
I like you,
you know,

941
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:30,310
and I'd bring up the thing he said about
your parents and they still get along

942
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,140
and then just say,
well look,

943
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:37,141
I don't want to get emotionally involved
with you if you can't look past the

944
00:57:37,581 --> 00:57:41,430
fact that I don't believe
in the bearded baby. Um,

945
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,480
and that's how I'd leave it.
And then,

946
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:47,750
you know what if she has a fucking
problem with that, then you walk,

947
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,510
you walk,
all right?

948
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,360
Or what you do is just hook up with
her once every fucking 10 days,

949
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,110
10 to 15 days, you hook up with
her, you fuck her brains out,

950
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,090
you have a great time, and then you
know, you, you walk away, you know,

951
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,700
so you don't get drawn in.
Like,

952
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:16,220
I dunno, be with somebody
else. It's like a,

953
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,090
the more you see him, it's like
fucking eating Doritos. You know,

954
00:58:20,091 --> 00:58:23,330
if you just take a few and you put them
on a plate and then you leave the bag in

955
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:25,130
the cupboard and you're watching a game,
you know,

956
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:28,040
you're not going to get up and
go grab the bag. All right?

957
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,300
But if fucking got the bag there,

958
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:31,680
you're going to consume the whole goddamn
thing and that's what the fuck are you

959
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:34,730
gonna do with this girl? If you keep
hanging out with her, all right,

960
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,310
you're going to consume
the whole fucking thing.

961
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,040
You're going to be totally invested with
the heart and then she's going to walk

962
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:44,390
away because you don't want to get fucking
dirty fire ash put on your forehead

963
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:45,890
every fucking February.

964
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:49,640
Then you can be crying in the fetal
position and you've got to spend fucking

965
00:58:49,641 --> 00:58:52,610
goddamn year or two of your life trying
to cry this bitch out of your heart.

966
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:56,810
You know what I mean? Sit Down and have
this conversation with the, there you go.

967
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,350
All right. Netflix documentaries. A bill.

968
00:59:00,351 --> 00:59:03,830
Just let's do the a recent podcast in
the podcast you mentioned that you like

969
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,550
documentaries. I love him.
I absolutely love them.

970
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:11,570
Documentaries are like reading
for stupid people. You know,

971
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:12,980
you get this like watching a book,

972
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,390
unless you watched those Michael Moore
ones or that one that that guy made about

973
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:20,540
Nirvana. You know what I mean? Like
what Michael Morris should be like,

974
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:23,210
considered video like op ed pieces.

975
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,123
MMM.

976
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:31,490
You know, I, I, and you can, it's easy
to tell. I hate to single that guy out,

977
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:34,640
but that guy I think is one of the biggest
offenders of somebody who's just like

978
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,880
already has his mind made up and his
editing around the opinion that he already

979
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:45,050
has and he's just, you know, taking you
by the hand and leading you down to this.

980
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:48,710
Absolutely fucking so
ridiculous to one side.

981
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:54,500
That guy to me is as ridiculous as
fucking bill O'Reilly. You know, I,

982
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:58,700
I'd actually say he's more ridiculous
that bill O'Reilly, you know what I mean?

983
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,170
Anyways, I don't like, don't like
talking politics. Here we go. Um,

984
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:09,140
now I know you say you
don't like football, soccer,
but I know you love this.

985
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:10,640
But yeah,
I know you'll love this.

986
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:15,110
It's called the four year plan and it's
about a team called Queens Park Rangers.

987
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:19,910
They had just been taken over
by a team of billionaires,

988
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,710
including big names in Formula
One. I love, by the way,
I love Formula One racing.

989
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:29,330
I never watch it. I always miss it.
I always somehow the seasons weird,

990
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:32,510
it starts in like February or some
shit. I don't know. I, I always miss it,

991
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:37,460
but formula one racing is like if
you're ever going to meet James Bond,

992
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,640
it's going to be at a
formula formula one race.

993
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:44,810
Like you're just talking the
richest people on the planet,

994
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:49,490
the greatest bone structures of any
people you're ever going to see.

995
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,700
Nothing but full heads of jet black hair
and some of the hottest ass you're ever

996
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:58,790
going to see in your life.
They're at these things.

997
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:03,300
It's insane.
And then what I love about this sport is,

998
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:08,350
is the level of intelligence to get that
car just go just a little bit faster.

999
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,980
And then it also makes sense. It's
as right and left turns, you know,

1000
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:17,030
and they race in the rain. It's re,
it's re, it's the real fucking deal.

1001
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,640
I'm a huge fan of it.
By all means.

1002
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:21,620
Somebody let me know when
the next Formula One races.

1003
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:24,230
It's not like I can't go on the
Internet and find out I had,

1004
01:01:24,231 --> 01:01:26,600
was it the fuel channel?
I know somebody shows them.

1005
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,270
I always wanted to get
that in just one year.

1006
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:33,290
Just follow it for the whole fucking year,
you know,

1007
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,480
Ferrari team and all those fucking
Mercedes and all those great car

1008
01:01:39,481 --> 01:01:41,100
manufacturers. Anyways, here we go.

1009
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:46,490
Somehow someone persuaded these Formula
One people to allow a TV crew to record

1010
01:01:46,891 --> 01:01:51,780
everything, which is basically them
owning this, uh, this soccer club.

1011
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:57,060
I'm in a nutshell. It turns out to
show exactly how not to run a club.

1012
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,530
Spoiler alert. Here we go. This document,
he may change how you see football.

1013
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:06,540
By the way, I'm from Birmingham, England,
England, and I support Aston Villa.

1014
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,640
My apologies because I know
I probably said that wrong.

1015
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:12,750
I really don't know why I've told you
this, but please watch it. It's fantastic.

1016
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,960
Oh, absolutely. I would, I would
love to watch that. I'd watch one on,

1017
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,190
on a world cup soccer.
I,

1018
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,730
I like World Cup soccer that the whole
world is watching and it really is a

1019
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:26,340
world championship when you win it,
you know,

1020
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:30,440
those fucking horns that they were
blowing. That really blew it for me. Uh,

1021
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,860
last time I remember trying to watch it,

1022
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:38,250
I was in Vegas with Tom Papa and,
uh,

1023
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:41,910
he had this show at the Orleans
and it was me and him doing this,

1024
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,650
this comedy show.
I was such a fucking great weekend.

1025
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:51,250
So I brought the lovely Nia with me and
we both went up to his suite and we were

1026
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:54,890
watching, I was actually
psyched that I found on another,

1027
01:02:54,891 --> 01:02:59,891
an American that was into the soccer and
we were sitting there watching it and

1028
01:03:00,021 --> 01:03:04,430
that stupid fucking horns
being blown the entire time.

1029
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,740
It just became, this running joke is he's
Tom started imitating, just kept going,

1030
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:11,190
crap,
I have to have that.

1031
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,800
I can't remember some sort of Jerry
Lewis kind of fucking noise and we would

1032
01:03:15,801 --> 01:03:17,630
just be trying to focus on the game.

1033
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:21,470
And every three minutes one of us would
do our impression of those horns and

1034
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:26,420
somehow it stayed funny for the
entire fucking match. And uh, but

1035
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:31,120
that really, that really hurt
the World Cup. Like those,

1036
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:34,480
those horns should be
banned. So anyways, whatever,

1037
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:37,510
whatever I'm saying I'm going to watch
that one. Did you say what it was called?

1038
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:42,670
Yeah, you did. It's called the four year
plan. I'm definitely gonna Watch that.

1039
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,180
All right. Hey, Billy boy.

1040
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,270
Just wanted to give you a couple of good
documentaries to watch on Netflix. Oh,

1041
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:52,770
look at me. I think I hit
it. I hit a nerve. I hit an
artery. People are enjoying.

1042
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:58,050
Um, just wanted to give you a couple of
good documentaries to watch on Netflix.

1043
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:03,330
I am the first one. The imposter
is a really good one. Also,

1044
01:04:03,331 --> 01:04:08,331
the wild and wonderful whites of West
Virginia is absolutely hilarious.

1045
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:12,420
You know,
I started to watch that one and

1046
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:15,890
it's really fascinating,
but that there's,

1047
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,810
there's something about watching
people who are poor at a certain point,

1048
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,180
poor and uneducated.
I have to shut it off because it,

1049
01:04:25,181 --> 01:04:29,220
it feels like a, I dunno,
it's like watching that dead.

1050
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:30,740
Here comes honey booboo.

1051
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:35,530
I started to watch an
episode of it and you know,

1052
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:38,450
it was kind of laughing along and
everything, but when they went to the,

1053
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:41,470
that auction and they were,

1054
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:46,500
they were basically auctioning off food
that grocery stores couldn't legally

1055
01:04:47,411 --> 01:04:52,240
sell. You know, it was kind of
past the expiration date or,

1056
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,980
and they would, they were bidding
on like old cookies and shit.

1057
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,790
Now there's no way they couldn't have
been meet because you could kill somebody.

1058
01:05:00,791 --> 01:05:03,160
So I know that maybe
it was something about,

1059
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,480
it was food that the grocery
stores couldn't sell.

1060
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:11,500
People so broke that they were buying,
they were bidding on week old cookies.

1061
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:13,430
Yeah.

1062
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:16,400
And then like high fiving and
excited when they won the auction.

1063
01:05:16,401 --> 01:05:20,770
Like they just bought a fucking Shelby or
something. I have to shut it off. So, uh,

1064
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,250
but it is fascinating.
Um, what the other one is,

1065
01:05:24,251 --> 01:05:26,680
he said one more is called unguarded.

1066
01:05:26,681 --> 01:05:30,160
The story of Chris Herren heroin.
I don't know how to say it. He,

1067
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:34,180
he was a bad ass high school basketball
player out of Boston who through his

1068
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,240
career, away on drugs. Um,

1069
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,050
that's another rough one to why I
liked watching the ones where people,

1070
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:44,050
they win in the end, you know,
but I'll watch that when he says,

1071
01:05:44,051 --> 01:05:47,080
love the podcast and you stand
up. Go Fuck Yourself. All right,

1072
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:52,060
that is the podcast for this
week. Everybody, uh, I hope
you enjoyed it. And, um,

1073
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,961
I have to tell you,
man,

1074
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:55,690
this was one of the most amazing
months in my standup career.

1075
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:58,450
All these beautiful venues
that I got to perform in.

1076
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:03,820
It's really a blessing to be able to
do standup at Ed at a theater. And,

1077
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:06,040
um,
I wanted to thank everybody that that is,

1078
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:09,220
that has come out to my shows this month.

1079
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:14,221
Then I really learned something this
month about all these so called B and c

1080
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:19,420
level cities like the,
they're the shit. And um,

1081
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:24,010
you know, people are so
fucking appreciative when you
come out to him, you know,

1082
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:26,350
I'm not talking like Dallas and
Austin and that type of thing.

1083
01:06:26,351 --> 01:06:30,280
I'm talking about when you go
to like Tallahassee, you know,

1084
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:34,480
it's so ridiculous. I guess last week I
kept calling to Columbia, but Charleston,

1085
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:38,290
South Carolina that I went to,
I mean that's an a level city.

1086
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,150
They'd like fucking houses with
$9 million right on the water.

1087
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:48,610
But like, just people don't go to them.
Um, we actually, I know what that,

1088
01:06:48,611 --> 01:06:52,000
I mentioned that I was going to do a
tour of Canada and we were going to do it

1089
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:56,770
in the summertime and we realized
how stupid that was. That uh,

1090
01:06:56,830 --> 01:07:01,710
you know, you know, I've done
a lot of stuff for the NHL, um,

1091
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:04,870
going on their radio show and everything
really if we really need to promote

1092
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:08,560
this thing because I haven't toured Canada
and I don't want to be in front of 40

1093
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:10,660
people every show.
So we took that tour,

1094
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:15,661
we moved it to January of 2014 during
hockey season where I can actually promote

1095
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:21,340
the thing. So I don't go
to fucking thunder bay and
stand in front of two people,

1096
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:25,870
but so that's kind of a bad thing
if you wanted me to come to Canada.

1097
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:27,880
So I apologize because I know
I said I was going to be there,

1098
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:31,940
but we are putting together
a tour of all these,

1099
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:36,280
the flyover states in
place of that in July.

1100
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:41,290
And uh, some of the dates are
going to be like Boise, Idaho.

1101
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:45,890
I know I got a date or two in Montana,
the last state I need to,

1102
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:50,260
to go to. Then I've been to all 50. Uh,

1103
01:07:50,261 --> 01:07:54,130
I remember hearing deadwood,
Kansas, I think Oklahoma,

1104
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:59,200
some places in Colorado that aren't
Denver because I always go to the comedy

1105
01:07:59,201 --> 01:07:59,531
works.

1106
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:03,760
So I'm going to try to get out there and
maybe do another bus tour and hit all

1107
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:07,690
these places that, um, that I've
never been to. And you know,

1108
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:11,380
I have people come up to me at the end of
my shows go, man. I, I drove four hours.

1109
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:13,390
I drove six hours and like these insane,

1110
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,350
I drove here from fucking Iowa and uh,
you know,

1111
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,440
so I think it's about time that I
fucking drove out to where they're at.

1112
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,350
So that's going to be happening in July.

1113
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:27,140
I'll let you guys know about the
dates as soon as they get solidified.

1114
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:28,640
And once again,
thank you to everybody came,

1115
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:33,700
this is how fucking great this toy was.
I actually, you know, I ended up in, um,

1116
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:40,380
in Kansas City at the Midland theater
and the promoters girlfriend made all

1117
01:08:41,171 --> 01:08:44,770
these cookies with my name on them.
It said,

1118
01:08:44,771 --> 01:08:46,540
the Midland theater
thanking me for coming.

1119
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:50,110
That was one of the nicest fucking
things anybody has ever done,

1120
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:54,820
um, for me. And you know, it's so
funny, I had such a fucking sweet tooth.

1121
01:08:54,821 --> 01:08:57,160
She made like 20 of them.
I took them all home.

1122
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,990
It's stuck him in my luggage and a,
some of them broke,

1123
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:05,640
but I was such a sweet tooth.
I put them in this fucking Tupperware,

1124
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:08,590
even poured the crumbs in there. So, uh,

1125
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:12,730
my battle for it of not being old Billy
fat face, I'm fucking losing it. But uh,

1126
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:15,940
so, and as much as I appreciated
that please somebody else,

1127
01:09:15,941 --> 01:09:19,090
don't do it to me because I'll become a
tub of shit if somebody gives me cookies

1128
01:09:19,091 --> 01:09:21,220
after every fucking show cause I'll,
I'll eat all of them.

1129
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,990
It's an embarrassing weakness
that I have. Um, all right,

1130
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:28,620
that's the podcast for this week. Um,
for people who want to get into the NHL,

1131
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,190
the NHL playoffs start tomorrow,

1132
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:35,190
I believe April 30th.
And I'm going to fucking,

1133
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,150
I'm ride or die with my Bruins and I'm
hoping just something because it's the

1134
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:43,610
playoffs that they can somehow put
together three good periods. Uh,

1135
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:47,540
I don't give a fuck. I'll always watch
him. I love him. Go Fuck Yourself.

1136
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:50,140
That's the podcast. I'll
see you next week. There.
