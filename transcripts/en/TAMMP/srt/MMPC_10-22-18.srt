00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,070

00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:26,250

Hanukkah and Christmas. Right?

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,140
Halloween and Thanksgiving are
the fucking Joey bishop. And uh,

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,230
what was the other guy's name was,

10
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:37,320
what was the other guy that was in
the rat pack rule? Said Rod Laver

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,630
something. Crawford. I Dunno what the
fuck his name was. Cindy Crawford.

12
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:48,631
Cindy serum isn't a greater Cindy's
back on TV telling these old broads,

13
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,650
if they get to fog the fucking
serum and they don't have her,

14
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,060
a genetic is still somehow
going to look younger.

15
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,063
You know,

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,840
Miss, she honestly looks
like she's like fucking 30.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,730
I'm going to get some Cindy's therom.
My hair is going to come back.

18
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:13,050
It's going to be all way B.
I'm going to get a fucking contract.

19
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:18,051
Was Chanel my stupid phone keeps
saying update apple ID settings.

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,410
It's not as stupid phone. I
apologize. Excuse me. I misspoke.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,480
It's not a stupid phone. It's a smart
phone. Oh it's so fucking smart.

22
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:28,710
Every two seconds,
you know,

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,490
to diva up to update apple ID settings.

24
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,180
Some account services will not be
available until you sign in again.

25
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,200
So I keep signing in and there's some
sort of fucking code is supposed to send

26
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:43,590
me and I think I deleted it cause I
just saw some bullshit from Verizon.

27
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,090
You know like do you want to,
do you want to pay your bill online?

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,240
Okay.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,830
You know what she optioned up to fucking
submit your DNA if you'd like with your

30
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:59,831
fingerprint so we can pass that on
to some fucking Russian mobster.

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,550
Okay.

32
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,550
Who is then going to buy a penthouse in
it and in fucking New York City for nine

33
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,880
zillion dollars and nobody's
going to give a shit.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,620
Okay.

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,480
I want to, I want to
know why. Why? All right.

36
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,150
If I go to sit here supporting the tropes,

37
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,850
being American and all of that shit,

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,350
why these rich cons in this fucking
country can then turn around and sell real

39
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:30,100
estate to people that live in
countries that we have problems with.

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,193
Okay.

41
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,330
I don't want to get all 80 stand up here,
but what's the deal?

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,910
Day to day would fucking,
I swear to God,

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,250
if one of these jungle
gym fucking training,

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,080
Isis guys could somehow scraped together
fucking nine zillion dollars to buy a

45
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,480
fucking townhouse in Manhattan,
they'd sell it to them.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,310
Okay.

47
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,150
No to have a fucking problem.
No one.

48
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:58,661
Well,

49
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:02,170
maybe would have a problem then and we
have fucking goal rate will go away real

50
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:07,020
quick. All right. You tell
him I go to New York City,

51
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,330
which I was just there.
I had a wonderful time.

52
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,210
I saw this fucking dude from Russia.

53
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:16,350
He bought three townhouses
on the upper east,

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,370
upper west side. Fucking things go
for like 2030 30 million of whack.

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,760
The fucking guy buys three side by side
is gutting all of them to tournament to

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,210
the biggest fucking
apartment in Manhattan.

57
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,040
Okay.

58
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,580
Here's the kicker. He, he
bought it for his ex wife.

59
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,190
My first thought was what killed
Jesus Christ set out. I shut her up.

60
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,440
Yeah.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,950
Then are they get them at least
through fucking, you know,

62
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,010
Halloween and Thanksgiving before the
holiday season really fucking kicks in.

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,230
You spend all your, do you know, you know
what's funny about that? Fucking broad.

64
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,550
She probably still wants
something for Christmas too.

65
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,190
I'm trying to help you.
I can't fucking do a Russian accent,

66
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,820
but I can't imagine what the fucking,
you know good.

67
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:09,400
And God damn well if he doesn't go out
and get us some big shiny stupid fucking,

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,220
I mean,
how much of a fucking headache?

69
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,670
Well, she, this is ex wife. He
went out and bought her that.

70
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,263
Yeah.

71
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,080
I mean if I was just account, I'd be like,
he's still fucking banging or, I mean,

72
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:27,440
what's going on here? What do
we don't get ghetto. Get a one.

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,660
Boris,
what do you define a fucking tree?

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,370
Um,
yeah,

75
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,970
and I guess he doesn't get audited
because he saw him, I don't know.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,070
It's a whole fucking thing is weird.
And then you'll see like, you know,

77
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:47,240
it'd be like some giant Goddamn building
and they'll be like the top fucking

78
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:51,600
nine floors for a cool $170 million.

79
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,060
Did we say cool

80
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,240
was sold to some fucking
person on mainland China.

81
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,820
Okay.

82
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,300
All these people. Okay. Janie's right.
You know what they're doing right?

83
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,520
That they're putting like dip,
doing something with the toys.

84
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,690
I forget what it was. Somebody told
me this one night in a bar, uh,

85
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,770
the guy was whispering,
he had one eyebrow, but he
really seemed to make sense.

86
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,600
They're doing some of the toys. Russia
is fucking with the elections, right?

87
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,830
Isn't that what I'm supposed to know?

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,330
We're supposed to say you're supposed
to repeat now that I'm in Hollywood.

89
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,270
I don't know. I don't even know
what the fuck I'm talking about.

90
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:34,790
All I know is it's very early in the
morning and I'm getting my podcast done

91
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,910
here before my,
uh,

92
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,610
my little cutie pie wakes up and I was
supposed to do it last night, but, um,

93
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,590
we ended up going out, went
out to breakfast, you know,
I hadn't seen it forever.

94
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:49,500
Right. And I was away from the family for
nine days. So we went out to breakfast

95
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,120
and,
uh,

96
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,710
when she came home for a nap and then
afterwards we went to this pumpkin patch

97
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,550
and it just fucking me
out, you know? I mean,

98
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,370
I could've come on and done a podcast,
but I wouldn't have been as funny.

99
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,730
Okay.

100
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,563
You know,

101
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,540
I wouldn't have been able to give you
all that vital information you need to

102
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:11,180
know about the country of
Russia and China. I mean, all
of that stuff was dead on.

103
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,250
You can go fact jacket@bill.com.

104
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,210
I've got all the facts to
fucking to back it up, right?

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,210
Um, I'm only kidding. Um,

106
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,430
if you're from Russia and you're from
China and you'd like to take your dirty

107
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,620
blood money and spread it around
here, then by all means, by all means.

108
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,390
Let's have after, after all this
suspicion about the last election,

109
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,940
let's have somebody from Russia
by three fucking townhouses,

110
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,470
right in the God damn.

111
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,830
Okay.

112
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,820
Fucking Manhattan. Why
don't, why don't we do that?

113
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,260
Why don't we have a fucking
commercial late at night? Okay.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,770
That has a fucking knife, sharp and
a thing that's so God damn sharp.

115
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,910
Evidently you can sharpen a credit card
with it and cut a fucking pineapple and

116
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:55,420
half.

117
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,400
Why don't we fucking do that and ignore
our goddamn recent history and just have

118
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,100
that out on the market.
And then this on a red flag,

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,610
have something out there that can take
a fucking butter knife and have it go

120
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:12,040
through for a frozen fucking steak.

121
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,340
The commercial that
literally showing the thing,

122
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,190
I almost feel like fucking irresponsible
putting this information out on

123
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,200
sharpening a credit card.
Okay.

124
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,120
Then it looks slices of,
I dunno what it was,

125
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,500
went through a fucking shoe.
I love the thing that's just like,

126
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,270
we took this cerated fucking knife and
we fucking went across concrete and then

127
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:41,270
we stuck it in this fucking thing and
now you can cut your postman's fucking

128
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:44,570
shoe off with his foot still in it.

129
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,950
Once again,
I don't want to do 80 stand up here,

130
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:53,040
but how sharp is the fucking type data?

131
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,030
I was watching that commercial last night
with the lovely Nia and we were just

132
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,410
laughing our asses off.

133
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,030
Yeah,

134
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,240
going, I, I wouldn't want that in
my house. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be,

135
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,840
I wouldn't feel safe
with me fucking happen.

136
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,300
A knife that I cut the
fucking tip of my finger off.

137
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,710
God knows what some other lunatic,
okay.

138
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:20,110
No civilian needs a
knife that fucking sharp,

139
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,710
even though it's fucking a Dyson
concert and one of those cooking shows,

140
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,160
you know,

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,620
I just wondered if that fucking guy from
hell's kitchen ever realized how sharp

142
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:33,890
the fucking knives are of the people
that he's screaming and yelling at.

143
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,263
You know.

144
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,010
And I worked in enough fucking restaurants
being one when I was growing up to

145
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:43,760
realize that people who work in the
kitchen for the most part are not the most

146
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:48,120
stable fucking people,
fucking lunatics.

147
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,870
I used to work in this fucking restaurant.
One of the guys was on work release,

148
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,240
meaning at night he went back to jail.

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,180
He voices it dices you
can rob a bank with it.

150
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,340
Um, anyways, I'm so fucking happy to, uh,

151
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,330
I'm an old man now. People,
I can't, I can't go on the
road for that long, you know?

152
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,610
And now that I've took the time to build
a personal laugh and have something to

153
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:20,840
come home to, you know what I mean?
I miss all the varmints run around.

154
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:25,841
I'm a property taken out in slingshot
killing something before breakfast.

155
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,290
You know, it's one of my favorite things
to do. Go out in nature, breathe it in.

156
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,680
Feel the peace and Fuckin kill some skin.

157
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,740
It look around making sure
no other predators coming
around won't steal my Keel.

158
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm in one time.

159
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:48,370
I sell this beautiful family of
squirrels right outside Mama.

160
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,610
Breck get my breakfast and milk.

161
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,940
Some are carved out without a permit

162
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,200
and a load bearing wall with
eight nobody to know that, right?

163
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:05,201
And I saw sue family squirrels and the
mother was handed a little baby a score,

164
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:08,510
a little fucking nut.
And right before it handed it to her,

165
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,370
I blew that thing's fucking brains out.

166
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,020
Made me feel like an American
mean. A little fucker was
coming down and you know,

167
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:20,230
I have a little bird feeder and they would
know enough that feeds for the birds.

168
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,830
All right? And I don't want to hear
nothing about no god. Damn Squirrel.

169
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:28,150
Ain't no fucking ain't fucking smart
enough to realize that bird food is bird

170
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:32,050
food and, and squirrel fruit is
squirrel food. And just reminded me,

171
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,120
you know, we're not sell that bird. I'm
not in me to ask this. And I was like,

172
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,130
what is this little beady and
motherfucker doing in, in the bird feed?

173
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,840
And I killed it in front of it's baby
squirrel to send a message to the other

174
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:53,410
squirrels. Sorry. Um, anyways.

175
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:56,530
Did Anybody Watch any, uh, what do, what
do, what do I want to talk about first?

176
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:00,800
You want to talk Formula One
racing Ui while you wait,

177
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,030
why won't you want to talk fucking f?
F1 You know what considering,

178
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,740
and it's always a weird call right now.

179
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,650
I just talked about killing
varmints in your fucking backyard,

180
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,180
which is very American, very
patriotic. Borderline a holiday,

181
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,403
right?

182
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,400
But I also talked about a Russian
and Chinese people buying fucking,

183
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,750
you know, top level fucking,
uh, real estate. Jesus. Bill.

184
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:29,440
Can he get it out once they bought
in America? All right, let, let's go.

185
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:32,890
F One f one oh Lewis Hamilton,

186
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,010
Louis the finger pointer Hamilton,

187
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,300
one of the great drivers of all time,
but oh,

188
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:45,080
does that guy liked to fucking point
fingers when he doesn't win a race?

189
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,340
Oh my God. He always goes, you know,
I don't know what happened. You know,

190
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,710
I don't really understand
what the strategy was there.

191
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,600
I'll have to find out about that.
But you know, racing is tough.

192
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:55,830
Okay.

193
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,300
He always does that.

194
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,080
Maybe that's why he's great.
It was a really, really,

195
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:07,950
really fucking exciting race. Lewis
Hamilton had the poll. All right,

196
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,650
the fucking race starts. Kimi
Raikkonen said, you know what?

197
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,130
I know I have more than a race since 2015
I think today's a good fucking day to

198
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,470
try to win one. And he comes to,
I don't even know what you know,

199
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:19,720
cause I didn't see any of the qualifying.
I fast forward through all the,

200
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,180
the grid lineups and shit.

201
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,110
I thought it was battle at first and
when I saw fucking Vettel spinout Yo,

202
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,440
I love about Vettel
federal and Kimmy raking.

203
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,700
I listen to a lot of guys
who drive emotionally. Yeah.

204
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Sebastian Vettel was driving the way I
drive in fucking rush hour traffic ends

205
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:44,820
up spinning out, fucking up his car and
he just, you know, he doesn't wave and go,

206
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:47,310
I'm sorry. Just slams on
the gas. Like he's fucking,

207
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:49,750
Burt Reynolds spins the car
around and keeps driving. Yeah.

208
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,490
Okay.

209
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,450
Okay. The guy managed to get all the way
back up to the front of the field to the

210
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,910
point that Lewis Hamilton needed to come.
And second,

211
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,700
if he was going to win yet
another championship and you know,

212
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:03,300
its Lewis Hamilton just because,
you know, it's not like,

213
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:06,490
I don't fucking respect the
guy, but I, you know, I'm
new to this sport. One of my,

214
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:10,030
I'm gonna just gonna become
a Lewis Hamilton fan. Um,

215
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm just going to start
watching college football.

216
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:15,840
And who's your favorite team on Alabama?
I'm a fucking doing that.

217
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,830
I'm going to refill it. You, um,

218
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,770
yeah you gotta go.
Contrarion so anyways, uh,

219
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,080
he had a chance everybody,
I think he fucking, yeah,

220
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:33,270
he pitted early,
like really early,

221
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:37,380
like on lap 12 of 56. I'm taking,
what the fuck is he doing?

222
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,560
There's no matter what he does,
those tires are gonna wear out.

223
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,810
So now he's in first place.

224
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,280
He's driving like a lunatic
because he's trying to get, guess,

225
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,840
get enough fucking space.
Um,

226
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,850
between him and everybody else,

227
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:55,970
specifically Sebastian Vettel because
if we basically, I don't know,

228
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,050
I don't know how many fucking points
he needed. I'm new to the sport,

229
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,420
but he basically could have
won the championship that day.

230
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,450
Okay.

231
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,690
So he's driving like a lunatic
wild trying to conserve as tires,

232
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,910
which never fucking works.
Right.

233
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,170
That's like staying in a relationship
because you know, you've got great sex,

234
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:16,410
but there's no love there.
Eventually. Yeah, you got to fucking,

235
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:19,320
you got to pull off. Just be
like, why, what are we doing here?

236
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,390
So it was fucking tars end up,
you know,

237
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:24,510
start blistering like
my shoulders in the sun.

238
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,040
They're like my ginger
freckled shoulders in the sun.

239
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,740
So any poles in.

240
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,460
And then the big thing is like fucking
Kenny get out of the pitch before battle

241
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:39,480
comes around so he can be in front of
them and he's got botox in front of them.

242
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,220
Valtteri Botox.
Right.

243
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,850
And you know Valtteri he's going to
fucking do whatever Louis wants him to do

244
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:48,390
because evidently he's the fucking
gimp on the Mercedes team. I mean,

245
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:53,070
that guy's given away literally a victory
this year to keep fucking Louis happy.

246
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,080
And Lewis is still walking
around going, yeah, you know,

247
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,720
I don't know what happened. They, what
do you mean? You know what happened?

248
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,680
What happened there is everybody's
catering to your fucking needs. Sorry.

249
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,590
You're gonna have to wait another week
before you win the fucking championship.

250
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,950
Okay.

251
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,390
Jesus fucking Christ.

252
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,750
Okay.

253
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,460
Somebody get this guy some sparkly fucking
Kleenex over here. Right. So anyways,

254
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,150
he gets out of the pit before Vatal does.
It's so fucking exciting.

255
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,070
My wife's going like, wow, this is
really interesting. It's amazing.

256
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:25,050
I can't get her to get into football.

257
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,990
Probably cause again hit
each other anymore. Right.

258
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:30,970
But I think I might've got her into motor
sports. I said, come on. Yeah, I go,

259
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,160
this is fucking international.

260
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,660
Okay.

261
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,620
And we went with this. They have a race
in Monaco. People pull up in yachts.

262
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,720
Okay. Did, does human trafficking going
on in the bay is the cars are going by.

263
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,630
And of course this gets your
excited cause all she's seen,

264
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,690
you know what she likes, she liked with
Lewis Hamilton, got out of the car.

265
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:52,950
She goes, wow, he's really
into jewelry. You know, I had
her, I had her right there.

266
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,800
It's going to cost me a bunch
of fucking money. So anyways,

267
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,510
uh,
Max,

268
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,670
Max Verstappen whenever Lewis and starts
working his way up to the fucking field.

269
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,860
By the way, Daniel Card has fucking
nightmare of a season continues.

270
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,260
He's driving around,
he's having a great fucking time.

271
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:16,490
All of a sudden his car quits like
a fucking Prius in the left lane.

272
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,383
Remember that rumor?

273
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,810
The thing just fucking dies and he pulls
over and now he's just getting you to

274
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:26,630
see mom, we were driving for
fucking Renaud. Yes, next year.

275
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,290
Can anybody explain to me why that
guy isn't going to be driving for a

276
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,790
okay

277
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,110
for Ferrari next year?

278
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,830
Cause they were trying to suggest that
maybe Kimi Raikkonen it's not going to be,

279
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,590
I can't fucking believe how much
I might know about this sport.

280
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,870
I love it anyways,
so they get down to the final five laps.

281
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,970
Lewis Hamilton needs to pass Max
Verstappen the does that 11 enough,

282
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,740
you know, gap between him as far as like,
uh, you know, I think at that would've,

283
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,090
that'll come and forth maybe,

284
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,510
but with the points he would
have enough points to win

285
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,010
and you got to give it to veteran Ferrari.
They're fighting to the very end.

286
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,570
They're like, fuck these
fucking assholes. We're Ferrari.

287
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,280
All right. That's what everybody fucking
wants. They want a god Damn Ferrari.

288
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,600
And maybe if you're a little bit younger,
you want a Lamborghini. Okay. But really,

289
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,410
if you really look throughout history,

290
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:31,580
elegant styling power,
all of that,

291
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,740
you got to give it to Ferrari.
You just have to,

292
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,570
every kid had a fucking post magnum
Pi. Did he drive a Mercedes? No,

293
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:42,170
we did not.
He drove a Ferrari.

294
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,050
Okay.

295
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,883
Okay.

296
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,253
Okay.

297
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,230
People out there who got the first
hair plugs. Did they buy a Mercedes?

298
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,290
No, they did not. They bought a Ferrari.
I don't want, I'm talking about here. Um,

299
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,200
anyways, all I know is when you
go to those meek and fucking,

300
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:01,870
you watch those Mika car auctions,

301
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,480
it's not even like for
like actually Mercedes, uh,

302
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,460
vintage Mercedes and Ferraris there.
Then I even at that thing there, right.

303
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:16,110
That thing that Jay Leno goes to on
that golf course up by fucking, uh,

304
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,930
where the hell, I mean
that, that's like debts.

305
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,931
Like people know every nut and bolt on
the fucking car or they have enough money

306
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:28,560
to buy their ex wife fucking three
God damn townhouses stuck together in

307
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:33,480
Manhattan. Ex Wife, right? Pebble beach.

308
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,650
I mean those cars are so fucking nice,
so goddamn expensive.

309
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,000
They drive them onto the golf
course at pebble beach. You know,

310
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:47,300
like you go into the fucking Rosebowl.
Um,

311
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,910
so they, they, anyways, for,
I had a huge day. I feel, you
know, Kimmy raking in one,

312
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:56,180
his first, first, uh, since 2015,

313
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,720
Sebastian Vettel showing the
heart of a fucking line, you know,

314
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,330
you're going to have to fucking kill me
if you want to win this championship.

315
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,950
And uh,
I don't know,

316
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:10,920
I'd probably add the best
thing was watching Louis
Hamilton trying to pass past

317
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:15,830
max for staffing and Max for stamps and
holding them off. Right. For some reason,

318
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:20,270
by the way, ESPN get out of the
fucking car when that's going on.

319
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,370
You know, I, I, what the
fuck am I looking at here?

320
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,680
I'm in the garden or playing a video game.

321
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,670
How can I tell how close they are if I'm
fucking sitting in the God damn car and

322
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:38,620
I can't look in the side view mirrors,
they did it on the replay too. Anyways,

323
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:41,680
but I also love that Lewis Hamilton,
like how we had to make sure that like,

324
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,160
I gotta make sure this guy
does his fucking spin me out,
you know, hitting my car,

325
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,390
then I'll be fucked.

326
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,600
So it was this weird thing where he had
to be like super aggressive but also

327
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,520
cautious.
It was really exciting.

328
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,470
I know a lot of you guys
fast forward to any of that,

329
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,670
but I'm so fucking sold on
that sport. Um, I love it.

330
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:01,250
And I missed the fucking, I don't know
if there was a moto GP thing about,

331
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,070
what is it? Mark? Mark has his fucking,
he's running away with the thing. Um,

332
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,520
but it's still some of the best
racing. And next, next April,

333
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:14,200
I got to carve out some time. I want
to go to that Moto GP race in Austin.

334
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,920
But anyways, let's plow
ahead here everybody. Um,

335
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,890
okay.

336
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,400
So next thing I wanted to talk about,
oh, well we'll talk about football here.

337
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,950
So yesterday, the only
game I really watched, um,

338
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,830
was the, uh, the Patriots
versus the bears because, uh,

339
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,380
I only got so much time in
my day now and um, you know,

340
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,190
I had to make up for that time.
I was away and my,

341
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,150
my wife didn't tell me when I was on
the road was saying to my daughter when

342
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,330
she's at that age, she was actually
missing me. Like walking around,

343
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:49,920
it's going that, that I wasn't
there, fucking broke my heart. So,

344
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,720
um, anyways, I dunno.

345
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,250
So I gotta I gotta Work
Smarter is what I've learnt.

346
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,150
So I was just like, all right, this
is football Sunday, I'm finally home.

347
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,520
So what I did was I went out to breakfast
to my lovely wife, my beautiful child,

348
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,350
and I just tape the
Patriots game. And when, um,

349
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,100
my daughter took a nap, I I fucking
watched the bears patriots game,

350
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,531
you know,

351
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:24,100
it took me like maybe like an hour and
15 minutes to watch it because I had the

352
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:28,720
whole thing recorded up until like
the final five minutes. And uh,

353
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,170
here's what I would do if I
was the offensive coordinator
of the fucking bears.

354
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,520
All right. That mixture bisky I don't
know if I said his name right. All right.

355
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:41,970
Very mobile quarterback and all of that.
But at this point in his career,

356
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,330
anything beyond 17 yards as
far as if it's like a pass,

357
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,270
he sees not accurate at all. They haven't
said that. I remember Tom Brady is this.

358
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,630
Secondly, the second year after he won
the super bowl is deep ball was not good.

359
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,810
Okay?
I'm not saying it was Mitch Dubiski bad.

360
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm just saying you can get better at it.
The guy can fucking throw it. 60 yards.

361
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,180
As we saw in the last play of the game,

362
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,690
he's just got to make sure that there's
somebody underneath it with the same

363
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:07,524
Jersey says.

364
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,470
So I didn't understand why didn't they
just dinking dumped their way down the

365
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:14,480
field, had that Cohen kid or
whatever coming out of the backfield.

366
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,840
He was killing us all day,

367
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,800
but they kept trying to throw like a 20
yard fucking pass and like I gotta be

368
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:22,320
honest with you.
I mean really it wasn't even close.

369
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,000
Should a dentin dunk their way down
the field and occasionally just send

370
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:27,840
somebody deep,

371
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,400
Have Mitch air the fucking thing out
just to keep everybody honest. All right.

372
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,750
And then you can utilize his eyes
running an ability because we grew really

373
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,990
couldn't stop the guy.
I'll tell you what was annoying,

374
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,530
but I really hate is when a quarterback
acts like they're going out of bounds

375
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:46,140
and everybody pulls up and then
the guy gets another 20 yards.

376
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,860
I think on the next fucking play you
ought to be able to like the guy up.

377
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,790
Alright?

378
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,260
It's a country fucking move
and everybody's slow eyes
like he's Barry Sanders.

379
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,720
Yeah, no it isn't. It isn't. Um,

380
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,300
okay.

381
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,960
But um,

382
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,960
one thing I will say if haven't sat
here and watched the ridiculous level of

383
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:11,560
celebrating that goes on in baseball now
and in football, especially in baseball,

384
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:13,060
like, dude, I don't fucking get it.

385
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,860
These guys had doubles and they're
doing synchronized celebrating with the

386
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:21,610
people in the dugout and back in the day,
you never did that shit.

387
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,500
If you fucking did that, your buddy who's
bad. Next we'll be looking at you like,

388
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,950
are you out of your fucking mind?
And then he'd take one of the head,

389
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,580
the pitcher just through it, the next
pattern and it was just acceptable.

390
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,970
Now you've got these guys, they're
going up there. They got the face guard,

391
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,430
they got the elbow pad,
they got the Shin Guard,

392
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,530
they're hanging all
over the fucking plate.

393
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,980
I would just love to hear what
like Nolan Ryan would say about

394
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,101
about that,

395
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:51,460
and then there's celebrate and they
hit a single and they're doing little

396
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:56,410
fucking jazz hands. People that dug
out at that point at each other.

397
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,840
They're fucking thumping that chest.

398
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,610
You need think they just won the game.
That's what kills me.

399
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,180
Like who's that guy on
on the fucking patriots?

400
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,220
I don't know anybody's name
anymore. I got a kid, right?

401
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,480
The fucking guy catches
the football on a kickoff.

402
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,760
I Dunno what it was. They're like scores
like 10 to three Isam, shit like that.

403
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:23,320
Seven to three, I can't remember. He
runs up to about the 15 yard line,

404
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,480
gets fucking drilled, coughs it up,
and that other bears fit player,

405
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:28,841
by the way,

406
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:33,841
just fucking Johnny on the spot just
catches the ball and he gives them like he

407
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,120
coughs it up,

408
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,710
bears get the ball and like the 15
yard line going and fucking score.

409
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,550
All right. Absolutely, totally fucked up

410
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,790
as the kick returner and then either the
next character, a couple of kicks later,

411
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,300
same guy catches the ball,
he runs down the field,

412
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,160
goes all the way for a touchdown,

413
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,870
slows down and like the eight yard line
to high five another fucking Patriot

414
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,860
before he goes over. The goal line
is slow as humanly fucking possible.

415
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,730
He's sitting there high five and like
he's up in that game. It's like, dude,

416
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,110
that just made you even,

417
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,570
you need to run another one back
and run into the fucking end zone.

418
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,460
I don't know if they turned, they drive
me. He's got world class speed. Yeah,

419
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:26,890
we'll tell him to fucking
stand on his head.

420
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,490
Maybe some of that world class speed
will trickle down into his fucking

421
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:31,324
brainstem.

422
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,070
That's like when fucking a tripit ski was
running all over the fucking field and

423
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:42,060
then we finally to sack him and one of
the Patriots does the shush thing to the

424
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:45,570
crowd, like he's been doing it all day.
That reminds me way back in the day,

425
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:50,530
Jerome Bettis was the king of that.
Granted he's a fucking hall of Famer,

426
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:51,630
so I'm probably wrong on this,

427
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:55,770
but I would watch that guy and he
would live like 30 yards on 20 carries.

428
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,140
And then in like the fucking
beginning of the fourth quarter,

429
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,160
he'd finally ripped one off for 30 yards
and then he'd get up and start fucking

430
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:06,490
stopping around. Like you've been
doing it all day. I guess it's,

431
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:11,340
it's just a, I think it's like
a generation gap type of thing.

432
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,490
I've always liked the guys.
They'd score a touchdown,

433
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,290
they give the ball back to the referee.
You know,

434
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,930
I just feel like everybody
now is aware that, um,

435
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,210
if you make a good play,
it's going to end up on Instagram.

436
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:34,230
So you gotta you gotta throw a little
more fucking mustard on it and then maybe

437
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:37,020
everybody will forget about the,
the rest of the fucking game.

438
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,570
I have no idea. Anyways,
plowing ahead here. Um,

439
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,000
okay.

440
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,520
What do I got here? I'm trying to
look for the fucking advertising here.

441
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,490
All right. Oh, Jesus Christ. I didn't,

442
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,230
or the Kate Upton thing that
I got was fucking hilarious.

443
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,920
I didn't realize she was married
to, what's his face on the,

444
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,230
on the Houston Astros. Um,
anyways, my bookie, everybody,

445
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,850
my bookie,
sure watching football is fun,

446
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,930
but it's more entertaining when you
have some action on the games. Guys,

447
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:18,560
you heard me talking about this for

you're an expert or a rookie,

451
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:32,570
the numbers on roulette,
you can create a big par lake.

452
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,400
I don't know why they use that roulette.

453
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:35,960
Okay.

454
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,640
Analogy.

455
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:40,670

your brain roulette. Is that right?

all three, could turn $100 into $600.

What else did I want to talk about?

542
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:52,970
Looking at the notes on my phone.
Did I already lose it over here?

Oh, there it is. There
it is. There it is. Um,

544
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,130
so anyway, so I got to
tell you. So I took,

545
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:06,080
we took our daughter to a pumpkin patch
yesterday, which, you know, that's,

546
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:09,740
that's a big mom,
dad moment for you.

547
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,360
First Time you take your kid to a
pumpkin patch, right? So my wife's going,

548
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,930
she goes, uh, when do you want
to take it? You want to take her?

549
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,490
Sorry. Before her nap or after I go a
pumpkin patch seems more like a fall,

550
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,490
you know, afternoon type of things does.
She goes, all right, we'll do it after.

551
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,530
So anyways, we had gone to breakfast
in the morning and then we, uh,

552
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,560
we went to a would, she takes her
naps and now we're going to go.

553
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,920
So we ended up going to this
really nice part of town

554
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,310
out here in la. I don't want to
out this fucking thing. All right?

555
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,630
They say it's a pumpkin patch. Okay,
now I know I live in a fucking city,

556
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,340
but at the very least,
you know,

557
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,700
just try to fuck and recreate
some of sort of patch.

558

We show up to the God damn thing.

559
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,310
It's in the parking lot of a fucking cvs.

560

was like this size of chief in one flew

564
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:24,140
over the cuckoo's nest screaming at
everybody that they had to keep this area

565
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:26,150
clear.
It's clear a what?

because they do the holidays right.

574
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,960
You know, they're just sitting there
like, you know, this isn't the fucking,

575
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,540
this is not a pumpkin patch,
but I will tell you this,

576
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,650
they had some of the best pumpkin's
I've ever fucking seen the Pumpkin's,

577
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,480
we're fucking ridiculous.

578
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,810
They were the kind of Pumpkin that
if there was a cookbook about shit,

579
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:11,870
you can make out a pumpkin.

580
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,780
These were the pump because
they would make the cover.

581
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,380
These were the sports illustrated
swimsuit models of fucking pumpkin.

582
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,420
So it wasn't all bad.
All right.

583
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,940
And that like six foot five woman yelling
and everybody was fucking hilarious

584
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,370
cause she was getting frustrated but
still trying to be nice, you know?

585
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,860
And she's into this fucking tent of God.

586
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:34,960
Damn head is almost touching
the top of the tent.

587
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,860
There was so much and I
didn't have any fucking money.

588
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,060
And somehow in there they had a little
ATM machine and I'm sticking my fucking

589
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:45,690
credit, my ATM card,
and they're going like,

590
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,940
there's no way this isn't
getting double swiped.

591
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,020
There's no way some Russian baron isn't
gonna try to fucking buys. I Dunno.

592
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,690
Oh fuck it.

593
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,260
Pen and pencil set for his ex wife with
whatever the fuck I have on my God damn

594
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:03,180
accountant account. So anyways, she
pulls the ripcord, she goes, no, no, no,

595
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:06,320
no, we're going to go to this
other one. So I'm like right,

596
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,840
no problem. Cause this is the new me.
I don't fight this shit. All right,

597
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,490
I've just decided I'm going to be a better
fucking husband and I'm just going to

598
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:18,360
argue less.

599
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,370
And when you really make the decision
that you're going to be a better husband,

600
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,270
they're the only real option is you
just going to agree with your wife.

601
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,303
Um,

602
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:35,340
that's really it to and in a lot of
women applaud that where if it went the

603
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:38,250
other way, like ladies, if
you want to be a happy wife,

604
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,960
just agree with your husband.

605
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,820
It would be considered like really
sexist and uh, they'd be a kept woman.

606
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,300
Does Stepford fucking wife or
whatever the hell he could Bridgeport,

607
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,160
it's some fucking town in Connecticut.
Wife, right? Hartford wife.

608
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,800
Um, anyway, Stanford, Stanford wife.

609
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,650
Is that what it is? I have
no idea. Um, yeah, you just,

610
00:37:02,651 --> 00:37:07,530
you just fucking agree with
them. Alright. And that's,

611
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,850
it makes it, it makes it better because
that whole happy wife happy life. I mean

612
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,910
it's really like, it's a
joke I do on my act. I go,

613
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:22,180
it sounds cute cause it rhymes,
but it's a threat because it's literally,

614
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:26,200
if your wife isn't happy, nobody's going
to be happy. And that includes you.

615
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,800
You kid the fucking, yeah.
If y'all got a Goldfish,

616
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,410
it's gonna Start Rolling over on its side.

617
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:35,080
Like it's starting to die until
she gets into a better mood again.

618
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:38,140
So it's just like, okay,
let's just fucking,

619
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,010
let's just keep it happy.
That's so, all right.

620
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:47,820
So we drive over to this other one and
the old me would have been like, yeah,

621
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:48,670
it's a fucking pop.

622
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:51,670
Could get good fucking [inaudible] a
fucking no one wants to let game the,

623
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:53,880
I would have been the old me.
So I don't,

624
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,620
I just do what my wife says and
I get back in the car. Right.

625
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:03,000
Fucking drive over the other side
of town does next pumpkin patch.

626
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,750
So we pull into the next pumpkin patch.
There's no place to park.

627
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,550
It's fucking crazy. It's actually
in a field. This fucking rides.

628
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,390
There's a petting zoo. There's
actually room for it. Right?

629
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,230
I'm not a big petting zoo fan by the way.
All right.

630
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,380
All I'm thinking is fucking what does it
hoof and mouth disease often fucking a

631
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,510
goat horn, dizzy, whatever the
fuck it's called. Right. Um,

632
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,710
and not to mention,

633
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,070
they bring the Goddamn kids in there and
they're sitting there like walking up.

634
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,790
They got no respect.
The parents for these fucking goats,

635
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,450
they've had their horn sought off.
So now they're standing there, right?

636
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,280
Like, like, uh, like Luke
Skywalker without his lightsaber.

637
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,530
Now he's just some guy in a bar,
you know,

638
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,910
I'm a Jetta. Oh yeah. Let me
see some jet. I shit. Well,
you know, I'd love to, but uh,

639
00:38:57,911 --> 00:39:00,700
you know, my light saber, the
battery, I got to recharge it.

640
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:04,450
Just hang out for a second. I'll fucking,
I'll have a sword fight with somebody.

641
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:05,290
You'd be impressed.
Right?

642
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:10,060
So we go in there and this just
people that just like their pet goats,

643
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:14,740
like their dogs and you see the goats,
the goats there, they're fucking annoyed.

644
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,900
One of the guys goes up and he's just
stroking the beard of this one goat where

645
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:23,590
I'm just like, you know, I'm not in
the social circles that goats here,

646
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,890
but that's gotta be some high
level fucking disrespect.

647
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,193
You know,

648
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,120
would you go into the fucking octagon
at the UFC and start tugging on the

649
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,100
fucking man bundle,

650
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,550
one of those fucking black
belt human weapon lunatics?

651
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,280
You wouldn't, this is
what they were doing. So

652
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,280
my wife keeps telling me to let my kid
pet the fucking things. And I'm like,

653
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:53,310
so I've just was holding onto her
and I went perpendicular to the goat.

654
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,701
You know,

655
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:57,400
if it's an alligator you want to come
straight on because they got to turn their

656
00:39:57,401 --> 00:40:00,880
head to the side to fucking bite you.
She goes straight up and just fucking,

657
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:03,520
you know, pet it on the snap. I mean,

658
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:05,110
if we're really going
to do white people shit,

659
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,530
which is walk up to shit and act like
it's a fucking dog when it isn't,

660
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,780
that's basically what we
do in nature, right? So my,

661
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:16,990
see my wife getting frustrated,
like I'm being a helicopter parent.

662
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,340
I'm not a helicopter parent lifestyle,
but I don't say that. I'm like, all right,

663
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,430
you know why you fucking do it?
So she's,

664
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:28,530
she's bringing the kid in like all the
moms and they got the fucking goats eaten

665
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:32,980
this hae to try to keep them happy and
ignore the fact that people are stroking

666
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:34,720
that Goddamn beards,
right?

667
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,350
So all of these mothers are
approaching from the rear of the animal

668
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,760
and all I'm thinking is one of
these kids is going to take a, a,

669
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:50,110
a single or a double fucking leg
kick from one of these fucking, uh,

670
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,440
for one of these goats.
So I'm sitting there trying to eat,

671
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,160
just fucking go from the side.
So fortunately nothing happened.

672
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,600
And um, then all these people like,
hey, you want to go hit the food truck?

673
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,710
It's like your kid just fucking pet goat.

674
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,240
You're trying to get goat
pinkeye what do you, what do you,

675
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:11,470
what the fuck are you doing?

676
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,500
And they had chickens in
their chickens by the way,

677
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,381
he could tell that this,

678
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:21,520
these chickens were just for the petting
zoo because they were regular size.

679
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,380
Cause I was sitting there going like,
wow,

680
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,860
look how look how small
it's it's chest as you know,

681
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:30,640
as opposed to those fucking roided
up once. You know what I mean?

682
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,780
The pumping iron ones that are at
the grocery store. Um, anyways,

683
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,250
long story short, we fucking, before
we get into that, we pulled into this,

684
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,310
there's pumpkin patch and there's no
place to park. And my wife's goes,

685
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,240
which they have a valet and
I'm like at a pumpkin patch.

686
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,500
Like how, what happened to you that you
want to valet park at a pumpkin patch?

687
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:59,450
So we drive up this hill
way up this Goddamn hill and
there's all these signs in

688
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:03,800
the side of the road that just
say a no parking $50 ticket.

689
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,500
My wife's going like, it says
$50 a ticket. And I'm like,

690
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:11,290
well it's the price of doing business
and what the fuck do you want from me?

691
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:15,340
And then I'm looking at it and
it's written on construction
paper with the magic

692
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:20,080
marker. And I'm like, I really don't
think that's coming from the city. Right?

693
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,770
There's all these other people
parked here. Nobody has a ticket.

694
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,930
Okay.

695
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,950
So we just park.
So me,

696
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,000
me and Nia just start laughing
about this no parking sign

697
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,060
about how it's written on construction
paper with magic marker and we're going

698
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:39,920
down the hill.
And uh,

699
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,120
we ended up running into
somebody that knew us,

700
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,310
that got us in there
was a super long line.

701
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:50,980
And then we saw that there was actually
valet parking. It was like, ah, they want,

702
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,630
they want you to do the valet parking
that came from the valet people and the

703
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:57,930
regular parking so they could get your
money. See you wouldn't park for free.

704
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,290
And we ended up parking up. So we went in
there, we had the best fucking time. Uh,

705
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,710
people asked and they treated you like
a king. Can't thank, I'm not going to,

706
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,730
you know, say the name of
the fucking place. So what?

707
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,500
I always feel weird out in that shit,
but thank you so much for the way.

708
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:13,500
The petting zoo was awesome.
I was just an overprotective parent.

709
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,020
Evidently we got some
awesome fucking Pumpkin's.

710
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,830
I was pulling my daughter around in the
wagon and she's at the age now where she

711
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,290
wants to walk,
but once she got in the wagon,

712
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,990
she sat in the back corner
and was just chillin,

713
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,100
was leaning on one elbow and she had
her other arm fucking draped around like

714
00:43:29,101 --> 00:43:31,620
she was fucking driving a low rider.

715
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,910
She absolutely loved it.
And uh,

716
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:40,120
I got to tell you when the
great dad moments of my life
was pulling a wagon with

717
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:43,900
my kid in it, with pumpkins all around
it. And I'm just thinking like, you know,

718
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,170
maybe that happy wife happy
life thing isn't a threat.

719
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,700
Maybe they just know when it comes
to this shit. The way I understand.

720
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,970
Um, I don't know. Some Guy Shit.

721
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,140
Okay,

722
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,990
so that's going to be my new thing.
All right.

723
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,550
You know, if you want to buy 47 fucking
pumpkin's for the kid Halloween party,

724
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:08,620
we're going to have, because it's
going to be great for their experience.

725
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:11,140
Then you know what?
We're going to get 47 fucking pumpkin's.

726
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,010
I've done all right.

727
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:21,050
I'm not going to pull a Lewis
Hamilton here and be like a, you know,

728
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:22,940
I don't know what happened
back there. I mean, uh,

729
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,830
I think we only need one pumpkin for
some reason we got 47, but uh, you know,

730
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,500
I mean, but it's tough
picking out pumpkins a tough,
I'm not going to do that.

731
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,370
She knows what the fuck's best

732
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,650
and we'll just, we'll just leave it at
that. We just leave us to that. I've done,

733
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,690
I remember long time ago going to a
cookout and talking to another husband.

734
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:45,000
He just, I said, so what'd you
say? What'd you say to her? Huh?

735
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,360
What'd you say to him? You
know, some bullshit. Right.
And he was just going, ah, man.

736
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:53,100
He goes, you know, Bill, he goes, I don't
have any more fight in me. And I was like,

737
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,430
first puzzle. But the, the amazing thing
was, was I heard the piece in his voice

738
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,200
and, and, and him and his wife
seem happy. So it was just like,

739
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,803
all right,

740
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,320
okay.

741
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,500
Maybe the problem here is me,

742
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,360
maybe because if the house was
run the way I was running it,

743
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:21,350
it would look like a bachelor pad
and that's not what kids need.

744
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:22,640
All right.

745
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,570
So I'm going to shut the fuck up and
make some pumpkin bread this week and

746
00:45:26,571 --> 00:45:30,380
whatever my wife wants to do, I'm
just going to fucking do it. Hug Her,

747
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:34,100
tell her I love her and I'm going
to try that. I'm going to try that,

748
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,210
that road rather than fighting every
fucking goddamn thing and being a

749
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,230
that fucking guy in one of those hacky
Hollywood movies about cops being that

750
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,740
I'm getting too old for this shit,
being that guy ain't,

751
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,430
I ain't not fucking doing
it anyways. Um, all right.

752
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,740
Oh. And then another great
moment yesterday was a,

753
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,820
when we left the first pumpkin patch,
you know,

754
00:45:58,821 --> 00:46:02,150
my daughter was enjoying walking around
so she was crying cause now she's back

755
00:46:02,151 --> 00:46:04,970
in the fucking astronauts seat and

756
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,210
tried everything. I gave her my keys,
I gave him my hat, all of that shit.

757
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:14,270
And then uh,
that wouldn't work.

758
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:19,271
So I just started singing to her and then
Nia started singing along with me and

759
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:23,660
then our daughter's slowly stopped
crying and then was trying to sing along.

760
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:28,340
We were doing the, uh, you know,
where his point or where his point,

761
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:31,110
or here I am,
here I am.

762
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,620
And my daughter always sings along to a,
the run away. Like she knows that part.

763
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,450
So we get through all the fingers,
get through, where's, where is Mama,

764
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:46,130
where's Papa? You know, where's
my daughter? And then we run out,

765
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,200
she's done crying.

766
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,040
And then we just sang old McDonald had
a farm all the way to the next pumpkin

767
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:58,010
patch,
which was literally like a half hour away.

768
00:46:58,011 --> 00:47:03,011
And what was funny was we ran out of farm
animals and I was doing like penguins

769
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:06,440
and giraffes because my wife
was, Neil was doing the, the,

770
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,210
the sounds of the animals and
who the fuck knows what a,

771
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,930
what a giraffe sounds like. So she would
be looking at me like, you can really,

772
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,310
you're going to throw that in my lap.

773
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,180
Like the guy on second base celebrating
the other guys at bat being like, Hey,

774
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:21,850
fuck it,
tone it down everybody.

775
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,810
But to take a 95 mile an hour
fast ball to my fucking Chin,

776
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:31,300
God over here. Um, and you know what,

777
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:33,640
it was a great guy, Dan Day.
We didn't have any fights,

778
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:36,990
so I think I discovered something,
um,

779
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,280
all these years of being
with my lovely wife,

780
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,990
evidently I was the
problem. Um, and with that,

781
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,110
let's do, um, let's read some of the,

782
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:54,630
uh, the fucking, the read the emails
here for the week this week. Um,

783
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,140
all right, bill, great email. Slowly, uh,

784
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,380
a Billy but munch.
Oh my apologies to Kate Upton.

785
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:05,800
I wasn't really trashing or I just thought
it was funny was I feel like that's

786
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:08,840
the last person I thought. Well who
would have chimed in? I did say that.

787
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:10,750
I thought it was cool that
she was a baseball fan.

788
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,550
So I just listened to you
Thursday podcast. Your ears
should have been on fire.

789
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:19,060
I yelled like a wild man.
Keep reading you dumb ass.

790
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:23,320
Keep reading while you were
looking up Kate Upton's bio,

791
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,990
if you only had read a little more,

792
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,830
you would have discovered Kate Upton
is married to Justin Verlander.

793
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,780
Look at Justin Verlander
crushing it on the field and off.

794
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,630
He's a sad or aunties a close up.
Um,

795
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,890
she's married to him and is currently
carrying their first child. Hey,

796
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:49,090
congratulations to them that Justin,
I learned something.

797
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:52,270
Happy wife, happy life. All
right, so when she got you,

798
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:55,870
got you got major league ballplayer
money and she's got her money too.

799
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:59,500
So when she wants 98 Pumpkin's,

800
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,380
which I also believe it's the
speedy of fastball. Just, you know,

801
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,790
just grab a second, third fucking
wagon. Just do it. I'm telling you,

802
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,420
you'll love the best day ever anyways
is currently carrying their first child.

803
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:15,130
So yeah, she's, she really
likes the Astros baseball.

804
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,660
Come on Billy bookworm. Don't make me
yell like that. It's hard on my heart.

805
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,320
And so always go fuck yourself.
All right. I'm an idiot. Um,

806
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,180
I thought it was cool that you, I just
thought she was a baseball fan anyway.

807
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:31,210
I'm always the worst. All right.
Michelin Stars. Oh my God.

808
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:34,000
Am I going to get trashed for
everything I said last week? Bill,

809
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:38,260
I was listening to you Thursday afternoon
podcast and hurts you bring up the

810
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,093
Michelin Stars for food.

811
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:42,790
And I had the same reaction some years
back when I first heard about it.

812
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,660
For those you who didn't listen,
like I taught Michelin Stars was,

813
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:51,580
was separate from Michelin tires
like the way a mackintosh stereo,

814
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:55,150
like the best turntable. One of
the best out there, arguably, um,

815
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,090
is different from Macintosh computers
and it's spelled differently,

816
00:49:58,091 --> 00:50:00,070
but evidently it was the same people.
And I'm like,

817
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,250
why am I listening to the
people who make radial tires?

818
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:08,020
So I don't fucking hydroplane tell
me where I should go. Get some,

819
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:11,830
uh, beef balling off. Um, so anyways,

820
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:16,831
he said I had the same reaction or she
said back when I first heard about it,

821
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:21,010
uh, like wait, it's the
same guys that do the tires.

822
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:25,480
So I had to find out why a tire company
became the standard for fine dining.

823
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,080
Um,
turns out the founders who are French,

824
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,210
so I automatically love him.

825
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,630
Started the tire company in 1900 when
there were only about 3000 cars in the

826
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:42,290
entire country.
So to help drivers develop road trips,

827
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,700
which would mean increase car sales
and also increased tire sales.

828
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,720
They started a guide that included maps,
how to change a tire,

829
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,810
where to get gas and
places to eat and sleep.

830
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,460
Eventually they branched into
fine dining in the 1920s or so,

831
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:03,710
this has got to be the most
informative and interesting.

832
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:06,230
A email I've gotten as
far as like correcting me.

833
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,900
The Kate Upton one,

834
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:12,830
one might have been the most hilarious
considering all you asked or friends knew

835
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:14,690
why she was chime in it anyways.

836
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:20,110
A one star means it's a very good
restaurant in it's category two stars is

837
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,070
excellent cooking worth a detour.

838
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,840
Three stars is exceptional
cuisine worth a special journey.

839
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,910
And I even think like that is um,

840
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,250
like all of those are uh,

841
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,720
the way they're described
are being extremely humble
because if he get any star

842
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:47,600
as far as, I mean, I don't too much about
it, but like if you get three stars,

843
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:51,620
you one of the best
restaurants in the world. Um,

844
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,130
so if you get one year, a third of the
best restaurant in the world, I mean,

845
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,990
I'm going to fucking eat there anyways.

846
00:51:56,991 --> 00:52:01,550
Most restaurants don't even get the one
stars. So one stars pretty damn solid.

847
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:04,760
There you go. Always. Sorry. Anyways,

848
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:08,570
there is actually a one star restaurant
right down the street from the comedy

849
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:13,460
cellar,
a on Macdougal called Minetta tavern.

850
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,090
I've eaten there. You've probably
walked by this place thousands of times.

851
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,180
If you haven't been there, it's
definitely worth the stop in, uh,

852
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,530
think it opened in the 1930s.
Not Stuff. You're pretentious.

853
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,910
Really old school place

of the advertising here real quick.

862
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,130
You guys want to hear me read out loud?

00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:05,780
Do you want to hear it be entertaining
again and then I'll go back to saying

864
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:09,020
dumb shit about stuff and then you guys
can correct me on the next podcast.

865
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:12,590
A dollar shave club to dude,

866
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:17,591
the fucking red sox are in the world
series playing the fucking Los Angeles

867
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:23,000
Dodgers. You know, usually they go
to the world series. I'm like, fuck,

868
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:26,760
if I was home I would go.
Now they're playing the team,
my hometown of God dammit.

869
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,020
I'm going to try to go to one of
those gangs and I will be not,

870
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:36,000
I will not be wearing any red sox shit
because it's just not fun on the west

871
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:38,070
coast.
Okay.

872
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,640
There's no fucking respect or anything.

873
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,990
You people try to kick the
shit out of here. It's, it's,

874
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,880
it's Philadelphia Times 900.
I've had a problem at dodger stadium.

875
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:53,910
I had a problem at a chargers game.
Um,

876
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
and I've only heard shit duffing good
about fucking 49 or raider games.

877
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:03,750
And it's just like, they, they just don't
get it. Sports fans out here really,

878
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,730
they just don't get it. It's
just, it's like violent.

879
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:12,150
And, um, so I just go there.

880
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:16,290
I don't wear any of this shit and I
just, I just leave it at that. But like,

881
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,900
people out here just [inaudible] there's
so much shit that's great about out

882
00:54:19,901 --> 00:54:23,790
here, but the sports culture is
fucking horrific. So that's my

883
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,750
warning to anybody. Any red sox fan coming
out here for a dodger game, you know,

884
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,230
I'm not saying 100% something's
going to happen, but uh, you know,

885
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,920
it's kind of Nice not to have
brain damage. Wouldn't you say?

886
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,190
I would just leave you fucking shit
at home and silently fucking chair.

887
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,540
I dress like a fucking a undercover cop
when I go to the Games out here, right?

00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:15,090

931
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:25,010
Kate Upton and Michelin Stars
car for a high school kid.

932
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,550
All right, let's see this.
Hey there, Billy bronco. Hey,

933
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:33,960
how about those new Broncos that are
coming back? Huh? Those looks sweet.

934
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:39,000
Um, I worked in a garage during
summers of high school and college.

935
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,430
Not only do you see, uh, what cars

936
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,890
aren't shit under the hood.
When I worked in car,

937
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,630
I literally went to the fantasy of buying
one of those Broncos and the fantasy

938
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:56,120
included my wife saying, absolutely,
Bill, get one. You know what?

939
00:57:56,121 --> 00:58:01,121
I actually tried to talk her into letting
me buy one of those old GMC RVs from

940
00:58:01,871 --> 00:58:03,970
the 1970s into the 80s,

941
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,240
and I wanted it in that palm desert green
and I was going to have to do to build

942
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:12,430
my truck,
make this fucking thing.

943
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:17,280
I was actually considering have a d
all electric and then hiring a driver.

944
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,140
Whenever I had a fucking road Gig,
I just had that thing driving around.

945
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:23,870
I'd fly to where it was
and do a run a gigs. Um,

946
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,150
and we would just be in there and
we'd have a fucking humor door.

947
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:31,840
And a fridge for some ice cold beer and
I put on fucking 9 million pounds and my

948
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:35,830
wife was just like, no, you're not
doing that. And I was just like, okay.

949
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:40,930
And it's got, because I
swear to God, if she didn't,

950
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,340
I would have the shit that I would
have. You know what I mean? I would,

951
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:49,660
I would argue that I would have one of
the weirdest fucking car collections ever.

952
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:51,460
Cause I would,
I would own one of those.

953
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,190
Yeah.

954
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,860
Um,
I like station wagons.

955
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,930
I'd have one of those fucking Mercedes
Benz AMG fucking station wagons.

956
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,150
MMM.

957
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,720
You know what? You know what
one of these days I'll actually,

958
00:59:06,721 --> 00:59:10,800
I'll give you like my top 10 fucking
cars cause I really got to sit down and

959
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:15,120
think about it. I like those fucking
those, those GM member per lookup, GM,

960
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:17,670
General Motors Pereda progress.

961
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,170
Okay.

962
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,910
And look at those, those, whatever.
What the fuck that thing called?

963
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:23,260
Yeah,

964
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,650
just look that up.
Whatever that vehicle was called,

965
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,570
it was like a fucking living room
and a boss all at the same time.

966
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:35,560
It had a spiral staircase that you
walked up the parade, a progress,

967
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:36,460
check that thing out.

968
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,493
MMM.

969
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,390
Anyways, plowing ahead here. Let me,
let me finish reading this thing here.

970
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,230
MMM.

971
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:47,820
Not only do you see what I would have
stretch limos from the 1950s I have a

972
00:59:47,821 --> 00:59:50,520
1955,
uh,

973
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,690
Chrysler imperial stretch limo or maybe
one of those ones that like John Lennon

974
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,600
and Elvis had and world leaders
had that was made by Mercedes,

975
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,890
the 1960s that really boxy looking one.

976
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,993
MMM

977
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,960
yeah.
All Weird Shit.

978
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:09,880
I wouldn't have a Shelby Mustang and a
fucking Hemi this and a Hemi that fuck

979
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:13,210
all that. That's all baby boomers. Shit.
I have no interest in any of that stuff.

980
01:00:13,211 --> 01:00:16,930
I like that fucking weird shit.
I like those Nash.

981
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,220
I liked that fucking BMW that
had like three wheels in the,

982
01:00:21,221 --> 01:00:23,170
in the full front of
the car would open up.

983
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:25,990
He had to move out the steering wheel.
I don't all shit like that.

984
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:30,250
Now there's gotta be somebody out there
with a car collection like that that you

985
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,240
can tell me where I can go look
at all those cars. Cause I,

986
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,760
I love all of that Shit,
man.

987
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:34,940
Okay.

988
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,560
All right. Uh, my advice for
the, uh, anyways, oh, the kid,

989
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:42,380
the kid who wanted to buy the
car. All right, let's start over.

990
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:45,050
I worked in a garage during
summers of high school in College.

991
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,230
Not only do you see what cars
aren't shit under the hood,

992
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:52,670
but also cars that look lame real fast.
Um,

993
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,830
my advice for that kid is to get something
with low mileage from the 90s jeeps,

994
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,180
lightweight pickups,

995
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:04,330
and anything you can find parts for and
anything where you open the hood and the

996
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:07,250
parts are identifiable.

997
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:12,290
Don't get a dodge neon or a shitbox.
Find something that looks new inside,

998
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:13,400
inside and out.

999
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,840
Get the oil changed every 3000 miles
and have it as long as you want it.

1000
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,870
There you go. I used to do that. I,
that's one of the big things. Um,

1001
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:23,590
okay.

1002
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:26,560
Changing points when I was a
kid was I learned how to, uh,

1003
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,640
change the oil in the car, which
is really simple, but it's huge.

1004
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:36,280
I would do it every 2,500 miles.
I remember being in back east,

1005
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:40,060
it'd be freezing fucking cold out and he
had to do that thing where it, you know,

1006
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:43,930
I tried it the first time when the engine
was ice cold and the oil was coming

1007
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:47,710
out like syrup. So you'd have to start
the car up, let it run a little bit.

1008
01:01:47,711 --> 01:01:51,310
We'd heat it up, but not too much where
all of a sudden then it'd be fucking hot.

1009
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:54,400
But even then that wasn't bad. You just
go inside for like fucking a half hour.

1010
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:55,780
And um,

1011
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,560
okay.

1012
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,660
I, and I had a little
place down by the, uh,

1013
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,890
the firehouse that used to take the
recycled oil and I come down there and I'd

1014
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:07,100
dump the shit in there. It
was fucking beautiful. Um,

1015
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,400
I learned how to change the fuel filter
air filters, one of the easiest things,

1016
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:14,960
fuel filter, uh, got a
grease gun, the loop job,

1017
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:17,420
all that. So you didn't get all
the squeaks and all that shit.

1018
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:21,500
Just basic maintenance like, and
then I would bring it in. Um,

1019
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,490
I never learned how to
adjust a carburetor.

1020
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:25,500
I always got nervous with
that shit and I would just,

1021
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:27,503
mmm.

1022
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,040
I do all of that. Although, however,

1023
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:34,300
one time I got in patient taking a fuel
filter off and I snapped it off of the

1024
01:02:34,301 --> 01:02:36,040
fucking fuel line,

1025
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:39,460
so then I had to get it towed over there
and I told the guy over there what I

1026
01:02:39,461 --> 01:02:43,900
did and he said I didn't communicate it
right and I had the fuel filter sitting

1027
01:02:43,901 --> 01:02:46,960
on the bench seat and he went out there
to start it up and gas when all over the

1028
01:02:46,961 --> 01:02:50,620
fucking engine and we had a fucking
engine fire. That's what he said.

1029
01:02:50,621 --> 01:02:53,080
We had a fire. I was like, no
dude, you had a fucking fire.

1030
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,650
And then he fucking yelled at me and shit
and like, like I was going to sue them.

1031
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:57,641
He goes,
oh,

1032
01:02:57,641 --> 01:03:00,520
they're not going to start fucking doing
a bunch of work on a God damn car with

1033
01:03:00,521 --> 01:03:03,750
a hundred something thousand fucking
miles on it and just yelling at me.

1034
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:05,080
I remember looking at the guy like,

1035
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:06,610
okay,

1036
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,360
dude, I've, and bringing you a gift is
my fucking car will be here forever.

1037
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:11,940
This is how you're going to treat me.
I'm not trying to be a fucking asshole,

1038
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:13,200
but I did not say that to them.

1039
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:15,100
Okay.

1040
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,170
So I remember my dad told me,
he goes,

1041
01:03:17,171 --> 01:03:19,060
you go down there and
you make sure you pay.

1042
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,750
So there's a record that your car
was there and not, and sure enough,

1043
01:03:22,751 --> 01:03:26,260
I went down and the guy said, no
charge. I said, no, I'll pay for it.

1044
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,500
And he gave me a look because he knew
that I knew what the fuck he was doing.

1045
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:31,150
And that's the last time I
brought my car over there,

1046
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:34,480
had it fixed somewhere else.
And Long Story Short,

1047
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:38,110
at one point I had an engine fire and
it fucking burned down to the ground.

1048
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,900
But that was years later. That was
my first vehicle to 83 Ford Ranger.

1049
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,880
Um, anyways, to be honest,
the insecurity never came.

1050
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,210
Yeah.

1051
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:53,840
Uh, wait a sec. Oh, it's a different,
different fucking email. Oh,

1052
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:58,010
okay. So that's, that's that guy
suggested he was too skinny, too tall.

1053
01:03:58,011 --> 01:04:01,490
Here's the thing about
the insecurity. Um, Bill,

1054
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:05,690
I am what you would call a
goofy looking bitch. Five 11,

1055
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:10,370
like 135 pounds and super awkward.
I have a pretty face, so I'm told,

1056
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:13,820
but I've always felt weird about my body.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1057
01:04:13,821 --> 01:04:18,170
If you got into fashion, they tell
you to lose 20 pounds. Five 11,

1058
01:04:18,171 --> 01:04:21,350
one 35. You sound lean
and mean to me. Be Honest.

1059
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,720
The insecurity never came from me,

1060
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:26,480
but from other people by
earliest memory of yeah.

1061
01:04:26,481 --> 01:04:29,810
And that's probably their insecurity
cause you're probably taller than a lot of

1062
01:04:29,811 --> 01:04:31,220
guys.
Um,

1063
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,090
my earliest memory of being made
to feel weird about my body,

1064
01:04:35,091 --> 01:04:36,410
I'm assuming this is a woman.

1065
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,400
Okay.

1066
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,430
Oh, they signed it.
Olive oil. All right. Uh,

1067
01:04:41,431 --> 01:04:45,270
my earliest memory of being made to
feel weird about my body was when I was

1068
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:47,070
eight and a teacher said,

1069
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:48,400
yeah,

1070
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,170
I'm too skinny and look weird.
Yeah, that's old school shit. Uh,

1071
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:57,730
people used to do that. I shot up in
heights since then and I've always,

1072
01:04:57,731 --> 01:05:02,230
always been mocked for either the
height, weight or both. As a consequence,

1073
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:04,600
I've developed somewhat
of a complex about it.

1074
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,860
I've been suicidal about it
before, honestly. Oh Jesus Christ.

1075
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:12,610
Don't take it to that level.
You've got the supermodel body.

1076
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:14,343
Um,

1077
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:15,480
okay.

1078
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,330
But then I'll watch some
video about a burn victim

1079
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,200
and then feel like a real sack of shit.
All right, so you got some perspective.

1080
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,430
I'm a girl by the way. Forgot to mention
that. And when I was in high school

1081
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,800
school,
I got bullied by this short guy.

1082
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:34,230
He said I was turning into a man once
and I honestly cried my eyes out.

1083
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,700
Oh God. Because you know what it
is? He's a little fucking run.

1084
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:42,100
And that's, that's the
thing. If, if anything,

1085
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:43,840
anybody in high school listening to that,

1086
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:47,620
like one of the best things you
can learn in life is that so much,

1087
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:53,110
so many things that other people say.
It really has nothing to do with you,

1088
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:57,150
even if they're saying it about you and
has to do with the other person and how

1089
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,090
their parents suck or they feel bad
about their own life. So, you know,

1090
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:06,400
like if you want people to not say mean
Shit to you, uh, walk around happy,

1091
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,240
have a happy look on yourself,
on your face. Like, you know,

1092
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,210
go out and enjoy yourself and you won't
believe the fucking negative attention

1093
01:06:13,211 --> 01:06:14,044
that you'll get.

1094
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,273
MMM.

1095
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:19,380
And one of the great joys in
life is the day you realize that,

1096
01:06:19,381 --> 01:06:20,790
that it has nothing to do with you.

1097
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:24,870
And you learn to just filter
all of that stuff up. Um,

1098
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:28,410
you have five, 11, one 35. I
mean, I'm telling you like,

1099
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:30,223
yeah,

1100
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:31,733
there's,

1101
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,810
there's a lot of women that are going to
fucking hate you because of your height

1102
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,990
and your build because it's going to
be hard for them to keep weight off.

1103
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:39,370
He got a tremendous advantage.

1104
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,530
Everything that all the
clothes you're going to put on,

1105
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:44,920
there's a reason why models are so
tall and all that because they look

1106
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:46,630
absolutely stunning in the clothes.

1107
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:51,710
And then they sell it to all of all the
short fucking people out there and then,

1108
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,920
and then they never look right.
Um, anyways, she said, uh,

1109
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:58,830
my question to you is,
hi,

1110
01:06:58,831 --> 01:07:01,470
do I get to a point in life
where you don't give a shit?

1111
01:07:01,471 --> 01:07:04,830
When anyone says I get that,
I'm thin. But honestly,

1112
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,740
it's just the weight my body likes.
I'm not unhealthy at all.

1113
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,400
I have no health issues and my doctor
isn't word. Yeah. And, and the, the,

1114
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,810
the older you get,

1115
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,160
you're going to,
you're going to look great and all the,

1116
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,850
that little run two made funny you.

1117
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:21,400
There's nowhere for it to go except
for his fucking man tits. Um,

1118
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:26,380
what should I do next time
someone says something to me, uh,

1119
01:07:26,381 --> 01:07:30,130
I'm 22 and people at work feel
comfortable enough to say shit like,

1120
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,730
did you have eating issues as a kid?
Jesus Christ.

1121
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,150
Even a complete stranger
who is asking for my help,

1122
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:41,590
no less took it upon herself
to tell me I look anorexic.

1123
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,080
Um, yeah, no, that's, that's
all other people's issue.

1124
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:51,130
I feel like people think they can get
away with shit like this because I'm not

1125
01:07:51,131 --> 01:07:55,960
fat. You think I should just tell
people to fuck off? Only thing is,

1126
01:07:55,961 --> 01:07:57,820
if I do,
that'll be,

1127
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,750
I'll be in an argument pretty
much one to two times per week.

1128
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,270
Thanks a bunch and I love,

1129
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,510
I love you and Nia wish you
and the Munchkin the best.

1130
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:11,170
Go fuck yourself a olive oil. All right.
You've got a great sense of humor.

1131
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:15,820
Just seeing your olive oil, there's a
bunch of shit you can do. All right.

1132
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,710
Um, I dunno, I,

1133
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,840
one of the things I used to do when
I used to go out after shows and when

1134
01:08:22,841 --> 01:08:26,680
somebody said like mean stuff
to me, I would just go, uh,

1135
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:31,270
you got something between your
teeth and they never did. Right.

1136
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,190
But it would just make
himself self conscious.

1137
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:40,600
They'd immediately shut their mouth and
put that tongue up over their teeth and

1138
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:43,830
then just fucking walk away.
Um,

1139
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:48,820
you can do that and just say, I
appreciate that and just, you know,

1140
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,960
offer them a piece of Gump,
you know,

1141
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,820
make it seem like they have bad breath.

1142
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,650
There's little things like that to
turn it back around on them. Um,

1143
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:01,880
okay.

1144
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,580
I don't, I don't, you know, you know
what really, what is really going to be,

1145
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:07,160
cause then, you know, I'm also suggesting
that you kind of be mean to them.

1146
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:11,030
What you're going to have to do is just,
you know,

1147
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:16,970
learned to like how you look. That's
it. And just really know that,

1148
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,680
um, that's all about, and I know
you're at work, but you know,

1149
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:26,000
if a guy said something to you, I mean
it's easy to be like, just be like,

1150
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:27,081
you know,

1151
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:32,060
I recently heard that a lot of things
that people say mean about you has nothing

1152
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:36,050
to do with you. It has to do with them.
That's too long. Just to be like, sir,

1153
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,010
are you saying that to me?

1154
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:41,450
Cause you're actually concerned or is
it because your dick is the size of a

1155
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:43,970
fucking peanut? I don't know what
the fuck you can go with Dick size.

1156
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:48,260
That's always good. All right. This is
some old school yard bully shit. Yeah,

1157
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:52,400
just go with the obvious. They're
going with the obvious on you. Oh,

1158
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:55,850
you can talk about my weight and I can
talk about that giant fucking potato you

1159
01:09:55,851 --> 01:09:57,860
call a fucking nose in
the middle of your face.

1160
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:59,560
Okay.

1161
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,390
You know, you know it's going
to keep growing your ears,

1162
01:10:01,391 --> 01:10:02,530
your nose just keep growing.

1163
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,200
You're going to look like Jimmy
Duranti by the time you're 35.

1164
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:09,130
You don't know who the fuck
he is. We'll look them up.
You can't now. Um, yeah, but,

1165
01:10:09,131 --> 01:10:09,964
uh,
I dunno.

1166
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,200
Yeah.

1167
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:16,060
I, I mean, I'm going to give you stand
up lines. You can't save him at work.

1168
01:10:16,061 --> 01:10:19,870
If some woman said you'd said you
are, you anorexic and just say, no,

1169
01:10:19,871 --> 01:10:23,350
I just know how to push myself away from
the table. Your pudgy con, you know,

1170
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:27,520
there's that, you can do that. But
I think it's really more important.

1171
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:30,790
It just accepting the fact that here's
the thing, your metabolism will slow down.

1172
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:34,360
As you get older, you'll fill out
a little bit more. And you know,

1173
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:38,590
I mean, when I was 22, I
was a fucking rail myself.

1174
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:43,300
And I look at the beautiful ball
that Donna said, hi, I'm now at 50.

1175
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:44,723
Um,

1176
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:46,230
okay.

1177
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:50,280
I Dunno. Look at me. I started losing
my hair. I didn't go out and fucking,

1178
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:54,000
you know, try to start moving shit
around up there. I just said, fuck it.

1179
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:57,480
I shaved my head. I just
am who I am. And, you know,

1180
01:10:57,481 --> 01:10:59,790
people call me a bald cut
now and it makes me laugh.

1181
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,840
I actually take it as a
term of endearment. Uh,

1182
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:06,540
I like how I look and I know
I, I, I'm, I'm not, you know,

1183
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:10,770
I'm not a good looking guy, but I
fucking, I, I like it. I liked that.

1184
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:15,270
I look like a fucking freak.
It's, and I actually enjoy aging.

1185
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:19,110
I bought this fucking old man's
sweater the other day and my wife goes,

1186
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,410
why you can't put that on you look
like you're fucking an old man. I go,

1187
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:23,250
I am an old man.

1188
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,980
Let me be an old man at where my old
man's sweater put around the house and

1189
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:31,650
fucking a sitting on the
back porch smoking a scar,

1190
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:36,330
thinking a glory days.
You're 22 years old,

1191
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,160
you got your whole life ahead of you.

1192
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,650
You're going to run into somebody who's
going to realize how fucking beautiful

1193
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:42,180
you are.
And I got to admit something,

1194
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,610
the fact that everybody gives
a shit about the way you look,

1195
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:48,030
you're going to have a great
sense of humor and you're
gonna laugh a lot in life.

1196
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:51,660
And that's gonna keep you young. Said,
God bless you and you five 11 body,

1197
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:55,230
hundred 35 pounds and everybody else
can go fuck themselves. And with that,

1198
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,440
that's the podcast and the rest of you
can go fuck yourselves and I'll check in

1199
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,080
on Thursday.
