1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,231
All right.
Hey,

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:04,410
what's going on is bill burn his time
for the Thursday afternoon just before

3
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:07,860
Friday, Monday morning podcast,
and I am just checking in on you.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,630
I didn't yell this time.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,680
I did yell at this time because I'm
sitting across from a man who is currently

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,970
setting the Guinness Book of World
Records for podcasting in a day,

7
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:20,250
promoting his new show on Netflix.

8
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:24,930
Stand up in a way for episodes
debuting Christmas Eve.

9
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:26,010
Ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,860
all of the greatest theater of
comedians have ever seen in my life.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,570
Please welcome Mister Brian Regan.
Bill, how are you man? I'm excellent.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,580
How are you doing? You look like
you're about ready to glaze over here.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,270
You're on the whole media
tour, right? Did they get you?

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,010
Did you do some morning TV?

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,950
Did you do any of that crap on morning TV?
I,

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,480
I'm not comfortable with
those morning shows.

17
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:54,190
I tend to love doing these with other
comedians. Oh, okay, good, good.

18
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:57,880
You know when it's, when it's
not another comedian, it's, I'm,

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,750
I am so horrible at them. And
you're funny, Brian. Oh boy.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,600
What can people expect from your show?
That's the Mo,

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,970
like if I'm doing a phone interview,
like a radio and phone radio interviewer,

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,730
well as soon as they say,

23
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:16,980
what can people expect people for
people who aren't familiar with you,

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,880
what can they expect from your show?

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,740
I know right away they're not familiar
with the person asks me the question and

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,220
I just want to hang up.
Like I just want to get a few to be over

27
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,251
at that moment.

28
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,580
Is your show going to be the exact same
thing I just watched on television?

29
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,050
Yeah. That's another one. Did
you write any new material?

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,710
It's good to be exact same shit.
See, after I finally got his special,

31
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:43,920
I didn't want it to ruin it by boring
people by doing the exact same stuff. Uh,

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,230
Brian in this company asked you all
hacky questions in this current comedy

33
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:48,771
climate,

34
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:53,771
how do you find the altitude until fly
at with your current presentation of,

35
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,620
of satire in a fucking
crazy. It's a, it's a,

36
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,100
it's an insane world. It's in the
same world right now. But uh, anyways,

37
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:05,000
tell me about your show.

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,030
It's a hybrid half standup,
half sketch.

39
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,710
A lot of the older bits that I used to
do years ago when I do my shows around

40
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:16,060
the country,

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,990
people at the end of my show sometimes
like to hear some of the older stuff and

42
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm like, well, what can I do? Maybe I
could do something with this. So, um,

43
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,480
you got,

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,480
you get you like that good that you have
like classic jokes that's harder than a

45
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:34,410
classic song. And I'm not going to
use that word on myself, but, uh,

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,060
it's nice of you to say
that, but, uh, you know,

47
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:41,980
so I'm like Johnny Cash. Yeah. Well,

48
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,160
it feels good that people still like to,
you know,

49
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,450
here some of these routines and I thought,
well,

50
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:50,820
maybe I can do something with them,
but I don't want to just do the standup.

51
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,400
I mean, people want to know that. So I
thought maybe if I do like a standup bid.

52
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:57,040
And then that segues into some
sketch or something like that.

53
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,440
And a Jerry Seinfeld got
involved. Oh, hey, go. Um,

54
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,470
he was the one who reached out and he's
always been cool with me and said that

55
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,100
he wanted to help spearhead
me having a show. I mean,

56
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:16,750
what better phone call is that? It's in
a life that's a big phone call. You know,

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,410
like, like you're, you're on the
phone going look at, he's goosebumps.

58
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,900
I got goosebumps. Yeah. You know,

59
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,120
it's funny when you said this when you
were describing your show is I, that's,

60
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:31,660
he's the first person I thought I was
like, Jerry would like to show. He was so,

61
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,500
you know, was cool. He said that he had
this idea or he didn't have the idea.

62
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,860
He said he wanted me to have a show.
He said,

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,970
let's get together sometime and see if we
can talk about this. And I was like, Oh,

64
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,880
you know, of course, you know, and um, he
was performing in Las Vegas where I live,

65
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:52,090
so I went to go meet him at his sweet.

66
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,530
They have sweets and hotels that are like,
that I didn't know were possible

67
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,720
like piano and a segues to
secretary after that from what

68
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,510
I have to go to that kind of room is this,
you know,

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,950
so I go, we go meet and we chat.
And uh, he said, yeah, you know,

70
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,150
he thought that I was one of the
comedians that have, should have a show,

71
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:23,230
which was just a huge, huge honor even
hearing that. And he said, well, you know,

72
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,920
maybe we'll get together and talk about
it sometime soon. And I said, well,

73
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:30,760
I have an idea. And he goes, okay. And I,

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,440
I know he likes coffee, right? So I said,
do you mind if we order some coffee?

75
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,040
And we chat about it.
So called room service.

76
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:43,540
They brought up a pot of coffee. I
pitched it to him in about three minutes,

77
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,160
you know, and he goes, I
like it, let's do it. And um,

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,340
I got emotional. I swear
to God, I started like,

79
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,310
I got a tear in my eye because it's
show business doesn't work like that.

80
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,480
I say we had his shell.
Business does. Yes, exactly.

81
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,920
I knew when he says,

82
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,650
yeah, yeah, let's do it. And they
didn't do it. And now we made,

83
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,470
I knew it was happening. I mean, I'm on
belittling all the work he does, but like,

84
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,820
he has like the, uh,
whatever that is. Like,

85
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,510
he knows when an idea is good and
then he goes, let's just do it.

86
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,920
And then he does it. He does it where
he wants to do it. Everybody responds.

87
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,440
And then,
uh,

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,920
and I knew back the bank truck
up exactly the money part as a,

89
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:32,520
as an even that important to me, you know,
I mean right now, but just his cloud,

90
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,410
your agent just slapped his forehead.

91
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,760
It goes renegotiations weigh in
or they're going to play this

92
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,850
wait is still be down to earth.
Brian,

93
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,940
at some point would you
be a little bit of a diva?

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,510
But I knew when he said he wanted to
do it, that it was going to happen.

95
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,060
Who's going to say no to him?
You know?

96
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:57,500
And I knew that he's the one shepherding
this. So anyway, it was like really that,

97
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:01,520
uh, that uh, he's supporting this. Yeah,

98
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,810
I would say I would say that would be a,
if you're going to go in with anybody,

99
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,210
that would probably be uh,
let me see. He did for them.

100
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,650
How long does it take
you to shoot an episode?

101
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:11,360
I'm fascinated with this aspect of it.

102
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,140
Of the Wendy you get to go
home aspect of show business.

103
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,560
Well there was a lot of a
writer's meetings, you know,

104
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:23,420
a a bunch of weeks of that, you know,
just coming up with the sketches.

105
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,680
A lot of the sketch ideas I
had, I had already had. Um,

106
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,110
and then we shot the sketches also.

107
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,420
Not every one of them is based
on one of your older bits.

108
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,750
It's just some of them are and
some of them are newer ideas.

109
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:40,400
None of the sketches are standup done
as a sketch. I didn't want to do that.

110
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,430
Stand up. I love stand up and
stand up. Should be stand up.

111
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,610
So they do the one where you want to
do the cattle prod and the person who's

112
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:50,150
just standing where they're supposed to
be walking in the airport was one of my

113
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:54,880
favorites. I'd like to see somebody, maybe
that one, maybe that one, I'll do it,

114
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,210
but I wanted to stand up to be
stand up and then I wanted, uh,

115
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,890
some type of transition into a sketch.
Sometimes it's a natural lead in,

116
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:05,720
sometimes you have to kind
of like horseshoe it, you
know what I mean? And, um,

117
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,950
but that was part of the fun too,

118
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,470
is like manufacturing
these segues into sketches.

119
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,580
So we shot all the sketches and then we
shot a all four episodes in two nights

120
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,640
in front of a live audience
where we would throw,

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,680
I do stand up and then throw to the
sketch or effect. Yeah. So in theory,

122
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,370
if you get 10 episodes, you could
be done by Wednesday for foreign to,

123
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,310
you can do a half day on Wednesday.

124
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:33,230
Like they have the PTA meeting and
then you'd done, yeah, it was cool.

125
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,740
It was cool. And then, you know, the
final night, you know, it was, uh,

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,000
happened to be my birthday and had a
big birthday celebration after that.

127
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:45,320
So it was cause, uh, nice. Uh, it was a
cool experience. That's awesome. Well,

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,640
my next, next time I do a TV show, I don't
think I'm going to do animation again.

129
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,700
I tried that. I was being so smart. I
love my show. I love doing the show,

130
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:59,970
but it's just like there's always,
you know, all, you know, every, yeah,

131
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,780
I shot the episode in
three days. I'm like, Jesus

132
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,980
takes us a fucking year.
You get this thing done. Um,

133
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,730
so [inaudible] uh, who is some of
the cast members? Anybody? I know.

134
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,190
I didn't want to a normal cast.
I cast pur sketch, you know,

135
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:24,191
so it isn't like there's this from Isis
how against the grain digit digit digit

136
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,543
cast here.

137
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,480
I want it like if it was a particular
sketch where you had three characters,

138
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:33,200
we would cast for that particular episode
or that particular sketch. You know,

139
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,810
I didn't want like a,
like a mad TV or uh, oh,

140
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:39,320
you don't want to know kind of thing.
People know whoever services the thing,

141
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,210
you know. Okay. And uh, so
there's some obscure people,
but uh, they were all great.

142
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,470
Soon did not be obscure when this
thing debuts, like I said earlier,

143
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,150
four episodes on Netflix,
Christmas Eve. Uh,

144
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,400
so you're a Florida Guy, right? Um,

145
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,280
what can people expect from a Florida
guy with a sketch show? Sorry,

146
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,070
I just love those questions.
Oh,

147
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,920
what do you think about our
current president? Is that crazy?

148
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,900
Let him material that event. So
He'd in a, uh, a social situation.

149
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,150
When you meet somebody who just finds
out you're a comedian and like every

150
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:22,240
single thing that said they
have to throw in I bed.

151
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:26,980
This is going to end up in your routine.
You should talk about this.

152
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,970
You know, somebody has a chip
and they put some, you know,

153
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,180
some guacamole on it and
it falls on the table.

154
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,530
I bet that's going to
end up in your attic.

155
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,220
They're in front of you in the buffet
line. Don't put this in your APP. Yeah,

156
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,060
usually try to avoid bombing.
My job is to entertain,

157
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:50,750
I mean, I might put this in the act,
the right this because now we are,

158
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,240
we're actually, they're actually
a, we're putting it in the act.

159
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,590
You described the Guac, fallen off the
chair. You know what I want more of?

160
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:00,660
I want celebrities,
celebrities,

161
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,310
if I can say the word telling me
about their political opinions,

162
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,170
I can't get enough of it.
You know,

163
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,900
cause I'm very unsure on
what I think about the world,

164
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,010
in which way I'm going to vote.

165
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,360
And then all of a sudden the f
six lead on a sitcom, you know,

166
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:17,890
informs me about finning or something.
And I'm like, oh, okay. That's,

167
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,580
that's how, that's how I need to think
about that. I want to see the flip.

168
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,970
I want to see in an inauguration
ceremony for a congressman and during his

169
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,990
swearing in, he says, who should
have one for wardrobe design

170
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,120
in a movie? You know, criticized,

171
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,340
criticized the wardrobe
winners, you know, um,

172
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,190
which of course is absurd, but I
know it's a weird, it's a weird time,

173
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:53,010
man. You know, I, I've never felt,
uh, I don't feel old, you know,

174
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,740
I just feel, I just feel like,
uh, it started with the music.

175
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,180
I didn't know what
people were listening to.

176
00:10:58,181 --> 00:10:59,710
I didn't know what the popular bands was.

177
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,720
And then I started to not know who the
players were playing sports and now it's

178
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:09,700
like a, yeah, I don't know
the words, you know, I don't,
I don't know. In other words,

179
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,110
I'm not that bad. I just, I just,
I, I, uh, I don't agree with it.

180
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,390
When, uh, the academy
awards come out, the,

181
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,010
it used to be, I had seen all of the
movies that are up for best picture.

182
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,580
Then it was like, oh, I didn't see
that one. Then it was like, well,

183
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,480
I saw a couple of them.
Right. And then it got,

184
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,400
now it's gone to the point where
I've never even heard of any of them.

185
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,700
Yeah. I've never even heard of them.
Yeah. I haven't even heard of him. Well,

186
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:40,990
now there's so much stuff to watch.

187
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,880
You heard they just got rid
of another Oscar host. Yeah.

188
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,550
Evidently he trips somebody in like
outdoor recess it like in 1983. Oh,

189
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,060
that was it. And there was some
sort of getting me in kindergarten.

190
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,440
Kindergarten thing. Yeah. And so,
yeah, I don't know. I don't blame him.

191
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,120
I don't blame him because
that was a mistake.

192
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,300
That was a mistake that
he made in his past. Yeah.

193
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,390
And tripping is never should be how
many times you apologize for it.

194
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,430
It's never cool. No, I think all,

195
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:10,540
I think all mistakes in life should
disqualify everyone from any future

196
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,760
endeavors. If you're human. Yes, yes.

197
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,050
No mistake should be allowed for in,
in the human condition.

198
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,160
Perfect people. Perfect. People should
host award shows. Perfect. People should,

199
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,660
when Heisman trophies, they should, uh,

200
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,030
host award shows 70 people like
us. Perfect. People like us.

201
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,770
So I want to add for younger kids now
because so much of this shit is like on

202
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:38,690
video and just summit. You get
there, you're going to be fun. Nick,

203
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,150
the amount of the population that won't
be able to run for any sort of office.

204
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,430
I just wonder,
you know,

205
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,700
there's always pendulums and everything
and right now the pendulum is over.

206
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:53,080
Two people want to, is it Penn
dilemma? Pendulum. You might be right.

207
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,330
I don't know anybody.
She's Arron pendulum pendulum.

208
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,830
Oh, I'm getting a nod that I'm
right. Look at it once, look at that.

209
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,530
But once penned alum,
well it's a pendulum.

210
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,080
You went to Florida schools pendulum.
Well there,

211
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,370
did you go to Ponce de Leon in high
school? I went to Pendleton high school.

212
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,600
I went to the High Fountain
of Youth Junior high.

213
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,560
I went to Christopher Columbus high
school. Of course you did talk about,

214
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,850
you know, politically incorrect in
today's world. You know another guy who,

215
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,860
where like where all of that new evidence
came. If he did all of that shit.

216
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,660
What did he write it all down? He
tweeted it. A toy. Oh, they went back to,

217
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,610
is this tweet to do you got to do a sketch
about that? Cause he's on the lumber,

218
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,030
say go back and hey, you know, it
was on the Santa Maria, you know,

219
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,900
and it's a lot of time going from Spain
or wherever they left from over to the

220
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,900
new world. So we would just
sit back in his cabin and tweet

221
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,750
uncredible Wifi when went across the US.

222
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,530
Um, so anyway, I, yeah, I do.

223
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,200
I went to a Columbus high school.
I forget the point of,

224
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,160
I forget the question and what my answer
is. I don't know, but I'm enjoying it.

225
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,200
All right,
good talk anytime you can.

226
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:16,090
You talk about Columbus tweeting when
he should be captain in the Santa Maria.

227
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,290
Uh,
it's actually a great premise.

228
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,880
Like how quickly would Hitler get kicked
off at Twitter? The second he got on

229
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,720
Hitler,
you said Queer.

230
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,370
You can't say that. That's a
great sketch. All these people.

231
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,580
And then you got to have like, you
know, Mother Teresa when she was young,

232
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:44,030
something she did. I don't know.
Who knows? Uh, anyways, what's your,

233
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:48,160
are you still see you a college football
guy? What was your deal? I played,

234
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,280
I played college. That's what it was.
Um, a small school division three.

235
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,110
So, um, it was sorta like a school,
Heidelberg College and Tiffin, Ohio.

236
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,820
Loved my years there and just,
you know, Midwestern school,

237
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:05,660
just like if you were to film a
movie and a mid Western campus,

238
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,540
this is the perfect place. You
know, just a thousand students.

239
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:13,540
Everybody knew each other and a future
supreme court justices either say,

240
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,380
yeah, right, right. It wasn't perfect tab,

241
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,790
but wasn't underneath what was happening.
So I played football there.

242
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,680
Love that. I actually tried out
for a semipro football team.

243
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,170
When did it happen in
those leaks by the way?

244
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,800
The a f a I'm sure you've heard of that.
No,

245
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,300
nobody has the American
Football Association. Okay.

246
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,190
And uh, they had a, they
were forming this new league,

247
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,660
so there was a team going to form in
Orlando called the Orlando Americans.

248
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,980
They're going to play in the
Tangerine Bowl. Nice. Hi.

249
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,660
Buddy of mine went up and try it
out and they invited him to camp.

250
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,240
He's a quarterback. He played at
Notre Dame and he said, Reagan,

251
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:57,860
you should go up there
and try out as a receiver.

252
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:01,970
I played receiver in college and I'm like,
I am that guy that was out of shape,

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,900
you know, it was like a year and a
half after college because no, the,

254
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,090
the talent up there is the
kind that you could fit in.

255
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:13,091
So I went up and try it out of this
big mass tryout and invited me to camp.

256
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,830
Wow.
They invited me to camp.

257
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:19,100
They brought a nine receivers into camp.

258
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,250
But when,
then we had to try out from there.

259
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,580
They were only going to keep three
receivers. They had like a skeletal squat,

260
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:29,480
like two starters and one backup,
you know, and they cut down to five.

261
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,110
I was one of the five, I was one of the
five left. Nice. And then they, uh, I had,

262
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,610
I did a post corner pattern
and through my hip out and um,

263
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,970
I don't think I would've made it
anyway, but they cut me, cut me.

264
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,820
I'm just picturing you running in your,
your standup crouch.

265
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,390
Like that's why you threw your HIPAA.
What year was that?

266
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,980
I will always say how old?
How old are you?

267
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,890
Uh, well that was like 20. No. Yeah,

268
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:58,000
it was probably 20 to 22. I
already too out of shape. Yeah.

269
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,440
That's how it is.

270
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,400
No, no, I was, I meant that as
like a compliment to athletes I up,

271
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,140
I think I had a cousin, uh, played
a little semipro football. Um,

272
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,320
does the least still exist?
Is that an actually an actual way into,

273
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:15,270
I feel like it's the CFL or you
walk on and you know, or that's it.

274
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:20,271
Like as far as getting into the after
college to try and get into the NFL,

275
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,290
I figured either going to stand out at
the CFL and even then that's a long shot

276
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,560
or he just try to get a
walk on right after college.

277
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,701
Well,
I,

278
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:34,410
I had no aspirations of
making it in the NFL zero,

279
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,363
you know,

280
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,510
but the fact that my buddy
thought this one team, I thought,

281
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:43,120
well this could be a good experience
for a year or two if I could get on the

282
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:48,040
team. And uh, you know,
that that particular league
doesn't exist anymore. So

283
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,770
what exactly did you do? Your hip?
I did a post corner pattern. Yup.

284
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,610
45 degree angle and then cut back out.

285
00:17:56,611 --> 00:18:00,750
I had these hip pads that were too
tight and I just remember feeling like a

286
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:05,250
sprawling, oh no. And I have no idea.

287
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,920
Like I didn't have money to go
to a doctor and I was like that.

288
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:12,390
I just couldn't walk. Kind of hard
to make a team when you can't walk.

289
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,160
So wait for that feeling to go away and
then you just sold it still hasn't gone

290
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:22,040
away. I continued on with your life.
It still hurts. It still hurts.

291
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,450
My knee hurts from football, you
know, uh, when I was in college,

292
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:30,470
I had a knee thing and they would shoot
me up with cortisone for the games

293
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,660
because we had to keep this oh
and eight streak going. Oh yeah.

294
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,220
You know what I mean? And they would
shoot me up with cortisone. It was, uh,

295
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,140
it was amazing because,
uh,

296
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,830
the pain was so intense when
they didn't shoot me up.

297
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:50,730
Like I could barely walk and then they
would shoot me up before the games and

298
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm going to field running
around like a deer, you know,

299
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:56,820
like I felt like Bambi like,
but while I'm running,

300
00:18:56,821 --> 00:19:00,780
I'm practically hearing crunch,
crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.

301
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,920
It's just twisted my knee up,
you know, and I finally quit.

302
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,870
I quit college because of the knee.

303
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:10,230
I was worried that it was going to do
permanent damage to it. Did you, I mean,

304
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:13,920
it still hurts it dad a little bit
here and there, but uh, yeah. Yeah. He,

305
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:16,920
one of those weather guys, nice
starts acting up. You're like,

306
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:17,870
this is going to be a twister.

307
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,440
That's my hip. It's going
to be a cold front. Um,

308
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,370
I can tell asteroids when an asteroid is
coming. Oh really? That's interesting.

309
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,170
Yeah.
Is that your hip or your knee?

310
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,530
My hip is like if there's an
incoming asteroid and mine,

311
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,400
my knee lets me know if there's an
earthquake coming. How's was been wired?

312
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:41,850
Bizarre. You know what I think
here at all things comedy,

313
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:46,020
we could cut a side deal with
the weather channel. You know,

314
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,160
let's just cut over to Regan anything
hurting the Regan report and then we go,

315
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,660
oh,
oh,

316
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,610
oh I feel a magnitude six coming on.

317
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,583
You know,

318
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,450
I really resent to channels that I
used to actually enjoy was the weather

319
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:05,284
channel.

320
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,430
I actually used to like watching it and
for some stupid reason ended discovery

321
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:13,510
channel and both of them, you know,
I dunno, I dunno what they did.

322
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,320
I don't like how the, you know,
the discovery channel further,

323
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,270
like make sharks look out.
Like they're just inherently mean things,

324
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,900
you know, with all this shit going on
now we sit that and whenever you watch,

325
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,330
you know something on sharks,

326
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,090
they're always telling you now
people is a misconception about it.

327
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:35,900
But then the whole way they sh they sell
shark week is that jaws vibe, right.

328
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,140
You know,
they put a ski mask on him and stuff.

329
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:40,750
They always said they'd been typecast
and I would think with all this

330
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:44,260
progressive talk out there that someone
would speak up in them and then the

331
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:46,120
weather channel,
they went the way,

332
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,060
the food network where they used to
just tell you what the weather was and

333
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,600
they'd have some Weirdo and now it's like
all personality driven and they got to

334
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:57,130
make it sound like Jesus is going to show
up every time it fucking rains as a my

335
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:01,060
issues. Those are the things that keep me
up at night. I feel that about, um, CNN,

336
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,730
headline news, not regular CNN, CNN,

337
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:08,731
headline news used to be 30 minutes of
just news with the most middle of the

338
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:13,660
road news anchor. And I'm like,
this is the way it's supposed to be.

339
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,050
Just a guy just telling you nice
and straight what's going on.

340
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,900
And now it's personality driven.

341
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:21,760
They have just like you're talking
about these other gyms, angry people,

342
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:26,020
hot chicks, this person, that person.
Yeah. I saw one the other night,

343
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:30,010
the local La News here and uh,
they teased this for half an hour.

344
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,940
A guy got cut off on a motorcycle,
went over his handlebars in the highway,

345
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,420
got a couple of bumps and bruises
but was fine, but he filmed it.

346
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,250
He had a little camera on top of his head,

347
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,410
so they just kept filming the
footage on the five south.

348
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,250
May Am happens, it's this guy splitting
lanes. I mean his legal out here,

349
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:50,430
but that's what he's still are.
The guy just went, you know,

350
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,060
the guy went to change lanes.
I didn't see him.

351
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,750
He hit went up and over and they
were like, yeah, after 80 teeth,

352
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,410
the whole fucking like this,
this is an actual news, right.

353
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,200
Then if you ride a motorcycle in La,

354
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,720
you could probably going to go down at
some point and he didn't even get fucking

355
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:07,650
hurt. If he died, I'd be like, wow. All
right. But it wasn't, it was like a,

356
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:10,040
it was like the first draft
of a script where it's like,

357
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,670
you got to raise the stakes.
Can he go?

358
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,570
Can he go over the handlebars into
the oncoming traffic? Can we get,

359
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,040
can we get some of that? But the whole
thing, and he just led for 20 minutes.

360
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,070
They teased it and then I finally see
the footage that I already been watching.

361
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:24,240
They didn't have any more footage.

362
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,440
And then they interviewed him and they're
like, how do you feel? He's like, yeah,

363
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,050
you know I'm all right.
Yeah,

364
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,330
I guess it was news because the guy
who hit him walked up to him said,

365
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:35,780
are you okay? And he said yes. And
then he got in the car and peeled away.

366
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,790
So they had his face looking at them,

367
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,370
you know, so I guess that, I
guess that was the news aspect,

368
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,700
whether it was a hit and run like hell.
The guy that he didn't care enough.

369
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,770
The guy who hit him while he took
off. Yeah, I think he did plenty.

370
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,870
[inaudible] House. He got
out. He said, you are.

371
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,440
The mistake he made is he peeled away.
That indicates guilt.

372
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,470
What he should have done was just signaled
and got back on the highway and just

373
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:03,170
be like guy. I thought it was
fine. I got out. I asked him,

374
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:07,490
I knew he had the Gopro on. I knew I was
on camera so I didn't do anything wrong.

375
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,000
He had a helmet on. Defense attorney.
I didn't have a helmet. I was fine.

376
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:13,460
I figure he'd be fine to
look at the side of my car.

377
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,440
I was out here in la one time
watching the local news. They said,

378
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:19,370
we have breaking news right?

379
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,210
And they had a helicopter footage of
a home who's the garage was on fire.

380
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:33,070
And I'm like the only person that would
possibly give a damn about this grudge

381
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:39,150
being on fire is the guy who lives in
that house. Yeah. Think about our target.

382
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,120
Nobody else would care about their garage.
Been on file yet.

383
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,220
It was breaking news.

384
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,130
Well it used to be when I lived out here
in the 90s I remember I was just like,

385
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:53,150
this news out here is a fucking joke.
And then somewhere along the line,

386
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:56,910
national news caught up to what they
were doing out here in la. Cause when I,

387
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:59,690
I kind of stopped, I don't know
if this is probably a bad thing,

388
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:03,800
but I kind of stopped watching the
shit like at least seven years ago.

389
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,293
Um,

390
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,310
like right now I'm trying to remember
the name of the vice president and the

391
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:14,390
first one that I thought was Joe Biden,
but that was the last one. Mike Pence.

392
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,880
Mike Pence. Yeah. Okay. See that?

393
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,550
I mean that's literally the backup
quarterback to the United States.

394
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,020
I don't know his fucking
name. I can understand. Not
No one. The uh, what was it?

395
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,550
The Secretary of defense?
The treasurer. The uh,

396
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,370
no, if I know those, the coordinator of a,

397
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,210
cause they keep changing in the current
administration. So it is hard to keep up.

398
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,390
But usually when they, when they ride
for years, I can remember them all.

399
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,670
Oh, is that what it is? I
don't, I don't, I don't pretend
to know. All right, so what,

400
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,870
what else can we talk about
here? Anything, anything
else you want to promote?

401
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:46,704
You got some standup dates?

402
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,280
I'm in a,
I'm in a,

403
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,790
I get to where the actors hat
and a show called Loudermilk,

404
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,890
the farrier milk.
Fairly brothers Peter Fairly.

405
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,620
They did dumb and dumber and all
that. They've done some things. Yeah.

406
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,740
Well there's huge and they're like, well,
the funniest fucking people ever. Well,

407
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:07,570
Peter Fairly and a guy named Bobby
Mort created a show called Loudermilk.

408
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,580
It's about substance abuse, dark comedy.
It's on a direct TV's audience network.

409
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:14,290
We just got picked up
for our third season.

410
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,820
I play a guy recovering from
substance abuse and uh, I,

411
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,500
I love it. I never did. Never had an
opportunity to do a lot of acting.

412
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:27,730
And uh, sounds great. I,
it's just so much fun.

413
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,380
What is your character addicted to? Uh,
alcohol, clay, Lubes, the whole thing.

414
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,530
Had a big family and had a falling out
with his family and the whole thing.

415
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:39,580
And uh, but it's funny but serious,
serious and funny. Mostly funny.

416
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,890
And Ron Livingston please. The,
the main dude. Um, and it's,

417
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,400
yeah, and it's like a group discussion
thing, you know, like an AA meeting,

418
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:51,400
but it's about people. I have
direct TV. How can I see this?

419
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,270
It's on the audience network. Every
Tuesday night. Audience Network.

420
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:58,390
So is that somewhere in my thing?
If you have direct TV,

421
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,810
you should have the audience network. It's
just a channel on there. What channel?

422
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,380
I think two 39 to 39.
What is it?

423
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,100
500 500 Jesus Christ.
You weren't even close.

424
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,370
Three [inaudible] this fucking thing.
You know, you know what Shannon,

425
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:15,970
I know it's on two 39 where I live,
it's it on 500 as well.

426
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,530
Oh, I don't know. But uh, on

427
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,870
the bus it's 500. All right.
So if you're in a house,

428
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:26,170
it's two 39 if you cause the channels
at the same but directv because that's

429
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:29,080
what I like cause I haven't direct TV.

430
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:31,290
You go on the road and I like
going to the hotel. I already,

431
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:36,130
I know ESPN is going to
be 206207208 you know, uh,

432
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,680
the redhead channel is a 798

433
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,600
I get the ginger report and see if
it's okay to go outside that day.

434
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,720
Jesus Christ,
look playing everything close to the vest.

435
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:49,560
What else do you got going on?

436
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:51,950
He had talked to you a fuck fucking
half hour before I find out you were in

437
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,470
third season of a show. That's all right.
A lot of people don't know about it.

438
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,820
You know it, it's an obscure, it's hard.
A lot of people haven't seen it yet,

439
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,640
but it's getting a lot of good buzz
and starting to get some traction.

440
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,610
Don't you feel like you almost have to
do three seasons of a show now just for

441
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,260
the general population to know that
it exists. It's amazing to me. I mean,

442
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,150
when I started in this business,

443
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:15,960
if I would've thought that I would be
on a TV show that my friends don't even

444
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:20,040
know about and I'm not exaggerating,
I have friends who go, Oh really?

445
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,520
You're on a show?
And it's like,

446
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:24,600
my parents have never seen the show that
I'm on just for the simple fact that I

447
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,650
can't figure out Netflix. Like they
came from an age, you just walked up.

448
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:32,820
He just pulled the Knob, turned
on the TV, four or five or seven.

449
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:34,440
What do you want to watch?
So they're not going to sit back.

450
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:37,170
I did a wide and then
they got that they can,

451
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:41,190
then they got to type in and search
like they just can be, I'm not, I'm not,

452
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,510
you know, I'm not fucking
doing that. They, they are,
uh, they are old school. So,

453
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,600
yeah. Um, I actually talked to
somebody have told this story before.

454
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:51,900
I talked one night I was talking to
another comedian and I was telling her how

455
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:55,970
much she liked how much I liked her
show she was taking. Oh, that's great.

456
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,610
[inaudible] we talked for 10 minutes
before she realized the show I was talking

457
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:04,350
about had already been canceled and she
thought I was talking about a different

458
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:07,160
TV show that she was on that I
had never heard of. That's crazy.

459
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,400
Then I told her that I had a TV show and
she had never heard of that and I was

460
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:11,521
like,

461
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:15,390
do you understand how fucked I could see
if we both worked at a lumber yard or

462
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:19,950
one of us did, but we're both
in this business. You're like,

463
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,630
you're like shooting, you know, you
don't even know what you're aiming at.

464
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,700
And we're both on beyond the first season.

465
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:30,510
So there is some sort of success to both
that shows that we're on and we still

466
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:35,200
have, we still haven't heard about them.
Wow. Um, anyways, where are you? Gonna I,

467
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:39,000
I saw, um, I had an
embarrassing moment with the,

468
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,740
Colin Quinn has showed tough,
tough crowd and uh,

469
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,270
you know, I saw him at a charity event
or something like that and said, hey man,

470
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,580
it's what you to know.
I'm loving you on tough crowd.

471
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,620
And he said it's off the air for
like four years, you know. Oh God,

472
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,430
you just feel so stupid. You know, like
that's, that's always the conversation.

473
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:02,520
First conversation, I would
have a colon coin. I, he,

474
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:05,670
there was a movie out that he
was getting credit for writing.

475
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,840
Uh Oh my God, what the
fuck was it called? It was,

476
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:13,470
it was the one with Daymond Waynes
in the Celtic Celtic pride. Okay.

477
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,730
I met him at my first
comics come home and,

478
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,750
and we're literally out
in front of the crowd.

479
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:22,320
I can't believe I worked with Colin Quinn,
Denis leary and all of these guys.

480
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,680
The crowd's doing a standing ovation.
Fucking Cam Neely standing there.

481
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,040
I'm like three years into the business,
right. I can't believe I'm a part of this.

482
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,290
And I see Collin and I'm like,
oh my God,

483
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,050
that's Colin Quinn from our
remote control SNL. And I'm like,

484
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:36,240
what do I say to this
guy? So I, and I was just,

485
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:41,040
oh cause I auditioned for the
movie. So, um, I lied and said,

486
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,470
saw it cause I didn't see it. I said,
hey man, I really enjoyed Celtic pride.

487
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,590
And he goes, I didn't write that piece of
shit. They took that away from us. Well,

488
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,340
I was like, oh my God. I
said the exact wrong thing.

489
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,200
That's what I get for trying to kiss ass.

490
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,660
But I made a mental note to never tell
somebody that I saw a movie that he

491
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:03,610
didn't see again. And I've broken
that. You have to, in this business,

492
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:08,380
you have to do it. Uh, speaking,
uh, golf. Golfing. Did you
say you were golfing with?

493
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:12,190
Right. Let's put Colin, is that we, we
met any minimum on the golf channel thing?

494
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,070
No, no, no. At a charity
show is where I saw Jesus.

495
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:18,320
I'm so [inaudible] list to my
goddamn guests. Well, you, you,

496
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,860
you do you have golf or I gotta go,
I gotta go on this thing.

497
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:24,460
When is this thing going to be here,
Brian and comes out to me or, dude,

498
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:28,780
you got to go on this, this three day.
It's like, it's like a spa, right? Yeah.

499
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:32,110
Give you sober up.
You can chill out and eat.

500
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,370
Nothing but a lot of fruits and
vegetables and we golf probiotics.

501
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:40,600
We do hot yoga. We go back,
we have a, we do hot yoga,

502
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,710
getting hip aligned again
and a lot of meditating,

503
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,740
a lot of meditating and it's just so,
it's so good for all,

504
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:51,610
all the fellows to get together.
Yeah.

505
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,270
So when did you got to be involved?
When is the next one? Uh, probably May,

506
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,660
but uh, yeah, I'd love to
have you involved, man.

507
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,700
I always feel like whenever I run into
the, the few times that I go on the wagon,

508
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,210
I then that's when I run into,
I sat my boots with you is,

509
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,340
was in New York and that was
that time. It was, it was,

510
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,650
it wasn't just the guys
that was men and women.

511
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:21,530
So they picked like this fancy fucking
place and that waiter came over and you,

512
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:25,030
you ordered like a Budweiser or
something like that guy. Sorry Missoula.

513
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:26,080
He did not have it.
Oh,

514
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:29,380
we haven't said these even the day and
you're just staring at him waiting for

515
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:31,750
him to finish. You're
like, is that a bear?

516
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,220
And you're like, okay,
I'll have one of those

517
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,800
when I love you weren't even trying to be
funny. You're looking at this guy like,

518
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:45,640
is it going gonna be a fucking
test at the end of this? Um,

519
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,300
and then I saw you more recently at a,

520
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:53,050
at a bar in New York and you weren't,
you weren't having cocktails at the time.

521
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,120
And then I felt guilty. I'm like,
I'm like six in here. No, I,

522
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,570
every once in a while I just, I, I, you
know, I shut it down for a little while.

523
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,830
Uh, I'm going to hopefully shoot another
special coming up soon and I just don't

524
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:07,910
want to go through the whole
fuck. I got to drop, you know,

525
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,570
20 pounds of pizza and beer.
I don't,

526
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,280
I don't feel like doing
that this time around.

527
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:16,630
So I'm also doing it during the
holiday. So my game plan is, uh,

528
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,630
I'll be three weeks in on Saturday.
I'm taking one night off,

529
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,780
which is dangerous for me because I'm a
big binge drinker. You know what I mean?

530
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,930
I'm, I'm goal oriented,
you know, I see a bottom,

531
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:28,580
I want to finish it right
now. One of these, these,

532
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,070
these path ass people that leave
sync in the dish dishes in the sink.

533
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:35,400
So I can't even speak now.

534
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,640
So I'm going to make a dinner for
my wife and then I'm going to,

535
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,730
we're going to drink a split,
a bottle of wine. There you go.

536
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:45,710
In the game plan is to
immediately go back on the wagon.

537
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:49,310
However, one of my buddies from New
York is also in town and he said, hey,

538
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:50,650
let's hang out Monday something.

539
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,600
Well maybe Sunday and Monday
and this is what happens.

540
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,390
Then it becomes Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
right? And next thing you know, you know,

541
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,100
I uh, I love, I think we chatted
about this in the past. I,

542
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,760
I, I get my work done. You know,

543
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:12,761
I work hard and what I do and I
put my nose to the grindstone,

544
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,310
you know what I mean? But you're giving
me the classic, I work hard, play hard.

545
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,390
But when you guys, you can see that
the, when I did more hand movement,

546
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,580
Trump's got to get this much about it.
Like it's like the thumb and index finger.

547
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:26,510
Everything else is lined up.

548
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:29,900
And then the pinkies up like you're
a little tea cup, but when I,

549
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,850
well I'm going to go out, you know,
like, and I'm safe about it. Car Service,

550
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:39,050
the whole thing guys together,
you know, getting ballistic.

551
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:44,110
I liked those moments or
those evenings and it's good.

552
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,030
No, no, I love those months. You know,

553
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,240
when you get lit up half the year.
I hate the winter.

554
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,630
I don't want to remember it.
That's right. I want to be warm.

555
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,020
That's what hibernation
is all about. Yeah. Um,

556
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,600
so it's probably not a good
message for people out there, but a

557
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,980
problem with it. It's like Jesus Christ
my advice. That's my advice. Yeah.

558
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,180
That is mine too. So I, I, you know,

559
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:15,740
I shut it down for a couple of months
and then I slowly start back up again.

560
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:19,700
And then when I just, I just feel like
it's getting out of control of like,

561
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:23,120
I'm just, you know, I'm just
living too much of a, a, you know,

562
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:24,981
I dunno.

563
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:28,040
Just too much of a slothful the whole
state because what happens is everything

564
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:31,370
goes off the rails. It's not just,
okay, I'm having too many cocktails.

565
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,000
It's like I'm also eating a steak and
cheese. You want to fry side salad,

566
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:39,350
I'll take the fries. Well done. I start
doing that shit. So, um, you know,

567
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:41,800
every once in a while I just,
I sort of dial it back and uh,

568
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,150
and I dial it back and I get eight
hours sleep and I, I'm just sort of a,

569
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,620
I like it in the morning,
but the rest of the day I'm sad.

570
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,980
So you like waking up like having not
drank the night before and go ahead.

571
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:59,300
It's fine. I'm glad you know, eight
hours sleep, nobody go apologize to,

572
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,440
but then, you know, once after breakfast,
man, it's just really like the gloom.

573
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,680
All right man. The next weekend you're
in. Yeah, I'm definitely in for that. Uh,

574
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:11,810
is it while you're in Vegas,
right? He's going to be out there.

575
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:14,430
I don't know if I could do, I don't
think, I think I know it's a good idea.

576
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,910
This next one's in Florida. We do it
in a different place. Every, every, AH,

577
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,400
Jesus Christ.
I had to pick the year.

578
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,770
It's all going the other side of the
fucking country. I'm going to, I'm,

579
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,360
we'll spring for a private
jet for you can, you know,

580
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,790
can you just book me at a
Magellan's fucking comedy club?

581
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,450
Every comedy club down there always seems
to be like, you know, the Captain Hook,

582
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:38,430
the barge, the, the uh,

583
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,010
whatever the fuck is the top.
The tugboat.

584
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,960
Tommy's Tommy's didn't
get down in Boca Raton.

585
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,460
It's funny. It's a guy from
the Florida keys. He books, uh,

586
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,980
he books almost to Cuba. Comedy
Club, whatever. All right, sorry.

587
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:58,290
I'm sitting here reading, trying
to make dumb jokes. Um, all right,

588
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:02,280
so stand up in a way for episodes.
Netflix, Christmas Eve. Uh,

589
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,760
are you a, you're going to be celebrating
holidays or anything like that?

590
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,080
A New Year's Eve.
I'm performing finally.

591
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:13,440
I get you to fucking plug a date.
What does it take me 20 minutes?

592
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,190
He just told me, cause I didn't plug them
on any other thing. He said, you know,

593
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:21,990
if there's an opportunity, this is Dave,
my tour guy. Smart Guy. Yeah. He said,

594
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,910
you know, part of this is plugging things.
He didn't say it that way. He goes,

595
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:30,180
if you can plug your New Year's eve date.
So here I am going to be here.

596
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:34,420
I am smoothly plugging my New Year's eve
date, Chicago, the Chicago theater. Ah,

597
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,990
New Year's Eve.
That's tremendous.

598
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,840
But that I'm not bringing in the new year.

599
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,490
I'm not on stage doing the countdown.
I always, what time's your show?

600
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,050
Eight o'clock. It'll be over,
you know, like nine 30, nine 45.

601
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:53,100
But I want people in Chicago knowing that
like you come to the show and then you

602
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:55,580
go to a party and have fun. I'm not
going to, you know it all night.

603
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,641
Chael let down.

604
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:59,620
I've done those and then you got to come
out and it's like a DJ still spinning

605
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,770
around. Why they want to hear,
keep doing your fucking job.

606
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,070
No, I can't. I can't, I
can't be. I'm an MC to uh,

607
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,780
the countdown and they've
already shut off the bar.

608
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,500
It's everybody's just standing
there sort of starting to sober up.

609
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,280
Good. I got mad at everybody
and then it's just over now.

610
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,760
Guy. Get the fuck Outta here.
Yeah, I would even rules

611
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,980
worked this many years at this job so
I can count from 10 to zero backwards.

612
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,670
And I've done that so many fucking, oh
my God, all those years of doing that,

613
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:32,170
I don't even work new years anymore.

614
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,740
I work a couple extra in November
and December and then I just,

615
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,410
I take that night off so I'm going to
take my wife out is what I'm going to do.

616
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,390
There you go. She doesn't know that yet
cause I usually a surprise. Yeah, yeah,

617
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,650
yeah. So that's what I'm
going to do. All right,

618
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,500
so that's it everybody. Brian,
Regan, everybody. By the way, dude,

619
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:48,210
you always such a huge influence on me.

620
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:52,980
You were one of the greatest comics I've
ever seen and just decade after decade,

621
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:56,070
just still in, you
know, the upper echelon,

622
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:59,640
everybody always brings you up when they
go the best guys ever the best fucking

623
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:04,170
albums and all of that stuff. So if you're
in the Chicago area, New Year's Eve,

624
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,990
it's an eight o'clock show.
He's not doing the countdown.

625
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,450
So get some friends to hang,
you know,

626
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:13,910
go to the show and then afterwards
pick a bar and a last time, uh,

627
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:18,330
stand up and away for episodes.
Netflix, Christmas Eve before you wrap

628
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,910
up, I, I have to say, I
think you're a genius.

629
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:24,450
I think you're wonderful at what you do
when you throw me a compliment that way

630
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,800
it means the world to me.

631
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:29,430
I love watching your craft
and how much you put into it.

632
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:31,290
You have a wonderful comedic mind.

633
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,170
So that compliment coming from you
means the world to me. Thank you.

634

definition in the dictionary. Uh,

678
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,220

00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,960
You determine what you want and

681
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:32,380
Do you do it for once a month to
once every six months? Oh yeah.

682
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:35,030
I guess you do it on website.
She says,

683

The Monday morning podcast for Monday,

December 13th, 2010. How the hell are you?

737
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,010
I've had that fucking song in my head.

738
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,500
I heard it on the radio
and like the grocery store,

739
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,100
you know I was going in
there to go buy a ham,

740
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,770
some glaze Jenelle gelatinous shit.
Right.

741
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,270
And I was in there and there
was this song, yeah, on the uh,

742
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:58,170
on the speakers there,

743
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:01,770
the sealant of the grocery store
that I just mentioned I was at,

744
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,080
if you forgot already, you
know, and I'm driving around,

745
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:09,910
I got this big fucking ham sitting in
my grocery cart and they'll through the

746
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:13,360
speakers, it's just this guy. It sounded
like it was from maybe the fifties,

747
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:19,180
you know, it's the holiday
season. Doobie Doobie do,

748
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,910
I can't remember if you went Dolby,

749
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:24,880
Dolby doe or that's just
how I remember hearing it.

750
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,230
I'm trying to give you more lyrics cause
I got to know the name of this song

751
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:30,280
cause I want to download it.

752
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,420
I want to drive around La in 80
degree weather on Christmas, you know,

753
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:40,200
with a stupid look on my face listening
to that song. How the rest of it go.

754
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,670
It's the holiday season,
Doobie Doobie. Do Hey,

755
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:46,830
just take a kid Katie and you cut
something like that. I can't remember.

756
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,460
You know all that is, you know
when that, you know the, the uh,

757
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,990
what is it when they do
that thing where uh, no,

758
00:46:55,991 --> 00:47:00,730
that that elevator music from the 1950s
where they actually took like sorta like

759
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:03,310
Blues Progression and I
dunno what they did to it.

760
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:07,450
So it's almost like still has
like the bed, but the habit there,

761
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:11,150
but that data, maybe
that's more swing, Eh,

762
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,590
you fucking stick it in your cut,
something like that.

763
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,450
But obviously it's a lot more,
uh,

764
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,830
has a lot more family values two or
whatever. It's the holiday season.

765
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,770
So please for the love of God. So I'll
stop singing this fucking song. Somebody,

766
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,610
somebody let me know what the name of
that song is. Okay. And before I forget,

767
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,040
which, I don't know how
I would, all right. Um,

768
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,610
you know,
we do underrated overrated every week.

769
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,330
Do you guys remember that from the last
three fucking years and be doing it just

770
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:46,000
about every Monday. I got
one for you. Underrated.

771
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,340
The black Crowes underrated.

772
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,170
Despite the fact that the selling out
these huge venues, this still underrated.

773
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,560
I went to go see him a Saturday
night or say as they say in Boston,

774
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,893
it's amazing.

775
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,190
They actually take that word that has so
many consonants and they remove all of

776
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:11,191
them like a cancer when you're going
to come on and come over with say a

777
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,800
Saturday night at the palladium,

778
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:19,390
the same place where Richard Pryor
tapes live on the sunset strip.

779
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:24,450
I went down and I saw the black Crowes
play truth and salvage company opening up

780
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,010
and the black Crowes played
three hours people three hours,

781
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,350
hour and a half acoustic set,

782
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,910
and then they take a break like fucking
barely 12 minutes and they come back out

783
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:40,960
again. Basically after kicking the shit
out of the crowd for an hour and a half,

784
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:45,580
they take a 12 minute break,
right? Just to go back, you know,

785
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,420
have a cigarette and a little shot of
Gatorade and they go right back out again

786
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,950
and kick the shit out of the crowd
for another hour and a half. Uh,

787
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,660
it's easily the best show
I've seen in like 10,

788
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:03,460
12 years. And um, I
don't, I just go see them.

789
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,610
They're up in San Francisco. If you're
in the area that playing the Fillmore,

790
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,950
all this, uh, all this week. And
uh, they, they were unbelievable.

791
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:15,550
And the greatest thing that I liked
about it was everything that you were

792
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:20,551
hearing was being produced by human
beings that the humans that were on the

793
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:26,350
stage as opposed to all this other
shit that you go to see. Now,

794
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:28,480
I'm not saying these people
aren't talented, but you know,

795
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,270
I've been flipping through the
channels like an old man, you know,

796
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:35,170
four fingers inside the fucking
waistband and my pajamas,

797
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,460
you know, the guy, you know, the,

798
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:43,660
the fucking was that married with
children just sitting there, you know,

799
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,610
you got the remote, the
other hand clicking through
and you see like, like, uh,

800
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,950
you know,
these little pop tarts.

801
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:53,380
Even a guy like usher who
is tremendously talented,

802
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,000
the singing and the
dancing and all that shit.

803
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,290
You're hearing all of these instruments
that are not on the fucking stage.

804
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,640
And then you're also hearing like,
I can't say with him,

805
00:50:03,641 --> 00:50:04,990
I can't remember who exactly it was,

806
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:09,991
but like you here at least it's like
the person is singing with themselves.

807
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:15,460
They have the track going
and it's like, so I dunno,

808
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,790
musically, socially acceptable
now, like back in the day,

809
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:22,150
if you've got busted doing that, that
was like the end of your fucking career.

810
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,710
Everybody's just like, he's the
fucking sell out man. And that was it.

811
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,130
It didn't shit. So the fuck am
I trying to say? It was awesome.

812
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,620
It was unbelievable show. And
uh, recently I finally started,

813
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,760
uh,
downloading us actually some little feet.

814
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,100
It's a band like 20 years ago,

815
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,760
guys I worked with in this warehouse
with telling me I should get into.

816
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:51,500
And when I finally got around to doing
it and downloaded their greatest hits and

817
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:55,430
that live album, uh, uh,
Christ, what's it called?

818
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:01,010
Waiting for Columbus, I believe. And uh,
they have a song on there called Whelan.

819
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,950
And I had listened to it, if
someone was saying, Oh yeah,

820
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,220
the guy wrote it and that's why he got
kicked out of fucking Frank Zappa's band.

821
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:09,740
And then he made fucking,
and he got with little flunk story short,

822
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,630
the Black Crowes ended up,
uh,

823
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,280
they closed out their set
singing that song and it was,
it was, I was just a shit.

824
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,780
It was even the way they ended this set.
They didn't do the big fucking, you know,

825
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,280
you know where they are just sitting there
strumming that one note in the guitar

826
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,090
and a fucking drummer sitting there
smashing all assembles. Thanks.

827
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,330
[inaudible] you been quite good.
I didn't even do that.

828
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,900
They played this really cool fucking song
and it ended on this nice just I was,

829
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,280
it was the shit. It was the shit.
So if you get a chance to see him,

830
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,990
please go see him. And uh, the
drummer of that band, Steve Gorman,

831
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,620
uh, has a podcast and a few
baseball fans out there to, uh,

832
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,950
or sports fans in general.

833
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,240
It's a sports podcast and a this week,
Tuesday,

834
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,550
I believe he's going to upload it.
Uh,

835
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,650
he interviewed a useless from the, uh,
the red sox. So please check that out.

836
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:07,520
And if you're not into sports,
please go see them at the Fillmore.

837
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,770
I'm sure they're already sold out,
but it was, it was fucking awesome.

838
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,940
So there you go. There's my plug.
I am in a generous mood this week.

839
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,540
You know why?
Because it's the holiday season.

840
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,860
Dooby dooby Doo and you stick it up.
Your fucking comment.

841
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,750
Sorry, I just, I got a
jar this loose in my head.

842
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,670
I'm going to figure out what
it is. So anyways, well,

843
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:35,671
well well a lot has happened since the
last time I did my podcast has an invoice

844
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,170
and girls,
a lot of things have happened.

845
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,960
Does anybody know what I'm talking about?
Just you know,

846
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:49,961
it isn't that an amazing thing
about life that in six short days,

847
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,790
seven days,
if you're into math,

848
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,620
how many fucking things can happen
and just a little seven day period.

849
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:02,950
If you go back eight days and you
think of what you thought about certain

850
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:08,531
aspects of the world and how different
European is a mere eight days later,

851
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,250
what would be a good example of that ass
shit? I don't know. Let's see. Let's,

852
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:20,420
let's just take your average
fucking Joe from eight days ago.

853
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,570
Like, I dunno. Let's say like a jets fan.

854
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,340
A jets eight fucking

855
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,560
days ago,
Huh?

856
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:35,000
What you oh my God. I was just
looking at my fucking my recorder.

857
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,110
I thought that whole thing. I thought,
I thought I didn't record it. I died.

858
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,740
I thought, I thought, I thought
he said you wanted one. Um,

859
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,690
I thought the thing had shut off.
Let's continue here. Goddammit.

860
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,510
I just fucked up my momentum.
A jets fan eight days ago.

861
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:52,140
What the fuck would they thinking?
Huh? I'm walking around now. People

862
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:55,620
eight days ago,

863
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,590
those motherfuckers thought that they
were going to win the Superbowl. You know,

864
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,500
probably talk to this day.
We're going to go into Foxborough.

865
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,690
Grab fucking Tom Brady with
his bio is updated mullet.

866
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,940
Slap him around a little bit. Put a
couple of more dimples into his chin.

867
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,350
That's what they thought was going
to happen eight fucking days later.

868
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,770
Eight days later.
Right now,

869
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,220
every jet fan in the country eject them,

870
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,600
has their green fucking head between
the knees looking at the fucking green

871
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:34,980
balls, shriveling up, pulling
up into their fucking abdomen.

872
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:40,350
All right, now here's the deal.
I'm not going to talk shit.

873
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,150
Talked a little bit of Shit.

874
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,350
I had to because of all the fucking
emails I've been getting and not just from

875
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:49,200
jet fans.
That fucking Dick from Philly.

876
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,920
You know who you are when you sent
me that email. Go Bill. Give it up.

877
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:55,740
Give it up already. You sound like
a moron. The jets are a fucking,

878
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:59,660
when the the the best team in the
AFC and all that shit. All right,

879
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,111
I'm gonna say this.

880
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:04,560
Say it real quick cause I don't
feel like I need to say anything,

881
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,030
but I'm a cunt so I'm going to
continue talking about this. Okay.

882
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,600
What did it, what the fuck did
I tell you? What did I say?

883
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,050
Everything I fucking said.

884
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,980
I'm not even saying that they can't
still pull it together and maybe win the

885
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,670
Superbowl.

886
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,940
But to refresh your memory
at the beginning of the
season when I was watching

887
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:28,740
those fucking morons on
that HBO hard knocks thing,

888
00:55:28,741 --> 00:55:33,300
running their mouths, that's what it
has. Why are they talking all this shit?

889
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,550
They're talking as if they already won
one, two, three fucking championships.

890
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,690
And do you remember what I said?
I said the Patriots,

891
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,840
the fucking Ravens,
this Steelers,

892
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,870
the chargers or even the dolphins could
beat this fucking team on any given

893
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:52,980
Sunday.
And Lo and behold,

894
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,860
within six days to fucking losses,

895
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,660
you know? So that's it.
I had to give you one.

896
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,990
I told you so.
All right.

897
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:09,270
And here's one for you jets fans.

898
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,210
If you think I'm thinking that the
Patriots are fucking going to win the

899
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,470
Superbowl and that the defense I saw the
last two fucking weeks is their defense.

900
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:18,480
Now you're sadly mistaken.

901
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,040
This is why you fuckers get disappointed
every year is because you see,

902
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,070
you see half

903
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,920
a ray of sunlight and you
think, dad, that's what it is.

904
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,920
I still don't like our defense.

905
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:34,450
All right to fucking great weeks in a row
does not make up for the fact that you

906
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:39,310
shit the bed and let up 24 to 30 points
for the first fucking 11 weeks or

907
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:42,760
whatever the hell nine weeks,
whatever. I don't know. No,

908
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:47,260
11 weeks we were nine and two.
That's right. The first 11 weeks. So,

909
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,360
I dunno who do you like for some reason
I'm thinking the ravens sitting there

910
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:56,620
all quietly nestled in Baltimore.
Right? No one's paying attention to him.

911
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,120
Joe Flacco. I Dunno. I know we beat
them this year but I don't know.

912
00:57:01,121 --> 00:57:03,280
I'm trying to beat those guys
twice in one year so I'm not,

913
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:07,570
I'm not fucking saying anything.
So there you go. That is it.

914
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,290
And having said that,
how fucking hilarious

915
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,920
I really felt as this something here,

916
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,720
I felt really bad for the strength and
conditioning coach who stuck his knee out

917
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,670
and knock that dolphin guide down.
I,

918
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,860
I felt really fucking bad for that
guy because that was such a classic

919
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,050
spur the moment completely
out of character

920
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,330
move.

921
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:48,330
It was just the right set of circumstances
had they'd beat the Patriots the week

922
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,300
before.

923
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:54,250
He wouldn't have done that shit had they
bounce back and they were beaten the

924
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:56,260
dolphins,
he wouldn't have done that shit.

925
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,440
He's never done anything like that was
just the classic that spur the moment.

926
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:04,750
Like it was just fuck we
got killed by the Patriots.

927
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,470
Fuck we're losing this game.
He's a competitive psycho.

928
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:13,150
Cause that's how you get to that
level, right? It was just all line.

929
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,013
I'm telling you

930
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,470
that guy like I don't think he's a
bad guy. I really don't. It was a,

931
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,790
it was a piece of shit thing to do,
but you know,

932
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:30,160
there's so many fucking people in
jail because of a moment like that.

933
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,570
They had never committed a crime their
entire fucking life and just two major

934
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:36,970
shifts happened in their fucking life.

935
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,740
And then an opportunity presented
itself to think about it.

936
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:43,900
How many times you go down this,
you walked down the street,

937
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:47,170
you see somebody bent over tying
his shoe and your brain just goes,

938
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:49,420
why don't you just go fucking
boot him in the ass? Right?

939
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:53,980
But you don't because the other side
of you is going, wait a minute. Yeah,

940
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,940
put this guy in the ass.

941
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:58,930
What if he knows that fucking UFC
shit comes over and fucking, you know,

942
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:02,970
blows out my eye and I look like
fucking Josh Koscheck over the fucking

943
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:07,290
crosscheck, obviously his
fucking name, right. Or what if,

944
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:09,550
what if I get arrested for assault?
What if I get sued?

945
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:13,420
Like that voice just beats down
that other voice count. God Damn,

946
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:16,150
look at those titties. Once you go up and
just grab them, just grab those titties.

947
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,910
They're right there.
Grab them.

948
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,640
But you don't cause you have a job.

949
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,310
She got a family cause you're
working towards something and it's,

950
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:30,620
it's going relatively well.
Yuron course.

951
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,960
Then what happens, you know,
girlfriend dumped Hsa, you know,

952
00:59:34,961 --> 00:59:36,280
you lose your fucking job.

953
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:41,281
It starts to unravel and when it starts
to unravel that voice in your head,

954
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,083
you know,

955
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:48,480
and she just fucking kicked that guy
right in the balls become so fucking loud

956
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:53,240
that that other voice of reason is now
it's way in the back of your head. Oh,

957
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:56,010
you don't do that? It hurts.
You can't even hear it anymore.

958
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:59,860
And that's what the fuck happened to
that guy. It was just, it was too,

959
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:04,860
I'm telling you last
night. Yeah, last night.

960
01:00:04,861 --> 01:00:08,770
That dude was sitting there. Okay, why
is this fucking thing saying I'm peak?

961
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,750
And that was a too loud.

962
01:00:09,751 --> 01:00:13,130
I'm trying to overcompensate for the
fact that people were saying that my,

963
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:17,480
my podcast with too quiet. Try
and overcompensate. There we go.

964
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,910
Why is that light sitting there
going peak. Hello? Test one,

965
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,530
two test went.
Oh fuck you.

966
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:30,320
Okay,
so ever dealt lead.

967
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:35,040
The reason why it said peak was because
I had reached the memory limit for my ls

968
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:39,540
10 or right. It deleted some shit. I'm
back. So anyways, the fuck was I taught,

969
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:44,160
I was talking about that guy.
I guarantee you he's not a bad guy.

970
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:47,850
Last night he was sitting there talking
to his wife. He couldn't even sleep.

971
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:53,400
It's wife or his girlfriend,
you know, she's sitting down
in the corner, you know,

972
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:57,890
holding her knees, sitting in the corner,
go to, why did you do that? And he's like,

973
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,240
I don't know.

974
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:04,530
I don't know why I did it like
Gus Grissom and the right stuff.

975
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,990
It was, there was a glitch.
The hatch just blue.

976
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,180
I Dunno why it did it.
I was standing there,

977
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:16,230
we were losing the fucking gay
with a guy came by. It just,

978
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:20,940
I only stuck it out a little bit,
man. I just stuck it out a little bit.

979
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,050
He's, he's, he just fucking

980
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,960
muttering to himself.
Why did I do that?

981
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:35,820
Why the fuck? Why did I do
that? That was so fucking stuff.

982
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,240
There's guys in prison right now.
Why did I,

983
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:44,610
why didn't I listen to that voice?
Why I paid my taxes?

984
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:47,840
I was a cub scout.
Right?

985
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:51,370
I fucking made sandwiches for my kids,

986
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:54,870
send them off to school
and then just sat one day.

987
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,160
My fucking neighbor,
excuse me,

988
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,250
Karl Koller talked to you for a second.
Um,

989
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,940
I know we've discussed this before.

990
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:10,941
Is there any way you could just not have
your dog relieved himself on my lawn

991
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:16,360
and that just happens to be a fucking
shovel and you're just looking at his

992
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:19,000
mouth, you know, and she

993
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:25,920
pedal what the Shovel Bang. You
fucking do it. Then you're like,

994
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:29,820
fuck, get up. Please get up, please
get up. Did anybody see that?

995
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,680
Bury the shovel man.

996
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:35,130
And then you just go down that road and
you've never committed a fucking crime

997
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:39,000
and then you end up in jail.
It was just because of that one.

998
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:43,200
The circumstances were there.

999
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,680
I don't think that that guy's a
bad guy. I don't. It was just,

1000
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:49,230
you know,

1001
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:54,230
the problem is they're
being led by a crazy man.

1002
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,580
Rex Ryan is out of his fucking mind.

1003
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:04,050
Another thing that I've said
since last fucking year,

1004
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,300
okay? That guy, I don't know if he's
bipolar or if he's manic depressive.

1005
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:09,990
All right?

1006
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:14,990
But I am a psycho and I can spot another
psycho from a fucking cross the room.

1007
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,720
That guy is out of his mind and what the,
you know,

1008
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:22,440
you got to buy into your
coach's philosophy. All right?

1009
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,570
So they bought into his shit.

1010
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:29,571
Talk in fucking John Wayne
Horse Shit when he was having,

1011
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,170
they didn't realize he was
having a manic episode. You know,

1012
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:39,650
all the coaches sign in that bus as
he's walking up and the depths of his

1013
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:44,220
insecurity saying that, you know,
you don't even deserve to be here.

1014
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:48,930
He had to so overcompensate for it. He
just, by the time he grabbed that Sharpie,

1015
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:52,290
his manic episode was so
through the fucking roof.

1016
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,040
He just starts writing on
the board. Ooh, so long

1017
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,730
we're going to win the Superbowl.

1018
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,760
He did that and he brought all his
players up to this manic fucking level.

1019
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,180
And when you go that high,

1020
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:12,210
you crashed that fucking low and
that's what happened in two weeks.

1021
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:17,100
This motherfucker, the strength and
conditioning coach, no pain, no gain.

1022
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:18,160
You've got to want it.

1023
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:23,630
That guy whose dad was probably
like Emilio Estefan says,

1024
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,430
I have a step as whoever
the fuck you say his name,

1025
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:31,080
his dad and the breakfast
club where I hate you.

1026
01:04:31,081 --> 01:04:33,180
You son of a bitch.
That was his dad.

1027
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:38,180
So he's got that information up there.
He's got rex Ryan's manic,

1028
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,560
all right,

1029
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:45,610
and his fucking head and it comes his
dreadlocks locked jackass running right by

1030
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:50,730
them. Sticky meal, stick
your fucking knee out.

1031
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:54,240
And he just, he went with it. You saw him.

1032
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:56,880
He's trying to fight it is
other needs going. No, no, no.

1033
01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:00,450
Stay back here with me and the other
needs like fuck that. I'm going in.

1034
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,250
I'm fucking going.
And he stuck it out and that fucking

1035
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:09,510
Jesus. Could you ever think that you could
take down a professional athlete that

1036
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:12,420
easily.
He looked like he fell out of a car.

1037
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,050
He got kneed in the side of
the leg on the 40 yard line.

1038
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:20,700
He didn't stop rolling to the
fucking 12 yard line. Okay. Ah,

1039
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:25,380
can you imagine that? The second he
did that shit, that poor bastard.

1040
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,220
I bet it felt like a cold.

1041
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:34,430
Like he was standing under a fucking ice
water waterfall. That even makes sense.

1042
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:38,430
And then that would be like hale.
I could've just said hail whatever.

1043
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,320
It's fucking cold and he's standing at it

1044
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:46,540
and I bet he could even feel is fun
fucking from is his goddamn heart down.

1045
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:50,130
He probably couldn't feel anything
just going like, oh my God,

1046
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,900
what did I just do? Oh my
God, please get up. Please,

1047
01:05:55,990 --> 01:06:00,640
please get up. Ah, fuck. Did
anybody see that dip? Did
rexy that. Why did I do that?

1048
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:03,910
Oh my God. Oh my God. What if I
get fired? But if I get fired,

1049
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:08,550
he fucking went through all of that
shit. That poor bastard. You know?

1050
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,010
But I got to admit,
as a patriots fan,

1051
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,790
I don't ever have to listen to the fucking
jets fans talk about cheating anymore,

1052
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:15,624
do I?

1053
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,180
It's the post going to have that caught
cheating with a little asterisk next to

1054
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:25,190
it for the rest of the fucking
season. Ah, your green counts.

1055
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:31,180
Um, so there you go. Whatever. So
that's, that's this week and football.

1056
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,570
That is this weekend football.

1057
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:36,350
How about those fucking Minnesota
Vikings with their inflatable roof,

1058
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:41,800
you know, can you imagine if that happened
during a game? Even with helmets on,

1059
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:46,640
I think somebody could die. It's a weird
thing because it's snow. You think like,

1060
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:47,960
it's just going to be like,
you know,

1061
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:52,070
getting a snow storm over with
in like a half a second. But, uh,

1062
01:06:52,071 --> 01:06:55,850
that was probably a good couple
hundred pounds of snow and a,

1063
01:06:55,851 --> 01:06:56,780
I don't know about you guys.

1064
01:06:56,781 --> 01:07:00,890
I don't want a couple hundred pounds of
anything landing on me from the top of a

1065
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:05,810
fucking Dome Stadium. Jesus Christ. Okay.

1066
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:10,130
That was one of the saddest moments I've
ever seen for professional franchise.

1067
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:16,330
You know, getting ready to play the New
York giants, New York football giants.

1068
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:17,770
How you guys want it?
You want it?

1069
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:21,700
They have fucking big
blue fucking bring it.

1070
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:25,300
The 20 minutes you got to
call back. Yeah. Listener,

1071
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,370
you know about that football game.
A Kuka.

1072
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,110
Is there a way we could do it on Monday?

1073
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:33,250
Monday would probably work a
little bit better cause uh,

1074
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,190
stadium collapsed and uh,
we have to,

1075
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:42,540
we have to get a bicycle pump when we
have to repair it. We'll duck tape. Yeah.

1076
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,640
But uh,
okay.

1077
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,910
I figured Detroit's in between your
city and our cities. Okay. Okay.

1078
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,110
You know, sort of equally
distant and uh, okay.

1079
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,610
It's just a suggestion. Oh yeah, just
call me back. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye.

1080
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,403
Okay.

1081
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,860
Oh fuck. So anyways, let's, let's
get into the podcast here this week.

1082
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:12,630
So that's it. I'm done
fucking talking shit. Uh,

1083
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:15,320
and I got to tell you something.
I'm going to pat myself on back.

1084
01:08:15,321 --> 01:08:16,130
I could have been a lot

1085
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,560
meter, I could have been a
lot meter. And you know what?

1086
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,110
I gotta be honest with you. If I
believed in our defense a little more,

1087
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,990
I think I would have been,
I think I would have been,

1088
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,870
how are you doing down there in San Diego?

1089
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:31,070
How is your team slapped you around
enough this year? Jesus Christ.

1090
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,590
Whatever you do,
do not bet on the fucking charges.

1091
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:38,270
You don't know who the fuck is going
to show up. It's kill or be killed,

1092
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:42,290
rape, or be raped. That's what the
fuck's going on down in San Diego.

1093
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:45,890
They're either going to win 41
nothing or lose 56 to eight.

1094
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,710
They got to safety. That's how
they got the eight. All right.

1095
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,210
Two field goals in a safety,
right? Is that another works?

1096
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,710
Maybe then went for a
two point conversion.

1097
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:58,010
I'm just trying to cover all the basis
for the fucking mathletes out there.

1098
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:03,150
All right, let's move. Let's move on
here. Uh, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,

1099
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:05,330
up a bear. Oh, here's something
that somebody sent me.

1100
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,930
They mentioned that they'd
seen Paul Mccartney, uh,

1101
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,970
a beetle on. Uh, why don't I just
read the email? What are, let's,

1102
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,780
who's getting who? Let's be honest. Why
don't I just attempt to read this email?

1103
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:22,580
Okay. Hey Bill, I just
finished watching last night,

1104
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:27,290
Saturday night live with Paul Mccartney
and I think it's time for Paul to hang

1105
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:28,430
it up for good.

1106
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,650
I feel like a bit of an
asshole for thinking it because
we're all supposed to be

1107
01:09:33,651 --> 01:09:36,260
in awe of him because he's a beetle.
Uh,

1108
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:40,940
they let them do four songs last night
because everyone is in awe of him and

1109
01:09:40,941 --> 01:09:41,870
that's the problem.

1110
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:47,230
No one wants to tell the 68 year old man
with the dyed brown hair and saggy man

1111
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:51,200
boobs that he doesn't have the voice
for a live performance anymore.

1112
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,520
I fear getting old and
being irrelevant too,

1113
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:58,400
but I hope that when
it's my time to retire,

1114
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:03,401
I can accept that I'm not what I once
was and move on to something else that

1115
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:08,150
better suits that stage of my life.
Paul should look to someone like Bano.

1116
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,070
Not that I'm a big Bono Fan,

1117
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:15,170
but I think he's done it right by
imitating Bob Geldof's example of rock and

1118
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:16,490
roll for philanthropy.

1119
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:20,240
How about a pat on the back for getting
through that sentence without fucking it

1120
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:24,230
up? Uh, you two won't draw a
stadium sized crowds forever.

1121
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:29,150
So Bonno set, set himself up as a jet
setting friend of the world's poor.

1122
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:33,530
Even if he never gave another
concert as sung another note,

1123
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:37,490
he'd still have a meaningful, you'll still
have meaningful work beyond his music.

1124
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,160
Uh, it's like you were
saying in previous podcasts,

1125
01:10:41,161 --> 01:10:44,630
it's good to have a side business in
case show business doesn't work out best

1126
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:48,480
regards. Um, yeah. Um,

1127
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,740
I kind of see what you're
saying a little bit, but uh,

1128
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:54,830
I know a lot of people saw Paul Mccartney
last year on tour and said he was

1129
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:55,880
fucking unbelievable.

1130
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:01,240
And then I also think that the Beatles
right now are a victim of a backlash

1131
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:06,410
because of something that they
didn't create. I think apple,

1132
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:11,130
not apple. Is that, uh, whatever
iTunes. That's right. Itunes.

1133
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:15,600
I got real confused there because they
had apple records and then Macintosh has

1134
01:11:15,601 --> 01:11:19,380
a fucking apple and that's all it takes
to really just send me flying down the

1135
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:24,150
fucking sideline. Like that. Dreadlocked
son of a bitch. You got tripped anyways.

1136
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,090
Um,
okay.

1137
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,570
I think iTunes has been trying
to get the Beatles catalog.

1138
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:33,410
Obviously it's probably the first band
you would want to start with as far as if

1139
01:11:33,411 --> 01:11:34,430
you wanted to make money.

1140
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:38,840
They finally got them and they
are from the baby boom generation,

1141
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,860
Steve jobs and all those guys. So this
is, you know, this is there Jesus.

1142
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:49,490
So they present the band as their Jesus
and just eventually it's just inevitable

1143
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,740
that it's going to a

1144
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,300
annoy the generations after.
And not to mention,

1145
01:11:57,301 --> 01:12:01,110
because we weren't born when
they were putting out albums,

1146
01:12:01,111 --> 01:12:05,640
it's impossible for us to see how far
ahead of their fucking time they were.

1147
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,111
You know?

1148
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:10,140
And that's something I also see in comedy
where I've actually gotten emails from

1149
01:12:10,141 --> 01:12:13,870
people going, what's the big deal
with Richard Pryor? You know,

1150
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:18,070
35 years of people ripping off his shit.

1151
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:23,140
They've actually made, you
know, some of his stuff.

1152
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:27,810
You know, like after 35 years,
people finally caught up with them,

1153
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,450
you know, so, or like an
athletic thing. Somebody,

1154
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:37,170
somebody sent me a fucking email
this week, was talking about that a,

1155
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:38,610
that running back on Cleveland.

1156
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:41,020
Remember that guy was talking
about who has the face mask,

1157
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,980
makes them look like the front
of a dodge ram pickup truck.

1158
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:49,370
Someone was saying they thought Jim Brown
of the Cleveland browns was overrated

1159
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:53,090
and that they're so sick of hearing
about this guy that if this fucking white

1160
01:12:53,091 --> 01:12:57,110
dude played back in that era with those
skinny people who played football,

1161
01:12:57,230 --> 01:13:00,570
he would have run all
over them. Which, uh,

1162
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,730
a lot of people say shit like
that and it's complete bullshit

1163
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:05,853
because

1164
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:12,260
is if he played back then
look, if you want to stick
them in a time machine, yeah,

1165
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,650
he would run all over those guys.
But that doesn't mean he's better.

1166
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:23,060
You know what I mean? That's like,
okay, I have a big test on Tuesday, um,

1167
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:24,750
the me on Friday,

1168
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:28,050
we'll go back in time after I've taken
the fucking test and then I'll know all

1169
01:13:28,051 --> 01:13:29,820
the God damn answers.
That's what it's like.

1170
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:31,740
If you take today's athletes
and you put them back then,

1171
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,090
which you have to do is just say,
okay,

1172
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:37,080
if you take that guy and you had him
born the same year Jim Brown was born,

1173
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:43,210
you know, he'd still be what he is
today because of the nutrition, the, uh,

1174
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:47,730
the level of, of uh, just
intelligence about sports.

1175
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:51,210
And what is possible at that moment,
the workout equipment and all of that.

1176
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,680
But you know, obviously if you
take a fucking guy you don't have,

1177
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:59,681
the big flaw in that is that kid today
is not the Jim Brown of this era or any

1178
01:14:00,911 --> 01:14:05,070
fucking error. You know? And if you
took Jim Brown from back in the day,

1179
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:09,510
you had him born in 1980 instead of 1940
or whenever the fuck this guy was born

1180
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,920
and he had access to all this,

1181
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,460
all this information about nutrition,
sports science and all that,

1182
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,610
he would have been much bigger than he
was. He still what a fucking dominated.

1183
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:22,120
All right? So that's one of
those sports arguments that they,

1184
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:24,100
that that people have,

1185
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,480
like they'll talk about
Koby Bryant because they see
Colby doing everything that

1186
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:31,300
Jordan has already done.
They, they equate it,

1187
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:36,301
therefore he's as good as Jordan and
they forget the fact that no one had ever

1188
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:40,270
done that shit until Jordan Jordan
changed the game. All right?

1189
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,860
Same thing with the fucking Beatles.

1190
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:45,700
The Beatles was so fucking
far ahead of everybody,

1191
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:50,440
but now it's, it's 40, almost
50 fucking years later. Yeah.

1192
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:52,780
Now you're going to look back on it and
have to, everybody's ripped him off.

1193
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:56,740
It's going to be like, dude, what
the fuck was the big deal? All right.

1194
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:57,521
So there's that.

1195
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:02,230
And then the last thing is I'm sick of
people throwing old people out in the

1196
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:07,090
fucking yard. You know, like
they're your old iPod speakers. Eh,

1197
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:11,920
there's a loose wire. Fuck him. He's out
the God damn door. I think it's bullshit.

1198
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,800
All right. I like old people. Even
that fucking asshole downstairs.

1199
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:21,850
I like him. I respect him.
And you, you, what it is,

1200
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:26,200
is you look at them and you see that died
here and you see their saggy man boobs

1201
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:29,800
right here, wrinkled up. Tushies. Right?

1202
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:34,830
So you equate that with their level of
intelligence rather than this fucking guy

1203
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:41,650
has walked this planet for
65, 75, 85 fucking years.

1204
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:46,870
And uh, you know, what's that
expression? As much as things change,

1205
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:49,950
they stay the same. Stitch in time,
saves nine without a fucking hammer.

1206
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,990
Remember expressions, whatever. You know,

1207
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,020
this guy has seen everything
that you're about ready to see.

1208
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:59,740
He's already seen it. Okay? He didn't
have a fucking iPod. Who gives a fuck?

1209
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,190
All right. A cunt is
still a cunt. All right?

1210
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:06,070
Some things don't fucking change.

1211
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:09,310
And this guy has this whole wealth of
knowledge that here's a guy's been playing

1212
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:13,120
live gigs for 50 something fucking years.
All right?

1213
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:16,120
He can still physically play.
Why wouldn't you want to go see him?

1214
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:22,450
You know, with all his fucking
experience, you know? Yeah. I mean,

1215
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,610
I could see if he was
jumping off the piano,

1216
01:16:24,611 --> 01:16:27,010
trying to do splits and
touches fucking toes.

1217
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,640
And then he came down and blew out his
knee and they had to give him fucking a

1218
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:35,050
Geritol rub right on is blown out
knee then. Yeah. You know what I mean?

1219
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,940
But like I don't like that whole fucking,
it's like,

1220
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:42,420
it's like a corporate mentality. I,
your skin's wrinkled up. We have no you,

1221
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:47,140
we don't like looking at you beat it.
I Dunno.

1222
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,360
I'd still go pay to see the rolling
stones. I would. Why wouldn't you?

1223
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,730
Why the fuck when those got red?

1224
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:59,050
Those guys give me hope that I can sit
there and drag my ass out on a fucking

1225
01:16:59,051 --> 01:17:03,850
stage. Eight years old, watch
up would medicaid you know,

1226
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,540
out on a cruise ship.

1227
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:10,810
But I do understand what you're
saying because definitely want to, uh,

1228
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,130
if I'm on stage

1229
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,120
in my sixties and seventies,

1230
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,500
sixties is fine cause I'm still going
to be fucking annoyed and want to be out

1231
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:24,500
there. But in my seventies,
if I'm still on fucking stage,

1232
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,400
I want it to be because uh,

1233
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,670
because I had not because I need the
money because I want to be out there.

1234
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:35,480
All right. I remember Keith, Richard's
saying like, someone was like,

1235
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:39,710
when are you guys going to hang it
up? He's like, never, I'm a musician.

1236
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:43,940
This is what I do. I will do this
in front of two people or 200,000.

1237
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,470
It's what the fuck I do. You want
me to put down my guitar? You know,

1238
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,920
he has a great line in his book where
he talks about how much he loves guitar.

1239
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:53,290
I don't know if I said this last week,
it,

1240
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:57,550
Keith Richards has this book called
life. It's the fucking shit. And um,

1241
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:02,720
he talks about how he loves
guitar so much that to this day,

1242
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:06,350
like he opens a guitar case
and just the smell of a guitar,

1243
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:10,020
he wants to crawl in there
and close the lid. Alright.

1244
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:13,550
So if you ask this guy to
stop going up playing live,

1245
01:18:13,551 --> 01:18:17,490
you might as well put a bullet in
his brain. You killing them in. Okay.

1246
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:21,200
So having said that,
let Paul Mccartney do is fucking thing.

1247
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:22,790
Has any been through enough?

1248
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:27,560
I mean that guy truly found the
love of his life. All right,

1249
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:31,160
you fucking dies then.
He, he's in a bad place.

1250
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:34,970
Like the fucking jets strength coach.
He goes out,

1251
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:38,180
he married some gold digging
whore with one leg, you know,

1252
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:41,420
which was the classic
fucking misdirection.

1253
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,420
Cause I bet in the back of his
head he kept going, you know,

1254
01:18:44,421 --> 01:18:48,350
I think she's a fucking gold digger.
And then that other place like, dude,

1255
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:51,590
she only has one leg man,
stop being so mean. Right.

1256
01:18:51,591 --> 01:18:54,530
And then he just gave
into that and then you go,

1257
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,940
hey, you think if you tried to
trip her, you stuck your knee out.

1258
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:02,690
Like maybe there was a possibility that
she's athletic enough that her fake leg

1259
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:07,070
would just fall off and she would just
be able to continue hopping down the

1260
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:10,670
sidelines and make a play.
Granted, she get a penalty if she,

1261
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:15,320
if she ran out of bounds on her own.
You know,

1262
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:16,550
that's a question for you this week.

1263
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:21,470
If that fucking gold dig and horror
with the one leg, if she ran down,

1264
01:19:21,471 --> 01:19:23,900
she had a fucking dolphins uniform on,
right?

1265
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,740
She went to the islands and got her hair
braided by some dude in Jamaica. Right.

1266
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:31,040
And she comes flying down the sideline.
If you stuck your knee out,

1267
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:36,500
hit her fake knee. Right.
Knocked her fucking leg off.

1268
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,580
Why am I repeating what you just heard?
Everything I just said.

1269
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:45,560
Do you think that she would
have the ability running
full speed? All right, we'll,

1270
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:48,110
we'll uh, we'll adjust it a little bit.
You tell her you're going to do it.

1271
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,240
You tell her you're going to do it.

1272
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:54,830
You can delete the legs going to fucking
pop off now. The fake one. Jesus Christ.

1273
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:58,310
We think I'm an asshole, but just
shut up. You're dumb whore. All right,

1274
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:00,320
I'm going to fucking knocked.
Shut up.

1275
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,900
I'm going to knock your fake
fucking leg off sweetheart.

1276
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:07,010
When you're running full speed, if
you can keep your balance. All right,

1277
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:10,060
we'll give you some shiny shit.
You're gold digging whores.

1278
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:13,610
Do you think she could do it?
Okay. That is my question for you.

1279
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:18,050
During the holiday season,
Doobie Doobie, do air,

1280
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:22,970
we knock off your fake leg. You can't.
Um, all right, what else do we got here?

1281
01:20:22,971 --> 01:20:27,400
You guys want some youtube
videos for the week? MMM. Okay.

1282
01:20:27,401 --> 01:20:29,830
Once again is great as the
black Crowes were. Let's,

1283
01:20:29,831 --> 01:20:34,570
let's talk about some
fucking music that I respect,

1284
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:39,860
but uh, I, I have to shut
it off every time I hear it.

1285
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:44,890
And that is basically the melancholies
singer songwriter put a gun in your mouth

1286
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:51,340
early to mid 70 shit.
You know,

1287
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:55,840
did I talk about this last week?
I can't remember. Like Carol King.

1288
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:58,690
Okay.
Seeing an Aas,

1289
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:04,220
David, it's too, they [inaudible]

1290
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:06,683
south.

1291
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:11,860
It is that has died and fucking kill.
Yes.

1292
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:16,810
Self. You douchebag. How would it
fuck it goes that song. James Taylor,

1293
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:19,580
I seen fire and I've seen rain.

1294
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:25,430
My fucking friend died in a plane crash
and I always thought that I'd see you

1295
01:21:25,431 --> 01:21:30,260
once again, Carly Simon.
Okay. That's the way.

1296
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:35,780
That's the way I've always heard it
should be. I'm telling you right now,

1297
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,920
don't ever listen to that song on a rainy
fucking day. If you put that song in,

1298
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:45,030
you have a 40% chance of doing
something really harmful to yourself.

1299
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:49,510
Joan Baez, diamonds, and rust,

1300
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,010
you know, and I have the song. If you
have, if one of those songs ever comes on,

1301
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:58,610
you're in a car and you don't have
control of the radio and you just feel

1302
01:21:58,611 --> 01:22:03,100
yourself getting dragged.
Yeah. Down this bottomless pit.

1303
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:09,270
I have the song that is basically like
that in adrenaline injection to the

1304
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:13,050
heart, like in pulp fiction. Just
put on Huey Lewis hip to be square.

1305
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,090
All right?
I can't take 100% credit for that.

1306
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:21,220
Me and a young Joe to Rosa.
All right. The teen idols,

1307
01:22:21,221 --> 01:22:24,570
sensation of the opiate.
Anthony Program we're taught was,

1308
01:22:24,571 --> 01:22:29,571
it was actually a segment that we'd love
to do on the uninformed shelf that we

1309
01:22:29,661 --> 01:22:32,210
do once every nine
years. At this point, uh,

1310
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:36,140
we were talking about how it's impossible
to be depressed if you listen to Huey

1311
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:39,130
Lewis and the news put
on hip to be square.

1312
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:43,430
I challenge you not to fucking
get a smile on your face.

1313
01:22:43,431 --> 01:22:48,080
It's like trying to hold off a yawn. You
know, you can't do it. It's impossible.

1314
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,830
So, uh, I don't know. I don't even know
why I'm bringing this shit up, but like,

1315
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:55,070
I don't know what it is about that music.
I respect it once again,

1316
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,170
getting back to the black Crowes
thing cause it's actually okay.

1317
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,370
Human beings producing all the sounds
that you're hearing. All right.

1318
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:07,990
But uh,
you know Jesus Christ already.

1319
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,430
Do those people have any happy songs?
Who's another one?

1320
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:17,410
Oh, that that fucking girl sings in
the false set off with a weird eyes.

1321
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:22,240
Joni Mitchell
singing about a paved,

1322
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,890
paved the parking lot, pay paradise,
turned it into a parking lot.

1323
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,840
You don't know what you got till it's
gone. All right, Joanie. I got it.

1324
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:36,220
Last week was better.
Jesus Christ. You fucking,

1325
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:41,330
you know, I don't know. I
did. I am it. Was there any,

1326
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,950
was there a point that was made there?
Other than the fact that I can't sing?

1327
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:49,420
Um, oh, here's a music
question for this week.

1328
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:53,650
As you guys also know other than playing
drums, I a I fuck around and guitar.

1329
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,600
Um,
and uh,

1330
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,020
I recently bought ACDC flick of
the switch, another underrated,

1331
01:24:02,021 --> 01:24:05,320
which I know I did last week.
Underrated ACDC flick of the switch.

1332
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:09,550
I just want to know what
tuning of those people in are.

1333
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:14,200
They tuned down like half a step because
it's like I listened to the album,

1334
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:17,860
I shut it off. Then I go and
I go to figure it out. Like,

1335
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:22,420
let's take the first song for you.
Guitar players out there rising power.

1336
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,800
All right. He's doing a pull
off down to a B court. Right?

1337
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:31,530
But are they tuned down like half a step?
Because last night I'm sitting there,

1338
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:35,260
my jam jams and I got my guitar that I
can't even fucking play. And I'm like,

1339
01:24:35,261 --> 01:24:38,590
you know what, I'm gonna have a little
geek moment by myself that nobody can see.

1340
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,450
I'm going to put on much
this fucking record.

1341
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:41,620
I'm going to play along to this song.

1342
01:24:41,621 --> 01:24:46,621
Cause I figured it out the Malcolm part
and it sounded like shit and I tried

1343
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:52,480
tune it down half assed and I just could
not fucking figure it out and beyond

1344
01:24:52,481 --> 01:24:56,560
the fact that I suck. Can somebody
help me out? What are they doing there?

1345
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:01,330
I know it's not a drop d
drop d tuning.

1346
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,830
Cause I know what that sounds like.

1347
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:06,250
That sounds like Satan is
your bitch and you got,

1348
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:10,750
you got some errands for for it to run.
I know what that sounds like

1349
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,660
and I challenged somebody to come
up with a riff and drop d tuning.

1350
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:20,380
That doesn't fucking rocket. It's
just, it's just, it's the shit. Right?

1351
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:25,300
But does that tune down half a step that
I, I can't fucking get. Come on man.

1352
01:25:25,301 --> 01:25:27,280
You heard how I sing?
Help me out here.

1353
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:32,380
Help me out or I'm going to fucking sing
for the rest of this podcast. All right.

1354
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:36,760
It's the holiday season. All right,
wait, let's, let's continue on here.

1355
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:39,880
Uh, oh, I got my, uh,

1356
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:44,080
I tell you somebody rear ended my Prius.
You know what I mean?

1357
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,650
Which really is like fucking boot and
an eight year old in the ass when you

1358
01:25:47,651 --> 01:25:49,840
really think about it.
Um,

1359
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,410
and got it just hard enough where I
couldn't walk away and be like, Eh,

1360
01:25:53,411 --> 01:25:58,390
don't worry about it. You
know, my hatchback wasn't
quite closing correctly. Um,

1361
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,610
you know what I mean?
Wasn't quite,

1362
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:06,320
it didn't quite work on the
hatchback area. Kind of like
a girl with a big booty.

1363
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,260
You know what I mean? There's always
a little bit of butt crack coming out.

1364
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:11,900
Who's got a tug? You know,
that's how he can judge.

1365
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,590
If you see a girl with a nice ass,
whether or not she's a whore or not,

1366
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:20,330
if she's constantly trying to adjust
her genes and pull them ups or ass crack

1367
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:24,200
isn't coming out of the back of
her pants, uh, that's a good girl.

1368
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:28,040
That's when you can take home to mom,
just makes sure she wears addressed.

1369
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:33,530
But if she's just standing there with
like an inch and a half coming out,

1370
01:26:33,531 --> 01:26:37,790
she doesn't give a fuck. I can't
even say that she's a fucking whore,

1371
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:40,580
but either that or she's
just accepted who she is.

1372
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:44,300
And for some reason that they don't make
jeans for girls like that. All right.

1373
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,370
That's one of those references that
it just was such a visual to me that I

1374
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,380
completely forgot what the
fuck I was talking about.

1375
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:56,090
Let's go back where you talking about,
what was I talking to? Look at tar.

1376
01:26:56,570 --> 01:27:00,210
Who gives a fuck? Oh, a song
about my car. So anyways,

1377
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,810
I'm getting it fixed this week.
And uh, so I went down to, uh,

1378
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,960
the rental car place and it was a usual,

1379
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:11,150
I go down there and I asked for a
fucking, uh, uh, an economy car.

1380
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,930
You know, I don't give a shit. I really
have no pride when it comes to cars,

1381
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,610
even though I fucking love him.
I don't give a fuck.

1382
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:20,540
I'm just so into not having debt
that I, I'm, I'm, I'm a little miser,

1383
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:23,570
so I get this a con, I go
down there and they go, well,

1384
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,460
the economy car isn't quite ready.

1385
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:28,880
We could give you a free upgrade
to this four door fucking pickup.

1386
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:32,150
And then it just became,
my,

1387
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:36,830
you don't even got outweighs my miserly
ways is, uh, I don't like waiting.

1388
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,890
I refuse to wait. So I go,
yeah, fuck it. I'll take it.

1389
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:43,370
And then immediately my girl was
just like, why did she get that?

1390
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:47,300
I can't try that. It's so
big. What am I going to do?

1391
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:50,600
I'm like, we only got until
Monday. Fucking relax.

1392
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:54,560
Plus we got to get the Christmas tree
this weekend. Right. Well, you know,

1393
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:58,220
Dasher read their Ed vixen

1394
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,990
daughter.
If you wonder how I did that,

1395
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:05,450
that was not some Phil Spector
Shit that's called just,

1396
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:09,350
you just spin it around ThreeSixty
away from your mouth and you just keep

1397
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:11,540
talking,
cause back around you like that.

1398
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:16,890
It's a new recording
process I just invented. Um,

1399
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,390
so anyways, uh, and go, yeah, we
got to go get the Christmas tree.

1400
01:28:20,391 --> 01:28:24,710
So for the last two years, I have to
admit something to you people. All right.

1401
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:29,330
I have been going down to get these
fucking Christmas trees and I have been

1402
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:33,260
getting the traditional Christmas tree
and we all know what it looks like.

1403
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,760
All right. It looks like someone on
the biggest loser about four weeks in.

1404
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,420
That's what a Christmas tree
supposed to pop that full, you know?

1405
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:48,320
But there's these other Christmas trees
that I noticed, not the scrawny ones,

1406
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:54,250
but they are minimalist Christmas trees
where you can see the entire trunk and

1407
01:28:57,231 --> 01:29:01,530
it's like they still have the branches,

1408
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:05,490
but there it's very like symmetrical.
It looks fucking cool as hell.

1409
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:09,390
Clean look and Christmas tree,
right?

1410
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:14,100
It looks like one of those trees and
like the doctor Seuss books, you know?

1411
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:18,330
So I go, you know what? Fuck this.
I'm going to get something different.

1412
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:22,170
I liked this tree.
It looks fucking cool.

1413
01:29:22,171 --> 01:29:25,760
I think the ornaments are going to hang
off it much better as if you know when

1414
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:29,460
you get one of those full
trees, you know this. Yeah,

1415
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:32,880
just it's a fucking pain in the ass. And
then the end of the end of the God damn,

1416
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,340
you know,
Christmas season,

1417
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:38,760
if you're not a dick and you just don't
throw it out the side of your car,

1418
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:41,400
like a fucking some,
you know,

1419
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:44,130
some piece of degenerate
gambler that Oj money,

1420
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:48,600
I said have it by Tuesday and then you
just throw it out the fucking car, right?

1421
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:51,990
If you actually do it the right
way and you, you saw it up,

1422
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:57,150
it's a pain in the ass. It makes it
unbelievable mess this thing, you know,

1423
01:29:57,151 --> 01:30:00,690
it's like, it's like you ever walk into
like, uh, like when I'm out with, with uh,

1424
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:05,160
with Nia and we go out to one of
her, uh, her clothing stores and

1425
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:10,920
if it's like a corporate place,
the place is just jam packed was shit.

1426
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,860
But if it's like a privately owned,

1427
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,120
they go out and they buy these individual
pieces still by a couple of sizes of

1428
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:19,770
each things that they like.
And you go in there,

1429
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:21,960
you pray to God that they
have your size and it's,

1430
01:30:21,961 --> 01:30:24,270
and you go in and it's very minimalist.

1431
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,870
That's the sort of Christmas tree
that I bought. And uh, you know,

1432
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:30,240
knee is a fashion Easter,
so I thought she would like it.

1433
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,770
So I bring this Christmas tree in
and the second she looks at it,

1434
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:38,220
cause I think she's going to
be like, you know, like I live,

1435
01:30:38,221 --> 01:30:42,030
she just have like techno music on like
I'm so far into the fucking future here.

1436
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:47,300
The second sheet looks at
it all my confidence just
drains out the bottom of my

1437
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:52,170
shoes. And I go, yeah, this is the
Christmas tree. And she goes, Oh yeah.

1438
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:56,760
He goes, where's the rest
of it? And I'm like, no, no.

1439
01:30:56,761 --> 01:31:00,960
That's the style. That's the style
it's supposed to look like that. I go,

1440
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:03,780
it doesn't have the cool, I mean it looks
like one of those trees in Dr Seuss.

1441
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,050
She goes, yeah, she goes, I
think it looks more like that,

1442
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:09,160
that Christmas tree and
that Charlie Brown cartoon,

1443
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,440
it's now I feel like an asshole.

1444
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:18,960
So because I love the verbal abuse that
you guys give me every fucking week.

1445
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:23,670
I'm actually going to be dumb enough
to send a picture of my Christmas tree.

1446
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,750
Now granted, it's naked. It's
not all dressed up. It's not
all dolled up. All right?

1447
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:33,570
It's like Charlie's Theron and that
stupid movie monster that rather than

1448
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,910
chastising her for being a murderous cont,

1449
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:39,540
they actually made a movie that said
maybe guys Outta to look at themselves and

1450
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:42,930
treat bitches a little bit better before
they go and start killing you after a

1451
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:43,764
blow job.

1452
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:48,180
It wasn't that the message of
the move SMS a gy got so anyways,

1453
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:49,620
it doesn't have any makeup on,

1454
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:53,100
which I think should automatically
give it a golden globe for being that

1455
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:56,820
courageous. It was so brave. It
was such a brave performance.

1456
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:01,810
Um, just take a look at the Christmas
tree. Tell me what you think.

1457
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,590
I think it looks fucking bad ass.
I love it.

1458
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:10,240
I fucking love it. And uh,
I stand by it. You know,

1459
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:14,950
I'm breaking a little tradition here.
So, uh, go on the M podcast.com.

1460
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:17,320
Take a look at my Christmas tree.

1461
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:20,650
We'll have a whole section where you can
leave your God damn comments about what

1462
01:32:20,651 --> 01:32:24,610
a moron you think I am.
Um, or maybe actually like,

1463
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:26,830
um,

1464
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:31,600
and along with that you can also
look at these youtube videos,

1465
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,340
the youtube videos of the week.
People.

1466
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:36,250
I just felt like I should have had a
theme, some theme music right there.

1467
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:38,740
At some point,
at some point,

1468
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:41,290
I'm going to have a make enough
money in this fucking business.

1469
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:44,890
I'm going to make a little studio and
I'm going to have all those little sound

1470
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:49,180
effects, like a real radio show like
Anthi on Opie and Anthony, you know,

1471
01:32:49,181 --> 01:32:52,330
he's got all those little buttons he
pushes and ops got all his little buttons

1472
01:32:52,331 --> 01:32:57,070
that they push, you know, those
button push and son of a bitches.

1473
01:32:57,070 --> 01:33:01,990
I want to be one, two, I have
drains. Um, and when I do,

1474
01:33:01,991 --> 01:33:05,500
I'll have a little fucking theme
music here. Uh, but until then,

1475
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,340
you'll just sit there and listen
to the awful silence. All right.

1476
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:12,940
Youtube videos of the week that you
can watch on the MM, podcast.com,

1477
01:33:12,941 --> 01:33:17,620
the official, uh, Fan Webpage,
whatever the fuck you call it,

1478
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:21,420
of the Monday morning podcast.
All right. Youtube video. Uh,

1479
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:25,660
this is one of my favorite ones.
Uh, if people puking makes you sick,

1480
01:33:25,661 --> 01:33:29,590
please don't watch
this. But, uh, you know,

1481
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:33,790
the great thing of watching a video tape
of somebody puking is you don't have to

1482
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:37,990
smell it so you can just
enjoy the hilarity that it is.

1483
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:42,300
You know what I mean? It's like
that shit that people, they, they,

1484
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:46,270
the vaporizer with weed, you know,
where it gets rid of everything,

1485
01:33:46,271 --> 01:33:49,810
all the toxins that just keeps the
shit that gets you high. This is,

1486
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:55,000
this is the vaporizer version of
watching somebody puke. Watch this video.

1487
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:59,650
This is, this is such, this video
literally made me cry. Laughing. Uh,

1488
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:04,180
epic beer pong puke. Um, it's just,

1489
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:07,990
it's got it all the,
the, the volume of Puke,

1490
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:11,400
the noise kid's making when
he's puking and then the,

1491
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:16,550
the fucking good natured
attitude that this dude has.

1492
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:21,160
He actually,
he has poise while puking.

1493
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:25,540
I think Mark Sanchez could learn a
little something about this, you know,

1494
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:28,990
little poise under fire by the way.
One of their offensive lineman got hurt.

1495
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:31,510
Now watch a run for his fucking life.
All right.

1496
01:34:31,511 --> 01:34:34,560
This game management son of a bitch.
Oh,

1497
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:38,890
so right about those
motherfuckers. All right. Um,

1498
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:44,020
all right, youtube video. Another one.
Uh, this one is just so fucking creepy.

1499
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:49,990
Um, I love this. I want to
go on a date with this woman.

1500
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:54,460
Uh, it's called the best model in the
world and I'm sure a lot of you guys have

1501
01:34:54,461 --> 01:34:58,310
already seen this and I'm sure Taj
Point Oh is already put it up. Uh,

1502
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:02,720
but it's the best model in the world hand
model and is this woman talking about

1503
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:05,810
being a hand model? And for a
lot of people it's what she says,

1504
01:35:05,811 --> 01:35:09,230
but for me it's the way she
just keeps stroking her hands.

1505
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:13,670
I don't know what she's doing,
but it is so fucking creepy.

1506
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:16,580
I want to go on a date with her.
I want to take her out to dinner,

1507
01:35:16,730 --> 01:35:19,580
have her sitting across from me as I
tell her about how many brothers and

1508
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:23,120
sisters I have in my hopes and dreams
in life as she sits there nodding,

1509
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:26,660
just stroking her hands and that it
would just, it would really, yeah, no,

1510
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,890
I don't know. Call me a
fucking psycho, but I,

1511
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:33,560
I would really love to just have that
experience. It's on my bucket list. Um,

1512
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:40,490
uh, did I spell this right? The next
one is Cammy secret parody, boob apron.

1513
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:41,661
You know that thing,

1514
01:35:41,661 --> 01:35:45,340
that commercial they have out there where
a women with the big titties and then

1515
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:47,300
all their boobs are always
fallen out of their shirt,

1516
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,750
but they don't like wearing something
underneath it to alleviate the problem.

1517
01:35:50,751 --> 01:35:55,620
So they created this little napkin
that hooks onto your bra straps. Uh,

1518
01:35:55,700 --> 01:36:00,080
first of all, let's pause and just say
how fucking brilliant an idea that is. Um,

1519
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:03,260
as far as just making $1 million,
you know,

1520
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:08,360
this checks out there who just
have, you know, efficient boobs.

1521
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:12,630
Just trying to think of a nice
way of saying small boobs, um, um,

1522
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:17,180
comparable, capable titties. Right.

1523
01:36:17,181 --> 01:36:19,760
There's still going to buy him just
cause I like having different colors and

1524
01:36:19,761 --> 01:36:21,770
sometimes I don't want to wear a shirt.

1525
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,770
And then those other girls who lie to
themselves about how big their boobs are

1526
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:28,010
and for some reason they've,
they buy a D Cup Bra. You know,

1527
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,740
when they got BEACOPP titties,
I don't know why they do that.

1528
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:34,370
Kind of like the guy who goes in and
buys the magnum condom and then it slips

1529
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:38,870
off and he becomes a fucking father for
the nighttime. Uh, yeah, just watch that.

1530
01:36:38,871 --> 01:36:43,010
It's a parody of that. And um, this
next one, all I have is a website,

1531
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:47,510
but my, uh, my web guys definitely
going to have it up. Uh,

1532
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,720
if you want to watch a video of somebody
who's about ready to get arrested by

1533
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:53,930
the FBI, watch this video.
This guy took one of those, uh,

1534
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:56,450
um,
you know,

1535
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:59,900
as those nerds who rather than going
out and getting a pilot license,

1536
01:36:59,901 --> 01:37:02,930
they go down to an open field
and they just fly like a,

1537
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:07,160
a fake playing around a
model airplane motorized.

1538
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,840
There it is motorized playing around.

1539
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,430
This guy put a camera on it and he
flew around the New York City skyline.

1540
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:17,660
I, yeah, I'm sure this guy isn't
going to get in trouble at all these,

1541
01:37:17,661 --> 01:37:19,790
they had the brains to
blur out their faces,

1542
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:21,650
but the dude is talking on the video.

1543
01:37:21,651 --> 01:37:24,470
You can hear his voice that
they're going to get caught.

1544
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:29,210
Some is going to recognize his voice that
he went to high school with. You know,

1545
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:31,730
by the way, people, if
you do something illegal,

1546
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,890
if you're going to be dumb
enough to videotape it,

1547
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:38,570
don't put it on fucking youtube and of
all the fucking cities to do it too.

1548
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:40,670
I mean it's definitely,
the footage is fucking cool,

1549
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:44,990
but this guy buzzes the statue of
Liberty with this model fucking airplane.

1550
01:37:44,991 --> 01:37:49,991
And considering the military has those
drones that can fly around and just

1551
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:52,850
vaporize people,

1552
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:57,060
it's probably not a good idea to
have one of those flying around.

1553
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,620
I'm going to go out on a limb, so
I look for that news. Everybody,

1554
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:06,480
these guys getting arrested in the
next couple of weeks. Um, okay.

1555
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:08,200
We also have the youtube video of the uh,

1556
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:11,160
the jets strength coach
tripping the Dolphin.

1557
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:13,150
If you just want to watch that and shit,

1558
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:17,160
just watch that with my psycho analysis.

1559
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:21,960
Is that all right? My psycho
psycho analysis of that guy? Uh,

1560
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:26,850
is that it? I think that's it. Those
are the youtube videos of the week.

1561
01:38:26,851 --> 01:38:30,330
And what are we up to here
at this point? Ah, by Golly,

1562
01:38:30,331 --> 01:38:34,920
we look at that 53 fucking minutes.
Um, I know what I need to do.

1563
01:38:34,921 --> 01:38:39,120
I need to hype my last stand up Gig,
my last official,

1564
01:38:39,121 --> 01:38:42,300
one of the official one of the year.

1565
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:46,440
I am going to be at the Improv
out here in Bray, California.

1566
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:52,190
Beginning this Thursday and I'm going to
conclude on Sunday and it's going to be

1567
01:38:53,341 --> 01:38:55,500
a, what is that? December 16th,

1568
01:38:55,650 --> 01:39:00,090
17th 18th and 19th.
Um,

1569
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:04,970
and I got to tell you my new hour is,
I'm really happy with where it's at. Uh,

1570
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:07,200
so I figured something out
somewhere during Seattle,

1571
01:39:07,201 --> 01:39:11,640
right through the cobs Gig in San
Francisco and I'm really excited,

1572
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:15,990
really excited to go out
there. So, um, you know,

1573
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:21,820
come on out and see me. How
about some Latino people? Ah,

1574
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:25,320
trying to break into this
market out here. I, I don't,

1575
01:39:25,321 --> 01:39:28,800
I don't know how to get in touch with
you guys. You know, I started doing that.

1576
01:39:28,801 --> 01:39:32,760
Resent his stone shit. I
fucking, I quit it. You know,

1577
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:35,730
I really want to learn how to speak
Spanish and I'm realizing that if it did a

1578
01:39:35,731 --> 01:39:40,731
little bit of resent of stone and I
just had somebody who spoke Spanish or

1579
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:42,840
Mexican,
whatever the fuck it is,

1580
01:39:42,841 --> 01:39:46,530
you skip call it and not trying to offend
anybody. I want to know how to do it.

1581
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:49,710
I think it's fucking, I don't
know, it's a cool language.

1582
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:53,250
I want to learn how to say it and
then I can talk to some Spanish women.

1583
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,470
Who the fuck am I kid?
All right, so that's it.

1584
01:39:55,471 --> 01:39:59,310
I'm going to be there this
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday. All right? If he,

1585
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,800
if he can't make it there and
you're in the San Francisco area of,

1586
01:40:01,801 --> 01:40:05,730
I'm telling you, go see the black
Crowes, go see them because, uh,

1587
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,910
I think they're going to take a little
bit of a break after this tour from what

1588
01:40:08,911 --> 01:40:13,650
I've heard. Uh, you know,
it just fits into my whole,

1589
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,600
don't go to the automated checkouts.

1590
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:18,360
Don't go to see these fucking
autotune jackass is go,

1591
01:40:18,361 --> 01:40:22,830
go see the real fucking deal. All
right there. I'm done with that shit.

1592
01:40:22,831 --> 01:40:27,630
And with that, is that the podcast for
this week? I'm coming up a little short.

1593
01:40:27,631 --> 01:40:31,740
All of a sudden, am I running out of gas?
You know what it is, is I'm, I'm in a,

1594
01:40:31,741 --> 01:40:32,160
I'm in my,

1595
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:36,930
my vacation mode already and
I'm in a silly fucking mood.

1596
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:40,920
I got my Christmas tree and I'm going
to be singing out those fucking holiday

1597
01:40:40,921 --> 01:40:45,540
songs this weekend on stage
or just society that just
for the podcast listeners,

1598
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:49,660
and I'm not even going to explain why
I'm doing it. I'll be telling Joe again,

1599
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:54,380
this guy can go fuck himself. It's
the holidays. Cs Ed Dolby go bay doe.

1600
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,460
Um, all right. Who's kicking?

1601
01:40:56,461 --> 01:40:58,330
Tell him I'm going to keep
repeating that fucker joke.

1602
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,040
Is that what I'm going to do,
Bill?

1603
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,920
Are you pulling the Paul Mccartney
right now and you don't know when to get

1604
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:06,880
offstage according to that one
fucking listener? I think I am.

1605
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:11,020
Did I have any underrated,
overrated, underrated?

1606
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:14,530
A four door pickup truck
like I rented this week,

1607
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:17,560
couldn't believe how convenient was
I went to go see the black crows.

1608
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:20,140
I put me and four other
adults in that thing.

1609
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:24,130
We went to go see him and
then the next day I got a,

1610
01:41:24,131 --> 01:41:28,600
I got a fucking a Christmas tree
in the back, standing upright.

1611
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:34,510
You know, it's funny when I put it in
the truck, uh, these three people walk,

1612
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:35,490
we're walking down the street.

1613
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:38,170
One of them was some Mexican
dude and he in Spanish,

1614
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:41,860
he said something and started laughing
and I was convinced he was laughing at my

1615
01:41:41,861 --> 01:41:42,694
tree.

1616
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:47,800
You know another reason why I would have
loved to gut through the Rosetta stone

1617
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:49,460
so I could have said in Spanish,
um,

1618
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:54,280
actually it's not the Charlie
Brown tree or right Hector,

1619
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:58,270
it's supposed to look like that.
Thank you. Very classy. It's very much

1620
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:03,730
just a freak them out. You know
what I mean? Cause you know,

1621
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:05,620
nobody thinks a white
dude could speak Spanish.

1622
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:09,400
Like how many times did George Bush catch
somebody's saying something fucked up

1623
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:14,401
is he sat there in his fucking white
elite fucking brown penny loafers with no

1624
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:20,260
socks and is Pete Carroll Coaching Pants,
right?

1625
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:25,090
Jesus Christ of the Seahawks get their
fucking asses kicked this week or what I

1626
01:42:25,091 --> 01:42:28,120
went to and to this week,
everybody, I finally went 500.

1627
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:32,950
I got something for first for gamblers
out here that I know you're all going to

1628
01:42:32,951 --> 01:42:37,540
agree with. All right. And, uh,

1629
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,330
oh before I said, you know, one of the
reasons why I didn't do an extra podcast,

1630
01:42:40,331 --> 01:42:42,970
because a lot of people were asking
me how come right after the jets game,

1631
01:42:42,971 --> 01:42:47,590
you didn't do a podcast making fun
of the jets. That's because I didn't,

1632
01:42:47,591 --> 01:42:49,220
I didn't believe in our defense.
And I thought it,

1633
01:42:49,221 --> 01:42:53,200
we had a really good chance
of not, uh, you know,

1634
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:56,410
of losing that game by a couple
of points just because you know,

1635
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:59,230
when you let a 24 to 30
points, that's what, you know,

1636
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:03,670
that's definitely a possibility.
And a,

1637
01:43:03,671 --> 01:43:05,760
I just thought it would have
been bullshit if I came. Yay.

1638
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,230
You know what the fuck you,
you fucking lost.

1639
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:10,900
That's also why I kind of
took it easy on you this week,

1640
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:13,510
which you probably don't think I did,
but hey,

1641
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:18,070
I did defend your fucking strength
and conditioning coach did and I will.

1642
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:21,550
All right then why don't I just talk
about that and I can't remember what I was

1643
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:23,740
talking to. Oh, here's one
for the gamblers out there.

1644
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:27,820
So I took the eagles last night.
All right.

1645
01:43:27,821 --> 01:43:30,870
Given three and a half against
the cowboys had they want,

1646
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:35,710
I would have gone three and one which
I desperately needed instead, you know,

1647
01:43:35,711 --> 01:43:37,990
and they drive down,
write down the fucking field,

1648
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:43,390
all write that down by three points and
they can kick a field goal and win the

1649
01:43:43,391 --> 01:43:46,960
bet. But because it doesn't matter,
they just want to win the game.

1650
01:43:46,961 --> 01:43:49,150
They take a knee and they
run out the fucking clock.

1651
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:52,070
And this is a rule that
I think NFL should do,

1652
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:55,200
you know,
subtly without letting the public know,

1653
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:58,420
because they really can't line
up with gamblers in or anything.

1654
01:43:58,450 --> 01:44:03,450
I really think that is in a sign of
solidarity for the regular Joe out there

1655
01:44:05,941 --> 01:44:09,990
were actually had the balls to put money.
So believed in your fucking team.

1656
01:44:09,991 --> 01:44:14,550
If you put money on your fucking team
and you have a chance to cover the spread

1657
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:17,820
and the final fucking second.
Sheesh. God dammit, you should do it.

1658
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:21,990
Andy Reid kicked a field goal.
You fucking asshole.

1659
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,830
Oh, I needed three in one. I needed that
so fucking bad. So now I'm too went to,

1660
01:44:27,831 --> 01:44:29,810
I can't pick a game to
save my fucking life.

1661
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,770
You know it was funny was
I took Tampa this week,

1662
01:44:32,771 --> 01:44:36,520
Tampa and Atlanta had been my
goto teams and I, for some reason,

1663
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:40,540
Carolina has been a little Jekyll
and Hyde, so I, the game scare me.

1664
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:42,640
It's a divisional game.
I just didn't fucking like it.

1665
01:44:42,641 --> 01:44:46,670
I stayed away and I went with the ramps
because the saints have been Jekyll and

1666
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:48,950
Hyde and I wasn't buying into
this. Oh, here they come,

1667
01:44:48,951 --> 01:44:52,730
shit that they've been doing the last
couple of weeks at Sam Bradford has been

1668
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:54,830
shown that he can play at that level.

1669
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:58,390
You know,
hundred percent wrong on that game.

1670
01:44:58,391 --> 01:45:02,200
And I can tell you this right now
to save yourself a fucking all sir.

1671
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,440
When the team,
you bet on throws a pick six.

1672
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:08,710
I don't give a fuck if it's in the first
quarter. Shut the game off. It's over.

1673
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:13,570
It's like God damn. 14 point
turnaround. All right, whatever.

1674
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:17,700
I bitched moaned and complained enough.
We're coming right up on an hour.

1675
01:45:17,701 --> 01:45:21,870
I think that's a good, that's a good,
that's a good number. Isn't it? That's it.

1676
01:45:22,290 --> 01:45:25,940
God bless all. Yeah. I hope you
enjoyed the podcast this week. Uh,

1677
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,850
get out there and go do your quads at
Christmas or a Hanukkah. Is it over yet?

1678
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:32,760
I saw a couple of people driving around
with Menorahs on top of the car's not

1679
01:45:32,761 --> 01:45:37,320
even bullshitting. Um, I've done only
idiots did that with Christmas trees.

1680
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:42,270
They mocking the idiocy of Christians
or they like, we can be dumb to,

1681
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,750
you know, like how women do. Yeah.

1682
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,960
How come only you guys get to box and
have brain damage. We want it to it too.

1683
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:52,380
You know,

1684
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:57,380
why are women's so convinced that
everything guys do is so fucking worthy of

1685
01:45:57,621 --> 01:46:00,020
getting involved in too?
You know, we're dumb.

1686
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:05,950
Just sit back and think a minute.
Just sit back and think a minute.

1687
01:46:06,130 --> 01:46:11,130
I want to join the workforce rather than
sitting around hanging out with cute

1688
01:46:11,201 --> 01:46:14,860
little kids. I know it's a job.
What the Fuck's wrong with you?

1689
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:19,820
Wouldn't that be awesome as a guy?
Just think about that right now.

1690
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:22,840
If the roles were reversed,
you know,

1691
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:28,990
and you had the option of just Mary and
some rich broad who just go out there

1692
01:46:28,991 --> 01:46:33,991
and just take care of you and all you
gotta do is just keep the house clean and

1693
01:46:34,101 --> 01:46:38,940
make a meatloaf a couple times a
week you can just tap out. Okay.

1694
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:41,670
You know,
I'm not saying you have to do that,

1695
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:45,950
but there's a lot of us out there who
would, okay, I do that for a couple.

1696
01:46:45,970 --> 01:46:48,840
I think I'll be in the fucking
stay at home dad for a couple of,

1697
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:52,810
and just chill the fuck out.
Right.

1698
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:58,960
Getting an incredible shape. So sick. All
those broads out there talk why? Again,

1699
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,010
I understand what they're out of shape
because they had to carry the baby.

1700
01:47:01,011 --> 01:47:04,670
But if you're a guy, there's no fucking
reason why you can't be in shape.

1701
01:47:04,671 --> 01:47:07,460
He didn't have to carry that kid around.
You know,

1702
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:10,230
you got all day long to work out.

1703
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:17,720
Oh my God, there'll be the shit. I know
what you think it out of these kids.

1704
01:47:17,721 --> 01:47:19,820
They never fucking go
to sleep. Yeah, they do.

1705
01:47:19,821 --> 01:47:24,520
They take a nap every fucking you can
nap with them. You can figure out a time,

1706
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:29,190
you can go out and go buy all kinds of
healthy food and then just chill out.

1707
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:32,330
I would get the fucking NFL package.

1708
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:37,650
I would just whine to my rich wife in,
just be a, come on guys, I won. Yay.

1709
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,900
Would you, you know,
do like the, you know,

1710
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:43,450
they do the little girl thing when
they want something, why did you start?

1711
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:47,640
I just your baby, you'd buy it for
me. I do that with the NFL package.

1712
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:54,340
You know, just make it a little weed here
when the kids are screaming. All right.

1713
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:56,490
And I would fucking
tape every goddamn game.

1714
01:47:56,491 --> 01:48:01,491
That would be my mission every week that
I was going to watch all 16 NFL Games

1715
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,400
or whatever the fuck they have,
Cup people have by weeks, 14 games,

1716
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:06,270
whatever the fuck it is.

1717
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:11,630
And I would sit there like a fucking
defensive coordinator who was waiting for

1718
01:48:11,921 --> 01:48:15,900
the phone to ring, you know, and what's
going to get picked up or some shit.

1719
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:19,620
And I would just, I would watch all
of those games and I would get a gate.

1720
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:25,300
I get up a padded fucking play room where
the kids couldn't hurt themselves and

1721
01:48:25,301 --> 01:48:28,510
I just fucking get a gate where they
couldn't get out and I just stick them in

1722
01:48:28,511 --> 01:48:33,511
there all day at play amongst yourselves
and that I would just watch all these

1723
01:48:34,281 --> 01:48:37,010
games and every once in a while
I would just throw food in there.

1724
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:40,210
Like they will like, you
know, animals at the zoo,

1725
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,090
you know,
rather than making three sandwiches,

1726
01:48:48,091 --> 01:48:51,510
I'd make one big one and I just throw
it in the middle and then just film it

1727
01:48:51,511 --> 01:48:55,810
like the discovery channel, you know,
with the pecking order, like the,

1728
01:48:55,811 --> 01:48:58,410
the most dominant male
lion gets to eat first.

1729
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:01,620
Then all the other ones are sitting
there, you know, Growlin and shit.

1730
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:05,170
Waiting to see when the, when the
biggest one is full, when they can go in.

1731
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:11,860
I think I'd like that. Uh, all right,
that's it. That's a podcast for this week.

1732
01:49:11,861 --> 01:49:12,970
Please help me out.

1733
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:16,040
I want to know about that one legged
gold digging horror running down the

1734
01:49:16,041 --> 01:49:17,510
sideline.
If she could keep going.

1735
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:21,050
I want to know what tuning ACDC is
using on the flick of the switch album,

1736
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:23,290
particularly,
uh,

1737
01:49:25,570 --> 01:49:29,440
houses on fire and rising power. And, um,

1738
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:34,680
it'll be funny if it's standard tuning.
My ear is just that bad add.

1739
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,150
What's the last thing?
Was there anything else?

1740
01:49:38,151 --> 01:49:40,690
I know I fucking asked you something
else. I don't fucking know one. All right.

1741
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:45,420
That's the podcast for this week. Have
a great week. Opiate jointed. Go Fuck.

1742
01:49:45,421 --> 01:49:47,790
[inaudible].
