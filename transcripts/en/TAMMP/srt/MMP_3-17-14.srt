1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,760
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:05,940
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,470
March 17th,

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,260
2014 St Patrick's day fallen on a Monday.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,680
We're really going to see who the
fucking real drinkers are. This.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,200
You don't want to falls in
Monday. Either way, whatever.

7
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:23,340
I'm still touring Canada with the
wonderful Paul Versey who was once again a

8
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:27,090
special guest here on the podcast.
Welcome Paul. Versey. Oh, what's up man?

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,180
I'm hanging in there. I'm doing well in,
what do we got left? Tell me what days.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,460
Put the blinders on and didn't think
about getting home. You can't and we got,

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,600
what do we got? We got
tonight, we got, you had to,

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,860
were worth three days away from being
home. We got one tonight and vent. Cool.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,480
Yeah. Then we're in a Victoria,
Korea. Then we go back to Calgary.

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,040
Back to those animals, animals, animals
in Calgary. Jesus, not the first show.

15
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,670
The second show. Wow. I'm
like, God, I'm trying to, yeah.

16
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:59,070
We wanted to reach out to
people in Calgary before we,

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,670
we just brand everybody in Calgary
animals like they were fucking pounds.

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,020
You know, that first show was
great. They, yeah, they were great.

19
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:11,760
That second show though. Whoa.
Yeah, yeah. They were like,

20
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,130
uh, they will come in and
with cases, a tall boys,

21
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:18,240
they were allowed to bring those little,
those little cardboard pallets hammered,

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,220
hammered fucking hammer.
Then they had like, uh, at,

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,880
you know, I think part of it had to do
with the fact that it was at a college.

24
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:30,060
So I think there was college kids there
that just put myself in that mindset

25
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:33,810
going, dude, I drank like that when
I was in college. This isn't how,

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,891
I don't know they'll do it.

27
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:39,570
That wasn't all college people because I
asked the crowd and like, that was just,

28
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:42,450
I think that was a lot of just Calgary
man. I think that was late at night.

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,720
You know, the, I think what
was permitted on the premise,

30
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,850
it's turned them into fucking animals.
Yeah. You know they, you know what,

31
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:53,520
by the time I went on stage and I
got halfway through my set, it was a,

32
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:57,570
most of them had kind of like passed out
like it got was getting quiet and I was

33
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:01,050
standing up there going like,
am I bombing up here?

34
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:03,910
And I just kind of was looking at like
five different people who will laugh

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,650
their ass off. And I'm like, I'm
just going to say my head this sober.

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,120
Like there's no way if I'm really bomb.
And I got somebody laughing that hard.

37
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,990
So I was just like, maybe this
show's gone on too long. I'm like,

38
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,240
I'll say that was a rough one. You
know, it was animals and Calgary.

39
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:22,570
What was at the zoo? So fun. So then,

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,500
then we were driving out,
you,

41
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,090
me and [inaudible] were trying to find
a place to smoke a stoby inside. Right.

42
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,510
Or they had this,
they had on that campus,

43
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:37,350
which was really exciting to me was
they had the speed skating loop from the

44
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:40,920
1988 Olympics and they still had ice on
it. We were trying to get on that fucker.

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,070
I'll do. That would've been
a great youtube video if
they loaned us some speeds.

46
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:48,420
Gates going out there in a stand up comedy
close with those giant blades on it.

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,520
I just want to be going fast enough.

48
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,610
I want to be going fast enough where
I'm turned so to the side they can put

49
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,790
those three fingers down, you know when
you go around the corner. Oh my God. Yeah.

50
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,870
No, I would never, I would have been on
youtube for the wrong reasons. All starts,

51
00:02:59,871 --> 00:02:59,980
you

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,320
would have wiped out and I wanted,
you know, when they wipe out,

53
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,540
when the centrifical force
just takes you into the stance.

54
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,900
Yeah,
that would have been a,

55
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,520
that would have been me. So anyways,
we're trying to do that. Uh,

56
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:12,620
we ended up finding this
great place to smoke a cigar,

57
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:16,450
so we're driving out and we're trying
to figure out going to do was, you know,

58
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,790
we're talking about the show going like
there wasn't me or that first show was

59
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,750
good, but that second show. Wow.
Um, did you feel the same way?

60
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:28,100
And we don't basically exchanging notes.
And as we drive out of the venue, uh,

61
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,540
we see this group of fucking hammered
people and this guy he's got,

62
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,970
you know what those things like when
they have a parade, go down the street,

63
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:39,080
those giant like metal um,
barriers or barricades. Yeah,

64
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,050
those metal ones that have like,
it looks like a fucking, I dunno,

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,640
whatever giant metal barricade.

66
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,750
This fucking guy picks it up with one
hand and he's got it over his shoulder,

67
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,711
turns around,

68
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:52,940
sees us coming and then waves us through
like he's some sort of official for

69
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,470
half a second. The way he did it, I
thought he was. And then as I drove by,

70
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,770
I'm looking at them and I see he's Sam,

71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,790
he's hammered and then I see on his face
it registers that were the two comics

72
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,610
he just saw. So, um,

73
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,700
I just pull away from him and as I'm
driving and you're going like, wow, man,

74
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,280
that guy just had, was carrying that
thing with one hand. What the fuck?

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,390
I turn around and look in the rear view
mirror and this guy's running after the,

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,280
the co we're doing probably
like about 15 miles an hour.

77
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,160
And this dude is running,
I was saying he looked like,

78
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,910
you know when they show highlights of
Babe Ruth hitting a home run when they

79
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,670
show him running and fast legs? Yeah
he was, I think he was mocking running.

80
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,950
I don't think he was really gonna do
anything cause I didn't get scared.

81
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:32,840
But I want to look in the rear view
mirror and I just saw this guy.

82
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:37,160
Just imagine you're driving along
after a fucking work and or whatever.

83
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:40,730
I kind of halfway out of it and then
you look in the rear view mirror and you

84
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,500
see somebody running.

85
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,070
But in this exaggerate rated way where
he was like pumping his fucking arms like

86
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:47,420
that,
it was like he was mocking it.

87
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,570
I didn't see it. All I saw was you
go, what the f you go, what the fuck?

88
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:53,060
And you just stepped on the gas.
But I was in the past

89
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,980
underpowered fucking rental car

90
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,470
and all of a sudden you go, what the fuck?
And I go, what? And he just stepped in,

91
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:01,900
I guess you go that got you started
running after the car. And I was like,

92
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,500
Holy Shit. Because I saw
one of his friends, right.

93
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,510
One of the just collapsed, like they
were so hammered that he didn't hit any,

94
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:12,130
he just felt like I just fell
and I just saw his legs go up.

95
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,340
But they were fucked up
through those kids. I would

96
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,870
be lying if like,

97
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,070
like three times yesterday and this
morning I woke up and I was picturing that

98
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,730
guy running behind the car and I laugh
every time. It was fucking nuts. Yeah.

99
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,470
Those guys were hammering man. Yeah.
So we got tip tip of the cap to a,

100
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,340
the drinking ability.
Yeah.

101
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,650
Not Encouraging that from
where we come back Wednesday.

102
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,920
We definitely like to have people try to
behave more like the first show where,

103
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,480
uh,
you know,

104
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,870
I don't feel like I'm interrupting your
drinking with my most of my jokes. Yeah.

105
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,520
That, yeah. That was deaf stuff. They were
great doll. The crowds are great. Yeah.

106
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,940
Yeah, they were great. But yeah, man,
that was still was another level. Yeah,

107
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,580
there was, there's always
a couple, there's always a
couple of hammered people,

108
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,820
but that was where it was getting to
the tipping point. Like kind of like,

109
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,980
you know, right before Hitler took
power where it's just like, what

110
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,370
side am I going to choose here for?
My own survival is,

111
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,710
that's what the drunk
versus sober level was.

112
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:07,700
By the time I got about 40 minutes into
my set, it was kind of like you're doing,

113
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,420
you're doing an hour plus I'm going
out there, up front, you know,

114
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:15,030
I could kind of see that their animals,
but you know, he just, you going out to,

115
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,580
by the time you're
halfway through your set,

116
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:19,640
these guys are like six tall boys in.
It's a shit show.

117
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,920
It's a fucking shit show is shit show
Edmonton Edmonton was unbelievable.

118
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,660
Edmonton at that venue.

119
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,530
You remember that one with the
orchestra fucking place there. Oh yeah.

120
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,340
That was great. So then when we have
a great time there and then the uh,

121
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,070
we ended up, uh, what the fuck did we
go? I remember we kept leaving the hotel.

122
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,630
We kept joint drove around or, but
you had, you had to get socks first.

123
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,290
He's fucking hilarious birds.
He has not done laundry.

124
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,820
I bought new shit, you know
dude, we're like 20 what?

125
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,950
Seventies we were 16 days in.
Yeah.

126
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:58,610
You've got 16 days worth the
fucking socks and drawers. Yeah,

127
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:01,400
I got them in a plastic bag and, and I
went to the store and I bought new ones.

128
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,950
You know what would have cost
me the same fucking thing.

129
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,190
We got to take a picture of your bag at
some point. Post it up big as it gets.

130
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,140
Yeah. Oh, he has them on the outside
pouch. What? You're checking the bag.

131
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,630
So I guess it doesn't matter, but uh,
I just did mine for the second time.

132
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,540
I that I fucking hate
having a dirty laundry.

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,210
You go back past a certain amount of days,
like I'm doing three,

134
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:26,120
four days in a row. Plastic bags
stuffed them in the front or whatever,

135
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,430
but mainly do mine at home.
Is it,

136
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,160
do you do what it does your wife do it and
my wife does it. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Hey,

137

skating now and he wants to get better at

140
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:48,290
it. And um, so we're
fucking then uh, Edmonton,

141
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,140
the next morning we got to
drive down to Calgary in force.

142
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,980
He's going like this gotta be a place here
to skate. So we find out they have, uh,

143
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,460
they have a skating rink at the
mall and I only use it a mall.

144
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:02,520
It's one of the most giant malls
in North America. America. Yeah.

145
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,100
West Edmonton Mall rivaling. Uh, what's
that one in Minnesota. Mall of America.

146
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,730
All of America. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
So, which I've been to that one too.

147
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:11,990
So we go to that one.

148
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,800
We're walking through there with a
fucking skates to middle aged guys walking

149
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:18,950
through this thing with fucking
skates and a, we walk in,

150
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:22,820
there's like this giant pirate
ship. I mean like, yeah,

151
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:25,190
you could say all the fucking ocean
with this fucking thing. Yeah.

152
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:28,270
It was a flicker of official
and I look on the other side.

153
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:31,820
It was really deep water and they took
all this time to make it look like there

154
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:35,280
was a ship wreck. Jesus Christ. I
mean like you could fucking, yeah,

155
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,190
it was monstrous man. Like Shaq could
drown in this water if he didn't.

156
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,830
That's how fucking deep it was.
Huge.

157
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,440
And then we look on the other
side and I'm like, Paul, I'm like,

158
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:43,850
is that a fucking sea lion?

159
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,330
They had sea lions at this thing and
they're like thrown at fishing. Fishing.

160
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,750
It was catching trainer was don't,

161
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,450
it wasn't like people just walking
by throwing shit from the food court.

162
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,130
It was a trainer throwing it.
And um,

163
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,400
so we're just walking through the mall,
walking through the mall.

164
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,930
Endless fuck him all. They had a
water park there. Yeah, it was,

165
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,030
I didn't look at any stores. I was too
distracted by the shit in the middle.

166
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,780
And then we finally get all the way to
the ice palace that called the Ice Palace

167
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,960
and we got all excited and we're the
only people with skates just walking

168
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:13,261
through,

169
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,340
holding a fucking dump skates and we
get all the way to the other side versus

170
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:19,620
all excited. Like, dude, I'm telling you,
I'm gonna get better at this. You wait,

171
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,530
I was getting, I was ready this
summer. He was already talking shit,

172
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,470
they were calling it right now.
I'm going to be fucking skating backwards.

173
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,170
You're going to be like, what the
fuck happened? Versie yeah, right.

174
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,510
And then we show up and uh,

175
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,960
there's a big judo tournament where the
ice rink is and they'd fucking put all

176
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,780
this floor flooring all over
it. How is it denial? I'm like,

177
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:40,860
maybe this isn't the rank. Maybe this
analysis dude, it says ice palace fall.

178
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:45,840
This is it. They covered it up. This is
it. I've got upset though at the moment.

179
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,270
Remember number, that girl,
man, that really bothered me.

180
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:51,600
We were walking through the food
court and you know, we had a gyro.

181
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,450
Great Gyro and just, yeah,
yeah, a great shower.

182
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:57,480
Or just please call Jimmy
the Greek dawn complaint.

183
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:00,330
And you agreed a little too much
white sauce and it was pasty. Yeah.

184
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,910
Wasn't it wasn't, yeah, it
was a little PC. One scoop.

185
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,020
He went to one school blessing a little
hot sauce and it would have been far

186
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,700
sighted. He got excited. It would have
been epic. Yeah, we, you got excited.

187
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,610
So then I said to bill, you know, I like

198
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,950

kid, I always felt, you know, it was Nah,

199
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,630
I don't know. I just remember,

one and I go, yeah, like a pink berry.

217
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,020
And she kinda just like gives a shake off.

218
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:50,540
Like why are you and she fucking did.

219
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,100

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,780
And we were walking around and I wanted
to find her. I wanted to find this again.

224
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,640
They did the loop on the phone.
I didn't know that,

225
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,440
but I said to bill and we got to the car.
I go,

226
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,970
I wanted to find it cause I would
have just went up to and go,

227
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:15,640
you know something. I found it and
you're a mean jerk, and then you go,

228
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,474
why would you do that?

229
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,430
Jerk. That's terrible. What am I
going to call her a cunt? Well,

230
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:24,180

to go with me and jerk. I mean, you know,

231
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,510
I hate that you're a girl mentality.
That pretty good day.

232
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,110
You're mean or you're a jerk if you
want to stay clean. But if you go,

233
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:33,390
you're a mean jerk. No,
you're not. You're not.

234
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:36,510
You're not pretty inside in a pretty
inside. It doesn't give a fuck.

235
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,990
She's the hot girl at the mall. Pall.
Put yourself in her fucking pumps

236
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,860

237
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:51,570
tournament down the way, asking if
they know where the ice cream store is.

238
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,460
They looked at us the way they were
supposed to. I, you know what, dude?

239
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,440
I like a sweetheart.
I don't care how you,

240
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:01,950
I would love to hear them tell the story
and then they come and then there's

241
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:03,060
just creepy guy comes up.

242
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,230
Oh good.

243
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,790
Where they're going to
hear it, Paul. Paul,

244
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,450
you ever watch those fucking prison shows?
Which ones? Like the scared straight?

245
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,770
No, not those ones. Where they,

246
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,250
they talk about the worst prisons in the
country and that type of ship. Oh yeah.

247
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:18,980
I seen a couple of minutes.
And you just sit there watching it going.

248
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:23,460
How the fuck would I go in there and
not get raped? What would my game plan?

249
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,760
He gets scared watching
it in your bedroom, right?

250
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,330
Women have to walk out of
the house worried about that.

251
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,020
That somebody is going to, you
know, do just imagine if if, uh,

252
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,640
winter hat on with a puffy ball
on top of it, holding ice skates,

253
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,510
asking for yogurt. If anything, she
probably thought I was fucking gay.

254
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,820
You don't look gay, Paul. I
know, but you're not this.

255
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,810
You're not your beards to terrorists who
need to get a little more metro sexual

256
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:54,230
and not to do that. We were sweared
sweatpants on. Do we want a mess?

257
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,610
Everybody in the fucking girl.
Yeah, that's what you look my beard.

258
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,700
My beard actually fucking says everybody
on the fucking ground. No, but dude,

259
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,550
I don't like the pretty girl who can't
be approached with a question because Oh,

260
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,020
this guy's hitting on me. It's, it's
awful. And you know something that got,

261
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,180
especially the blonde one who went
like shook her head like what?

262
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,260
She's going to be a nightmare. She's a
fucking nightmare for some future guy.

263
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm telling you. She's a nightmare.
She's already selfish. It's over.

264
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,290
What if she just knows what
she wants and we're not at,

265
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,480
Oh this is the thing dude.

266
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,080
You actually aloud like how
old do you think they were?

267
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,120
Probably 2122 yeah.
You learn at 2122 year old.

268
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,960
I met a girl at my age,
not even a one way.

269
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:43,300
She shook it all that and
you let her ruin like to do,

270
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:45,430
we're driving down to Calgary.
She wrote,

271
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,640
I got the rocky mountains on the right
hand side of the car and you're just

272
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,680
still calling. You're calling
her a cunt the whole way down

273
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,640
and bothered the shit out of me. It was
like, why are you, why would you ask me?

274
00:14:55,641 --> 00:15:00,140
How would I know? Dude? You realize how
funny that is that they did that to us?

275
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,640
Like what? Like yeah, they really made us
feel like shit. That's fucking hilarious.

276
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:05,370
If you look at it,

277
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,810
it bothered me the whole time is cause
you wanted to get frozen yogurt that how

278
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:13,310
funny would it be if we chased him down
and frozen yogurt with sugar free gummy

279
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:15,500
bears on it.
It was still all natural,

280
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,680
no organic gummy because how great would
it be if we chased him down and I just

281
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:22,130
walked up to her and I go, you know
something, you hurt my feelings.

282
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,890
I just fucking broke down. You hurt
my feelings. I just want a yogurt.

283
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Oh by the way, people listen.
Listening here. This is last
week. You know, you know,

284
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:36,590
just trying to kill, just trying to
make jokes to not go out of your mind.

285
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:39,880
Being on tour this fucking long is we
were doing the danger field. Everything.

286
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,980
I'll tell you, I've got a friend
of mine loves yogurt, you know,

287
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,920
so we were doing that
and once that went away,

288
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:49,370
that got old somewhere along
the line you started doing it,

289
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,610
you started saying really sentimental
shit to me and then pretending like you

290
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:57,050
were crying and then that just became
like the running joke and then you started

291
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,240
laughing and then you were just like,
you got to do that on stage,

292
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,050
do that crime and things. So now we'll
just go up and like if we'll be like,

293
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:06,470
hey man, I'm tired, but dude,
you know what? Hang on, hang on.

294
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:07,700
What you on the road has been great.

295
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,650
You're the only one I
could have done it with.

296
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,320
And then bill would come and tag it.
That's the best thing.

297
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:17,420
Bill would come and tag and
I would just be like, oh,

298
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:22,090
I was hoping you were going to say that.
It's been,

299
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,170
it's been fucking wonderful for my anger.

300
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,650
I'm going to try to do that when I got
home and like 10 like I'm crying man.

301
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,900
It's fucking hilarious.
So two stories.

302
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,620
We go in to eat and we have this
Filipino waiter, right? By the way,

303
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,620
I like to play the Games where I sort of
hell, where are we? Was that Edmonton?

304
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,700
Was that Calgary? I was having to, yeah,

305
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:42,170
it was Edmonson so I like to do this
thing where sometimes I like to fuck with

306
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:44,120
people so I'll just get on a
phone and I'll be like, Bill,

307
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,720
go along with it and we'll be in
an elevator and I'll go, what? No,

308
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:50,090
that's horse shit. And like bill, just
look what happens. So like I said,

309
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,760
like he had a parole
officer called and he said,

310
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,820
and bill goes all they worked it
up and then instantly Burgos. Yeah.

311
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:59,360
What about that video tape?
I go, Nah, Nah, they said
it's insubmissible and like,

312
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,340
and like the guy, there's just
a stranger. They're right.

313
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:06,050
Sometimes I break out laughing. So bill
calls it, he gets a little emotional guy.

314
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:10,870
So we turn this crying thing, we do it to
like, this has been great, right? We turn,

315
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,230
we turned that into doing it in public.
So we have this Filipino waiter, right.

316
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:18,470
And the whole guy guy was great and he
was talking to us and at the end I just

317
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,980
go, he goes, here's your bill.
And I go, I just want to say stop.

318
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,200
And I kept the dead straight face
and you've been a great waiter.

319
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,500
And I put my hand on his
fucking arm and got, you know,

320
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,440
you're bringing the waters and bill just
looks at and goes. He gets a little,

321
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,810
he gets a little emotional, you know
what I mean? I know, but it's big.

322
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,640
It means a lot guy didn't know what to do.

323
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,950
I had no cause he was so fucking polite.

324
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,840
And he was actually from the Philippines.
So he's jumped right in.

325
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,550
Perfectly good for. And he gets a
little emotional like no, but Billy,

326
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,780
he'd been the waters and I'll do it.
Well he was freaked out. Dot. Yeah,

327
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,250
that's the new game on the road.
You have the best one. I got to say,

328
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,930
the best one was at the airport yesterday.

329
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,860
We got to the airport yesterday and
bill starts busting my balls about my

330
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:02,910
laundry and he goes, Versie fucking 16
days. And you're caring. And you know,

331
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:06,630
dirty socks and underwear. And I
go, dude, I go, I bought new ones.

332
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,180
You know the dirty ones
are tied up tight in a,

333
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:13,980
in a plastic bag and bill just goes,
just secure emotions. And Dude,

334
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:15,840
I fucking could not walk.

335
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,230
I couldn't walk and I had to stop pulling
my fucking the bag I'd checked cause

336
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:24,750
we were laughing so hard. And it does,
it works though. It makes it, it makes,

337
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:27,930
it's fucking great. It's driving
a tour manager nuts. Oh yeah.

338
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:28,840
That's the one thing we yeah,

339
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,860
well because women don't want to see
a guy getting emotional like that.

340
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,250
It's just, well no, cause once
somebody cries it's over. Yeah.

341
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Like when I go out afterwards and I'm
taking pictures with people and stuff,

342
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,310
I always come back. I was just
saying, I got to tell you, you know,

343
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,320
I've seen a lot of people do that,
you know, doing the picture thing,

344
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,520
but you gotta be one of the best

345
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,950
wives. She's going, would
you stop fucking doing that?

346
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,880
Our wives are going to go nuts.
Cause you know the first thing I,

347
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:57,780
when I see stays and you see your wife,
we're just going to go. It's been so long.

348
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,380
I miss you so much. No, you gotta,

349
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:02,350
you gotta set it up with talking like
you got to start off normal white day.

350
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,550
You're going to say something really
sentimental to them so they're almost

351
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:08,490
crying and then you cry, which ruins
their crying and I swear to God,

352
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:11,430
you get slugged in the shoulder,
which is all you really want. Um,

353
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,030
I'm the minutes in here. I think it's
time to do a little advertising here,

354
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,880
you know? Okay. What have we got then? I
just shut it off. No, I didn't. Oh Shit.

355
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,920
20 minutes in. I'll
tell you Paul, you know,

356
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,130
time really flies with you on the podcast.
It's been so fun.

357
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,710
This is probably only funny to us,
but I don't give a shit.

358
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,580
Try it with your friends stuff. Fuck that.
If people are with the game is called,

359
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,190
he gets emotional and
just walk into a bar.

360
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,210
Just have one of your friends started
hitting on a woman and then the other

361
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,540
friends got to go along.
Yep,

362
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,350
and then just starts welling up and
then the other guy goes on. Sorry.

363
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:45,990
He just gets emotional and you just got
to let the other person deal with it.

364
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,161
Dude,
you don't want it.

365
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:50,300
The fucking airport where you walked
up to that lady at the con though,

366
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:54,210
the little fucking I sell gum, whatever
the hell it is. He said, excuse me,

367
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:58,040
do you have the one of the biggest
night I broke out of, I go, hey ma'am,

368
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,710
I need to, what are the
biggest condoms you got there?

369
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,140
What's the biggest size condoms you have?

370
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:03,570
I turned around and walked away and you
turned around and walked away and I'm

371
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:07,530
just staring at her and I'm biting my
tongue as hard as I can to not laugh and

372
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,600
then I just burst out laughing.
She said what?

373
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:13,430
And then when you went to repeat it,
you try to point to it and I lost it.

374
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,340
You lost it and had to walk away. Paul,
we're punchdrunk out here. All right.

375
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,360
I got to do a little, I'm going

431
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,910
You can't believe I'm not watching any
gangs because I'm traveling and I'm

432
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:39,010
totally staying up on it. Like, you know,

433
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:42,250
like that a Sunday night when they
show all the football highlights,

434
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,190
it's incredible. Everywhere we've gone
down to sit, there's been a TV within

435
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,710
our right there. Plan,
I ain't write up on it.

436
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:51,650
I'm watching the Bruins when I'm watching
Tyler Sega and having a great year,

437
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:53,180
but they got smoked by the sabers.

438
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,870
I watched the flyers highlights
of a big win over over, uh,

439
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,640
the penguins. I know Vancouver
just beat Longo down in Florida.

440
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:05,170
I know that fucking old
old, uh, uh, flashy toes.

441

There is back between the
pipes in Montreal price. Yeah.

442
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,130
Hey, look at me. The it got, his
first goal is I'm a Canadian.

443
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:14,690
I'm just sitting there watching this.
Paul,

444
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,990
as I'm having a beer with you and an Irish
coffee in a pub around the corner and

445
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,270
my listeners know that I never
drink on pet saint Patrick's day.

446
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:26,990
It's fucking amateur night to use
Jackie Gleason's famous phrase.

447
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,110
Not If you do it early enough though. I
think it's amateur hour tonight. Listen,

448
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,880
not if but we'll be there or not.

449
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,990
If you're in your hotel and all of a
sudden they say there's a gas leak and you

450
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,990
can fucking smell it.
You have to run down the stairs.

451
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,330
Then what he's supposed to do to,
how about the left half?

452
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:44,960
You Shit in the room and you walk up the
street and there's a guy with bagpipes

453
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:49,250
playing that green analog 80 no, no neck
goose. You're not going to go in there.

454
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,750
You know. I'm glad you were had to
look at the band. I'm glad that you're,

455
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:56,090
you're my vantage point
with my back to them.

456
00:24:56,091 --> 00:25:00,170
And you had to look cause when she went
into that like Irish hip hop beat and I

457
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:03,260
just turned for a second so her
like jumping up and down, I just,

458
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,930
I probably would've lost oh yeah,
this is going, I get it back.

459
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:09,810
She can't make head could get back and
got my guess.

460
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,180
I told what can eat right now. How
about that? I said where you go dude.

461
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,800
I hope this is good cause if it's not,

462
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:18,410
I'm just going to have to stare
at my beer. Yeah. Cause she,

463
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,620
she intro to it and it was good.
I just said a version of it,

464
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:22,520
but it was more saying,

465
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,280
they were actually very text
saying this is like Scottish, uh,

466
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,690
beatboxing and I just looked
at Paul and I go poff,

467
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,270
she's about ready do Scottish beatboxing
from the old country. And I go,

468
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:35,270
this is either going to be amazing or
I'm going to have to sit here staring at

469
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:40,010
my beer. Uh, Vancouver's awesome.
Praying for it to be over. Well,

470
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:44,090
let's go to the guests leak.
So we're sitting here in
the hotel. Oh yeah. And um,

471
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,020
you know, I know verse, he is not a
morning person. I have not called you one.

472
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,810
I haven't woken you up other than before
going to the airport just to make sure

473
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:54,170
your comments. So if we have a day off,
I don't fuck with you. I let you wake up.

474
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,840
Yeah, it's, it's a great, it's
great. I don't poke the bear,

475
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,060
so I know that we're
going to do the podcast.

476
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:03,740
We were gonna try to do it
around 12 noon here and uh,

477
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,750
cause I'm trying to sleep off this little
cold that I've, I've caught. But um,

478
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,990
all of a sudden you, you call me,
I'm like, oh great. Versus these up.

479
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,270
And then you're like, damn dude,
Hailey's, hey, what's going on?

480
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,700
There's a gas leak in the building.
They told us to get out of here.

481
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,280
And I'm just sitting there like,
no,

482
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,740
I was walking out to go get lunch and
all of a sudden I see a construction

483
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:24,360
worker come in full thing. He just runs
in. He goes, hey, yeah, we're running.

484
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,710
We got running. Like it scared me as
I'm walking out, he just goes, hey,

485
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,340
we got a guest and I just smell and
there's a hundred construction workers

486
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:34,460
outside and just warning
people to run down the street.

487
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:37,550
It was like a fucking seat. Some
gone, oh shit. Bills up there.

488
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,930
So let me call it bill because
it's a friend like shit
that you thought about me.

489
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,000
Okay.

490
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,210
So I called bill and I go, dude, you got
to go. There's a gas leak and it smells.

491
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:50,970
You got it. They're going to probably
evacuate you go you, you cut me off.

492
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,610
You heard gas leak and they're probably
going evacuate what? You go do it.

493
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,280
I'm on my way down. And then you just
got the fuck you got the fuck out.

494
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,160
And I don't mind getting blown up.
I'm worried about burning to death.

495
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,600
So I had to get the fuck out of this.

496
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:03,300
So I'm grabbing everything and I'm sitting
there going, I've got to get out of,

497
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:05,130
you've got to get out of here.
And I grab my watch and I'm like,

498
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:08,580
that's going to be the move right there.
That fucking kills me. So I go outside,

499
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,550
you know, try to find the exit
and I've run it down and thing.

500
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:15,660
And when I got to the the right to right
where I go, I'm on the fifth floor. Okay.

501
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,290
These, this construction guys were working
on some sort of line in the street and

502
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,210
somebody fluffed up and hit something.
Yeah.

503
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,710
So I got right to the fire escape doors
doing and it smelled like when you go to

504
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,050
light a grill and you think you have,
uh,

505
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:31,740
some juice left in your automatic lighter
and there isn't and you just take that

506
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:34,980
extra three seconds to find some
matches and then you light it and goes,

507
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,100
you don't get, Whoa, what the
fuck? That's what it smelled like.

508
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:40,260
A little more intense. And I'm
thinking, I'm on the fifth floor.

509
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:44,890
This fucking place. Yeah. So
I ran down those stairs, um,

510
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,930
and went out the side and then I got off
the side of the building thinking, okay,

511
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:51,540
I'm safe.
And I still smelled it almost worse.

512
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,400
And I was standing right
outside the hotel. Yeah.

513
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,490
Trying to find you and I could
still smell it. I'm like,

514
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,370
if this whole fucking thing's going up,
I'm going to get knocked on my ass here.

515
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:03,150
Cause it at the least because
I can still smell the shit.

516
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,280
I've got a hat on with the pump pod,
Paul,

517
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,220
I'm going to go up like a fucking
bowling alley. So then they finally said,

518
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:11,010
they told all of us to get the hell
out of the way and we backed up.

519
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:13,530
We went down the street, we
got some breakfast and it
thought it was really nice.

520
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,383
A little bit.

521
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,400
It's never not funny.

522
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,940
The Nice. Anyways, the Nice thing
is you got, you got the out here.

523
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,940
You wouldn't have blown,

524
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,680
you were a bird right with the balcony
because they're going to bow. Well,

525
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:30,890
I have a balcony on the fifth floor and
then there's like a patio right on the

526
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:33,740
other side of it. I don't know, Paul,
when you're on fire, you don't want to be,

527
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:37,370
I don't mind blowing up. I just don't
want to burn the debt. It's fucking awful.

528
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,130
Yeah. If there's an explosion, I want
to die. I don't want to be coming out,

529
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:43,460
you know, running down the street like
that naked girl in the Vietnam picture.

530
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,130
That girl like get cause you got
burned by fucking agent orange.

531
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:46,551
That's what she's,

532
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:50,300
she's running down the street cause
skin is hanging off a fucking backside.

533
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,310
Horrible. It's fucking horrible. Paul,
you have a [inaudible] greatest Vancouver.

534
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,770
Yeah. Now we got the image of a naked
girl running down the street on fire. Uh,

535
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,050
yes. That's all. But that's
what I was thinking of. Sorry.

536
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,420
That image touched me when I saw it.

537
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,430
Nobody should die like that.

538
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,400
I swear

539
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,760
to God.
I hope they find them is funny.

540
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:18,410
And this is going to be most annoying
podcast ever. Whatever. Fuck you.

541
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,860
You go to Canada for 20 days
dancing like a monkey. You,

542
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:25,840
you'd got to come up with some shit too.
We get emotional. Um, Vancouver. Yeah,

543
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,700
Vancouver's great. Love it.
I love the Edmonton Calgary.

544
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,560
Unfortunately I didn't
get a chance like that,

545
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,670
that street right outside a hotel man
and all these bars and all these great

546
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:39,020
places to eat. Really, really
fucking fun towns. Yeah. And, um,

547
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,130
when I was in Winnipeg, who wouldn't?
That was her off, you know? No,

548
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,190
let me tell you, those people are tough.
Okay. Well I saw a to the other day,

549
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:47,470
I don't have to finish it, but no
did. Winnepeg was like, you know me,

550
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:50,230
I don't like to fly when I have to win a
peg. I was like, let's go to the airport.

551
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,410
Like, and the people were
great and the food was great.

552
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:58,411
There's no way you like that part of the
world to live there in the wintertime.

553
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,130
It's, you have to be a special
kind of tough or you're,

554
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:06,010
you're out the second you turn 18, like
fuck you parents, you're out. Yeah, no,

555
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:08,160
the people were great. The
food was great. We had Greg,

556
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:12,310
who was outstanding was that that Tortilla
I have, which is a French Canadian.

557
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,510
A meat pie. Yeah. Flaky crust. And they
had the crust underneath. They didn't,

558
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,770
they didn't skimp on that.

559
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:20,740
Sometimes your older at shepherd pie
or a meat pie and they just, you know,

560
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,000
they fucking cook up the meat,

561
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:24,670
stick it in a bold and they put
just a doe on the top. Yeah.

562
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:28,600
And I want this thing, you know, oh, well
I want both parents to be there. Right.

563
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,130
The one on top and on the bottom right.
Just necessarily net.

564
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,190
You gave me a piece of it. It
was unreal. And then I did,

565
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,010
I had chicken salad and make
it cry, you know, it was great.

566
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,290
We had great food over there.
Did you get emotional Paul?

567
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,080
If tasted a lot of things,
but that was,

568
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:48,220
no I, yeah, when my, I love the
room last night. I love that.

569
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,830
Like it's a kind of like a beacon theater
right up front. That's what I love.

570
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,570
Edmonton was like law Edmondton room
almost as a Carnegie was just deep and

571
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,580
layers. I was on that night, dude.

572
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:01,420
I went out there and the fucking add was
working to my, sometimes it fucks me up.

573
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:02,350
It was working great.

574
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,690
Oh Edmonton fucking just shuffle the deck
of all my jokes and then that made me

575
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,610
say all this shit and I was just like
one of those things where I felt like I

576
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,790
was on stage for five minutes on that one.
Now Dude,

577
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,700
you from Edmonton was
that was fucking Edmunton.

578
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,530
Actually I had a show stopper where like

579
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,430
literally in Vaudeville I had a fuck this
guy's a show stop now I had a surreal

580
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,880
triple threat. No, I had a
bad show stopper. I'm, I'm
saying that in a bad way.

581
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:31,050
You Fuck it? Oh, that was my fault.
I shouldn't know. I showed that.

582
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,540
I did that joke where I was just like, you
know women, you know, you guys like it,

583
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:37,060
personal trainers and you,
you know,

584
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,450
you go all out for your wedding picture
and your wedding day and you look great,

585
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:44,170
you'll take an Olympian and then I go
and then it just kind of falls apart.

586
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:48,700
But like, and the place just fucking
stop test someone in the crowd went, wow,

587
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,100
somebody knows somebody goes,
oh my God.

588
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:56,060
And like I had the bid I did before it
killed. And then I did that and I go, no,

589
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,600
and I kind of saved it when I
go know what I'm saying is like,

590
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:01,690
you should just come down the aisle the
way you're going to be like what I'm

591
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:03,880
going to be looking at for
the next 40 or 50 years.

592
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,490
And like half of them laughed,
but I was just like somebody who was like,

593
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,790
well then I told you afterwards and the
look on your face, you would just like,

594
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:14,290
wow, yeah, fuck up. And I was the idiot
when you sent it to me in the restaurant.

595
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:18,790
It was fun. It was funny to me. So I
said, dude, you got to do that on stage.

596
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,790
And then somehow the way you said
that you said it, I was just like,

597
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,980
I mean that's fucking let me that
they'll look dude. I mean he can't,

598
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,530
women have to,
they have to give birth.

599
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,460
Can you imagine what the fuck you do?
You stay in shape,

600
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:32,380
you do all that and then you
can begin to have another kid.

601
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:34,710
You basically going to have to go
through that and what that the angel,

602
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,800
what I'm saying, how could, you know
what I'm saying is, and this is what I'm,

603
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,980
you know, I know women do and,
and you know, my wife looks great,

604
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:45,410
she had two kids and everything and I
know women go through a lot of shit and

605
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,800
have kids. I'm saying don't put
on that show for everybody else.

606
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,710
Be who the fuck you're going to be.
It's the same way people, you know,

607
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:55,730
clean up for company like what? The
regular families not good, you know,

608
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:59,270
and just being nice and Betty who we
don't see ever who's coming over once a

609
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,360
fucking year is what you've got to get
onto your hands and knees would have to

610
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:06,140
pick or two, I'll go
with this. It does suck.

611
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,640
When it's somebody that you don't give
a shit about and your wife's saying,

612
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:14,030
we got to clean this fucking place up
and they're going on. It isn't just like,

613
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,970
okay, let me, let's just pick a
room that we throw all the shit and,

614
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:18,500
and close the door.
Like you,

615
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:21,560
they actually want you to clean up
that they're coming in from Maryland.

616
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,700
I don't give a fuck. I'm not going to
see him again. Right. You know? Right.

617
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:27,380
But as far as I'm looking good
on the Wednesday, I want to,

618
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,610
I want him to look as good as they can.

619
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,640
I would like to know I was trying to do
with a joke and it fucking backfired.

620
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,310
I wasn't there for you as a friend,
you know, and I'll tell you,

621
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:35,480
that's going to haunt me forever.

622
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,070
Um, yeah. But, oh, what, what, what about,

623
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,110
what was the name of that theater
that we played in Winnipeg? Man? Uh,

624
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,920
Burton Cummings. Yeah. That it was,
it was, it was a, I got a little,

625
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,700
some of the history that that
place was made in, uh, 1908.

626
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,270
And they had these, these
fucking stairs in the back. Now,

627
00:33:56,271 --> 00:34:01,260
everybody's Charlie Chaplin.
Uh, uh, who's the guy that, uh,

628
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,300
fatty Arbuckle, Harry Houdini, all these,

629
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,930
it was a Vaudeville theater for like the
first 30 years before the talkies took.

630
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:11,380
Oh, I say, and um,

631
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,270
they still had like the
original stairs in the back.

632
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,150
You walked up to the green
room and these are like slabs.

633
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,650
I don't know what kind of stone it is,

634
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:21,380
but from years of people walking
up and it where you basically,

635
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:22,214
you put your feet,

636
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,070
there was like these indentations from
people's scuffing up as they walking up

637
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:30,100
or coming down. Yeah.
And then outside, uh,

638
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,650
the upper deck of it, the, I guess
the mezzanine and the upper deck,

639
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:35,660
they used to have pews
all the way through them.

640
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,340
And then they put seats in at some point.

641
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:42,341
But in the upper deck they still had
these wooden pews and during my set,

642
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,980
because the acoustics are incredible.
Can you talk in 1908? I mean,

643
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:48,500
I don't think they could really amplify
voice at that point. Could they?

644
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,140
I don't know. Yeah. We don't know. We're
idiots, but I don't think they could.

645
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,560
So it's a,
it's was acoustically perfect building.

646
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,080
So when people were way
up in that upper deck,

647
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,180
we're talking like an old
hockey barn for hockey fans.

648
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:02,750
There are basketball fans where you
felt like if you lean too far forward,

649
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:06,800
you'd fall right on the emblem at center
ice or center court and these people

650
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:08,040
would walk down and it's making that,

651
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,910
that sound like you almost like an
old chair makes all that rickety shit.

652
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,060
And it sounded like it was right above
me and I was sitting there going,

653
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:17,030
are these fucking union guys walking
around and making noise door my show?

654
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,640
And I kept making jokes like that.
They,

655
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,140
that they were already changing
the marquee and they were over me.

656
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:25,190
And what it was was
people in that upper deck,

657
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,650
we're walking down just to go
to the bathroom and get a drink.

658
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,790
But the acoustics were so unbelievable
and it was so fucking steep. It sound,

659
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:35,420
it sounded like it was right above my
head. It was amazing. That was one of my,

660
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:37,860
a place was old school
and then I old shit dude.

661
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,700
So I actually walked up
there at the end of my show.

662
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,240
I wish it did it dude.
It was, it reminded me a,

663
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,040
there's one in Seattle that we did the,
the Moore theater where a,

664
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,110
I think they shut the uh,

665
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:55,450
the video for even flow

666
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,620
found bucket check at DePaul.

667
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,050
That one right when he's fucking hanging
and he's looking like he's bleary eyed.

668
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,350
You know, like he's crazy but he hasn't,
he knows exactly what he's doing.

669
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:09,090
He already knows he wants
to fire his drummer.

670
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,180
We played that one and that one was really
interesting where just like this one

671
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:16,140
that we played in Winnipeg,

672
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,080
they have separate entrances
for the upper deck and that,

673
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,700
I don't know if they
had segregation up here,

674
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:24,060
but in Seattle that that was what
that was for that upper deck.

675
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:28,350
You had it completely separate entrance,
no fucking elevator.

676
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,110
And you just walked up flight
after flight after flight.

677
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:34,860
And these were serious flights,
like 40 14 groupings, you know,

678
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:38,040
two groups of like 14 to get to
one floor all the way, all the way,

679
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,720
all the way up.
And I was joking with the guy going,

680
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,040
this is why African Americans kicked
the shit out of white people because in

681
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:47,610
sports, cause we just rolled into the
theater. Hey, he has to just have a seat.

682
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,660
You've got to do like the fucking stair
master all the way up and come back down

683
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:54,390
just to see a fucking show.
And that's like insanely high man.

684
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:56,990
Like that was scary. High. Yeah. Steep.

685
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,030
It's like you don't want to lead
forward like steep. Like you'll fucking,

686
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,360
it was scary. Yeah. Like I would
not want to be like hammered, oh,

687
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,500
not the up there. And then, you know,
smoke a little joint or something.

688
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:10,830
Some of our smoke a cigar that made me
fucking lightheaded. I would just be like,

689
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,390
I mean if I had to leave I would,

690
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,730
I would go hands and knees backwards
down like a little, you know,

691
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:20,610
a little toddler that goes downstairs.
That's how I would exit with the,

692
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:24,090
uh, with the fear. He liked the Burton
Cummings when I like, I think, um,

693
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,080
I think the vogue last night
was one of my favorites. Man.

694
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,540
I'll do those are two great crowds to,
yeah,

695
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,700
and we're not shitting on Calgary by the
way. It was just that second show dude.

696
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,900
It's been a while since I've been in
front of people that drunk. But uh,

697
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,840
we had another amazing week. Now
when do we play hockey? I'll wait.

698
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,770
We went to the Bruins.
Canadians game. Yeah. And what
does the name of that place?

699
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:46,890
Molson Center. Yeah, they changed it. They
changed it whenever the fuck it is now.

700
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,220
You know, I don't know. Some
sort of cellular company, but uh,

701
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,780
it's just an amazing place to go to.
We see all those retired numbers,

702
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:59,010
all those Bay Stanley Cup banners
and just how into it people are.

703
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,210
And there was some people leaving early
down below that kind of disappointed me.

704
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,650
But it was a beat down.

705
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,300
It was a beat down Bruins fucking killed
three goals in the third period. Hey.

706
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:12,450
And I wasn't obnoxious either. I didn't
like the guy who brought me into it.

707
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,840
He was a Canadiens Fan. He
said, hey, we're going to go
into this, this, you know,

708
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,720
the famous, I don't know, one of
the levels in the mezzanine level,

709
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:22,680
they have this pub. And the guy who
hooked us up with tickets said, listen,

710
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:25,680
I know he's a big Bruins fan, but I
respect, could you just not wear stuff?

711
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:28,450
It gets weird when you going now.
So it's like, yeah, absolutely. I'm,

712
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:32,040
I gonna fucking do that. I'm going
to stand up and share when we score,

713
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,380
but I'm not going to be that asshole.
Go, yeah, we're face, you know,

714
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,040
giving them shit or whatever. I'm not
going to do that. No, no. Yeah, yeah.

715
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:42,580
So I just sat there and like, they're
really fucking enjoyed it. And, uh,

716
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,200
but earlier that day, we actually, uh,
some of the guys from just for laughs,

717
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:51,310
Bruce Hill hooked us up with some ice
time and I got the shit kicked out of me.

718
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,640
And for as he played hockey for the first
time we played at this, this, you know,

719
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:58,800
they've got a zillion rinks out
there and it was a old Canadian, uh,

720
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,110
Stefan can tell, uh, we played, you know,

721
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,420
back when I was first going
to games and shit like that,

722
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:07,770
or maybe we're five years into when I
started going to games and he somehow,

723
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,870
I forget how it was, but his Jersey
was framed there. So anyways,

724
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:15,160
we played on this little sort of mini
rink. We had the floating Blue Line.

725
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:17,440
You bring it to the zone and the
red line becomes the Blue Line.

726
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:21,670
And I've got to tell you, Versie fucking
animal, he's out there with just gloves,

727
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:26,580
a stick and a helmet. Dude, you
had like three shots on net online.

728
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:26,950
I mean,

729
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,710
I don't know if you try it like trying
to tap rebounds in his shots on net.

730
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,330
I don't know how that fucking works,
but dude,

731
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:35,290
you had like three on one shift and I was
sitting there laughing on the bench go,

732
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:38,950
this fucking guy's got more shots on net
in one shift. Well, one of the guys like,

733
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,430
dude,

734
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,800
I said like we were talking like maybe
throughout the whole game I'm going to

735
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:44,080
have like 12 shots,
but I didn't know how to stop.

736
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,700
I got the shit kicked out
of me. I'm falling down and
everyone's got pads but me.

737
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,490
So I'm the most novice in this thing.
All right.

738
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,890
And the only thing I had
was gloves and a helmet.

739
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:58,150
I'm falling on my knees and elbow getting
and like it was so legit that there

740
00:39:58,151 --> 00:40:02,260
were two locker rooms. You had your
own jerseys. There was a timer.

741
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,260
These guys had shifts and I'm
getting thrown into this thing. Okay.

742
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,670
I haven't been on the ice.
You know why?

743
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:10,030
I've been dragging all my stuff up
here because it's, we're going to play,

744
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,060
I want to make sure I'm protected and
I'm not going to wear somebody else's

745
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:16,120
smelly stuff. That's
fucking, that's gross dude.

746
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,260
That's like the pad version of using
your buddy's toothbrush. It's gross

747
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,340
but yeah and and and typical me,
I'm like,

748
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:28,180
I don't know how to play but I just
know scoring position from floor hockey.

749
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:30,940
So I just would go down,
get into scoring position,

750
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:34,210
not know how to stop and just fucking
get the shit kicked out. I would,

751
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,350
I'll tell you this one thing a coach
would never have to tell you is go to the

752
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:43,060
net. That's all you did. The second grade
team. The second your team got the puck.

753
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,060
I just went to do and understand offsides
though are offsides a couple of times.

754
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,920
What the fuck dude, you would just
put your head down and just mirror.

755
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,250
I just started skating and you had you
stick on the ice the wrong way because

756
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:58,120
every time I shot I wouldn't need a
lefty stick. So I had the righty stick,

757
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:01,870
which that an opposite and I kept
doing backhands with the wrong stick.

758
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,430
But I did have a post on that one.

759
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:05,680
Your backhand was lethal cause
you had a right handed stick.

760
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:07,960
Everybody thought you were right hand
and he's going down and go and look at

761
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:08,381
this fucking guy.

762
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:11,500
He's got like all these shots and neck
and he's playing left handed with a right

763
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:15,220
hand to stick was all right. Yeah. Yeah.
No, no, you're good man. You're, you're,

764
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:17,140
you're good at it. I, I was, oh thank you.

765
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,450
I was hoping you were gonna say something.
No cause a little self conscious.

766
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,530
I definitely recognized it.

767
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,220
I skate all right until I get the puck.
I just, I swear to God dude, it's just,

768
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,920
it all falls apart and you know, it's
the funniest thing when I play with guys,

769
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,830
it's two passes to me before my,

770
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,240
before my whole team figures it out
and then it's just like, you know,

771
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:43,970
I then I have to be like literally
going across the Blue Line screaming

772
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,310
something to get the fucking puck back.
But they know now. But you did you,

773
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:51,480
but you had some good passes shot on goal.
There was like,

774
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,170
I liked playing days was
a 13 year old kid there.

775
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,750
There was a 14 year old kid there
and these, and I just was like,

776
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:59,630
but I almost hurt myself. Remember I just
slammed my head, dude. Yeah, that was bad.

777
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,300
I was like, no, I knew you were going
to be. So everyone was saying, hey,

778
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,180
go take some Advil. And you're like, no,
I don't do, I feel fine. I feel fine.

779
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:07,070
And when you fall like
the way you were falling,

780
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,270
those are those deep fucking bruises
and they don't show up for at least 24

781
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:14,300
hours. The best thing Bruce did, he
goes, dude, you don't want to concussion.

782
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:17,570
And he brings me a helmet and
I slipped back to it. If you,

783
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:20,960
if the way you fell on my head, dude, that
would, I would have been over. Oh yeah.

784
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,950
That would have had that awful fucking
sound of a head hitting the back of the

785
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:29,690
head, hitting the ice. Oh my God. I felt
so bad one time somebody skating by.

786
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:32,120
I thought it was you. Somebody
just goes, you got air on that one.

787
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:35,540
Like I was getting the shit kicked out
of me. But this is the thing though.

788
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,180
You were doing it to yourself
that just let people know.

789
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,820
It's not like people were knocking
them down. This was a non contact game.

790
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:45,320
Paul would just go head a fucking
stage like you were gonna run.

791
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,740
It never leaves something.
I never,

792
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,090
the best compliment I got was
when I saw somebody goes, I go,

793
00:42:49,091 --> 00:42:51,320
I never put an ice hockey before. And he
was like, well you've got good balance.

794
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,910
And I was like, have you been watching?
Yeah, I know, right? Hey, let me, let me

795

Okay. I just want to mess it up.

817
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,380
[inaudible].
You're a business owner,

818
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,310
but automated phone systems
and secretaries are not
in your budget just yet,

819
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,850
and juggling incoming calls yourself
makes it hard to look like a professional.

820
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,550
Here's something that will
dramatically help you make more money.

821

does with his lovely and absolutely
fucking hilarious wife Christina presents

visit ski. I'm the worst
trying to read. Um,

858
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,990
Tom has a new special outcall completely
normal that you can download as of

March 15th on iTunes.

860
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,840
I love this guy because
he's just one of those,

861
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,050
he doesn't give a shit in a good way.
Like he goes out,

862
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,950
he's not afraid of silence.
He has something to say, dude,

863
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:03,180
him and his wife arguably. Okay.
I know burns and Allen. Fuck them.

864
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,540
Okay.
You want to go with these two?

865

They crush it like we have like those
all things, comedy shows sometimes. Um,

866
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,770
we were doing them down at Luna and uh,

867
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,250
and Christina came down one night and
absolutely just fucking destroyed.

868
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,560
I'm trying to think. We had,
we had Tom down there too.

869
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:21,980
I've watched Tom and like the
improv forever, but um, he,

870
00:47:21,981 --> 00:47:26,520
he's the real deal and he's on his way to
make it his mark. Uh, and he has a new,

871
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,680
a new, a comedy special, like I said,
completely normal. So check it out.

872
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,860
All right, first question
of the week, and Paul,

873
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:35,680
I know you're going to love this one
because you've been absolutely obsessed

874
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:39,670
with this. Uh, this says the, the name
of the question is where's the plane?

875
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,550
Oh yeah, let's go. Uh, he says, Bill,

876
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,160
using whatever knowledge
you have of the situation,

877
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,680
whether it be a lot or a little,

878
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:51,720
please break down what
happened on that plane. Um,

879
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,280
this is right up my alley.
First of all,

880
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:56,590
it's right up your id knowing you and
you and you hate flying. I tell you,

881
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,080
we know it's annoying as I have to blow
my nose because I'm coming down with a

882
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:03,500
cold. So why don't you start as I
walk over here to blow my nose off my,

883
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,640
because I'm a professional. What do
you think Paul? You're the guest.

884
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:10,840
I'll let you go first here. Would you like
a glass? Go ahead. What do you think? Uh,

885
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,160
I think that,
I think obviously the plane was hijacked.

886
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:19,840
I think that's why the, um,
the, you know, it's hard to

887
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,300
know. Uh, yeah, a little bit.

888
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,370
I think the plane was hijacked. Um, of
course. I think that's why there was,

889
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,330
the communication was cut out and then
they have proof that it kind of diverted

890
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,180
and, and changed its course.
And then nobody heard anything.

891
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,790
I think the fact that the fucking
thing is not in the water.

892
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,510
There's 230 people on a seven 77.
I flew that,

893
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,130
I've flown in seven 77, two uh, Italy.
Oh yeah, dude, that's your nickname.

894
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:53,070
Tell us seven 77 you, yeah, I mean,
so when I fly it now, um, and, and,

895
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,820
and there was, I won't go unless it's
a seven. It's not a center. Yeah,

896
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:01,000
that's not it. It's glass glass the whole
way. The lucky number, you know, seven 30,

897
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:06,000
70, you know, so, uh, so there was no
debris, nothing. So I don't think that,

898
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,720
I think that the plane,

899
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:10,480
they said that the plane could have flown
for six hours after they lost contact.

900
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,100
That fucking thing could be anywhere.

901
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:14,800
Right now there's going to be
a movie about this. I think,

902
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,100
I hope that in off everybody,
you know, God, God forbid,

903
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:20,410
but I think the plane landed
somewhere and was hidden.

904
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,110
And then I think the people that
did it, I think, I don't know what,

905
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,410
I don't know what they did with
the people, but, uh, you know,

906
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:29,260
I don't think it's in the ocean, so,
all right, let's, you know, come on.

907
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:30,310
You've got to put some money on.
Well,

908
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:32,740
listen what country you
pick and casket Stan,

909
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,790
they said it could have gone as
far as Kazic sedan to Zika. Stan,

910
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:41,440
all of those standards, uh, Liam for,
okay, let's say we're at Catholic Stan.

911
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:45,700
I think, uh, yeah, dude, I think that
it landed somewhere and it's fucking,

912
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:50,410
it's just an awful situation. But, um,
I, this is what I, it's the aliens built,

913
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,850
you think? See, I don't know. I think, uh,

914
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,170
with each day that passes that there's
no sort of demand or anything like that.

915
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,840
I'm thinking more unfortunately,

916
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:07,050
I don't know sadistically or whatever
they fluid way off course and I don't

917
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:12,060
know. I mean how, unless you dump a plane
in like the shipping lanes, what does,

918
00:50:12,061 --> 00:50:15,660
what is the odds? The plains has
a beacon. Planes have a beacon,

919
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,780
but it was turned off. I mean,
I dunno, there's something that,

920
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:20,830
that where they can track.

921
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:24,250
It was fucking turned off and
the people knew how to do it.

922
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:28,500
So I think with every passing day,
yeah,

923
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,840
like it's not a good, like
there, there's no demands.

924
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,530
It's just really weird
that, that if, you know,

925
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:40,010
there's always some crazy reason to
draw attention to something that someone

926
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:42,260
does something like this.
The fact,

927
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,820
the only hope that I have is the fact
that they haven't asked for any demands

928
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:52,130
yet is, is I, I dunno, I mean,
what you wanted the plain,

929
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,540
I mean, what the fuck? You know,
how fucked up was your country?

930
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:59,390
You can't get a seven 77 crest.
They're laying all over the place.

931
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:03,770
But what's the motive or the, what's the
motive of the hijackers? Uh, I don't know,

932
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:04,281
but I,

933
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:07,760
I really felt for the family members
because they're sitting there and they're

934
00:51:07,761 --> 00:51:11,060
talking about the airline, how the
airline is handling this, like a,

935
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,740
a business rather than, you know,
what is going on. And they go,

936
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:19,190
we can't comment on anything right
now because basically, you know,

937
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:21,680
it's a cooperation. They're like, we're
going to get the shit suit out of us.

938
00:51:21,681 --> 00:51:24,470
Let's, let's try to limit how much
we're going to get the shit suit.

939
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,850
Like they go into that fucking mode.
Yeah.

940
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:32,120
But it's one of those awful
things where, you know, um,

941
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,170
also, you know, the victims
are going to go into it.

942
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:38,450
We're going to sue the shit out
of your mode. So it's just like,

943
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:41,030
if people could just in this moment,

944
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:45,380
if the airline could be allowed to just
say, we're fucking devastated. I mean,

945
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,610
we had employees on that plane
too, you know, and they could,

946
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:53,630
everybody could just share information
and there wouldn't be that stupid,

947
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,500
you know, lawyers licking their
chops on both sides or one cowering.

948
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:59,300
And the other guy,
other side of licking their chops,

949
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:03,140
maybe they could at least make it a little
more comforting for those people. But,

950
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:07,740
uh, it's in, and, you know, I
guess there's no comedy here,
Dude. It's just, it's fine.

951
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,180
I just feel, I just feel bad for, you
know, there's kids in there and shit, man,

952
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:14,630
it's fucked up man. It's awful. And
it's one of the most unprecedented, uh,

953
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:20,590
mysteries like a seven 77 with fucking
230 peoples disappeared and nobody knows

954
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,850
where it is in the airlines
don't have answers.

955
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,430
And 10 countries had their navies fucking
just scowl at the fucking ocean and

956
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:31,400
nobody can find it. Right?
It's crazy, man. Well, I mean,

957
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:33,770
there's a kind of good thing
there that maybe with the,

958
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:36,470
they're still alive and there's
something you can do to negotiate.

959
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:38,390
But the thing about,
uh,

960
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,480
trying to land a plane like that,

961
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:44,990
it's not like you could just go to some
boot bootleg fucking air strip. I mean,

962
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:48,290
you need a lead, a lot of fucking
runway to land something that big.

963
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,090
It's not like he could go to fucking,
you know, some little last, you know,

964
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:55,200
let's say had it planned unless they
had it planned in a hangar. Yeah.

965
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:58,340
But then what the, what the fuck? So
what are you doing? Okay, you got it.

966
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,830
She took the fucking plane, he
took the people. What do you want?

967
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:05,750
Where are the people? It's
annoying. I mean that like, I mean,

968
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:07,850
I wonder if if they had a
plan and then something,

969
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,780
they shut everything off and then
something else went wrong. How, I mean,

970
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,030
because they gotta be
looking at satellite footage,

971
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,880
like say even like remote areas,
jungles and Shit,

972
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:19,340
looking for pictures of smoke and fire.

973
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:23,300
Something to try and find the
fucking thing. I mean, look,

974
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,820
the biggest mystery still
on the planet is the ocean.

975
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:28,560
So I think that that's where it is.

976
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,970
It's at the bottom of the fucking ocean
in some place where we can't find it.

977
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,260
I hope it isn't,
but that's what I would guess,

978
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:38,040
just for the simple fact that it's just
weird that nobody claimed responsibility.

979
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,910
There's no ransom demands. Um, I mean,

980
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:46,911
how do you sneak a fucking seven 77 and
into something with the amount of fuel

981
00:53:47,211 --> 00:53:50,410
they had? They know the distance it could
go. There had to be something, dude,

982
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,670
there had to be something
to the fact that it's not,

983
00:53:52,671 --> 00:53:56,180
it should be on every fucking like I
don't think there's enough coverage of it.

984
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,800
Hell, I got a picture of Genoa. Well what
the fuck? They probably would be alive.

985
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,201
Well,
I,

986
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:05,480
if some point when there's no new
information becomes like this fucking 250,

987
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:10,430
270 person cold case file that
time to try to find, it's insane.

988
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,590
It's fucking insane. It is. It is. And,

989
00:54:12,591 --> 00:54:16,130
and that's why I kept asking you every
day we'd go hang out and bill would go,

990
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:19,520
Paul, I can't fucking do you keep talking
about it. And I'm like, I can't get it.

991
00:54:19,521 --> 00:54:20,650
I don't get it because you,

992
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:23,780
you got this obsession with fucking
planes and safety, you know,

993
00:54:23,781 --> 00:54:25,130
cause you're afraid to fly it.

994
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:28,010
I don't fucking think about shit
like that and that now your,

995
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:31,430
your fear is starting to rub off on
me. I'm scared. I go to the airport,

996
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,240
I didn't mean to protect my fears
on you. It's okay. You're all human.

997
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:44,550
All right. Uh, whatever. Perfect. I
really hope that that ends, you know,

998
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,780
I hope doesn't have some sort of Chuck
Norris Delta Force thing that ends it

999
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:51,750
fucking happily, but that is a
rough state and I'm like, God,

1000
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:55,140
the fucking poor people, they got
to sit there wondering when, when,

1001
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,990
what's going on and they suffer. Now
what's going on is terrible. It's awful.

1002
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:01,740
All right, great question
buddy. All right.

1003
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:04,110
What's your beef deer farmer bill?

1004
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:08,490
If you could only eat one type of meat
and one type of vegetable for the rest of

1005
00:55:08,491 --> 00:55:09,780
your life,
what would they be?

1006
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:14,790
Got to figure some choices are more
versatile in the kitchen. All right.

1007
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:19,170
Uh, I wouldn't go fish because I would
worry that I'd get the mercury thing.

1008
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,203
Um,

1009
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,420
I couldn't go red meat because I ended
up like John Wayne Chicken is all slimy

1010
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:29,910
and you're fucking end trails.
I would have to go, uh,

1011
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,460
what else is it? Turkey. I
go Turkey. I'd go chicken.

1012
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,390
Cause if you cook it, if you
cook it enough, like you'll
get any kind of, but yeah,

1013
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:42,180
you're right. Yeah. The mercury
in the fish red meat. Your bout,

1014
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:42,961
you're fucking agree.

1015
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:46,950
The fish and God knows what that meltdown
in Japan has done to the fucking Sushi

1016
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:52,170
Jesus. Oh I had sushi
yesterday, man. Fuck yeah. Yeah.

1017
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:56,610
I love fucking Sushi. Oh you got to pop.
You know you're not going to have Sushi,

1018
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,580
but uh, no, I'll go chicken and
vegetable. I hate vegetables. So I man,

1019
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:04,680
it's maybe Spanish, a little
garlic. You know I love vegetables.

1020
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,810
Oh that would actually make you sad
if like this is like fucking said.

1021
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,420
So I guess I would have
Turkey every day with a,

1022
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,130
I almost want to pick a vegetable that I
don't love cause I don't want to end up

1023
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:18,910
hating it because I got
to eat it every day.

1024
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:23,740
Cauliflower every day for the ready
fucking, I'm already hate that shit.

1025
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,460
No cauliflowers unless they make
the cauliflower mashed potatoes.

1026
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,680
That was one of those are bad.
But the one reason why it's not bad,

1027
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,810
it's because you've got all the butter and
salt and pepper in there. Yeah. But he,

1028
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:36,040
yeah, I mean I would go Turkey cause
I could make a Turkey sandwich.

1029
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,810
I could make Turkey sausage.

1030
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:41,860
I could make shrimp list shrimp that
like we saw that guy in Montreal,

1031
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,990
that actor, we were in an elevator
with Bubba Bubba Gump and I didn't,

1032
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,400
I only saw that movie once. Yeah. I
walked in there and I was like, Oh shit.

1033
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:52,540
Now we walked out like, you know
who that was dude? I was like, yeah,

1034
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:55,000
he was in heat. He was down,
was funny. It was funny.

1035
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,900
He was funny and insanely friendly and uh,

1036
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,900
and then I want it to go up and say
something or invite them to his show and I

1037
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:03,820
was just like, let me fucking
leave this guy alone. Right.

1038
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,970
You said you saw another, there was a
bunch of people, there were someone,

1039
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,720
a movie in a hotel,
Turkey,

1040
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:11,500
bacon to think all the different
fucking ways I could do it. Well,

1041
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:14,920
you wouldn't go Turkey, Turkey, you'd be
a nightmare. The of fifth Turkey Sandwich.

1042
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:18,490
You'd be like, I fucked up, dude. Have
to chicken every fucking day. Chicken,

1043
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,020
chicken, Parmesan chicken
Scampi. You don't what?

1044
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:26,560
I just did check in check and Talky,
talky, talky sandwich, Turkey sausage.

1045
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:29,910
I'm talking. You can put Marinara
with Melton boots it. That's fucking,

1046
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,760
that's good for a month, you know?
Then you'd be fucking dead shit.

1047
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,620
You'd be a tub of shit. Dude, do you
can eat chicken palm every other day.

1048
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:40,990
You wouldn't be a tub of shit
if you eat chicken every day.

1049
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,740
You know you've got to mix it up palm
with all the pasta and all that shit.

1050
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,550
Got fucking bread. Your
red wine discussing crimes.
Whatever you Sicilians though.

1051
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,350
I guess I would go Turkey.

1052
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,240
I love a Turkey sandwich and I think
chicken is overrated in and then just the

1053
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,990
shit that you know, chickens, you
know you've got the Salmonella,

1054
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,950
you get all that fucking
shit with that, you know. Oh,

1055
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:06,480
there's a problem with everything. We know
Paul, maybe we have a problem with you.

1056
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,040
You ever think that?
No.

1057
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:16,420
I go chicken, spinach, chicken,
spinach. I would go Turkey.

1058
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:20,860
You have a Turkey really doesn't
go go with the vegetable. Chicken.

1059
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:24,010
Spanish is a good one that Chris Paul,
you're better at this than I am.

1060
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:28,570
All right dude. You're a fucking, you
committed some crazy fucking murder.

1061
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,690
You're on death row. You get your
final meal. What are you going to have?

1062
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,410
Oh shit man. No, let
me say this a rough on.

1063
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:39,080
You know that's so funny
you asked me that. I leave.

1064
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:42,640
I had to actually lean back in the chair
for that one. That's it. That's tough.

1065
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:44,280
And this is assuming you could eat,
okay,

1066
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:47,090
so nauseous that they're going
to fucking kill me here. Yeah,

1067
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:47,921
I never understood that.

1068
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:51,280
They showed a list of what all the
serial killers got and like one guy,

1069
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,010
one guy like Bundy or one of
those guys just got an apple,

1070
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,420
but another guy got fucking like,
he wanted a whole pie with like pepperoni.

1071
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:00,550
He wanted sandwiches and
like he got the whole set.

1072
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:05,551
Like he just like everything that's a
true fucking lazy man to be able to sit,

1073
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:08,320
you know. And he said a food court,
like the guy eating an apple,

1074
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:11,580
he's probably just like, let me just
taste one last thing. Let's have fun.

1075
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,330
He was a fucking,
I don't know if it was Bundy,

1076
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:15,850
it might've been that McVay guy
that blew the Timothy Mcveigh.

1077
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,420
And I remember this, he had an amp,
got a pint of mint chocolate chip.

1078
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,440
And that stuck with me cause I was like,

1079
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,590
I love mint chocolate chip
and I eat a pint all the time.

1080
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:27,380
And that actually seemed like if someone
was going to fucking kill me and I

1081
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:29,180
don't have any sympathy for
these fucking people either,

1082
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:33,080
but I'm just saying that someone's going
to kill me, you know it would, I know,

1083
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,130
you know, we're, we're fucking going to
kill you at this time and it's coming up.

1084
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,680
I want something that's going to be a
little easy on my stomach and for some

1085
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:43,070
reason I just think ice cream
would be nice. Just be comforted.

1086
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:51,020
Did I love, I love chicken cutlets man.
Like I know like my mind. All right,

1087
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:54,260
when you asked a question, I'm thinking
Italian or Sushi because I love it.

1088
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,170
But I love chicken cutlets
with lemon squeezed on them.

1089
00:59:57,171 --> 01:00:00,230
So I might do like a shitload a chicken
because the chicken and I just thought

1090
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:01,870
chicken and dumplings,
which I haven't in a long thing.

1091
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:05,240
It's any better than dumplings was
a great chicken and dumplings in it.

1092
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:07,930
But then the mint chocolate chip did,
they wouldn't go go with the debt.

1093
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,970
Did they let you drink on what?

1094
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,570
Like on your last meal if you ordered
a bottle of red because that would be

1095
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:18,350
funny if you were hammered.
Yeah,

1096
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,280
you'd fuck yeah. Fuck yeah.

1097
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:27,610
You guys are looking at who you're going
to kill the kill you fucking pussy.

1098
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,500
Yeah.
You got enough guys.

1099
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:37,280
All my barriers were one on one.
Look at you guys five on one. Ooh.

1100
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:42,100
What are the odds? Uh, you
feel good about yourself?

1101
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:46,270
I don't think tail successful.
Hang your hat on this one.

1102
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,710
They let them drink.
That'd be fucking great.

1103
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:55,330
Why are you guys all have the same
clothes on what you all call each other?

1104
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:00,880
Making the other psychos laughing as
you're leaving. Show me the way to go.

1105
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,930
That judge was a fucking bag

1106
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:11,310
as what you would do, you would just
start talking shit. Oh yeah, you did good.

1107
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,770
It only took his eight years.

1108
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,950
You go into the death chamber and all the
fucking family members are looking at,

1109
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,910
you guys do stuff. Oh, he didn't say menu.

1110
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:28,300
You was, I got caught. That's
all I'm saying. I don't sweet.

1111
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:36,650
That'd be fucking amazing. Oh Dude.
That'd be hilarious. Just walking out.

1112
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,200
Hey Buddy, buddy. Before
you do it buddy, you know,

1113
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:43,100
the way they keep asking the question.
But anyway, it only took you five years.

1114
01:01:43,101 --> 01:01:44,860
I had those lockers in the attic for

1115
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,640
bad. Did you? Uh, there's
been a couple of guys, uh,

1116
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,380
you know, some of the last
words. One of the guys go, well,

1117
01:01:55,381 --> 01:01:59,020
his last name was French and he yelled
over the reporters. He goes, hey.

1118
01:01:59,021 --> 01:02:00,940
And he was going to the electric
chair. He goes, hey, he goes,

1119
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:05,740
I got your headline for tomorrow. He
goes, French fries. And he's like, well,

1120
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,140
like last.
And then they electrocuted him.

1121
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,080
Did you see the one guy that
they did it too and he fucking,

1122
01:02:11,081 --> 01:02:14,210
they thought it was Friday fucking he
popped up and he was like, fucking,

1123
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,590
he popped up like in a fucking
horror movie. He was like
a big guy and it didn't,

1124
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,041
he didn't,

1125
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:21,060
it didn't take the electric utem and
they're all sitting there and exactly the

1126
01:02:21,061 --> 01:02:24,030
Tom Hanks movie that really happened?
No, no. A guy they showed it on,

1127
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,120
they showed it on one of those shows
where they jolted him and like normally

1128
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:29,430
like the normal person,
the show and he just went,

1129
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:31,860
it was like one of those death row inmate
or like, it was like, uh, you know,

1130
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,000
people protesting outside.

1131
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:35,880
One of the guys that wrote you were
dead on discovery channel alone

1132
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,390
and he like popped up for a second.

1133
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:44,460
I had a fucked up part two
that I'm telling you scare
the shit out of the fight.

1134
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,760
You got to make sure that it did.
You know, I've got a friend of mine,

1135
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:51,900
you can electrocute, you can take a beat.
And I know this guys were off. Okay.

1136
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,560
Why they put it with putting an electric
chair. He got right back up again.

1137
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,910
Boy, I've got a friend.
He's tough. You know,

1138
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,540
sometimes I wish I was tougher.
We all do bill.

1139
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,580
We're not high. People are not
drunk. This is what would, if I was,

1140
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,130
if I was hiring now be fucking losing
my mind. All right. Uh, sad music. Oh,

1141
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,080
that's right up our alley. Why you bring
it up? All right. Sad music. Dear Bill.

1142
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,840
Uh,
from what you talk about on the,

1143
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:28,980
from what you talk about on the podcast,

1144
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:33,540
it seems like you're mostly into classic
rock and music that involves really

1145
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:37,770
talented musicians. Uh, do you ever
listen to a motional music? I mean,

1146
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:42,620
like a sad acoustic track or
just anything depressing verse.

1147
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,130
He's already losing it.
If so,

1148
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:47,850
do you put it on when you're sad
or when you're happy? No, no, no.

1149
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:52,550
I listened to that stuff. Sometimes I'll
need to get emotional when I'm there.

1150
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:56,850
Cool.
What song are we seeing in the car?

1151
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:00,230
Just once.
I'm going to Jan and Megan.

1152
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,860
Just one night

1153
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,260
try to do something else.
And south.

1154
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:11,000
The South we were doing,
we were saying,

1155
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:13,620
we'd say that to our wives one time
when they would like bitching, yelling,

1156
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,900
how come you Blab, blah,
blah, blah. It doesn't,

1157
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:18,230
and it's in the middle of them yelling.
Just go stare at them and just go

1158
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,240
it.
Shut the fuck

1159
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,653
shower.

1160
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:33,720
Why does it always have to be something
to do? Hey, we just lie around the house.

1161
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:34,810
Joe's Wong,

1162
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:35,930
Paul,
you creep,

1163
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,740
you keep procrastinating and you
sleep in late and the kids are up

1164
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,320
just once.

1165
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,370
We should let me sleep.

1166
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:51,070
You're

1167
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:55,720
fucking talk all the time.
I have nothing to say,

1168
01:04:56,330 --> 01:05:01,150
lady. All right, sorry. Um, sad
music. Do I listen to sad music?

1169
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:01,984
Yeah,

1170
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:07,300
probably the first sad songs I listened
to other than Elton John where he was a

1171
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:09,760
little too on the head. Right. Sit her
sad though. Like that's what I want.

1172
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:14,500
AC DC ride on. Lonely guy on the
road. That was probably my first one.

1173
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,610
Do it. Every fucking heavy metal
band had those home sweet homes.

1174
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,370
I'll tell you what said,
you want to know what's the sad one?

1175
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:31,360
Yeah, no I don't. I, you
know, it's a sad song.

1176
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:37,030
Cat's in the cradle. You
Go, you're going rocked on.

1177
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:39,850
I'm thinking more of like the
just once like, you know, oh,

1178
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,520
you can't go hip hop hip hop,
you can't do a sad song.

1179
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,330
They tried to do emotional wrap. Remember
that? Yeah. And some people still try.

1180
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:50,180
Yeah. Like when it went wide, that
Guy Drake, man, I just like, I don't,

1181
01:05:50,181 --> 01:05:54,100
I mean I get it. Yeah. You know, look
at guys, he's got a beard and shit.

1182
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,720
So women like him, but like when it just
gets to a, I don't want to hear like,

1183
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,670
I don't wanna hear a rapper opening up.

1184
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,850
No rappers trying to open up by
one of their rapper friends dies.

1185
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,450
But it's never really sad. You're more
just like, you know, they'll just be like,

1186
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:09,680
you know,
they just wrap it and you know,

1187
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:12,370
then what they did at that point out of
44 and that's like the most of it though.

1188
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,490
I like that. Keep it like that.
Okay. Nobody was better than you.

1189
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:17,950
Like it's a debt you can't
get, you know, you don't.

1190
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:22,150
One of my favorite things in this business
was opie from the opiate Anthony show

1191
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:25,990
was he had this thing that he would do
when guys would start crying when they

1192
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:29,650
would play audio. Yeah. Oh my God. That
was fucking, his timing was perfect.

1193
01:06:29,651 --> 01:06:32,710
Every time someone would be
talking like retiring from a sport,

1194
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:37,300
like when Mike Schmidt retired, which is,
you know, it's very difficult to watch.

1195
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:41,380
He was like, you know, you know, he
just was ending is like 38 years ago,

1196
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,930
a little boy began a journey to
play the wonderful Kiera pace.

1197
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:49,030
Oop would always go,
oh boy.

1198
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:53,610
Okay,

1199
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:58,010
what am I favorite? And it always, oh
boy. It always meant, that's great.

1200
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:02,670
Nobody wants to see a man just completely,

1201
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:07,110
you know what it is. I can watch a guy
cry if something terrible is happening.

1202
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:11,220
Just don't try to talk while you're
crying. You know? That's the thing,

1203
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:15,150
the talking and then bursting out into
cross. Let your shoulders go. Yeah,

1204
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:19,590
let me shut fucking crying.
But don't fall for the love of God a man.

1205
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:23,070
He's a man. Needs to cry and private.
Yeah. You do that in the shower.

1206
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,980
You do it in the shower. Like when
my son was born, everyone's like,

1207
01:07:25,981 --> 01:07:27,900
did you cry yet? And I'm like,
no, what are you talking about?

1208
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:29,100
And then when my son was born,

1209
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:32,670
it all hit me later and I went home to
go get stuff for my wife in the hospital

1210
01:07:32,671 --> 01:07:35,070
and I sat on the couch and
I didn't like weep, but I

1211
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:37,063
gotcha.

1212
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,100
I didn't weep when I got emotional.

1213
01:07:40,101 --> 01:07:42,680
But like just picturing you sitting
on the couch by yourself and just,

1214
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:46,160
you just go,
that's stupid.

1215
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:54,910
It's just completely unexpected to
use your thing from your podcast. Oh,

1216
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,550
that's unexplored. The effect. That's
unacceptable dude on it. Completely.

1217
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:03,110
The talk into it, right? Yeah.
The talk into it. That's,

1218
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:05,960
that's what the fight of about crying
is. You know, it's like, you know,

1219
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:07,460
you always do this to me,
you know,

1220
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:11,520
you always do this to me and I'm trying
my best and it's over fucking over with.

1221
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:16,190
Some of my friends die. I've had so many
who it died. I just cry in shower. Yes.

1222
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:18,560
What I do. I asked a girl,
we asked a girl. Right,

1223
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:20,630
because you don't feel like you're crying
cause there's all that water on your

1224
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:25,430
face anyway. No. We asked the girl,

1225
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:27,710
we go, what would you do if your dude
started crying? Like if it wasn't,

1226
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:30,230
if nobody died,
if a dude and you are just art,

1227
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:33,230
he just had a bad day and he just had a
bad day and you got into it and he broke

1228
01:08:33,231 --> 01:08:36,140
down and cried and she goes,
yeah, no over, over, over.

1229
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,080
Get the fuck away from me.
Yeah. You know what's funny?

1230
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,570
There's some women they think that
they want to see that part of you.

1231
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:46,130
They don't get what that is to them
is that's their total conquest. Yeah.

1232
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:48,650
You know when you bang a girl in
the ass and he's just like, yeah,

1233
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:50,420
I got this shit.
I'm fucking with you.

1234
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,290
Their version of that Jesus
built no fuck with you.

1235
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,880
Their version of that is is if they can
get you to be so vulnerable around them

1236
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,070
that you cry and then
it's one of those things.

1237
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,500
It's almost like when the crowd
screams out a joke, they already heard,

1238
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:08,780
they think they want to hear it again
and then you tell it's like, ah,

1239
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,740
it wasn't as good. Now it's
the same thing. Is that,
yeah. And you said something,

1240
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:15,320
you said something about
like if a burglar comes in,

1241
01:09:15,321 --> 01:09:17,930
if you cry in front of a woman,
all her mind is like,

1242
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:21,440
what if the Burger comes in
at this fucking guy? Yeah,
no, it's over. You can't cry.

1243
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,860
You Strip a woman a security if
you cry in front of her. I think,

1244
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:28,160
I don't think I've cried for,
I think my wife saw that's what it is.

1245
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:31,570
Like a stripper for security. Cause now
she's like, well I got this fucking, yeah,

1246
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:36,410
this fairly crisis baby sleep and next
thing, you know. Yeah, it's, it's over.

1247
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,330
You know, and Oh yeah, no, you just,

1248
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,090
you might as well just have a
pullover sweater on, you know,

1249
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:45,440
walking around and then she mocks
you. What are you going to cry, bitch,

1250
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:52,370
you so me? Yeah, it's fucking over,

1251
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:55,400
dude. You can't have
that. Uh, so sad music.

1252
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:59,390
A cat's in the cradle
with classic one. Uh, no.

1253
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:02,210
I actually listened to a lot
of, I believe it or not. Like,

1254
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:05,870
I mean you always have like your
core shit that you listen to.

1255
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,870
I like some Phil Collins when it's sad.

1256
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,900
What does it rain

1257
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:16,570
down me?
Ooh.

1258
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,060
Well I hated that annoying one when he
was sitting there like ruining my day by

1259
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:21,170
bringing up homeless people.

1260
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:26,200
Like I don't look at them and feel
bad for him day for you and me

1261
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:34,330
twice because it's just another day for
you and meet you and me and paradise.

1262
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:42,350
That fucking stupid song. Yeah. No,

1263
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:45,440
I hate when people do and that's all the
money to that went to homeless people.

1264
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,450
That's one of, that's just pandering
to the, if you have a crack,

1265
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,480
have you ever cried alone listening
to a song or like not cried,

1266
01:10:50,481 --> 01:10:51,750
but have you ever been like,
oh no,

1267
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:55,550
I've completely broken down and I've
told the three cars just weeping

1268
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:59,040
uncontrollably. Have I? Yeah,

1269
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:04,460
like totally cry. No, no.
I've definitely teared up.

1270
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,260
Listen as an,
as an artist,

1271
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,670
at some point you're going to have
to go to those emotions. You need to,

1272
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,020
you need to be a, you need to meet to with
your instrument though. I have, I have,

1273
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:16,150
what was the ones like I had
this weird thing where, um,

1274
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,350
I stopped crying at some point.

1275
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:23,220
I Dunno when I stopped
crying and got mad more when,

1276
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:27,510
when I got hurt and my brother beat
the shit out of me. Um, you know,

1277
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:31,320
most of the crying I'd be, it's just
like at the end of it. But I wasn't,

1278
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:34,740
but I wasn't crying.
And then I didn't cry

1279
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:41,040
one time too.
I remember my brother is bigger than me,

1280
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,670
my little brother's biggest
thing. Right. Big Toe. Like,

1281
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:47,970
and I remember he thought I said, I said,
if you fucking take my clothes again,

1282
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,900
if you take my clothes, and he did it
every day he would go into my room,

1283
01:11:50,901 --> 01:11:53,670
we take my belt to take my clothes and
I'd come home and I guess in a boy band

1284
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:58,020
and I, I need to go, I need to go out.
Right. And I go, mom, if he does it again,

1285
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,870
I'm fucking hitting him. If, and my mom
be like, oh, you know, he just, and he,

1286
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:05,160
and one time I need really needed a shirt
and I'm fucking throwing shit through

1287
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:05,910
the house.

1288
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:09,570
And he gets out of his friend's car and
he starts walking up and he's got it on

1289
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,660
and I fucking snap them.

1290
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,970
My grandmother was there and I jumped
on him and I started punching him and he

1291
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:16,230
stood up and he just goes,

1292
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:23,870
well, you made your older brother
cried on my younger brother. Oh,

1293
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,830
he's bigger than me.
But he didn't know what to do.

1294
01:12:25,831 --> 01:12:28,350
He got so upset that he just got,
and he looked around, he just,

1295
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:31,560
he was so angry that something
needed to come out. And he just goes,

1296
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:39,300
what did you feel bad? And you start, oh,
I kind of just walked away. And you know,

1297
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:42,720
we laughed about it afterwards,
but to now, now he's a,
he's a fuck, he's a big kid.

1298
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:46,080
But you know, my mom had the opposite. I
get a little brother, man, he's an animal,

1299
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:48,210
you know,
my mom says she went to a,

1300
01:12:48,211 --> 01:12:51,810
she went to a funeral once and everybody
was there and everybody was crying and

1301
01:12:51,811 --> 01:12:55,560
she was overwhelmed with emotion that
they had to fucking drag her out.

1302
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,371
She said she had them all.

1303
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:58,560
One of the most embarrassing things
happen to her where she said she

1304
01:12:58,561 --> 01:13:02,160
uncontrollably laughed because they
said that that could happen sometimes.

1305
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:04,780
So she's sitting there,
she's,

1306
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,100
she's sitting there and
everybody's crying and like,

1307
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:11,600
she went up and she could not stop
laughing and like she, and I said, why?

1308
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,950
And she was like, Paul, I
just don't know. She goes,

1309
01:13:13,951 --> 01:13:18,840
I could not stop laughing
and I had to walk me out. And
like [inaudible] mom. Yes.

1310
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:22,650
She said because the emotions or somebody
that they said that that could happen

1311
01:13:22,651 --> 01:13:25,830
sometimes where it's just you just like,
she didn't know what to do.

1312
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:29,220
So instead of just breaking down,
she went the other way and just couldn't,

1313
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:33,900
couldn't control their, and like, humans
will protect you in a really, like,

1314
01:13:33,901 --> 01:13:36,600
that's what they don't get sometimes
when comics make fucking horrific jokes

1315
01:13:36,601 --> 01:13:40,270
about some bad event. Make good jokes.
Yeah. It's about a horrific event.

1316
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:43,800
So they go, that's so fucking
me. It's a defense mechanism.
It's all she, my mom is,

1317
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:46,860
my mom was a sweetheart who felt bad and
her emotions just went the other way.

1318
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,330
And she goes, Paul, I felt so bad.

1319
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:51,150
I couldn't control myself
so I could control myself.

1320
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,220
I hate to say this because somebody
lost somebody, but there was,

1321
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:57,920
if there was video of that,
oh my God. Oh, I'm sorry.

1322
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:00,570
I was saying, so I somewhere
around, I don't know, 10 or 11,

1323
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:04,940
I didn't cry for years, years and
years and years. And I didn't,

1324
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,590
I didn't cry until a friend
of mine killed himself.

1325
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:11,410
And even then I was sad and
it's just, Oh, I went, uh,

1326
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,560
I was in the bathroom once
again. Yeah. And it was in there.

1327
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,130
And I remember I started to cry and then
I started thinking like, wow, I'm crying.

1328
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:19,120
I haven't cried in a long time.

1329
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,900
And then I stopped because I could out
of it cause I stopped thinking about the

1330
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:27,430
Duke killed himself. Wow. Yeah. I went 10
years without a cry and then I had one.

1331
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,980
What was it over yogurt?
Gummy bears?

1332
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:39,310
No. Uh, I think, yeah, it might've been,
it might've been one of my son was born,

1333
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,800
you know, it might've been on
my son. One. That's acceptable.

1334
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,350
I guess it's acceptable. Back in the day.
He just stood out in the waiting room.

1335
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,920
Right. And smoked a cigar. No,
you Irish dudes don't cry. I said,

1336
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:50,950
today I even just tweeted something.
Irish dude, I swear to God,

1337
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:55,951
I've never seen a funny your group of
people who ae take pain and just take a

1338
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,200
vet. Some of the funniest
people to talk. See Acceptance.

1339
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:04,350
They see it's the acceptance of the
beating and you don't try to change it.

1340
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,850
He just,
you just keep running into the brick wall.

1341
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:09,670
Something so comical about
just accepting the beading,

1342
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,890
not trying to remedy it at all.
I don't,

1343
01:15:11,891 --> 01:15:16,560
I don't have that 100% anymore because
of getting into this business and

1344
01:15:16,561 --> 01:15:21,100
traveling and seeing other types of ways
of dealing with shit. But like dude,

1345
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,040
I was actually thinking the other
day like my bloodline, German, Irish,

1346
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:25,600
Scottish English right there.

1347
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:30,760
I mean that would make a therapist to
a spit take like you fucked emotionally

1348
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:33,850
when you have that blood running through
you. I don't know what it is. And then,

1349
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:34,330
uh,

1350
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:37,510
let's see when we get hung over and we
had a night out the night before and then

1351
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:40,750
I see you in the lobby and you just see
the look on my face and I'm miserable

1352
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,120
and I'm looking at him and we'll
go on this guy did what I did.

1353
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,230
How is he just taking it?

1354
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:48,610
Like you don't even show you just fucking
put your head down and go me, I put,

1355
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,260
that's how I got sick. Yeah. Cause
we, we will, we will find that uh,

1356
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:58,180
that cigar private place. We smoked
cigars and Calgary, we drank,

1357
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:02,290
we got like three hours sleep
and we woke up, came here. Yeah.

1358
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,500
Took a fucking steam.
And then I came back and like an asshole,

1359
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:08,850
but I'm going to go work
out. Oh, that's sleep.

1360
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:11,710
And then I fucking jumped on the treadmill
and then worked out and I came back

1361
01:16:11,711 --> 01:16:14,300
and then right when we get to the
theater and may head, I was going like,

1362
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,190
this is dumb bill.

1363
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,390
Don't go down to the treadmill because
you just got all taught in the steam

1364
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:22,960
thing and then you gonna run down there
sweating and you only got three hours.

1365
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:26,000
You go versus, Hey, what'd you do? I go,
I took a nap. I laid down. It was Greg,

1366
01:16:26,001 --> 01:16:28,810
what would you do? You? I go, do
you get some sleep? He goes, no, no.

1367
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:33,550
I went to the gym like there's a
fucking animal can be self a break.

1368
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:37,360
I go until I get sick and then I give
myself a break. Whatever. Paul, Hey,

1369
01:16:37,361 --> 01:16:39,970
what do you want from me? Okay, then who
else? You got a friend, he doesn't quit.

1370
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:44,650
You know it's, I don't, I want to,

1371
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:47,230
I'm just afraid it's Shabbot does you?
So

1372
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,570
it's obnoxious. It's this point
people that I don't care. Fuck you.

1373
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:57,430
You do 20 days in a row. All right.
Problem with ex-girlfriend. Uh, Bill.

1374
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,270
Uh, I have a question regarding how to
handle a situation with my ex girlfriend.

1375
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,500
I used to really hug, kiss and squeeze
her all the time. After we broke up.

1376
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,980
I talked to a pretty 20 year old in
a coffee shop about squeezing and

1377
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,790
making out in the blue water in Thailand.
She really got into an,

1378
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:18,200
asked me to show her how I would
pleasure her in the ladies room.

1379
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:21,200
Do this guy's got some game. He sitting
there painting a picture to the points.

1380
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:27,050
There you go. He goes, I have always
been a romantic. So I said, yes,

1381
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:31,070
that's hilarious. I'm a romantic. I'll
take you to the ladies room. Oh my God.

1382
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:32,140
This movie.

1383
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,710
I kind of got into eating around
and I don't get this graphic egos.

1384
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,070
I added some dirty talk and I think
somebody might have listened in.

1385
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:43,400
I saw my ex girlfriend leave the copies.
Wait,

1386
01:17:43,401 --> 01:17:48,170
she was in there later, but she
did not say hello. Wait a minute.

1387
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,100
I got with the graphicness
of this. Wait, wait, wait.

1388
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:56,870
I talked to him in a coffee shop. She was
really into it. So wait, wait, wait, wait,

1389
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:59,290
wait. So I saw my ex girlfriend
leave the coffee shop,

1390
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:02,990
so she was there as you did all of this,
but she didn't say hello.

1391
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,580
I met with this girl couple of times
and she always wanted to play me to

1392
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:11,480
pleasure her in public places,
like the movies, et Cetera.
She's got a fetish here.

1393
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:15,890
Then she suddenly proposed that I would
pleasure her friend who I had met a

1394
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:19,310
couple of times. Dude, fuck
you. What? This is awesome dude.

1395
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:22,370
You don't have to achieve shit after
it was the coffee shop. All right.

1396
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,320
I know from experience that
this would be a red flag,

1397
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:32,210
but I said yes because I am 42 on now.
He's a creep 42 what do you,

1398
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:36,110
what are you doing? He's still out there
and I really log in as question goes.

1399
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,030
The more it sounds like a
lot. Yeah, I know. Right?

1400
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:42,160
And I really love to pleasure
women after having pleasure.

1401
01:18:42,161 --> 01:18:44,810
This woman in a changing
room in a department store.

1402
01:18:44,811 --> 01:18:48,200
I against Sama ex-girlfriend leaving
without saying hello, where dude,

1403
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:49,340
this is fucking bullshit.

1404
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:53,090
You keep pleasure in this woman and your
girlfriend keeps showing up and up and

1405
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:56,780
I'll buy it. Uh, but I got rid
of, this is such a great story.

1406
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:58,700
I'm going to finish it though.
Um,

1407
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:01,760
later my ex girlfriend called me
and was a bit upset. She asked me,

1408
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:02,780
am I not a woman?

1409
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:07,781
You would have sex in a public place
with now the correct grammar would be a

1410
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:10,370
woman with whom you would
have sex in a public place.

1411
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:12,320
Do you think I should
correct your grandma?

1412
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:15,830
This is all a bullshit one or would you
think that correcting her as a sign of

1413
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:20,780
not being over her, I don't buy that man.
That's just too fucking crazy. I mean,

1414
01:19:20,781 --> 01:19:23,960
that was, that's like, I never
heard of anything and he's 42.

1415
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:25,010
That was very well written,

1416
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:28,310
phony question and I liked all the
fucking left turns. It was wonderful.

1417
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,840
I enjoy it. There's no way that could
be real right now. No, not, I mean,

1418
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:35,840
you sit in a fucking coffee shop when
your ex girlfriend's sitting there.

1419
01:19:35,841 --> 01:19:39,350
Not saying hi and then she and she
doesn't work at the coffee shop and other

1420
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,810
girls like, hey man, why don't you come
in the bathroom and eat me out? I mean,

1421
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:44,840
it's like I listen that alone,
that could happen,

1422
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:47,980
but to then have it happen again and
it Thailand, you know what I mean?

1423
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:55,100
The departments do. I heard a lucky play.
The Lotto Buddy. Jesus. Um, all right,

1424
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:59,600
well this is the last one in then. We got
it. We got to run here. Um, am I a whore?

1425
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,780
A hey there Billy fat face. Fuck
you. I've been on the treadmill. Uh,

1426
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:07,800
I am a senior in high
school and might be a whore.

1427
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:11,880
I know you're the lean mean redheaded
machine when it comes to calling out

1428
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:14,610
whores. So I'll let you
be the judge. I I listen,

1429
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:17,910
I don't fucking judge you here.
All right.

1430
01:20:17,911 --> 01:20:20,140
My ex boyfriend who was
a year older than me,

1431
01:20:20,141 --> 01:20:22,350
he left for college at
the end of last year.

1432
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:26,610
He goes to University of Washington
and decent leap from Arizona.

1433
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:29,250
Um,
where we went to high school.

1434
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:33,330
We broke up after Jay dating just over
a year because we ultimately agreed that

1435
01:20:33,331 --> 01:20:35,400
a long distance relationship
with suck for both of us.

1436
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:40,110
Plus I eventually knew I'd be plagued
with the thought of him balls deep in some

1437
01:20:40,111 --> 01:20:44,010
artsy whore and it would get to me.
That's girls hilarious. Um, however,

1438
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:48,030
when we've visited this for his
winter break, about six months later,

1439
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,890
I came onto him again.

1440
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:53,280
He initially didn't want to
get back together because
he knew he was leaving and

1441
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:57,720
thought I'd be a, I'd be hurt in
the long run, but quickly gave in,

1442
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,630
we were basically dating again
for the entire three week break.

1443
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:04,140
He was here holding hands in public and
going on dates where one of us would pay

1444
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,220
or the other.
Um,

1445
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,990
what do we got to finally we
left without any incident,

1446
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:13,440
but it felt like we kind of flashed back
to are heavily involved relationship.

1447
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:17,520
Here's what things start to get
sleazy on my part. His friend Devin,

1448
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:22,590
oh boy was always around
hill. Oh boy. Oh boy.

1449
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:26,040
His friend Devin was always
around when we were dating,

1450
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:29,880
trying to insert himself into things.
When my ex and I would hang out.

1451
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:33,750
My ex thought it was creepy and shut
them down, but ever since he left,

1452
01:21:33,751 --> 01:21:36,870
I've been hanging out with Devin
a lot. Oh, how'd you do this?

1453
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:40,500
All the dicks in the world. You're
going to jump on this one, um,

1454
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,570
which would make you a whore. It
just kinda makes you like, uh,

1455
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,420
you could have had a better
selection here. Here we go.

1456
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:51,300
I spent Valentine's Day with them and
then she writes you, oh Geesh. Uh,

1457
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:52,380
but nothing happened.

1458
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:56,160
And I sent my ex a picture to
see what his reaction would be.

1459
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:56,994
That's what she's doing.

1460
01:21:57,390 --> 01:22:01,410
It upset Him and he told me that it really
pissed him off and was comparable to

1461
01:22:01,411 --> 01:22:05,580
cheating. Later this month, I went
to a formal event with him and pose,

1462
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:07,410
posted a picture on Twitter.

1463
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,510
I texted my ex later that week and he
told me it was really pissing them off,

1464
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:16,800
how I dragged him back into having
feelings for me and then rub my proverbial

1465
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:19,710
dick in his face. I apologize.
But ever since then,

1466
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:22,950
he seemed kind of pissed
at me and interest and not
interested in talking to me.

1467
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,290
What do you think that Billy boy,
am I a dirty whore?

1468
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:30,150
Is his just anger justified or is he just
being a jealous con loved the podcast,

1469
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:33,510
thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um, you're not a whore.

1470
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:36,330
You're not a dirty whore.
Uh, which you are is,

1471
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:39,480
you're being a really mean person because
you don't know how to express the fact

1472
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:43,890
that you still have feelings for him. So
you dragged them back into it and maybe,

1473
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:47,030
um, you didn't want to
break up with them, but you,

1474
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,700
or maybe you thought you did and now
you're having second thoughts about it and

1475
01:22:50,701 --> 01:22:53,670
rather than just saying that to him,
uh,

1476
01:22:53,671 --> 01:22:55,380
the pain you have that
you're not together,

1477
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:59,910
you're now sort of for some reason taking
it out on him by doing everything that

1478
01:22:59,911 --> 01:23:02,670
you know is going to tear
his heart out of his chest.

1479
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,030
So you need to stop doing that. That's
what I would say. Yeah, that's exactly

1480
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:10,090
like, it's like just nobody
had come, nobody just picks
up the phone and says, Hey,

1481
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:13,230
like keep sending the poor guy
pictures and fucking doing that tune.

1482
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,990
There's no look, they're young.
They're young. You don't know what,

1483
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,120
you don't know how to do stuff like that.

1484
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:19,090
And sometimes you're doing shit and you
don't know why you're doing shit cause

1485
01:23:19,091 --> 01:23:21,040
you don't know who you are yet.
So I'm not judging this person,

1486
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:24,650
I'm just saying what you're doing is
really, it's really unnecessarily mean.

1487
01:23:24,651 --> 01:23:27,100
One thing that's not brought up.
What about Devins feelings?

1488
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,730
I know he must really seem to
care for nothing like this.

1489
01:23:30,731 --> 01:23:35,080
Two guys getting fucked. She sent him
pictures. I don't know. Just listen.

1490
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,330
Without a doubt.
Devin.

1491
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:41,170
Devin is not a good dude
cause it's his friend.

1492
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,850
It's his friend and he was trying
to move in on it when, uh, when,

1493
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:50,110
uh, when they were still together.
So that guy, you know, it's weird.

1494
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:52,900
You know who's going to lose in all of
this is going to be you because you're,

1495
01:23:52,901 --> 01:23:57,650
you're with this creep. This guy's a
fucking creep. Um, or maybe he's just,

1496
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,060
you don't know he's a creep.
Don't maybe,

1497
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,560
maybe he always had feelings for
her and the other guy didn't treat.

1498
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:03,880
We don't know.
I just went with creek.

1499
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:06,940
But she said that her ex boyfriend said
it was creepy. I don't fucking know, Paul,

1500
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,290
what am I going to solve? The solve the
problems of theft in 18 and 19 year olds.

1501
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:15,850
I can't do this. All right,
look, yeah, stop doing that
to them. Stop posting stuff,

1502
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,240
sending pick and you're, you're acting
like you don't know what you're doing.

1503
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:22,650
At least as a far as like a hurting
the person. You're hurting them,

1504
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:26,830
you're hurting them and you
should stop. Um, and if you don't,

1505
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:29,950
then you're a mean person, but you're
not a whore. She's not a whore now.

1506
01:24:29,951 --> 01:24:32,620
And that's not a whore. That's not a
whore. What is a hoarder? You, Paul,

1507
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:35,950
if she sent pictures while
she's blowing Devin, I mean,

1508
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:39,850
that'd be a little fucking much, you
know? But even then as you get older,

1509
01:24:39,851 --> 01:24:43,720
when you start to think of the psycho
psychological reasons as to why a woman

1510
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:45,610
would do that,
you know,

1511
01:24:45,611 --> 01:24:48,790
and it always goes back to some sort
of family issue that they would do then

1512
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:52,450
some sort of insecurity and you
know, having no boundaries, right.

1513
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:55,120
The Times when something like that
happens, you got touched as a kid.

1514
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:58,180
I'm kind of paraphrasing some of
the shit that I've heard some, no,

1515
01:24:58,181 --> 01:25:02,450
I just think a horse, when I think of
horror, I think of Eugene using sex, you,

1516
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:05,860
you know, doing sexual things
or using sex in order to,

1517
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,340
to gain and do stuff like that, you
know, to, to get yourself ahead through,

1518
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:10,780
through sex.
And she,

1519
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:14,170
and I would actually say that that's more
of a sociopath who just happens to be

1520
01:25:14,171 --> 01:25:17,320
using, uh, you know,

1521
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:20,560
sex rather than using a gun or
a knife or something like that.

1522
01:25:20,561 --> 01:25:21,394
They're just going up.

1523
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:26,210
They using the weapon that they
got are all horse sociopaths.
No, no, no, no, no, no,

1524
01:25:26,211 --> 01:25:30,460
no, no, no. I would say, I would say no,
not at all. I would say that, you know,

1525
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:35,230
men and women who have a
bunch of fucking partner,

1526
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:37,660
different partners or something like that,
the older I get,

1527
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:40,990
they're not like dogs and
whores and stuff like that,

1528
01:25:40,991 --> 01:25:45,580
like they have does something
wrong with them, uh, beyond, um,

1529
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:46,751
look,

1530
01:25:46,751 --> 01:25:49,270
there's something wrong with fucking
being married and this is the only person

1531
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:50,970
you ever going to have sex with
again. I mean that's, it's,

1532
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,050
there's something not
fucking natural about that,

1533
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:57,550
but the other side of that is to
just walk around fucking everybody,

1534
01:25:57,551 --> 01:25:59,440
just fucking everybody.
Then there's something,

1535
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:03,380
there's something wrong about that.
But what I'm doing is also, you know,

1536
01:26:03,381 --> 01:26:06,680
my opinion is, is I'm come, I'm looking
out my own head here, how I would feel.

1537
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,290
I remember, you know, I
was out dogging around.

1538
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:12,350
I would always feel like a piece of
shit on some level, past a certain age.

1539
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,630
You twenties you like psyched, like, yeah,

1540
01:26:14,631 --> 01:26:18,400
he got another one right in your thirties.
It starts to get,

1541
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,160
it starts to get sad such to get pathetic.
So I, I wouldn't say you're a whore,

1542
01:26:22,161 --> 01:26:25,460
but um,
unfortunately we have to wrap up here.
