1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,740
All right. We ready? All right. Hey,

2
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:06,320
what's going on is bill bird is
time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:09,140
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and a,

4
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:10,910
I'm not checking in on you this week.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,060
Usually I check in on you to
see how your week's going,

6
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:18,320
but occasionally I'll have a guest on
at which point I'm talking to them and

7
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,720
hopefully this fills up your ride home.
Uh,

8
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:25,721
I am with the one and only the legend
from the San Francisco area from Prime

9
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:31,490
Primus. Mister Les Claypool. How are
you sir? Uh, I am well, I am fantastic.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,150
You just got over it. You literally just
landed and you came right over here,

11
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:38,980
which is, you're just a hardest working.
I'm in jet setters. They say. Yeah,

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,450
it's like an Irish setter in a
jet. How was your uh, southwest?

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,380
I'm going to guess flight down. No, I took
one of the, I've never done this before.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,690
I took a, uh, it's called, uh, I
think it's called jet suite. Oh,

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,380
and that's one of those app jet
things. Yeah. I don't know. I have my,

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,900
my guy out there set it up.
I've never done such a thing was it,

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,460
now here's a big question that
everyone's going to want to know.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,600
Did you have to go through any sort of
security? Do you just walk on the fucker?

19
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,070
I walked on the fucker. Um,
big box like bugs bunny.

20
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,220
So you got there earlier
than I needed to get at,

21
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,850
which was like 45 minutes and I sat in a
little lounge and I ate some beef Jerky,

22
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:19,200
which I have some beef jerky if
you would care for some dirty,

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,890
you know what I think I'm going to pass.

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,700
I just had a bunch of shit food that
I shouldn't have ate and the uh,

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,050
and the Goddamn lounge area here.
I should've gone beef jerky.

26
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:30,920
If I could have held out,

27
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:35,030
I could have had a nice protein
because I had an ask Jim Beam, uh,

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,550
you know, convenience store, pack
of pack of Cherokee. But uh, I,

29
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,530
I hop right on the plane. It
was, it wasn't anything fancy.

30
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:45,690
It's not like it's a fancy thing.
It's just a convenient, you know,

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,660
you don't have to, it just
looks like a plane, but you get,

32
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:51,410
it looks like a fancy planning. But
inside it looks like a regular plain with,

33
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:56,390
you know, you know, sort of cramped seats
and all that. But it was, it was cool.

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,120
I enjoyed the notion of not having to,
um,

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,830
be scrutinized by, by a guy and take
my shoes off and all that one. Right.

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,480
So that all part is perfect. But they,
do they do any sort of screening?

37
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:13,210
Like how do they know you're cool? Ah,
I don't, I don't think they ever did.

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,580
I don't think they ever,
that was it.

39
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:18,720
I don't think that was ever a
concern that I was cool. Yeah.

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,540
I'm just saying like if I'm a terrorist,
it's a fond the airline. No, no, no,

41
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:27,110
I'm not, I mean, as far as like,
I don't mean literally cool.

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,250
I mean as far as like the reason
why we all go through the security.

43
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,530
So now you have this thing
that's just generally,

44
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:35,960
if you have the cash and you
can download a fucking app,

45
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:39,950
you can just get on this damn plane.
I'm assuming it's, it's, it was my,

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,150
it was my virgin run, so I'm, did you,
was there anything, was there any that go,

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,950
any of that concern is you got on there?

48
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:49,320
Did you do a quick turn
around to see if, uh, okay.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,460
Just trucker hats? Uh, I it did not.

50
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,060
There was a woman that came walking
in and I'm assuming she had some form

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,770
enhanced buttocks, like, oh,

52
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,380
whether it's the pants that have the
padding in it or she had some sort of, um,

53
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,110
surgical, yes. Because it just,

54
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,710
it didn't look like it didn't look
like reality. It doesn't move. Like,

55
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,900
first of all, the legs
move, the ass doesn't,

56
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,430
and then on top of that is the
legs don't match the ass. Yeah.

57
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,160
It looked like it looked like something
when you were a kid, you would draw,

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,280
you know, fun House Mirror. It
didn't, it didn't look like real.

59
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,030
It didn't look like reality. I'm just
going to leave it at that. Right.

60
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,540
So that was the only thing she knows.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,630
That could've been a bomb
smuggled in that form of fashion.

62
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:39,010
That was the only thing I saw that
seemed irregular. Did you shame or no?

63
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,390
No. Why would I? How would I shame
her? What would you do? I'd be like,

64
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,990
do you think your phone,
anybody with that fake ass?

65
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,100
Could somebody please
make sure you really know.

66
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,910
What I would do is I would be a,

67
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,560
I would be a coward about it
is I wouldn't say anything.

68
00:03:56,561 --> 00:04:01,561
I would snicker to myself
and I were talking about on
my podcast and my standup.

69
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,300
Okay, well there you go. You've
heard of the cowardly lion.

70
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:08,440
I'm the cowardly comedian, comedian. I
like it. That's exactly what I am. Good.

71
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,450
So I know you're a busy man and you,

72
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,450
you don't have time to just be flying
around and just sitting down and talking

73
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:17,320
to some fucking Middle Act here
who shames people with fake asses.

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,270
There is a reason you are a man on a
mission here. I'm man on a mission.

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,340
You have a new mission. I'm curious,
you are here to promote things as,

76
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,880
as most people who are very
artistically inclined. Uh, yeah. I,

77
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:33,250
I started asking you about your new
album that you did with Sean Lenin called

78
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:38,110
the monolith of full house eight foe,
the monolith of Phobos.

79
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,750
That was a whole album. That was our
first album. That's your first one.

80
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,980
So this new Lyme in the limpid. Well
that's our, that was our, an EAP.

81
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:49,150
We did our, the new album
is, is, is, is different.

82
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,630
The new album's called south of reality.
I literally, before we turned it on,

83
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:56,260
I asked you what is your new album?
[inaudible] previous albums. Oh,

84
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:59,560
did I say that? Jesus crossed.
All right. What's it called? Uh,

85
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:02,480
it's called south of reality.
South. The reality. Yeah. Okay.

86
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,190
This is a nod to a slayer. They'd south
that heaven. So you south the reality.

87
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,730
So I didn't realize that
we were nodding slayer,

88
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:13,200
but I do enjoy nodding slayer on occasion.
Um,

89
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,250
I have to say this album,
um,

90
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,600
I've never had such a
difficult time naming,

91
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,830
nor coming up with the artwork
for an album as really we did.

92
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,410
Is that something that in the past
is this come easy for the, yeah,

93
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:32,830
they usually just, you know, flip pork,
soda, how that's going to be an appetite.

94
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,810
You know, these things just
Frizzell Friday they just
kind of, um, but this one,

95
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,780
you know, perhaps it's
because of the, you know,

96
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,290
both Sean and I are very opinionated,
but we just never,

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,920
we never could come up with a title that
will really set the tone or the artwork

98
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,580
as, as well. It, it, it took a long time,
but you haven't got the artwork here,

99
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:55,660
but it's,
it's actually,

100
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,810
it's one of the best album we that I've
been a health card. No, no. Very cool.

101
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,520
You know what your mind, even when you
just said your pork Sodi like some,

102
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,690
that's got to be an album title.
Yes. That reminds me, David,

103
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,410
tell David tell we'll call them,

104
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,540
will text me with like the most brilliant
joke that no one could think of other

105
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,930
than him. And there'll be like, do you
have a joke like this? And it's like,

106
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:19,590
no date. Nobody has a joke like that.
It's like, why would you like pork soda?

107
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:21,420
Who Comes, who comes up with that? Maybe,

108
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,410
maybe Beck Beck had some new pollution
and stuff like that. Like Jeff Beck? No,

109
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,330
the other back. Yeah, I
know the rapper. Um, hey,

110
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:35,100
so is that what comedians do they call
each other and say, do you have a joke?

111
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:39,240
Like if you're concerned, if you're
concerned of like sometimes, uh,

112
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,690
I don't know you've ever written a song,
just came to simple and your dislikes.

113
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,910
Then I hear this in a fucking
elevator or something.

114
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,910
It's the same thing with like,
just pretty much every prime as song.

115
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:51,810
It'd be probably music.
Oh yeah.

116
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,170
We got up there on the screen. That's
what the modern technologies, okay.

117
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,230
South the reality. All right, let's
go through this. Uh, you know,

118
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:02,010
this is not a visual medium here
for people. So what am I looking at?

119
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:05,610
That appears to be some sort of insect,
um,

120
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,800
does not appear to be on this planet,

121
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,160
but he definitely seems to be dealing
with some sort of global warming issue

122
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:14,460
here. It looks like he's at the
polar ice caps and it's melting.

123
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,470
It's got sneakers on.
I like that.

124
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,360
And he's looking into some sort of like
your interpretation of compact. Yes.

125
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,250
Is putting on taking the shine off
his nose. Um, that would be a flea.

126
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,590
It's supposed to be a flea. Okay. Um,

127
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,630
because we have a song called like
fleas. And so, uh, the flea made the,

128
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,231
made the cut.

129
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:38,600
Basically what happened was we w we
were bouncing artwork off each other's

130
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,840
Sean's and artist.
I'm an artist,

131
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:43,050
we work with a bunch of
different artists and um,

132
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,180
Sean did the drawings for the, for
the, for the first album. And um,

133
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,180
somehow the notion came about if let's,

134
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,210
let's find an artist to do something
like one of those old Saifai paperbacks

135
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,170
from sixties and seventies.

136
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,840
And I stumbled across this piece of
art and we couldn't find the artist.

137
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:07,960
And we looked and looked and finally
found this guy and he's this Japanese

138
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,670
fellow that Sean ended up knowing about.

139
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,230
And he used to do Omni magazine
covers and whatnot. And, and he,

140
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,040
after my brother used to read many
renditions, he came up with this.

141
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,990
So there it is. Now, how does
that connect with the music?

142
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,190
I guess I have to listen to the album.

143
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,170
Like this looks like some old school
stuff where you just do like the,

144
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,710
that kind of drug that makes you happy.
You know,

145
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,400
none of that crazy stuff that makes you
think he can fly and sometimes done a

146
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:37,610
lot of drugs. I ain't nothing he
can fly. It kind of makes you happy,

147
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,310
don't you think? The notion,
the notion of flight,

148
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,260
um Oh do I get that out of the fleet?

149
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,950
This right here is why I
don't go to museums because
it just makes me feel dumb.

150
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,810
I just like,
there's no scoreboard there.

151
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,210
I can't tell what's
going on and then I just,

152
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:52,650
it just ends up making me feel dumb.

153
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,940
I think if you listen to the record
you'll get a notion to what some of this

154
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:58,410
stuff is.
Like fleas is the closing song,

155
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:01,170
which is a song like fleet.

156
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,860
The line is like fleas on the back of
a dog eventually will be shaken off,

157
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:08,550
which is the notion that parasitic
man and eventually, you know,

158
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,180
Mother Nature's trying to kick us off
the off the planet cause we're just

159
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,450
screwing everything up. And so Shawn said,
we're like fleas on the back of a dog.

160
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:19,950
So it was, it was a water will rise
up. It was a moment where, you know,

161
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:24,120
I had this lyric and,
and I read it to him and he said,

162
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,250
oh well we're like fleas
on the back of a dog.

163
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:29,700
And then that became another portion
that became the chorus. So that's cool.

164
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,830
That's where the Claypool, Lennon
lyrical cooperative comes into play.

165
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,940
I was thinking yesterday,

166
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,790
I was out in Santa Monica and I just
looked at the ocean, how big it was.

167
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,430
It's just like, it's coming
for us. Oh, it's calming.

168
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,570
Um, would you say that you
are addicted to touring? No,

169
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,370
cause every time I see is if you're not
making an album bank account is addicted

170
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,130
to touring. Oh, is that what it
is? I got a kid in college, man,

171
00:09:56,131 --> 00:10:00,900
you gotta you gotta keep saying guys, you
know I do get in legit. What was that?

172
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,350
Did you can't get into school legit or
did you pull that showbiz stuff that

173
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:07,600
happened? If it was a bit of a handle
down here, how many Cox I had to suck the

174
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,160
um, well the urine and legit, we're not
dealing with chimps here. He's, he's,

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,150
I wasn't sure if you Photoshop his head
onto like, wait, what? What did you,

176
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,830
what were you saying? People. Oh,

177
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:22,500
you're talking about the latest
thing we're buying. So there,

178
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,120
I mean there was some Hollywood
celebrities that got in trouble.

179
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:30,720
They were photoshopping their
nonathletic kids had on top of it,

180
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:35,240
like some sort of Lloyd it up guy. And
then the football coach would be in on,

181
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,980
it'd be like, Hey, here's a great new
year. They think like a white kid,

182
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:42,000
put it on some Samoan kids body torso
or something. And next thing you know,

183
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:46,590
he's the starting linebacker allegedly
potential for the USC Trojans.

184
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,850
See I should have done that
because you know he will,

185
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,710
he's going to an art college so
there's no sports whatsoever there.

186
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,120
But just the notion that we could,

187
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:59,150
we could have applied that Salvador Dali
weird mustaches and the beard thing and

188
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,480
just Photoshop it onto his, uh,
his face and they'd be like, wow,

189
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,230
look how creative this
stuff like that. He's, he's,

190
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,630
he's trying to get in on
a sports scholarship to a
school that has no sports. Um,

191
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,040
no,
he's an artist.

192
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,670
He's going to Laguna College of art and
design and he's learning to make video

193
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:17,760
games.
He's been into it since he was like 14.

194
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,300
He has been taking courses
in the summertime at cow
and Stanford and went on.

195
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,950
He's all about it. That's his
whole, Oh, so you're out here raw.

196
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,270
You're out here hustling.
But being a great dad,

197
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,300
he could share his dream comes true.
I'm a good dad. You are. There you go.

198
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:35,010
It's one of my better,
my better accomplishments.

199
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,350
I wasn't sure how you're
going to take the compliment.

200
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,030
A lot of people can't take compliments.
I'll take that compliment. I,

201
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,410
I take pride in what I've done
with my kids. I'm a good guy. Damn.

202
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,670
Damn good father.
Um,

203
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,450
are you going to leave three cigarettes
out on their foreheads? Well, you gotta,

204
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,030
you gotta you know you to
make a statement, you've got

205
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,470
to let him know who's in charge.
You've got to set those parameters.

206
00:11:56,471 --> 00:12:00,630
You set the tone. Uh, we are going to
be seeing the tour bus on this. Uh,

207
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,390
you can do on a run right now.
You're doing some dates.

208
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,750
So we just promoting the album.
Uh,

209
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,420
I was just told to come down here
and talked to him, talked to Vaughn,

210
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,130
Birmingham and I, here I
am. Um, yeah, I, you know,

211
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,040
I have friends down here and just kind
of popped down here. Just come to say,

212
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,820
oh okay. But I know we have a record
and we'll get ready to go on tour.

213
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,870
The records new, we did Cole bear
last week, week before, you know,

214
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,870
we're out there see a slumming it too
or out there starting to shake hands and

215
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,120
kiss babies and all that one.
Not.

216
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,850
So the press too are starting to
wind down now that you're on my, uh,

217
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,120
he was starting to do podcasts, so wine
to nap. I think this is the beginning.

218
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,200
This is,
we're about to start touring and I,

219
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,300
the thing is is this year was supposed
to be mellow because last year was a big

220
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,240
prime usher. We did the longest two or
I've ever done in my, I saw you guys,

221
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:47,710
I saw you in Austin. It was incredible.
Austin and Austin city limits.

222
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,050
I absolutely love that show.

223
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,230
And I three times in my life
I was supposed to see you
and some bs came up on my

224
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:59,340
business and I wasn't able
to go three fucking times.

225
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,570
And finally our paths crossed on the road.
And uh,

226
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,320
I was able to see you guys in Austin.

227
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,790
I W I performed some
dump the night before.

228
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
Then I went to the beautiful
place you guys were at and uh,

229
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,830
I got to see the show and it was
absolutely incredible. Like the way you,

230
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,870
I don't know all this stuff that you do,

231
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:21,550
the way you put together the music with
the visual is just a whole experience

232
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,480
that makes me wish I tried
psychedelics at some point in my life.

233
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,780
So you've never tried psychedelics
at any? No, I, I'm always,

234
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,310
I've always been like a late bloomer,

235
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,000
so I figure I'll try and do the thing
with your cousins where you'd hold your

236
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:34,361
breath,

237
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:37,360
hyperventilate and then they squeeze you
until you pass out and smack your head

238
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:39,760
on the ground. And none of them
know. I did see some kids at school.

239
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:42,370
There was this big thing, like we
didn't understand how the body worked.

240
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:45,670
So there was, we thought this was
amazing that basically what's,

241
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,550
you'd sit there and someone
would grab both your jugglers,

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,120
either side of the neck and just
squeeze them. Holy Mackerel. Yeah.

243
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,290
And kids would just fallen over.
And I or did you grow up? Uh,

244
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,660
the suburbs of Boston.
Ah,

245
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,160
it was the 80s like there wasn't a
lot of information out to m domain,

246
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,810
my neighborhood. Yeah. So we just, we went
straight to methamphetamine. Oh, you did?

247
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,710
Well, I didn't, but you
went to Elliot. I forgot.

248
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,050
I tried weed for the first time when I
was like almost 40. So I think of it,

249
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,770
I'll try. I remember saying I get it.
When I finally got high I was like, oh,

250
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:24,460
I get it. I get it. Um, but
it's not something you partake.

251
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,110
I think the way that I'm wired booze is a,

252
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,460
I should probably smoke weed
because I'm probably too wound up.

253
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:36,250
But I relate to booze,
like how it makes you feel.

254
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,810
And also I feel like there's this a
trajectory to it that I understand.

255
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,030
Like I had one beer,
here I am,

256
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,810
okay now I've had to when this
amount of time and now we've,

257
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,670
now we go up to the second
floor where that shit,

258
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,570
it's just like you do it and like
nothing happens until it does.

259
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,230
And then it's just like someone dropped
a fucking piano on your head depending

260
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,430
on the potency of it.

261
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,940
And then you start falling and it's
just like how deep is this fucking hole

262
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,290
where with drinking you can
kind of be like, oh, okay.
Hey, people go into the hall.

263
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,660
I'm the drinking too. You
can do that. You can listen.

264
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,880
I'm not trying to get in the
way of anybody's fun here.

265
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:16,700
I'm just saying the way I'm wired,
where I would drinking,

266
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,200
I can see the staircase down to the
basement where with like psychedelics,

267
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:24,740
I feel like I can maybe see,
I would think anyway,

268
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,210
like my never done second to I guess
what's some fucking weed though?

269
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:32,700
I've ate wheat a couple of times
and never eat weed. That's, that's,

270
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,310
that's the worst. I mean I've, I saw
the last time I read, I saw the light.

271
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,370
I saw the light, the hold it and I
literally said, don't go into the light.

272
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:43,610
You have kids. It was one of my
kids were little and I how many?

273
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,820
How many milligrams was it? I have no
idea. I was, I didn't even want it.

274
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,160
We are in a van touring the,
the,

275
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,300
the east coast with one of my little
bands and a couple of the guys.

276
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,590
Somebody had given us some
Claypool's bucket of Bernie brains,

277
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,580
the frog brigade and JC who,
who's just a,

278
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,620
it's just a human bong was
eating all these brownies,

279
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:06,500
him and a couple of other guys and I was
just hungry and we were driving to the

280
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,410
hotel late at night and I was
like, all right. He's like, man,

281
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,570
these things are a hell of a week.
I was, all right, let me have one.

282
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,980
I'm just going to eat it
because I'm hungry. And by
the time we got to the hotel,

283
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:19,490
I could barely move. And
it was intense. Yeah. I,

284
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,650
the first time I ever ate
wheat was like that. I, uh,

285
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,990
my girlfriend at the time brought over
a tray of brownies that her roommate had

286
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:34,280
made and they will probably about the
size of like a bathroom tile, you know,

287
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:39,170
big square things, right? So she eats half
of one. I go, well, how much should I eat?

288
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,420
She goes, well, you're bigger than
me. You should eat a whole one.

289
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,890
So I eat a whole one. And then was
sitting there and looking back,

290
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,830
I was getting high, but I
didn't, it was coming on slow.

291
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,610
So I didn't feel like I felt anything.
She goes and we were going out. She goes,

292
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,020
well, your bigger, why don't you,
why don't you have another one? Yes.

293
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,520
So I had another one, the slippery
slope. I still didn't feel anything.

294
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,210
And then as we walked out the door,
I hate her other half.

295
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,560
So I had two and a half,

296
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,540
then got in a car and went to Newark
Airport because we will go into Costa Rica

297
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,710
and it hit me right at the fucking
airport and it was one of the, uh,

298
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,810
at first it was hilarious.

299
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,050
And then the paranoia came in and
by the time I got onto the plane,

300
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:22,370
I just wanted to stand up
and admit everything and just
fucking get it over with.

301
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,480
But um,

302
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:28,100
probably for like a 12
hour period it seemed,

303
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,710
I felt like, you know, when your
foot falls asleep really bad.

304
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,450
I felt like there was a ball
of that sitting on my head
and I remember thinking,

305
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,940
oh, people say I got baked. I
got fried and I was thinking,

306
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:41,290
I'm literally frying my brain
right now and I, I didn't enjoy it.

307
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,730
It for like two days, I was
like, we'd hung over. Yeah.

308
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,630
And that was the end of that. No, it's
making, it's actually making me nauseous.

309
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,310
Just hearing the story
cause I know that feeling.

310
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,420
Yeah. I just, why I don't eat,
I just remember there was,

311
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,620
and I was a big pot smoker for many,
many years, but he still likes to smoke.

312
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:02,420
I don't like putting smoke into my lungs
ballgame. But you're a wise man. Yeah.

313
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,890
Yeah. But then I smoked cigars every
10 days or so once every 10 days.

314
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,660
I tried to, again, it'd be a week and a
half. I have one, I dunno, red hour back.

315
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:15,090
Look for a long time. He used to
smoke them every time they won a game.

316
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,160
He won a lot of games. He
lived a lot of years. Um,

317
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,010
how did you, how did you end up
meeting up with, uh, Sean Lennon?

318
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,100
Does he have any sort of musical
background, by the way? Not much.

319
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,220
I think his dad was a
transmission mechanic. Oh,
that was my dad's, sorry. Um,

320
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,910
uh,

321
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,270
his band ghost of the saber tooth tiger
opened for Primus on a tour we were

322
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:42,690
doing with dinosaur jr and
we just hit it off. Actually,

323
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:46,500
he and my son hit it off
right away because my son's
like one of these guys that

324
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,580
just absorbs random bits of
knowledge and then, you know,

325
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,070
regurgitate some to people to,
you know, get these conversations.

326
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,340
Did he get that from one
way more is way more.

327
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:59,490
He gets into all this nerdy
stuff and Sean's the same way.

328
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:01,980
Sean's like Encyclopedia Brown.
It's unbelievable. You get,

329
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,900
he can get him going
on just about anything.

330
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,160
And so they're just
sitting there a little bit,

331
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,890
a little bit of talking about the cosmos
are talking about, you know, whatever.

332
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,370
And um, so then, uh,

333
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,920
this was on one of the tours and then
Sean and I hit it off and we just kind of

334
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:15,960
started jamming one day.

335
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:20,850
I have so little dough bro base that
I carry around and fiddle around with

336
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,330
backstage. Oh, what is that?
It's, it just looks like,

337
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:26,330
you know what a dough bro Guitar it looks
like with a resonator, with a senior,

338
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,180
with the big, uh, it's like, uh, it's
like an acoustic her, but it has a, uh,

339
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:33,230
a big chrome resonator in
the middle of it. Okay. Um,

340
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,470
and they tend to sound a little more
metallic and I have a basis like that.

341
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,440
So I was toiling away on it and he comes
over with his acoustic and we start

342
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:45,090
trying and then I started realizing, wow,
this guy's playing, he's not playing,

343
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,460
uh, just uh, uh,

344
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,520
predictable counterparts to what I
was doing or playing along with me.

345
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:54,840
He was pointing some very interesting
stuff and we've made a habit of it just

346
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,850
kind of getting together and
jamming. And I said, Hey,

347
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,320
I want you to come out to Rancho relaxo
at my place and see what we can come up

348
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:05,070
with Rancho relaxo. And we did.
How does that, how does that work?

349
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,700
I've always been fascinated because I'm
such a huge music fan and was not given

350
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:13,180
the gift. Unfortunately or fortunately I
think I've seen you play drums. I know,

351
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:16,080
but I mean, yeah, it's like Dad
rock. You know what I mean? If you,

352
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,360
if you give me all the answers
to the test, he is like the,

353
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,170
it's like the is the mainstay
of the Australian economy.

354
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,870
It's because their dad
rockers, you know, I, I'm just,

355
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,980
I'm just saying one time I ever jam with
somebody and they actually had their

356
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:32,550
own riffs and then I had to do what
you were just saying Sean was doing and

357
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,520
there was no answer to the test.
It's like, hey bill, you know,

358
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:37,920
cause before it was just, Oh,
John Bond and played this,

359
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,020
let's just fucking work
on this til I can play it.

360
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,650
Which of course I never was able to,
but I could fake it. But this one,

361
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:46,950
I actually got together with somebody
like, hey, here's my creative ideas.

362
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,410
Can you creatively add to this?
I just kept playing the same.

363
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,860
I think my face literally turned red. I
was saw, I was like, wow, I knew I sucked.

364
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,540
I didn't realize I suck this bad.

365
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,750
So that fascinates me that
you got together with Shawn
and what he was playing

366
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:04,150
cod you ear like, oh, what is
this guy saying? How do you,

367
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:06,880
how did you learn how to
like a free yourself up?

368
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:11,800
Like what point did you feel
at you? Like, Hey, I'm, I'm,
if I'm, I'm in in this mood,

369
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,430
so now when I pick up my bass,
I can play the mood that I'm in.

370
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,940
Like I feel like great musicians,

371
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:21,520
you guys are literally just like
talking with the instruments.

372
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,040
So like the way I can be like, you
know, how was your day? Oh Man,

373
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,650
fucking song off the boat and I
am down here and this is my tone.

374
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,100
You guys can do that with
your instruments. Like how,

375
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,670
how do you learn how to fucking do that
blows my mind. Well, I mean I've always,

376
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,780
I would have said for a long time,
you know, playing music, it's a con,

377
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,020
it's a conversation and interacting
with jamming with other musicians,

378
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,280
you're having a conversation.

379
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,090
Some musicians are really great
at reading a speech, you know, or,

380
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:50,240
or classical musicians that can only
read the written page. Right. I've,

381
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,470
I've had people come into the studio
and violinists or whatever, say, hey,

382
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:56,410
you know, jam on this movie. What do you
mean, you know, where's the written pay?

383
00:21:56,411 --> 00:22:00,040
Yes. And I would assume it's very
similar to what you're doing. You know,

384
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:04,300
you can go out on stage and just
tell the jokes that are on the page.

385
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:08,320
Or you can tell the jokes on the page
and throw in a little zippity do in

386
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:13,030
between or, or take off on a, on a
tangent, a or full straight improv.

387
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,670
Uh, I'm sure he had done it.
All of those. It is the same.

388
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:19,540
But the thing about what fascinates
me is with, with stand up. Okay.

389
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,950
It's like, uh, all I'm doing is talking.

390
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,980
So you come, you know, from
the beginning, Mama, dad day,

391
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:30,730
you start talking and everybody like
write us right now, just talking.

392
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:32,590
You're just listening to me
and then you're reacting to it.

393
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,560
So you already know how to do
that. So as a calm, a comedian,

394
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:40,090
all I have to do is make that leap to,
uh,

395
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,970
you know, making it funny.
And then of course, you know,

396
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,070
blocking out the fact that there's
a bunch of people staring at you,

397
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:47,390
which is the weirdest
thing ever in a year.

398
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,970
And see now you're saying things that
to me are, are frightening. You know,

399
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:56,380
and I've always been fascinated with
standup comics because the notion of going

400
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:59,770
out and,
and doing a bit over and over,

401
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,100
you and I talked about this a
little bit once you said, well,

402
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:06,460
I can I move it around, I am probably do
this and I'm listening and I get that,

403
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:09,940
but I can go out and stand in front
of tens of thousands of people,

404
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,160
hundreds of thousands of people,
um,

405
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,870
with is if I got a base in front of me,
you know, I kind of, my base, I can do it,

406
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,220
you know, but going out there without that
thing and I would die, you know, I, I,

407
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,790
I don't know I could do it, you know,
but maybe, well, maybe that's what it is.

408
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,440
Maybe it just, I dunno, I just,

409
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:31,240
I just think that that's the most
fascinating thing ever. That like, uh, um,

410
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,140
because I had a period in my
standup where I was literally,

411
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:39,670
I would just memorize my jokes and
went up and did my jokes and then

412
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,960
occasionally I would try a new one and
was his big fucking moment. Like, okay.

413
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,280
How was that for he was that new jokes?
Terrifying.

414
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,900
Terrifying. How was it received? Oh,
most time. In the beginning of it,

415
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:52,100
it didn't do well.
And then I would get panicked,

416
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,760
which would make my brain go blank and
then I couldn't remember my act and then

417
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:58,640
dry mouth and then it
just would all go to shit.

418
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,560
But like I would just
by continuing to bomb,

419
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,490
like if for musicians who are listening
to this, you keep going after that,

420
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:11,960
continuing to bomb. That's that to
me, that's the big hurdle right there.

421
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,820
Uh, I don't know who said it first, but
the, uh, this is the best way to put it.

422
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:20,510
Like a,
the comics for the most part,

423
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:24,380
that to make it or whatever,
or become pros of quitting.

424
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,560
It never dawns on you to quit
because that's what makes sense.

425
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,970
It would make sense that if
you felt that horrible feeling,

426
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,430
you would be like,
I don't ever want to do this again,

427
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,210
which is what you feel as a comedian.
But if you're a comedian as a person,

428
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:41,420
you feel,
but as a comedian you,

429
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,040
you don't think you think, I don't,
I'm, I'm still going to go and do this.

430
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,670
I just don't want that to happen
again. And then that's, that's the,

431
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,540
the thing that makes you nervous and
make sure live on stage of like, fuck,

432
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,060
is that thing going to happen tonight?
But is there that element of, okay,

433
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:01,850
I ducked, I ducked at, wait a minute,
I just got a great seven iron shot.

434
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,360
You know what I mean? Is there that,
oh, absolutely. Absa fucking blue there.

435
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,510
And so that's, that's what
it is. It's that getting, uh,

436
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,830
getting a laugh. Uh, yeah.
And I mean, you literally,

437
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,560
in the beginning you just
living laugh to laugh.

438
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,950
I remember that one guy in the crowd,
that one guy,

439
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:23,780
I heard him laugh or that comic
who's actually a pro, said, hey,

440
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:28,550
good job or good stuff. And then
yeah, I'll soon into into to this.

441
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:32,240
Did you get the, to get that? The first
time I really got a good one was a,

442
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,800
there was a comic,
uh,

443
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,830
Mike McDonald and it's not the guy a
rest his soul just passed away in Canada.

444
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:44,441
It was a out of the Boston scene and
I was in this comedy competition,

445
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,380
the big radio station WBCN,
which I'm sure it promoted, uh,

446
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,790
sailing the seas way
back when. Um, and uh,

447
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,770
they used to have this,

448
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,830
this thing called the WBCN a comedy riot
and it was at stitches comedy club and

449
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:04,350
it was to try and find, you know,
the best up and coming Boston, uh,

450
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,580
comic. I mean there's, this scene was just
increase. I mean, I came at the tail end,

451
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:10,610
I missed it, but it started in
the 80s that BCN would do that.

452
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,540
And it was just like, it was fucking
insane if you, if you won that thing.

453
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,120
And then of course there was the curse
of the ride if you made it or whatever.

454
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,080
So anyways,
in 1993,

455
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,360
the last year of it and stitches
clothes, like the week after, and I, uh,

456
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,490
I was, um, I entered the
contest and um, the night,

457
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,710
my night, it's like if you won
unite, then you went to the finals.

458
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:37,880
So there was like a qualifying and
then you had unites of the night.

459
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:39,440
This Guy Mike McDonald was hosting it.

460
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,650
I went up and did my bullshit and then
went over and went well and sat down at

461
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:46,450
the bar. I was still working at the
dental office with my dad. And, uh,

462
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,610
he came off stage and you walked over
to me and he just goes, uh, he just,

463
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,970
he just looked at me dead serious.

464
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:55,500
So typical pro comic didn't laugh at all
or anything, just look to me. He goes,

465
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:59,670
look, he goes, uh, I don't know what
you're doing, but keep doing it.

466
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,170
And that's all he said.
That's all I remember him saying.

467
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,670
And I remember being like,
wow,

468
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,700
I saw that guy on fucking MTV and he's
hosting the Rye was the biggest thing

469
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:11,430
ever.

470
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,430
And then that was a thing over the next
year and a half of sometimes doing okay

471
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,910
sometimes having a moment of killing
and then most of the times bombing.

472
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,500
That was just something that I hung onto.
That Guy Mike McDonald said,

473
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:28,410
I don't know what you're doing but keep
doing it. So if you hadn't got that,

474
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,320
that little nugget.
Yeah,

475
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:34,500
that's the thing that scares you
because I was thinking the other day,

476
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,850
I remember that, you know,
being an entertainer, we,

477
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:40,560
we work on those nights
when everybody stays home.

478
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,010
So it's kind of cool during the week
when they have to fucking go to work and

479
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:45,600
shit. But then all of a sudden, you know,

480
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,130
the holidays come around and all that
and everybody's gathering around eating,

481
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,430
fucking drinking eggnog and having the
Norman Rockwell scene and you've got to

482
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:54,240
grab your gear.

483
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,360
I got to fucking put on my stupid
sport coat to go do a do a show.

484
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,490
I remember the first time having that
feeling was football season. And you know,

485
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,760
still living back in Massachusetts and
this is back when you actually had a fall

486
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,530
before it just went from January to July.

487
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,360
It's kind of seems like the weather
now. And um, it was just that perfect,

488
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:15,960
crisp, cold football, whether I
was still living at home, you know,

489
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,140
just got out of college and my
parents are making a great meal.

490
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,990
They had some friends
over and we were watching,

491
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,110
I think a BC was playing Notre Dame
and it was this big thing to Catholic

492
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:28,350
schools and both teams were ranked
and it was going to be great.

493
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,030
And I had a fucking show and I had to
go down to Rhode Island to go down into

494
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:36,930
some fucking bar that wasn't
a comedy club. I knew it
was going to be a hell Gig.

495
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,480
And I remember saying to my older
brother being like, yeah, man, I don't,

496
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:44,200
I don't know man. I don't, I don't, I
don't think I want to go to this and blah,

497
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:46,910
blah blah. What do you think he would
think it would be bad if I just didn't,

498
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,160
and I was booked on the show.

499
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:52,500
I was going to like cancel it and thank
God he just sat there and he listened.

500
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:56,520
He's like, is that, I don't know
man. I think he should go, should go.

501
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,800
And I went and I remember
it sucked going out,

502
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,770
getting into my piece of Chez us old
fucking Ford truck and I got into it and

503
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:08,840
then once I got on the highway it just
started making sense like, yeah, yeah.

504
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,930
Thank, what the fuck was I thinking? What
else do I have? I suck at everything.

505
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,760
I was terrible in school. This is the
only thing I want. Why, why did you know?

506
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,160
It was just my first experience. That
was, I was sorta just like, uh, I dunno,

507
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,050
I'd never lived on my own or anything
was sort of me having a kick.

508
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:28,350
My brother helping me kick me out of the
nest a little bit and I went down there

509
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,980
and um, so those are two
things I think about a lot. If,

510
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,480
if that could be a good show. No. Yeah,
it older brother, younger brother,

511
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,740
older, but no, it wasn't a good show.
It was a, a I did. Okay. I think I did,

512
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,890
but no, none of them are good shows.
In the beginning it was, it was, uh,

513
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:49,690
it was surviving. It was all, it was
like my first like year and a half,

514
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:54,670
like very rare would there be like
open mics in an actual comedy club.

515
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,360
It was mostly a lot of, you know, Boston
area was a lot of Chinese restaurants,

516
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,650
sports bars where they turned down
the sound of the fucking Bruins game,

517
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:04,750
but they would leave it on,
he says perform at the, uh,

518
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:08,200
the 90 nines and restaurant
and Bill Ricka, Massachusetts.

519
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:11,430
And um, you know, I,

520
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:16,240
I spaghetti Freddy stay in a basement.
I've played like some shitty places.

521
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,690
Um, but I still, I've listened
to what you're saying and
I go, man, that's, that's,

522
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,690
those are just some big ass hurdles for
me that I'm not sure I would have been

523
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:30,180
able to go in and play in Spaghetti. Eddie
is, or Chinese restaurants, whatever.

524
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,190
But the notion too, I was going to ask
you, cause I heard you say, Oh, uh,

525
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,420
the dentist's office, you worked with your
data at the dentist's office. Yeah. Um,

526
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:43,170
so how supportive was he and your
family to what you are pursuing?

527
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,220
Totally, totally supportive. Like my
parents were really cool where, you know,

528
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:53,221
they did what they did and they
didn't pressure anybody to do,

529
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:56,580
they definitely stress the college
education, but there was just like,

530
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,220
like everyone in my family does
something completely different.

531
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,900
Um, so you just, I dunno,
there's this weird,

532
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,460
my family's weird, it's really like
loving, but everybody's a total loner.

533
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,900
So it's like love is like implied,
but it's definitely there.

534
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,800
If you were to look at it,
it looked like the Brady bunch,

535
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:16,780
but there was all kinds of,
you know, like most families,

536
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:21,690
they had a lot of things going
on there. But the, uh, the,

537
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,840
the thing that I, I, you
know, as you become a parent,
I think what you do is you,

538
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:28,540
like, you look at all the great
stuff your parents said. He like,

539
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,450
I'm keeping all that and then there'll
be like two or three things that you'd

540
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:35,890
like to adjust. But one of the things
that I am definitely going to keep is,

541
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,080
um, that thing that my parents
didn't judge me then I,

542
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,670
I wanted to get out of
going to a regular college,

543
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:44,230
go to more of a performance school.

544
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:49,350
They started doing radio that I got into
stand up and they would totally 100%

545
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:54,400
supportive. They never thought in
a, never said anything of like,

546
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:58,780
well Jesus Christ, what if you don't make
it, you gotta be fucking destitute. Um,

547
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,290
which was a period in my thirties that I
had to deal with when I didn't have any

548
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:06,580
representation or sleeping on a Fuckin
Futon, but I never gave her the, Oh, hey,

549
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:09,310
you know, it's, you've been working hard
at this, but you might want to, you know,

550
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,180
they're like, you know, you know, for a
salesman over at the Chevy dealer, no.

551
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,030
You know, it was a dick.
The, uh, the, our butcher,

552
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,370
he was an asshole when he just found
out that he and my mother was all proud

553
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:26,170
going like, Yay, he's over
at Emerson College and he's
majoring in communication.

554
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:29,970
He might have a career in
radio and he reigned for her.
Mother just said, he guys,

555
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:33,820
Hey, he goes, I don't know.
Everybody wants to be the staff.

556
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,380
Like that's what he said.

557
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:39,500
And I remember looking at him and
his bloody fucking apron. He would,

558
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,320
you were standing

559
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,240
there when I was just like,

560
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,960
fuck this guy fucking cutting
up poor God bless him.

561
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:48,940
Cutting up the pork chops and shit.
But like the fuck is,

562
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,170
we never even had a butcher.
Yeah, you got to have a portrait.

563
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,921
We didn't have a butcher.

564
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:56,850
You just go to this store and there'd
be some cellophane and away you went.

565
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,430
All right, well here's my thing. But the,

566
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,830
but the great thing was was
all I had to deal with was me.

567
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,130
I didn't have to figure out how
to get along with three, four,

568
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,070
the fucking people and getting
a van and deal with somebody.

569
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,880
I found with group traveling where
the weed comes in and that's where,

570
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,570
because I was not a pot smoker prior to
getting in that van with this foot odor

571
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:18,420
and the hippiest right. It was, I'm
serious. Like, I smoked some dope and,

572
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,670
and high school. In fact, uh,
uh, lots of different story. But,

573
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,590
um, tell it I could. My Dad,
he, my dad was like, we got,

574
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,650
we've always gotten along very well,
but my dad was very young when I was born.

575
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:32,420
He was 19.
And my dad was like the Fonz,

576
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:36,450
he was like a cross between the Fonz
and Dennis Weaver, you know, and um,

577
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,750
but he was not, he, he was married.
He used to brag that when he was 19,

578
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:44,960
he had a mortgage payment, a car
payment, a payment on a washer and dryer.

579
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:49,400
He was a transmission mechanic and he
had a wife and a baby boy at 19. Um,

580
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,400
so needless to say,

581
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,480
he was not the type of guy that in
whatever year that was was running around

582
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:58,310
smoking dope or any of
that stuff he wanted. Yeah,

583
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,970
he wanted to beat up
those guys. So, um, uh,

584
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,240
so when they found the tiniest little
speck of weed in this film container in my

585
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:11,030
bedroom when I was in high school, I got
a lot of trouble for that. I'm sorry.

586
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,760
He called the cops on me.
Um, he did it to scare me.

587
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:17,000
He called the local guy that he knew
and it scared the shit out of me. Um,

588
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,090
and that was actually sold to me
by Kirk Hammett, by the way. Um,

589
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,650
but no way. Yeah, we went to high school
together. He used to smell, sound me weed,

590
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,440
but I was not like a big weed smoker.

591
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:31,280
I just kind of smoked to hang and be cool
and all the musicians, you know. But I,

592
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:34,210
I didn't really enjoy it cause I,
it was a very similar to you.

593
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,220
I was a tall, skinny guy. And when
he would hit me and just, you know,

594
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,390
I couldn't control my brain.
I didn't like it so much.

595
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,490
So it wasn't until I crawled in that
van in my early twenties with all these

596
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:51,240
dudes and we start driving across the
country and the joint comes passing by me

597
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:56,180
and pink Floyd animals is on the
stereo. Right? Then I went, okay,

598
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,050
I'll have some of that.

599
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,140
And it made the roads so much sweeter
and I became a pot smoker after that for

600
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,090
many, many years. For decades.

601
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,810
I've got to ask you a question. What,
where are these fucking high schools?

602
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,110
How was your musicians like you
listen to guns and roses. It's like,

603
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,420
oh slash went to high
school with Steven Adler.

604
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,140
You listened to the Chili peppers
and it's just like a flea.

605
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:22,160
When I went to school with a blanket on
this lead singer's name Anthony, right.

606
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:26,300
They just like, like a whole
fucking band. It's just like,

607
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,380
like this kids walking around,
like being like, oh yeah,

608
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,390
the bass player from a,

609
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:37,980
from a Primus was in my ips
class. And uh, the guitarist from

610
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,730
Metallica, I took Jim with
him. Like, what, where the
fuck are these high schools?

611
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,240
Well, I mean, I grew up in, in an area,

612
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,780
I was born in Richmond Panol,
Elsa Bronte,

613
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,400
which is a North East Bay San Francisco
area. I mean, it's basically it.

614
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,740
So it's all, it's all blue collar.
You know, where I went to school,

615
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,310
you said you would say you've taken the
test. I'm, I'm taking that. I'm not, well,

616
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,640
I'm going to take the test or
are you gonna take this call?

617
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:03,540
I took the test and the test was to
see what job you are going to get at

618
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,830
standard oil.
You know,

619
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:08,040
Larry Lalanne from Primus took
the test and he did very well,

620
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,150
but he said screw that.

621
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:13,710
And he went off and play death metal in
a band called possessed. Um, but that's,

622
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,420
that's where we grew
up. And so, uh, I dunno,

623
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:23,060
I mean Kirk was in my, my Algebra
class with Mr. Kelly and Kirk who have,

624
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,280
you know, he had this dirty white tee
shirts and big thick pop bottle glasses.

625
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,510
And he sat behind me just

626
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,680
divvying up dime bags and looking
at guitar magazines. And, uh,

627
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,810
so I remember it because I would always
be singing these songs and he said,

628
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,800
hey Claypool, hey man, you
want to come sing for my band?

629
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,140
And I was too bashful to sing.
I can barely sing now.

630
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:51,070
But, um, so when it came down
to it, I, I couldn't do it, but,

631
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,010
and then I met this other
guy who needed a bass player.

632
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,450
And so I begged and pleaded my dad, hey,
let me, cause we had no money. So let me,

633
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,410
I know a guy who has a base for $30 let
me, let me buy it and let me some money.

634
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:03,540
And he said, well, if we're going
to do this, let's do this right.

635
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,520
Let's go see all over at house music.

636
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,940
And we love that there wasn't a
guitar center's back then. Yeah,

637
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,190
well I mean there was, but they were
not where we live. You know what I mean?

638
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,790
It's just more like local because I used
to go to Norfolk county music. Yeah.

639
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,110
So we went to Alice music
and my bought a fender, uh,

640
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,110
Memphis p based copy copy of
a fender p Bass. And you know,

641
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,820
I was going to give us a good deal and
I'm not sure Al gave my dad a great deal,

642
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:27,301
but I ended up,

643
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:31,770
I had this base and I had to pull weeds
all summer and work for people and what

644
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:35,400
not to pay off this base, but
I was instantly in a band. But

645
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,630
what's the thing, if you
were a bass player, you, it
was easy to get into a bank.

646
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,090
Everybody wanted to be Eddie van Halen.
Nobody wanted to play the bass.

647
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:45,270
So it was like, Hey, and bus. It only had
four strings. I figured it'd be easier.

648
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,220
And, uh, I was instantly in a
band and a way I went. But Kirk,

649
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,560
he was,
he also had this band called exodus,

650
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:57,540
which went on to be exodus one of the
premiere metal bands of the world.

651
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,040
Um, uh, after he left Metallica, I mean,

652
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:05,760
after he left exit exodus to Metallica,
but we just had a good, well,

653
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:06,660
music community,
where are we,

654
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:09,210
where we'd all get together
and jam at Keggers and whatnot.

655
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:12,430
And that's just what you did. That's
a, that's that's, I don't know,

656
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,300
I came from more of a jock town, so none
of that stuff existed. And we weren't,

657
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,420
we weren't, we were not jocks.
As soon as I, I, you know,

658
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,420
I used to play a little baseball,
some basketball,

659
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:24,330
but as soon as I picked up
that base and I struggled,

660
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:27,570
I didn't want any of that stuff touching
my hands. My hands became precious.

661
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,750
But then I was a carpenter
for, you know, eight years,

662
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:33,060
beating the hell out of my hands.
So, how did you develop that?

663
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,770
How did you develop,
cause nobody like you.

664
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,470
So who did you listen to
that we will you actually,

665
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:40,360
I feel like if I had to guess,

666
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,170
we listening to a lot of non
bass players to get your ideas.

667
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,620
I was listening to pretty much everything.
But um,

668
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,870
when I first started it was guys,

669
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,010
it was definitely a Getty Lee and Chris
Squire and John Paul Jones and people

670
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:54,371
like that.

671
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:59,371
And then I got turned on to the Larry
Graham's and the Stanley Clarks and the

672
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,480
Louis Johnson's, you know, remember
Don Kirshner is rock concert.

673
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,190
Do you remember that name?
I know,

674
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:07,540
but that was a little bit for my tops know
MTV so late at night. That would be a,

675
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:11,500
there was um,
I want the midnight special,

676
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:13,450
I think it was called and
Don Kirschner's rock concert.

677
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,360
And that's what you watch those on
youtube. Like I discovered those,

678
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:21,130
like when youtube came out I was able
to go back and watch the chief critic on

679
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:24,240
Don Kirshner is and seeing the brothers
Johnson and there's Louis Johnson old

680
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,600
bucket. I was like, oh my God, what
the Hell is that? So here's a question.

681
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,910
How the fuck did you
figure out how to do that?

682
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:35,911
Because these kids nowadays that you
can just look up basically any song and

683
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:39,400
somebody will break down how to play it.
Um,

684
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,010
and sometimes it's actually the
guy who literally played it.

685
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,290
Like nowadays it'd be like
fucking John Bonham. Hey,

686
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:47,650
this is how I play that quick
little triplet thing. You
want to do this and blah,

687
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:51,580
blah, blah. Good luck mate. Whatever plays
bastards. I have it so much easier now.

688
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,500
I know.
And they're monsters.

689
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,620
You had to sit and just figure
it out or go see concerts,

690
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,070
which I didn't have any money, so it
was hard for me to even go see concerts,

691
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:03,070
but just plan it.
Just kind of,

692
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,350
that's why my style is the way
it is because it's, it's, it's,

693
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,400
there's no conventional
element to it besides,

694
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:14,401
I joined jazz band right around then
and my music teacher was shocked to find

695
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:15,910
out that I didn't know how to read music.

696
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:19,450
So he gave me this crash course on reading
music and I just was in the jazz band.

697
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,780
So that was the only real theory I ever,
we still know how to read music.

698
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,230
It just barely just,
yeah, you don't really,

699
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:29,360
I mean he hears it as good as they are.
You don't really need to do, I mean,

700
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,210
unless you're like a session guy,
right.

701
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,140
And not too many people are reading
music these days unless you're,

702
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,740
unless you're in the orchestra, like a
hipster thing to do in the music world.

703
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,700
What? Read music, you know, they
always do all the throwback shit.

704
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,560
You know what I mean? I have no
clue. I mean I would love to,

705
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:50,170
I wish my reading chops were better,
but I,

706
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,230
there's other things I'd rather do at
this point then Polish my reading jazz.

707
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,080
Well that's right because
you have your new album,

708
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:01,190
the catch south of reality and
that's a flea on the cover.

709
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:03,450
It actually learn what a flea looked like.
I never needed,

710
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,520
it was like some little thing
jumping off on my dog. Um,

711
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:10,270
with the Great Sean Lennon and you guys
are going to be touring is going to be a

712
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:13,210
US tour. You starting here in
the u s going up to Canada.

713
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:14,490
What are you doing and how we're doing?

714
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,760
I think we're doing three or
four tours this summer, so we're,

715
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,680
we're starting in a couple of weeks going
around the states and then we go out

716
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:25,180
with Jim James and then we go
out with the flaming lips saw.

717
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:30,080
That's awesome by the way. But
before we wrap this up here, um,

718
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,730
I love you bus by the Little
Rhonda. Oh my God. You have,

719
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:38,720
you bought like one of those old school
like Grey Hound look and buses that has

720
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:41,750
like the roof and then it goes up and it's
like the windows. Is that what it was?

721
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,040
It was it straight across?
Straight across.

722
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:49,000
It's a provost Privo say in
France. And what year is it? A,

723
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,700
it's an 87. Yeah, I knew it was an
old school. It's older than I was.

724
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,840
My wife said a handful of years ago.
Hey when I'm letting you know,

725
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:59,480
once the kids move out, I'm coming on
the road with you. And I said, all right,

726
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:00,930
well if you come on the road,

727
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:03,710
you're going to be selling some booze
cause we have a boutique wine label.

728
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:08,510
What's the name of it? Uh, purple
packet room. Claypool, sellers. Um,

729
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,160
but we make it's very nice.
Peanut like I would have brought you some,

730
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,480
I for some reason I didn't
think you drank. Uh,

731
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,270
cause you always catch me when I'm on the
wagon. I'm taking this year off. I uh,

732
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,500
you know the problem, what I did with
booze was I brought it into my house.

733
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:24,290
I let the devil in the house,
cause my thing is if it's there,

734
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,270
it's just like a gown ice cream.
There's a gallon ice cream,

735
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:27,920
I'm going to fucking eat it
and there's a bottle of booze,

736
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:31,100
I'm going to finish it.
And then, uh, the same way,

737
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:33,830
if I eat fast food than I create
fast food from drinking booze,

738
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:34,940
I just sort of crave it.
But,

739
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:38,420
so I just kinda got out of my house and
going to take the A, I want to be that.

740
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:42,350
I want to be that guy that has a glass of
wine with the, with the, with the meal.

741
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,270
And he's like, oh that was great. That
that was a nice a cultural mall coach.

742
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,960
Ramal Couteau mall to my meal and
then having to my house. So I have,

743
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:53,770
well I have a lot of ice cream. I
have, we do in the case of lasers.

744
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,830
Amazing, amazing wine. No, but that's
another thing though. Or it's an event.

745
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,450
It's the same thing with cigars.

746
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,150
I got him out of the house
cause I started smoking Cuban.

747
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:06,500
So you didn't go in the book cause I
went through a big cigar phase in many,

748
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,260
many years and I'm a humidor full of them.

749
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:10,400
There was only like 22
years old or something.

750
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,400
My thing about them is I find that,
uh,

751
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:16,220
with Cubans is so many of them,

752
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:19,450
their wraps so fucking tight that,
you know, like when he had like, um,

753
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,010
like when you were a kid and you had
like a shake or a malt or something like

754
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:25,370
that and you had it like almost suck
your brain out of the Bacchae it had just

755
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:29,220
to get it to come, I felt like malls.
Yeah. So it's like, you know, there's not,

756
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:31,340
it doesn't have, like, a lot
of them don't have a good draw.

757
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,540
It's a pain in the ass.
And this, there's some, um,

758
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,640
ones that I like more to Minuchin or
Nicaraguan cigars that I'm enjoying and

759
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:44,450
they're, they're not wrapped, you
know, balled up like a fist. I still,

760
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:47,440
but there's nothing better than
a Cuban with the good drop,

761
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,040
but like trying to find one,

762
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:51,770
someone gave me a Cuban the other
night and I was like, oh my God,

763
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:53,270
this is amazing. I was
just like, Jesus Christ,

764
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,570
fucking eyeballs are going to pop out of
my head trying to get a little mouthful

765
00:43:56,571 --> 00:44:01,460
of smoke here. So, um, I like the
Aurora emeralds and then there's,

766
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:05,600
um, to say on the one, what the
fuck is it called? I can't remember.

767
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,390
I just know what that one, so you're
smoking like the big old Churchill's.

768
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:13,220
Are you sticking with a little,
you know, a, a fistful of dollars,

769
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:16,280
you know Clint Eastwood's style, not
the little ones. Ron White smokes those.

770
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,160
I've seen him smoke few of those and
he looks cool as hell. It's doing that,

771
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:19,730
but not,

772
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,660
I used to steal the old Tianwan of smalls
and Swisher sweets when I was a kid

773
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,950
and smoke them in the tree for
it. That was always, Oh, it,

774
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:28,930
my dad used to smoke the Dutch
master and then he wouldn't,

775
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:32,070
and he would always keep the box and
then in there went all the loose screws

776
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,500
and everything would go in
there, uh, inside the, uh,

777
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,860
whatever, the little kitchen drawer
there. So I told you, and you know,

778
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,720
I haven't been able to pull it off yet,

779
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:47,721
but my rode a bus that I want to
get is I want to get one of those,

780
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,180
you remember that, that uh, that GMC we,

781
00:44:52,181 --> 00:44:54,220
you and I were sending back
and forth and I just, you know,

782
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,450
you're a busy guy and that one
with the blue leather interior,

783
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:01,920
that thing was cool. And I know, I know,
I know. I want to get, I just have to,

784
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:05,340
I have to work it out because what it is,
if I didn't have a fucking kid,

785
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,660
then I would be doing the road like an
animal and I could bring my wife along

786
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:11,940
and blah, blah, blah. But, you know,
I got this whole, I'm rooted now,

787
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:16,200
which is great and I love it.
But, um, are you rooted here? Yes.

788
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,450
And I love it out here.

789
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:21,900
The dream is I want to get one of those
definitely buddy who built my truck and

790
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:24,020
my dad's car.
Um,

791
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,290
Redo the thing and I'm sorry,
I'm trying to,

792
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,480
I'm going to Burp here. It's so much bad
food today, um, Turkey, but help you out.

793
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,800
Turkey. That's I needed to,
if this podcast was a tube,

794
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,310
my body would be thanking you right now.
Um,

795
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,950
I want to get that thing totally like
redone, like underneath, like to have,

796
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:44,820
it still looked like 1974,
1975 on underneath be like 2019.

797
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,470
And the thing that I would add to it was
I would have a humor door and then it

798
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:50,490
would just be like my,

799
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,500
my vice mobile so I wouldn't
do anything when I was home,

800
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:59,550
which is most of the days now. And
I only do, I do to two runs a month.

801
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,240
So I'd be like, you know, and just like
one, one night on each run I would go hot,

802
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,220
you know? Well I, I had my face off and
then that would be like times 12 months.

803
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:13,140
That's 24 days a year. I got drunk,
gives a shit my lever. But you know,

804
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,150
my doctor, my family. But other
than that, who gives a shit? Right.

805
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,920
Well, I mean there's many things
in that. That's a big statement.

806
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,760
One is you can drink, you don't
have to get drunk. I mean,

807
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:28,550
I drank the wine because
I enjoy it every night.

808
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:31,560
And that's called being mature and
you know, with some little subtle,

809
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,200
some beef Jerky, it's all
good. Um, and then, uh,

810
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,380
set the of the region. I see.
I'm that guy. I'm the, I'm the,

811
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,290
if you're looking for a vehicle,
an older vehicle,

812
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:45,620
I am the guy because I always tell
people I don't do social media.

813
00:46:45,621 --> 00:46:49,310
My version of social media is going on
craigslist and looking for old car parts

814
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,800
and I'm not bullshitting.
I'm always looking for Chrysler parts.

815
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:52,820
I'm looking for this.
And then the next thing,

816
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,620
so when I hear somebody
who's looking for something,

817
00:46:54,621 --> 00:46:59,390
and I did do a little digging for you
at that time and then I forgot, but um,

818
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,640
I used to have a 23 foot birch
haven GMC. The 23 is, well,

819
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:09,590
there's the table. Something's happened.
I just noticed it's 23 in the 20th.

820
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:10,520
This is the 26.

821
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:15,050
And then there's the 23 to 23 is or are
cool because you can take them into most

822
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:20,010
campgrounds that don't normally allow RVs.
And um,

823
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,900
the birch havens where the only the
birch havens and the royals were the ones

824
00:47:23,901 --> 00:47:26,890
that actually have real
wood interior. So I'm, oh,

825
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,040
I remember you sent me all of that
stuff. Yeah, it's a whole, it's a whole

826
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,740
subset. Yeah. And there's websites
about these things. They're,

827
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:34,390
they're amazing race
and when you drive them,

828
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:38,110
it's like driving a Cadillac and the
way the windshield wraps around you,

829
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,350
it's almost like you're sitting on
the bumper, you know, it's, yeah,

830
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:46,830
it's really incredible rigs now with a
few times I've done tours and I rented a

831
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:51,280
bus or anything.
The thing that I did love about that was,

832
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,830
uh, first of all the guys
that I toured with a toward,

833
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:57,940
with three of my great buddies and like,
it was like,

834
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:02,230
he was so excited to do the show
and you'd pull up in the bus,

835
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,930
it was fucking awesome.
And then you'd go and you'd do the show.

836
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:06,190
You'd have a great time.

837
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:11,490
And then we would get on the bus and
you'd be so excited and we'd put in like,

838
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:13,810
good fellows are anchorman
or something like that.

839
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,500
And we would just sit there laughing
the whole night. Um, you know,

840
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:21,670
drinking and eating and just watching
movies. And it was like the, uh,

841
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:25,630
the comradery on it was, was, was
incredible. And I, and I kind of,

842
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:30,550
I do miss that. And a, I have
to figure out a way I've been,

843
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,640
I've been toying with
it because my thing is,

844
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:38,320
I think I want to do it is to just hire
a driver and then he just has it and he

845
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:42,490
just a different thing than getting the,
the GMC right. I mean, not in Chino,

846
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:44,800
but I want to get the GMC
and just have the guy had,

847
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,560
he just has the fucking thing and I say
it right. And it's just like, all right,

848
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,190
here's my tour goes from here to
here because the pluses, buses,

849
00:48:51,191 --> 00:48:54,580
that's a whole different level that's
like, you know, million dollar rigs.

850
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:55,601
And they were amazing.

851
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:57,860
And that's why I don't do it
anymore because when I got the bill,

852
00:48:57,861 --> 00:48:59,660
it was like Jesus Christ,
because he was still, you know,

853
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,930
drivers go and you want to
leave tonight. I was like, yeah,

854
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:03,370
let's get the fucking
drive out of the way.

855
00:49:03,371 --> 00:49:06,040
I didn't realize I was paying
overtime, so I already paid. I was,

856
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:10,330
I already won one gig and a half is out
the fucking window and then the bill

857
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:13,600
came. You know what I mean?
It's like, you know, you know,

858
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:18,190
it was like fucking stop playing them
Chinese joint. Yeah, you can step it up.

859
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,480
Well, anyways, uh, the album
is called south. The reality,

860
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,920
you don't know where they can get it.

861
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:27,340
I'm assuming that you can get
it on iTunes and all that.

862
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:30,190
It's like psychedelic music.
It's too incredible.

863
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:32,590
Musician Sean Lennon and the Les Claypool.

864
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:35,220
Thank you for doing my
podcast and thank you for,

865
00:49:35,221 --> 00:49:38,980
we go on three solid decades
of incredible music and uh,

866
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:43,000
I love everything that
you do. Um, Tim Alexander,

867
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,180
one of my favorite drummers of all time,
brain, everybody that you play with.

868
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:49,240
I just, I just loved the
musicians that you work with.

869
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:52,630
So I'm going to be downloading
this, uh, when I get home. Well My,

870
00:49:52,631 --> 00:49:55,810
if my wife teaches me how to do it, there
you go. I will definitely be doing it.

871
00:49:55,811 --> 00:49:59,900
So a look for the tour.
Three tours, right?

872
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,250
So far. Yeah. Oh, by the way, I'm
so I've got to read an ad here.

873
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,910
You want to see something inspirational?
I'm watch. Watch me try to read out loud.

874
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,820
All right. Oh, look who it
is. It's my bookie. Yay.

875
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:13,570
I get Dolan brackets first round upsets.
Still Final Four.

876
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,900
March madness is here and it's time
to bet with the best at my bookie.

877
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,330
Uh, would you rather sit at your
office desk or call out sick?

878
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,860
And I love this degenerate shit
that's been, yeah, blow off work.

879
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:31,800
Call out sick and binge on the NCAA
tournament games and junk food.

880
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,670
Like that's even a choice.
Sometimes it feels good to be bad.

881
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,330
These guys are wonderful, especially
when it's with someone you trust.

882
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,230
You either already saying fake sick and
now they're going to act like they're

883
00:50:43,231 --> 00:50:46,530
trustworthy. And if you're looking
for a place to get in on the action,

884
00:50:46,531 --> 00:50:47,940
you can trust my bookie.

885
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:52,230
They've been in the business for years
and they're growing like wildfire.

886
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,210
The best part is they pay out fast.
So when you called that 12, uh,

887
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,710
over five upset this year, I what
that means, make sure to celebrate.

888
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:06,390
You'll be pocketing cold hard cash
here in under the core talking points.

889
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:11,280
March madness is the most exciting action
patch pack, sporting event of the year.

890
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,910
Even grandmothers fill out a bracket.
My mother does,

891
00:51:14,911 --> 00:51:17,820
she picked holy cross a couple
of years ago. You play, you win,

892
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:21,630
you get paid or you lose, you get
evicted and you suck. Dick. Okay,

893
00:51:21,631 --> 00:51:25,230
I'm just just being devil advocate
here, right? Only at my bookie. Dot.

894
00:51:25,231 --> 00:51:28,680

Agee hotline,

907
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,850
the one and the only bill burr bill.
It's march madness. Are you, uh,

908
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,220
are you one of those guys who
fills out a bunch of brackets?

909
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,750
Are you going to fill out a bracket?

910
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,700
I used to be that guy.
I got a kid now.

911
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:50,200
So between watching like
the Mickey Mouse Club,

912
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:52,090
been a puppy dog pals.

913
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,000
Feel your pain there.
I feel your pain.

914
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,280
The kids had been out of
town for like four days,

915
00:52:57,281 --> 00:52:59,890
so I'm just immersed myself
in college basketball.

916
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:02,783
It's awesome

917
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,280
to watch hockey or chalking watch
basketball. She knows how to do this,

918
00:53:08,281 --> 00:53:11,970
but then like about three minutes,
then she's just like, oh, watch

919
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,430
out pass.
So I essentially only one,

920
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:22,431
she was highly life [inaudible] career
him blowing out the spanker and all of

921
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:26,140
that out. You know, it was blown up,

922
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:30,840
shot our shops and continuing
to go up after he blocked it.

923
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:40,550
Yeah.
He uh,

924
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:43,090
he blew out his shoe and he
also kind of hurt his knee.

925
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,720
And then there was this big debate
in the, you know, amongst the sports,

926
00:53:46,721 --> 00:53:47,860
like talking heads,

927
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:53,100
whether or not Zion Williamson should
come back or just rest the rest of the

928
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:54,880
year and miss out on the tournament.

929
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,060
It's pretty cool.
Now go ahead boo.

930
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,413
I

931
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,090
stay and,
and not have conversations like that.

932
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,770
Just basically getting

933
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,700
filthy rich.

934
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:24,190
Yeah. And I think, you know, I think we're
going to, we're, we're close to that.

935
00:54:24,191 --> 00:54:27,850
They can't keep, continue this
charade of like amateur athletics,

936
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:31,780
but we're going to sign billion dollar
contracts with the TV networks. I mean,

937
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,510
specifically I like, how's
ions? Kinda like, Nah man,

938
00:54:34,511 --> 00:54:37,720
I want to play ball with my
friends. Like back up, you know,

939
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:39,040
I'll make some money in the future.

940
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:41,800
But I do think it's funny that everyone
had to have an opinion about this,

941
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:43,210
what this kid wanted to do and he's like,

942
00:54:43,211 --> 00:54:46,270
well my kid and want to play basketball
with these dudes who I'm friends with.

943
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,720
So it's the, at the very least they
should just let them, you know,

944
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,000
make money off their own name.
You know,

945
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,730
if there was a guy on a mass scholarship
and Sun and Sunlight compass company

946
00:54:57,731 --> 00:55:01,090
wanted to pay him a bunch of money or
a graphing calculator company wanted to

947
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:04,930
pay a bunch of money to MDUs that graphing
calculator that the school wouldn't

948
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:07,750
have a shot and there's an amateur
athlete please. It's just, it's just,

949
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:10,210
cause the colleges aren't,
wouldn't be getting a cut of that.

950
00:55:10,211 --> 00:55:13,420
And they already had these shoe
deals. That's, that's the real issue.

951
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,543
The beginning of

952
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,420
television and then the Internet
streaming and all of that. And

953
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:30,763
I want

954
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,700
to
listen to the coach and

955
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,990
you know I was watching, I'm going to
say the guy that much in this team,

956
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:49,850
this team is playing.

957
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:56,230
He comes back and it's just all about
him so they started to kind of discuss it

958
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:58,700
and one of the,
one of the teller commentators don't,

959
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,530
well you have to understand that when you
get a player of his caliber he's going

960
00:56:02,531 --> 00:56:03,780
to have to get,
he's touching

961
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,550
my team still
with nobody underneath.

962
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,260
Nobody's getting whole team.

963
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,660
It's just really near the completely,
she has different game

964
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:35,190
but it just sucks when they don't pay
the kids and then also get to see coach k

965
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:39,550
develop a guy like Zion for just
one year as opposed to like,

966
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:44,010
I don't think like the last big
guy that stayed four years was a,

967
00:56:44,011 --> 00:56:47,400
what's his face from the stores
just blanked on his name.

968
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:55,310
He stayed for a while. For sure. Yeah.

969
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,830
I do think there's that element of
like I want to root for these guys.

970
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,221
You're after.

971
00:56:58,221 --> 00:57:02,070
I mean part of the reason you like
rooting for a protein to like that's going

972
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:03,710
away. It is. It is becoming,

973
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,650
I feel like the millennial culture and
plenty of people have talked about this

974
00:57:06,651 --> 00:57:08,960
specifically in basketball,
they root for players now,

975
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,990
like Odell Beckham would be a
good, good, good choice too.

976
00:57:11,991 --> 00:57:14,420
I know a lot of people are getting
Brown's jerseys cause they're back.

977
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,110
It's like what is this nonsense for
your team? You support your city,

978
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,070
defend the shield.

979
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,430
Never gonna open up

980
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:42,700
the wallet to get those kids to stay
compared to what they would make as prose.

981
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:46,810
Yeah. I mean even if they go
in my business, if I sell out

982
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:49,400
at the end of the day,

983
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:56,240
yeah, right. You're
bringing the entire crowd.

984
00:57:56,270 --> 00:58:00,890
It's the Fab five thing. Jalen rose, Chris
Weber or walking down the street, the,

985
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,900
this,
the college is making tons of money.

986
00:58:02,901 --> 00:58:04,950
They're selling their
jerseys for $100 a pipe,

987
00:58:04,951 --> 00:58:06,980
but they don't have enough money
to pay for it. Like that's,

988
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,740
it feels like you could very
quickly fixed that by saying,

989
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:14,000
if we sell as Diane Williams Jersey,
you get a piece of this period.

990
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,283
Yeah.

991
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:31,390
Billions of dollars. Uh, you know,

992
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,990
especially with like football
has to physical or the offense.

993
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:35,210
And the defense and all that.

994
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,840
You didn't have time to like be going
to class and all of that type of stuff.

995
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:41,130
I mean,
it is what it is.

996
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,700
And the reason why those schools have
all those beautiful buildings is because

997
00:58:44,701 --> 00:58:48,770
of the sports programs. So I mean
they, they should be getting a,

998
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,900
I dunno, so be getting a
little something I would think.

999
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,890
Yeah. We know it's all
those chemistry a advocates,

1000
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,410
they're donating hundreds of millions
of dollars to build buildings. It is a,

1001
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,650
as a transparent, then

1002
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,530
you're going to have this genius genius,
I should say

1003
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,470
goodwill hunting kid. And He, uh,

1004
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:28,740
solve the math problem that there's not
like a big ESPN Saidman on it. Right.

1005
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,030
That would be hilarious if
people walked around with Jersey,

1006
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,570
Asian kid on the back.
He's figured out the first 31 trillion.

1007
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,140
It's like,
who gives a shit?

1008
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,243
Yeah.

1009
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:52,770
It's funny to watch those, those kids at
Turner awkward just like freaking out.

1010
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:56,440
Oh man,
this spelled correctly.

1011
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,300
It's somewhere between
a blooper reel stopper.

1012
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,320
It's definitely a novelty thing that
people are watching for comedic.

1013
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:09,930
Like they don't play the highlights on
sports center because they want to show

1014
01:00:09,931 --> 01:00:13,110
some awesome words. They really
just want to make fun of these kids.

1015
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:13,944
It's kind of wanting to,

1016
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,630
do you want to have some gift of some
kids sweating and it's like facial

1017
01:00:18,631 --> 01:00:23,010
reactions in his glasses and uh, yeah,
that's what they're looking for. Not,

1018
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,900
not the celebration of scaling

1019
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:37,390
freaking
out.

1020
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,600
Yeah. It's like a, it's a more
intelligent approach to wheel of fortune.

1021
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:47,330
Oh, absolutely. I can't figure out

1022
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,020
a bill as

1023
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,590
a basketball team has
always been the canvas.

1024
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,780
They are definitely one of the teams
that people are throwing out as.

1025
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:13,040
Don't be surprised if Kansas takes an
early exit from the tournament this year.

1026
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,840
They have, they have some, uh,

1027
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:18,890
they've had some issues all year and I
think there were what? Sean unforeseen.

1028
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:22,830
Yeah, they're taking on north.
Northeastern, yeah. There,

1029
01:01:22,831 --> 01:01:25,040
there are four c going up against the 13.
[inaudible].

1030
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,060
This was the first year that in the big
12 tournament they weren't a number one

1031
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:33,860
seed. So every I probably 14 years
since they didn't win the conference.

1032
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:38,090
I think. Yeah, it's been a crazy
year off for them. But those are,

1033
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:42,080
those are sometimes a teams you have to
be on the lookout for as far as bedding

1034
01:01:42,081 --> 01:01:46,160
on teams with that kind of history
that maybe just had a down year in the

1035
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,490
regular season, solid coaching, they can
kind of turn it on and make a run. I mean,

1036
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:51,530
that's how I kind of think
Villanova is going to do.

1037
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,830
They've won two in the last
four national championships.

1038
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,420
They didn't have a great regular season,

1039
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,550
but they played well winning the big east.

1040
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:01,970
I think they could make a little bit
of noise. So yeah, just to tie it up,

1041
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:05,210
Kansas is playing northeastern and the
first round minus six and a half point

1042
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:07,790
favorite. So people still
liking Kansas, I think, right?

1043
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,370
Not,
not northeastern box.

1044
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,970
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. They
in it. We, we, you know,

1045
01:02:11,971 --> 01:02:15,540
because we were going to talk to you.
I looked through it. I come through it.

1046
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:15,721
I'm like,

1047
01:02:15,721 --> 01:02:20,540
what's Boston teams are going to be in
the northeastern is the only Boston and a,

1048
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,570
yeah, they won whatever
time conference. They're in

1049
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:29,430
Kansas. Jayhawks oh, all I gotta
go. I gotta go northeastern though.

1050
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,450
All right,
so you're going to northeastern,

1051
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,700
so you're not a millennial who's
just going to follow players.

1052
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:36,170
You gotta stick it, stick to
the, the home. The home grown.

1053
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,350
Nice.
I like it.

1054
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,640
So maybe,
yeah,

1055
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:46,560
maybe ride the huskies have bill burr
catching six and a half points bill

1056
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,590
that Wednesday.
Thursday.

1057
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:54,380
It starts tomorrow morning. I think the
first game tips at nine 15 Pacific time.

1058
01:02:54,381 --> 01:02:59,381
Northeastern Kansas is going
to be at 1:00 PM tomorrow.

1059
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,570
Uh, that's got cigar bar written
all over it. All right. I love it.

1060
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,850
Go huskies as a, uh, as a
comedian, you know, it's,

1061
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:15,410
it's easy to get annoyed. I think
I had, uh, you know, the, the,

1062
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,250
the announcers when they try and be funny.

1063
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:20,880
I think the one exception though
is Charles Barkley. Are you, uh,

1064
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,030
are you a huge fan of
watching Barkley as a, uh,

1065
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:26,070
as a color commentator or a analyst?

1066
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,320
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
There's a lot of great ones.

1067
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:42,930
Time you've talked about

1068
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,150
some stupid thing.

1069
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:53,290
Nothing to do with the game.

1070
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,020
The coach is trying to
figure out is his tendencies.

1071
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,080
I'd love Tony Romo.

1072
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,270
Well,
I just love that he waited.

1073
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,700
He saves his greatness for after he was
done playing football for the Dallas

1074
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:11,080
cowboys.
So I do

1075
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:19,990
is that owner who looks like he should,

1076
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:27,850
that guy stepped in in the
beginning when he got Jimmy Johnson,

1077
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:33,340
Jamie was getting all that credit
elevator going down the field.

1078
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:37,120
They problem is the owner. It was not
only wrong, but he's the quarterback.

1079
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:38,110
So he took all the brunt.

1080
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:42,680
Yes, he does have a Montgomery
Burns type vibe, a Jerry Jones

1081
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,540
seat elevator to get down to the,
well,

1082
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:50,710
we can run out there and get some
face time when they went that that's,

1083
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,620
that's not saying in your own way.

1084
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:56,460
Yeah, that is a, I mean that's a
horrible move going on the sidelines.

1085
01:04:56,461 --> 01:05:00,900
Just ask Arthur blank of the Atlanta
Falcons when they were on the 28 to three

1086
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,830
and he goes down there with his wife and
they're holding the hands as the lead

1087
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:07,380
slowly slips away and the
paths go all the way back.

1088
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:11,230
And when an OT that's you just, you
gotta stay in the state of your buttocks

1089
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:16,090
right up there with watching somebody
on Sunday playing the masters.

1090
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:19,970
There's nothing like showing
it does because it takes, so

1091
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,590
he missed his game over like,

1092
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:32,930
I mean, do you remember the Greg Norman
show job where it was like, well, I mean,

1093
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,230
I remember as a kid watching

1094
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,290
this guy has completely
ruining his life right now.

1095
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,060
He looked like a guy in a public course.

1096
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,470
Yeah, no, I mean, I was going
to say that's what happens when,

1097
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:47,680
when you're playing a four summit to bell
and Burbank and you're playing with a

1098
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,870
guy who just freaks out
and I'm the third holy,

1099
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:53,620
he's throwing his clubs and it's like,
all right, well this isn't gonna go well,

1100
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,750
who is that guy I saw like

1101
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:00,830
10 years ago for the
first time I was like,

1102
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,230
I'm going to watch the masters
from Thursday through Sunday.

1103
01:06:03,231 --> 01:06:05,900
I watched the whole thing
does it Kenny Perry?

1104
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:07,480
Oh that.

1105
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,830
No.
What the hell was his name

1106
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:32,500
when he fell down a scorecard. You
can, you can talk to his family.

1107
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:37,140
He just got in this car and
started driving and that's it. Then

1108
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,930
we're going to be like a hoarder's.

1109
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,620
You walk by that and then you go on the
golf course. That's like the best buy.

1110
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:56,190
It just looks like a regular, you know,
strip mall. So the Internet, so he left

1111
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,690
and then just drive it down.

1112
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:04,163
It's funny you say that.

1113
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,260
What are the worst things I ever saw?

1114
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,960
Yeah, you're right. It was Kenny Perry.

1115
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:11,800
It was 2009 so stellar memory
10 years ago did collapse.

1116
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:13,930
I've also been to Augusta and yeah,
it's,

1117
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,770
it's Kinda like when you visit a very
prestigious university that's dropped in

1118
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:19,900
the middle of a bad part
of town and there's just,

1119
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:23,410
you walk through security game,
you walk through gates, uh,

1120
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:26,140
Georgia tech and he went like this.
The USC is a little bit,

1121
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,850
you walk through some gates
and all of a sudden you're,

1122
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:30,190
the grass is green and things
are nice and you're like,

1123
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:31,550
what the fuck's going on here?
Yeah,

1124
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,520
kind of makes you think
about society a little bit.

1125
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,750
You go on the outside of the gate to the
Augusta and at strip malls and barbecue

1126
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:39,530
joints like that.
That's all there is now.

1127
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,950
They call it discussed
the for a reason shown.

1128
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:45,820
It's funny you mentioned that Hooters
because uh, every year at that Hooters,

1129
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:50,860
John Daly shows up in a RV and just
hangs out at the Hooters parking live and

1130
01:07:50,861 --> 01:07:54,910
just signs autographs and
talks about his crazy days.

1131
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,460
What a life that guy has.
No, he's really on top of it.

1132
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,630
He's one of the

1133
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:12,010
longest drive torque
and the head of his card

1134
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,500
laugh, like I'm watching a stand
up real fight at how this don't,

1135
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,410
just the raw power and
just having that all set

1136
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,270
for going out and partying the night
before and saying like, he's, you know,

1137
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:50,320
he's too tired or whatever.
And he just finally looked at him aside.

1138
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:02,280
He was playing pickup Jordan Jordan
cocktails on the golf course.

1139
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:05,280
Lawrence Taylor.
That was the opposite.

1140
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,800
Well, John Daly had a
great, uh, he, he was in,

1141
01:09:10,801 --> 01:09:14,020
he was doing an interview and he
explained that he had trouble putting,

1142
01:09:14,021 --> 01:09:18,450
because every time he would go to Putt,
as he was pulling the club head back,

1143
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:22,080
he would start thinking about how
much he owes his wife in alimony.

1144
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:27,120
He was paying her $35,000 a month. He
goes, I can't hit a damn pot anymore.

1145
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:29,640
All I do is thinking about
how much money I owe or

1146
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:36,720
so sad. Yeah. Sunday comes around to that.

1147
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,380
No alimony and child support.

1148
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:48,080
Maybe one day daily. We'll get some of
that money back. A bill. Before we go,

1149
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:51,650
just your thoughts on NFL free
agency or the NFL off season.

1150
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,070
The Oda Big Odell Beckham Trade,
Antonio Brown.

1151
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,640
He didn't want to play for the bills
and he ended up getting traded to the

1152
01:09:58,641 --> 01:09:59,790
Raiders.
Levy up balance.

1153
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:05,250
Yes.
Okay.

1154
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:17,620
I didn't want to play there and then it's
just like he gets to go somewhere else.

1155
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:27,230
John Elway,
all of those guys.

1156
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,293
I won't say,

1157
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:33,930
I won't say with an NFL quarterback
because if people don't look bad and they

1158
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:37,320
have no offensive line, like your
career's going to be over like all that.

1159
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:39,780
Like the Joey Harrington, he
said, well that guy was a bus.

1160
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,460
It's like you got thoughts.
He went to the lions.

1161
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,170
Who knows what he could have been.

1162
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:48,220
He wasn't running for his life for
three years. So I don't know. I think I

1163
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:55,050
may feel swagger and a gal,

1164
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,340
his emotional issues or whatever,

1165
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:59,710
they're kind of becoming the
mid West Oakland Raiders,

1166
01:10:59,711 --> 01:11:03,010
so maybe that'll work if they can get a
bunch of free spirits in there as they

1167
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:05,200
say. Um, I think,

1168
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:09,800
I think him and Baker Mayfield are going
to be great together and I think it's,

1169
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,830
it's exciting just to see Brown
fans excited. I'm happy for that.

1170
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,070
I do agree with that.
I,

1171
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:19,910
I do find it interesting that we as a
country feel sorry for Cleveland and

1172
01:11:19,911 --> 01:11:23,420
always want to prop them up when
there's an opportunity. But yeah,

1173
01:11:23,421 --> 01:11:27,050
it does seem like Odell Beckham walking
into the browns locker room is like the

1174
01:11:27,051 --> 01:11:31,210
dude smoking the cigarette, walking
through a gas station. It May, may, may,

1175
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,240
may turn into nothing,

1176
01:11:32,241 --> 01:11:35,120
but it also may turn it into a
whole very awesome situation.

1177
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:39,470
Watch it come down a and Jarvis
Landry, he's, no, he's no wallflower.

1178
01:11:39,471 --> 01:11:42,890
That guy blast them and it's supposedly
he's best friends with Odell so maybe

1179
01:11:42,891 --> 01:11:44,060
they make it work.
But he's,

1180
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:48,020
he's a guy who loves getting the ball
and it's going gonna make that a point.

1181
01:11:48,021 --> 01:11:49,640
So if Baker can kind of battery,

1182
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,950
I hope it goes to the positive way and
then they become like this hilarious,

1183
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:03,940
you know,

1184
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,540
exciting team to watch that has like the
best interviews afterwards cause they

1185
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:09,850
all say a bunch of crazy stuff.
That's what I'm hoping for.

1186
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:13,300
Well and the networks are clamoring to
get Cleveland browns games this year. So

1187
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:20,150
multiple Cleveland Brown games in
prime time. It's been a long time.

1188
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:23,820
My uncle, my uncle is going to roll
over in his grave. But you got,

1189
01:12:23,821 --> 01:12:28,070
I mean the browns fans in general,
Cleveland is a real legit sports city.

1190
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,680
Any team has so many die hards,

1191
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:34,640
whether it's the browns or the bills
teams that maybe the city doesn't have a

1192
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:39,170
lot going on besides the team. You
got root for those, those fan bases.

1193
01:12:39,171 --> 01:12:42,560
So it's good to see they're getting
some big time players in their bill.

1194
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,650
As always,
appreciate you calling in to the podcast.

1195
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,700
Make sure you check out bill's a Monday
morning podcast. F is for family.

1196
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:51,170
Anything else you got going on bill

1197
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:58,540
now streaming on Netflix?
It's an adult cartoon.

1198
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:02,560
I would say definitely some vulgar
language and Scott, a lot of heart.

1199
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:04,090
I don't watch it around your kids.

1200
01:13:04,091 --> 01:13:07,240
We've got three great seasons and we're
wrapping up season four right now as far

1201
01:13:07,241 --> 01:13:09,670
as writing it and season
four should be out next year.

1202
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,730
A quick sidebar to that.
Uh,

1203
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:16,731
one of my kids fat stumbled across F F
F is for family and I had that moment

1204
01:13:16,861 --> 01:13:21,210
where I was like, no, stop.
But it is funny. Great show,

1205
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:22,330
great says.
Yeah.

1206
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:23,503
Yeah.

1207
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:28,620
You guys just parents decide your own
what you're going to do with your kid

1208
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,013
watching it.

1209
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:35,370
I'm not a big fan of censorship,
but I may be applied a little sensor show.

1210
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:37,430
You got it.
You got to figure out the right edge.

1211
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:41,940
All right. Thanks. All
right guys. We'll see you.

1212
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,520
All right.
Appreciate it.

1213
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:48,740
[inaudible].
