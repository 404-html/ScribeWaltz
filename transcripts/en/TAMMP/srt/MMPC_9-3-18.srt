happy be fucking Labor Day to you.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,530
How many fucking podcasts are out there
wishing you a happy Labor Day with an

16
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,690
original song?
Huh?

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,770
Am I going to get sued for saying
that in the podcasting world,

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,910
in the podcasting stratosphere. Where
are you guys doing today? On Labor Day?

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,410
Okay.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,020
What the fuck is Labor Day Anyway?

21
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:09,030
So does this have something to do with
the troops? How hard they're working,

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,080
right? And you're not doing shit cause
you're not wearing a uniform, right? Huh?

23
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,960
You fucking civilian piece of shit.

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,170
Don't you love how, that's the vibe. Now,

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,780
how about a round of applause for
our troops? I have around a plus.

26
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,370
The rest of us paying the fucking taxes.

27
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:28,140
You can't do this God damn field trip
over there and it's never going to fucking

28
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,440
end until what we bankrupt the whole
fucking thing and five cons have all the

29
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:36,390
money. Ah. How about a round
plus for us? You're rich. Cons.

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,260
June is growing and leaving
us with the fucking tab.

31
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,510
Okay.

32
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,540
Can I get on the plane first? Every
once in a while. You're fucking asshole.

33
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,320
All right. Labor Day. Labor Day,

34
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,570
fucking me.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,620
Nay Labor Day is a public holiday or
a day of festivities held in honor of

36
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:05,200
working people in the United States
and Canada. This ain't about your wife,

37
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:08,050
is it? Oh, shots fired.

38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,620
I'm on the first Monday in September
and in many countries on May 1st.

39
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,120
Why do we always have to
be different over here?

40
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,970
You know the whole fucking
world's on the metric system. Oh,

41
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:24,960
fucking world is celebrating
Labor Day on May 1st not America.

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,870
Now we're on standard September 1st.

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,830
Yeah.

44
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,400
The rest of the world respecting
the summer or at least the spring.

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,150
Okay.

46
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,660
Oh yeah. He shares your fucking day
off at the end of the goddamn summer.

47
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,030
How you like,
you got to pack up the water skis.

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,950
Hey Buddy.
You know,

49
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:50,951
and that's about the Nath fucking
negative thing you said about the United

50
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,130
States of America. I got one for
you. I, you got a fucking day off.

51
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,680
Why don't you pack your shit
up and get the fuck out.

52
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,200
See how you like it if some mother fucking

53
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,970
yeah,

54
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,200
fucking Moscatos the size of
your fucking freckled ball head.

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,760
You fucking orange mother fucker.

56
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:13,761
I got a good fucking mind to get out of
my truck and go in and show you what's

57
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:14,724
what

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,220
pappy labored.

59
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,290
Hey dear America.

60
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,390
Oh you fucking wine and crime.

61
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:32,391
Fucking snowflakes out there
bitching about global warming.

62
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,500
You want to see warming? I bought
my fucking nuts, mother fucker.

63
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,540
I'm a God damn coal miner.
You understand me?

64
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:51,490
I'm a coal miner in 2018 why the fuck
would I want to go out and learn about

65
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:55,870
solar power when I can continue
doing a fucking job that's out slate.

66
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,100
I don't give a fuck if I'm
digging in a national park.

67
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:06,460
Stepping on a fucking Bald
Eagle fucking head. All right.

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,880
If that's going to put spam on my
fucking table, I'm going to do it.

69
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,450
And at some orange to play where a mother
fucker where the Goddamn red tie down

70
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:19,000
his fucking name is going to
do it for me and a God damn.

71
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,200
And I'm going to vote for

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,630
dear America.
Um,

73
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,560
does he know what he was wondering?
What my neighbors think?

74
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,500
You know how many people live in that
house in, are any of them in a good, yeah.

75
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,383
Mood.

76
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,580
Oh Jesus.
So it's Labor Day.

77
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,910
Now let me ask you a question since
it's a fucking day off, right?

78
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,710
Does your wife's give you the day off?
Huh?

79
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,670
Or does she wants you to run around and
do a bunch of God damn jobs that need to

80
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:00,610
be done while she stays in the
house doing God knows what,

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,140
right?
I was

82
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,670
silver. We could get those boxes.
Is that what you were hoping?

83
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:11,671
Well God gave you a couple of arms
and a back started lifting this week.

84
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,123
Okay.

85
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,210
He's fucking ladies. I swear to God it
can you, can you ever just sit down?

86
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,640
Yeah.

87
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,050
What is a couch for in their world other
than to throw too many fucking pillows

88
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:29,910
on it. See, can't even fucking sit down.

89
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,850
And the second year it's like they know
this second, you fucking god damn acids,

90
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:40,050
the couch and your head's on the pillow
and you grabbed the remote to watch a

91
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:40,300
little.
Yeah,

92
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,600
Carly football. What happened? Hi.

93
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,900
Sorry. I am in a mood. I'm
actually happy married guy.

94
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:53,040
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I'm just trying to make you guys laugh.

95
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,460
All right. Cause I've been in
those relationship. All right.

96
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,460
My wife's cool as shit though. You know,
the other night I was hanging out, right?

97
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,950
Smoking a Sega. Oh No, I
wasn't. He supposed to hang out.

98
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,030
I ended up just fucking partner called
me up and we ended up hanging out and

99
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:14,370
she's like, you know, she sent me
the usual texts and I was like,

100
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:18,430
I'm down to the comedy store, I'm smoking
a cigar with some buddies of mine.

101
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:22,660
We did a spot. Sorry. And she goes, she
goes, no, hang out with your friends,

102
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:27,480
have a good time. And I texted
her back. Best wife ever. Right.

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,770
You can't complain if your wife does that
once a fucking year you, you got a gym,

104
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,780
you know, and my wife consistently does it
unless, you know, at two three, you know,

105
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,250
the next night when I went out again,

106
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,620
that took a little four day vacation is
what I did here as I stayed on my diet.

107
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,500
By the way, I had a couple of
little missteps here or there,

108
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:52,060
but generally speaking, I'm, I'm drinking
a little fucking smoothie here, you know,

109
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,540
I don't know what I'm doing.
I've got to add some cardio,

110
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:01,040
but you don't stuff that I
got this fucking Shit beat
out of me by some God damn

111
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:05,210
bugs. I don't even know where they
always go after my left foot, you know,

112
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm like the fucking Daniel Day Lewis,
a bug bites my left foot.

113
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,360
They just go after it
right now it is on fire.

114
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,250
You know,

115
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,720
I literally have to put like some that
oxy 10 on it and then I got to put a sock

116
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,510
on it like so I won't
scratch it. Like, you know,

117
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,900
when you put a fucking the Goddamn I,

118
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:29,870
someone said chandelier
a fucking lampshade.

119
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,160
Okay.

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,180
Over dogs fucking, you know, so he can't
turn around by itself. The problem is,

121
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,940
that's why should always just stick a
fucking one of those lampshades on my, uh,

122
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,403
on my ankle.

123
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,370
But the problem is I'm a God damn human
being made in the image of our Lord and

124
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,750
Savior,
Jesus Christ.

125
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:52,751
So I have the ability to figure out how
to take off said lamp shade and started

126
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,840
scratching the fuck out of my ankle.

127
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,910
It was so bad the other
night actually woke me up.

128
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,430
Okay.

129
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,920
Like nothing could touch it.
It was on fucking fire and a dude.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,910
These are next level. These are next
level. Global warming. Fucking mosquitoes.

131
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,480
All right. If you got a pair of jeans on
or Dungarees as they used to be called,

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,040
they'll bite right through them.
They don't give a shit. You know,

133
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,910
I wish it could be some assassin
fucking mosquitoes. Right?

134
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,710
And rather than just buying regular old
fucking people and giving them malaria

135
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,390
in that shit,
like it could just

136
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,960
fucking just go find one of
those Bilderberg meetings.

137
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,790
It just find who the fuck is in
front of all this? God Damn Madness.

138
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:45,900
Okay.

139
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,950
Sorry guys. I don't know. This is
why I don't watch the fucking news.

140
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,010
Um,
yeah.

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,540
Just go on a hundred million fucking
miles hour into the brick wall and all

142
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,330
these fucking rich people think that
somehow they're going to have a parachute.

143
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,200
And I guess what the rest of us are
all going to die. Is that what it is?

144
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:07,880
I'll bill. Come on. It's a
holiday. All right. All right.
Let's talk football here.

145
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,860
Let's talk football.
BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp um,

146
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,040
how about those Red Sox? Woo.
Lots of the white sox last night,

147
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,690
eight to nothing for the first time.

148
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:25,340
We're actually kind of playing like 500
ball and I think it's a great thing.

149
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,750
I don't want to go to the
fucking playoffs. Not knowing
what losing feels like.

150
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,700
Like, wait, what's this other
wheels coming off? I wanted
to more be like, oh yeah,

151
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:37,250
this, we got out of this. All right.

152
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,010
Sales still on the disabled
list as far as I know.

153
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,020
And I don't know if price has,
uh, has pitched since, uh,

154
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,500
he got hit by that comeback
line or off his wrist.

155
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,010
X Rays were negative,
were doing further fucking studies.

156
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,830
So a, we shall see. We'll see what's
going to happen. Uh, last I saw,

157
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,260
um,
the Astros,

158
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,290
the team to beat the defending world
series champions getting zero respect out

159
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,700
there in Houston.
You know,

160
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:11,540
you would think that the baseball team
was as fat as the average person in

161
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,470
Houston. And I don't even fucking
wrinkle your Goddamn snout up at me.

162
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:19,820
If you fucking live in Houston,
you guys went back to back.

163
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,010
You had a goddamn dynasty
of being fucking, uh,

164
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,780
nominated or winning the fattest
city in the United States of America.

165
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,760
All right. And this is the fattest
fucking country evidently. Okay.

166
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:37,430
You are a,
you are a fat person's fatty Houston.

167
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,273
Okay.

168
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,330
Down there. Fucking barbecue
and everything, aren't you? Huh?

169
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,490
Do you know how it's just actually was
actually just in Houston there there is

170
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:53,491
not a juice joint and that entire city

171
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,500
lettuce is illegal. This,
this is, this is a US city.

172
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,313
Okay.

173
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,950
Now you wondering why they had
that Biblical flood down there.

174
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,680
Maybe God was like this.

175
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:12,580
This is a level of slough
that I have never seen. See,

176
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:16,390
that's why there's never a
flood out here in Hollywood,

177
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,490
okay?
Because we are so righteous.

178
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,863
We

179
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,700
are so living,

180
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,750
okay,

181
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,520
day to day and his image in his word.
I want you all right now.

182
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:34,480
I want you to close your eyes.

183
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:37,810
I want you to close your eyes right
now and just to know that Jesus,

184
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,240
he wants you to live in Hollywood.
He wants you to go there.

185
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,860
He wants you to do some coke.

186
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,400
He wants to get a girlfriend trying to
fuck her friend and try to keep both in

187
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:51,280
the fuck you at the same time.
He wants that. I'm sorry,

188
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:56,130
that was my Joel Olsteen. That's why
he didn't open the Goddamn doors.

189
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,350
When I'm that flood fucking Cayman
say I don't have enough fucking,

190
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,071
what am I fucking,

191
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:05,860
Jesus is going to keep pulling out
fucking barbecue fish for these people. I,

192
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,660
I don't,

193
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,610
I simply do not have enough
wafers to sustain this.

194
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,000
It's going to be a ride. They can,
they can rip up my blue carpet.

195
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:16,900
Okay.

196
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,440
Um, he was content to let those
fatties just float right by the arena.

197
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,040
Oh, well, you know what I would've done?
I would've put some fucking moorings.

198
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,020
Is that what you call those things?
You get dock a boat too.

199
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,230
I would have thrown some rope out there
and just had those fatties fucking,

200
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:31,064
you know,

201
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,330
now they're like a bunch of dinghies
until the water came down. I mean,

202
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:40,940
what was Joel Olsteen supposed to do?

203
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,753
Okay.

204
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,720
Joel Osteen's in shape. He lives
in Houston. You know why that is?

205
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:53,980
It's a miracle. I tell you, I saw a,

206
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,390
the image of a skinny Joel Olsteen and
my pop tart deal the day when I was in

207
00:12:58,391 --> 00:12:59,590
downtown Houston.

208
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,050
You ever take two pop tarts or heat him
up and you stick a glazed doughnut in

209
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:10,400
the middle of it cos you don't,
you don't live in Houston.

210
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,540
He weigh in about this laugh.
Um,

211
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,230
I had a drink smoothies
more before I do a podcast.

212
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:23,231
I have incredible energy and a new
level of disrespect for a lot of things.

213
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,590
Dude,
my fucking foot,

214
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,780
my fucking foot is driving me nuts.
And then I got,

215
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:36,520
I got a bug bite on the back of my arm
and then I got another one on my lower

216
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:40,090
back, like just to the right of
where a tramp stamp would be.

217
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Did I ever tell you guys I was dumb enough
to get one of those in the nineties?

218
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,590
I did. I got a Boston Bruins stamp. Tramp.

219
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,140
Okay.

220
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,770
Do you know and it said real men wear
black and I had that right above my ass

221
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,570
and I had to,
I had to work so hard.

222
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,820
Yeah.

223
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,653
Sorry.

224
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,660
In stand up to finally be able to
afford enough money to begin my laser

225
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,130
treatments to remove it.

226
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,610
I know a lot of you probably always
wondered why I never wore a half shirt on

227
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,330
stage. Well, that is why.

228
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,393
Okay.

229
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,260
I mean, I guess my big fault
is that I'm a hockey fan. Okay.

230
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:29,030
There I said it. Um, did you guys
watch any college football yesterday?

231
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,210
How about college football?
Just taking over this weekend.

232
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:35,180
The way the NFL does
towards the end of the year,

233
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,210
the NFL is give a fuck that you
got Christmas shopping to do.

234
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,270
They don't care that you got,
you're Jewish and you got to buy.

235
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:45,320
Fuck was it eight gifts?
Nine gifts for each fucking person,

236
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,623
right?

237
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,580
Is that candle fucking ghosts
candle number one. What do you got?

238
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,580
Well, how do you do what? Jewish people,
Dhea, Dhea, Dhea. Build the buildup.

239
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,300
The gifts. That's why
you got to do it, right?

240
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:02,210
You've got to start with the
weakest thing you got right.

241
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,380
What do you guy got a pair of socks,
you know,

242
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,470
and you just gradually
build the whole outfit up.

243
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,423
MMM.

244
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,810
Too Sharp and for Kwanzaa,
right?

245
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,470
The NFL does not give a fuck come
the end of the year. They like,

246
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:25,210
we own all the weekends.
We're taking all the fucking money.

247
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,043
All right.

248
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,430
We're showing games on Saturday that we
thought were going to matter, but don't.

249
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,720
We're kicking off the NFL season
this Thursday. This Thursday.

250
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:42,070
The NFL season is back,
ladies and gentlemen,

251
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,650
and it fell.
Football is back.

252
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,253
Okay.

253
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,960
And for the next 17 fucking weeks

254
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,510
with the bye week,

255
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,110
I ever fucking lonely. The, the, the,
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

256
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,950
the fucking season is
now the regular season.

257
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,043
Okay.

258
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,900
I like to think that this country
can set aside all of the issues

259
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,530
that are weighing us down and we can lose
ourselves in the bread and circus that

260
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:16,430
is professional football. And
when does it start, Bill? Or

261
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,240
put it up, put it on. It
starts Thursday night.

262
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,770
Thursday night with yellow
defending super bowl champions.

263
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,600
The Philadelphia Eagles.

264
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:34,230
Did you ever think you'd ever
hear that in your fucking life?

265
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,350
People of Philadelphia,
you know, you didn't,

266
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,830
don't even act like you did.
Right? Where the fuck am I?

267
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,380
You guys are playing the dirty birds

268
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,090
down there and fucking
Atlanta. It's, it's,

269
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,520
it's the battle of the
birds this Thursday night.

270
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:55,750
This is the only Thursday game worth
watching for the entire fucking season.

271
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,480
Why you may not have asked,

272
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,100
because this is the only one where the
fucking teams didn't play four days

273
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:06,340
earlier and they're all banged up.
Yes.

274
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,120
The Eagles who will be
wearing green on green. Yes.

275
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,410
The Falcons will be wearing, I dunno,
black and red on black and red.

276
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,500
It's a home game for the goes. They're
probably going to bring the, if the, the,

277
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,560
the,
the championship flag up there.

278
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:25,561
And can you imagine how many people in
the city of Philadelphia are not going to

279
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:30,601
be able to time their alcohol intake to
when the flag is going to be raised and

280
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:36,160
they'll be in that little jail in
the Eagle's stadium looking out,

281
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,490
you know,
while the police laugh at them,

282
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,150
the local cops as they play iron
maiden's rhyming the ancient mariner.

283
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,563
Right.

284
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,460
Somehow it combined Ryman, the ancient
Mariner with the of Monte Cristo I'm on,

285
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:55,461
he's looking out the fucking his
jail cell and he could see the ocean.

286
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,920
You could see how free,
you know,

287
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,110
see the boats going by and
he was just sitting in there.

288
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,733
MMM.

289
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,380
And then later he got a Gig
on sesame street. Anyways,

290
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,020
it starts with the eagles and the falcons.

291
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,420
Now I've got, if you're a Philadelphia
Eagles fan, you gotta be asking yourself,

292
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,700
will this be a hangover game?

293
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,680
Yeah.

294
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,210
Are The eagles still celebrating?

295
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,030
Who Am I patriots playing?
Tom Brady coming up,

296
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,070
one of his great games is
a pro against the eagles.

297
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,260
A lot of people forget that though.

298
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:34,261
I thought thought the fucking ball he
threw for over 500 yards in a Superbowl

299
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,350
and lost.
Okay.

300
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,230
Now let's the Patriots go to
the Superbowl again this year.

301
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:44,020
You tell me when the fuck that's
ever going to happen again.

302
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,820
Everybody talking about Joe Dimaggio,
Oh, oh 56 game hitting streak,

303
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,930
whatever. Anybody can fucking do. That

304
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,570
56 game hitting streak is, is uh, is
pretty, God dammit. Impressive. You know,

305
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,440
to the point, they literally were
writing songs Jolton Joe Dimaggio,

306
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,900
whatever they were doing, right?
President was paying attention.

307
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,270
Did anybody write a fucking
song with Tom Brady?

308
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:18,271
Threw for 500 fucking yards and a god
damn Superbowl people have thrown for half

309
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:23,320
that much, smoked a cigar
and paraded around with the,

310
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,460
he threw enough yards to win to fucking
trophies in one game and the man lost.

311
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,103
Yeah.

312
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,500
So everybody's sitting around going,
how it can Tom keep doing it?

313
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:38,410
I used fucking old and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay.

314
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,820
And I'm sitting over here with no
more hair left on top of my head.

315
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:46,810
The pullout going,
the problem is not Tommy.

316
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,810
Okay.

317
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,180
I would say it's our defense.

318
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,080
That's what I, I would say that
that was the fucking problem.

319
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,733
Okay.

320
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,730
That was such a fucking weird game.
Um,

321
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,850
I would love to go back
and watch it at some point

322
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,840
and just try to figure out how there was
only fucking two points or three points.

323
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,770
The whole fucking game. The
weirdest Goddamn game I've
ever seen in my life. Um,

324
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,450
it's like both offenses
showed up to play and the,

325
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,140
and the fucking defense was just
like this, this is the Superbowl.

326
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,800
I just can't get comfortable.
Um, what else we could,

327
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:26,450
we got the bangles or the bangles

328
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,000
as a is Paul Versey calls him the bangles,
calls him the girl group there,

329
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,840
and he calls the girl group the
bangles. Okay. But Paul Versey,

330
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,530
he marches to the beat of his own drummer
is playing the cults. Andrew Luck.

331
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,710
And I'm gonna tell you
something right now.

332
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:43,220
I'm gonna you something right
now by Andrew Luck. All right?

333
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,110
If you're fucking sitting there right,

334
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:50,100
and life keeps kicking you in the Dick
and you landed face down in the dust,

335
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,690
you know, and you just don't want to
get up anymore. Watch Andrew Luck.

336
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:58,290
Take a fucking hit. He
doesn't give a fuck. Gets up.

337
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,270
He congratulates the Gay Greg Job,
man.

338
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:03,480
I'll probably be filling that in
my early fifties. Granulation.

339
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:05,910
See on the next play.
I love that guy.

340
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,410
This is me actually saying something
positive about the Indianapolis Colts as

341
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:11,750
much as I hate gym or say,

342
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,140
okay.

343
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,531
All right.

344
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:17,760
Andrew luck the way he conducts himself
out there with such fucking class,

345
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,720
it actually actually transcends the fact

346
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,870
did he takes a paycheck from that corrupt
piece of shit that Flimflam the boss

347
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:34,250
Hog, the fucking NFL. Um,

348
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,350
anyways, the bills are playing the
ravens. This is what I gotta be asking my,

349
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,130
if I'm a buffalo bills fan and I got my
face in a plate full of fucking wings

350
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,270
over at anchor bar or fucking Duffy's,
whatever the fuck you supposed to go.

351
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,860
I got to be asking myself,

352
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:53,720
is this the year where the
bills for the finally return

353
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,980
to their AFC championship winning glory.

354
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,213
Okay.

355
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,430
Do the bills finally
get back to their peak?

356
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,800
Going to a super bowl?

357
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,510
Yeah.

358
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,330
Sorry. You know, I'm going to get
people in the AFC east. A lot of shit.

359
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,870
The Buccaneers and the saints,
uh, drew breeze, by the way.

360
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:18,420
Not In a lot of people realize this guy,
he's second all time.

361
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:22,560
I think he's strong for more yards and
Tom Brady and nobody pays attention to

362
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:25,620
him. Who's, who's kidding, who,
he's not dreamy. Like Tom Brady.

363
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,860
He's not as tall as Tom Brady.
You know,

364
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,150
supermodels are not knocking on his door.

365
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,440
He is a regular Joe.
He's a family man,

366
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,910
you know, and he's down there and, and,

367
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,830
and a fucking city that the devil is
even scared to go to and he is gone. He,

368
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:51,510
he's been able to maintain
of the stuff,

369
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,550
the fucking values that he was,

370
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:57,360
he was brought up and I would say that
is actually more impressive to me than

371
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:00,660
actually the amount of yards he's thrown
in his career were taking collars.

372
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,490
Okay.

373
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,920
Patriots are playing the Texans.
Right.

374
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:06,730
And that fucking saint
quarterbacks coming back,

375
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,450
I already forgot everybody's names.
Was that kid from Louisville.

376
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,840
Okay.

377
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,460
So Clemson and all the fuck he's from.

378
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,753
Yeah.

379
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,470
But um,
I know he's amazing and JJ watts is back,

380
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,560
so they should be an early test for these
[inaudible] page with the 49 is versus

381
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:30,800
the vikings. I don't even know what's
going on over there. Okay. Is Catherine.

382
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:35,240
It's still kneeling on the
ground. Kaepernick doesn't
have a Gig. The Vikings,

383
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,330
the vikings who are at
their peak right now

384
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,510
doing what they do,
coming fucking it up,

385
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,200
waiting to the next season and they
are on the rock. Can they finally,

386
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,390
can they finally turn the fucking
corner? What else? What else is going on?

387
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:56,590
The giants are looking good.

388
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,980
They got that maniac running
back from fucking Penn state.

389
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,600
They're playing the Jaguars,
the Brown.

390
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,270
They got that fucking dude from
Oklahoma, right? Or that the other,

391
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:14,590
the guy on TV said was undrafted and
he went on his fucking show with an

392
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:16,510
undrafted bill shirt.
They got this kid.

393
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,220
Okay.

394
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,550
Little bit of swagger.

395
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,980
The Cleveland browns playing the Steelers
right out of the gate. Jesus Christ.

396
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:25,620
Those two cities, they didn't even get
a chance to put their fucking face up.

397
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,490
I cannot fucking wait.
I am taping all of these games.

398
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:34,491
And your Los Angeles Rams versus the
Oakland soon to be Las Vegas Raiders.

399
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,900
I mean, how great a fucking game is that
going to be? That's the game right there.

400
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,250
That's the game of the week right there.

401
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,930
Rams first Raiders as far as I'm
concerned. That's the one I want to see.

402
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,930
Okay.

403
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,280
Oh, the 49 is have, what's his
face? Seattle's a Richard Sherman.

404
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:59,160
They got him coming back from the,
the, the fucking dreaded Achilles

405
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,270
tendon injury. See what he can do for
the 40. Niners you know what I mean? Um,

406
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,150
all right.
There you go.

407
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,600
So good luck to all you guys
unless you're playing the patriots.

408
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,820
Um,

409
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,313
okay,

410
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,460
now let's talk college football. How
Great was the college football? You know,

411
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,940
they were smart enough to not have all
those cupcake games of beginning of the

412
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:22,550
year. I mean, when I was growing
up, like September was a joke.

413
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,170
You get your football cad from your
bookie and what would they be saying?

414
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:32,171
It will be just like Nebraska would be
favored by 59 against like Kent State and

415
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:35,150
you'd take Kent State and then
like they would be up like,

416
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,770
like fucking 35 to nothing at the half.
And you like tea, they would cover.

417
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,580
Um, anyways, I watched my Lsu,

418
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,110
my adopted Lsu Tigers against the Miami
hurricanes, and a good friend of mine,

419
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,030
he's a huge Miami hurricane fan to the
point that I actually root for the Miami

420
00:25:56,031 --> 00:26:00,440
hurricanes because I'm friends with him.
Not that I was ever a hurricane fan,

421
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:04,310
I wasn't.
So he was playing my adopted Lsu Tigers.

422
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,840
His team was playing my team. So I
texted him before the game. I said,

423
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,000
the Miami tropical depression,

424
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,210
you don't like when they think
it's going to be a hurricane.

425
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:16,280
And then they downgraded
to a tropical storm.

426
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,870
Will the downgrade of tropical storm
is tropical depression, I believe,

427
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,400
according to the weather that I
looked up. So he's like, fuck you man.

428
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:28,970
So we bought him a better round of drinks.
Some cigar came even fucking remember.

429
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,080
And I got to tell you right
now, I thought, you know,

430
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:37,640
Lsu the entire time I've been a fan of
these guys since like 2008 when I moved

431
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:39,980
out here, 2007, 2008.

432
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,040
So 2007 when I came out to
La and I actually had time
to watch college football.

433
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,903
MMM.

434
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,450
And I'd like less Meyers and how he
would go for it on fourth down and trick

435
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:54,310
plays and all that shit.
You know, and I just,

436
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:56,800
I wasn't going to just jump
on the Alabama bandwagon.

437
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,230
Isn't it amazing that they're
still at the peak 10 years later?

438
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,013
MMM.

439
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,640
There's still the team to beat. So I
was like, I'm gonna go with these guys.

440
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:07,700
So I've been watching them for 10 years
and for 10 years we have not had a

441
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:08,570
fucking quarterback.

442
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,880
They were doing that awful thing like
that old school college football thing

443
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:17,300
where it was just like, this is a running
down, putting the black quarterback.

444
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,140
This is oh, passing down,
put in the white quarterback.

445
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,210
They were doing that shit
in the two thousands.

446
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,270
Right.
Um,

447
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,030
and then I think there are there all time
rushing leader was their quarterback,

448
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,160
you know,
which is not a good stat.

449
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,180
They've had these bees at defense. They
actually had Odell Beckham at one point.

450
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,010
My buddy was saying like,
what a fucking waste.

451
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:44,250
They had nobody that throw
it to throw it to them. Um,

452
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,450
so I'm watching the game yesterday.
This kid, Joe Borrow, I guess,

453
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:52,200
transferred some from some other college.
Um,

454
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,150
I was losing my mind watching this guy.
I like, this guy's a fucking quarterback,

455
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,780
you know, people getting in
his face, giving him shit.
He's giving him shit back.

456
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,230
Okay.

457
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,440
He's fucking, he's reading
the blitz, you know, he's,

458
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,840
he was doing all this type of
shit and I was all excited.

459
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:13,330
And then I was just like,
this guy has got to have like 250 yards.

460
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:15,070
He only had a hundred,
144.

461
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:20,230
That's how much the QB position has
suffered while I've been watching these

462
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,250
guys,
uh,

463
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,640
that I was excited that there was a
guy in the middle of the third quarter.

464
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:28,870
I had 144 yards passing.
Um, and their new coach,

465
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:32,040
I hope I say his name,
White, uh, ed or German.

466
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,030
Okay.

467
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,790
Or Gerard, I don't even know how to
say his name, but all I know is he's,

468
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,890
he's got that by you fucking accent and
he, he sounds like fucking Hulk Hogan.

469
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,110
He sounds like he's
doing a wrestling promo.

470
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,350
I was waiting for me at lemme tell
you yourself to a broader, um,

471
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll try to get you a clip of him and he
flips out and screams and yells at the

472
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:55,800
players and uh, that reminds me of what a
football coach was when I was a kid. Uh,

473
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,760
Lsu for the most part
just handled 25th ranked.

474
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,710
Lsu just handled eighth ranked Miami,
tropical depression,

475
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,270
Miami hurricanes. And uh,
but in typical Lsu fashion,

476
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:12,900
they still scare me towards the end
when all of a sudden l a Miami started

477
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:15,090
coming back and then it was just like,

478
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:20,060
it was 33 to 17 was six minutes
left and Miami stopped him again.

479
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,790
I'm like, they are two drives
in to two point conversions.

480
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,210
Touchdown two point convergence
away from tying this fucking game.

481
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,340
Only Lsu could make me this nervous
after being up like 33 to 10 or some shit

482
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:36,960
like that. Um, but they held
on they want and all of that.

483
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,420
So I am excited.
Uh,

484
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,190
I know it's the first week of the season
before all you negative concepts out

485
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:44,870
there are going to be fucking,
you know,

486
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,060
you know what [inaudible] was all,
all over overrated

487
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,680
much. You know, like
that's some sort of like,

488
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,140
people just hate people being excited.

489
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:56,680
Okay.

490
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,910
Oh,
well what are you happy about?

491
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:00,460
Something and how cop can I
fucking shit all over this?

492
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,883
MMM.

493
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,101
Anyway,
so let's,

494
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:08,990
let's do some ad reach
here on Labor Day to you.

495
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:13,430
Oh, just in time for fucking football
season, I now remember people,

496
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:15,740
you got to gamble responsibly.

497
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,740
What I love about these guys is these
guys to not hide behind the fact that they

498
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:24,950
are a gambling site. Like some of
those other ones way back in the day,

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,810
like this is a, this is a game
of skill. All right. My bookie

500

502
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:44,420
I know I look good, right? Same
thing. They're being brave right now.

503
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,910
Um, my bookie, you know,
ever since I, this podcast,

504
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:53,000
people have been asking me for advice.
I don't know why.

505
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,740
Ask me what team do bet on. The truth
is, I don't know who's going to win,

506
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,670
but if you think you know you got a chair,
you got to check out my bookie.

507
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,450
I could have done it in a way, but at
the truth is, I dunno who's gonna win,

508
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,920
but if you think you know, you got
to check out my bookie. Remember,

509

who you're betting on is just as
important as who you're betting with.

511
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,830
That's why I always tell people to bet
with my bookie. I didn't know I did that.

00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,050
I went to London and I went to Paris.

563
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,450
Okay.

564
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:32,450
France and I showed my tramp
stamp underpants and a,

565
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,350
I took a couple of pictures,
you know,

566
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,380
with my wife and our beautiful
daughter in front of the loo,

567
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,280
front of the Eiffel Tower.
Right. My favorite place to, uh,

570
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:53,830
I forgot what street it's on.

571
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,100
And then I took one of me smoking a cigar
with my dad when we were in London and

572
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:03,310
I just had all of those framed.
And that's great because you know,

573
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,940
you take all these great pictures,
they stay on your phone and then you know,

574
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:09,700
they ended up in some hard drive
and then you break up with somebody.

575
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:13,060
You forget the fucking hard drive.
Make sure you're framed your good ones,

635
00:38:56,931 --> 00:39:00,470
The rest of that read my head
was actually, I've already
made the Burger patties.

636
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,840
Okay. Now next thing I'm going to do
them a cup to the tomatoes, the lettuce,

have all the pickles, have everything
ready to fucking go. And this year,

638

for the first time ever,

639
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,920
I am going to do a practice burger just
to make sure my temperature is right,

640
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:19,890
to know how long. So for all the people
who want it, medium rare, medium, well,

641
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:24,140
well done, all of that fucking shit.
I made my patty small this year.

642
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,150
I made him Finn.
All right.

643
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,160
Better than Mcdonald's or old school
Mcdonald's. Not Quite Wendy's all right.

644
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,140
Right in the fucking wheel house because
I used to work, I used to work in a,

645
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:41,090
uh,
this place called the sable cafe in,

646
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:45,650
um, in Cary, North Carolina. I,

647
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,350
I worked there, I swear
to God, 31 years ago.

648
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,840
I worked there for nine months.

649
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,680
And unfortunately the restaurant
was gradually going out of business.

650
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,070
I was a busboy and then I became
the busboy and dishwasher.

651
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:03,570
And then at one point, I swear to
God, I was the grill chef. The busboy.

652
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,840
And a dishwasher.
As I took on these extra jobs,

653
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,890
they would give me like a 50 cent
raise and I was so bad with math,

654
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:15,840
it never dawned on me like, hey, minimal
wage is three 50 an hour and, and,

655
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:19,020
and the dishwasher was getting paid
three 50 an hour and I was getting paid

656
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:21,390
three 50 an hour.
So you're paying two people,

657
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:25,680
$7 an hour to do these two jobs
and now I'm doing both jobs.

658
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:29,520
That other person doesn't have a
job and I'm only making $4 an hour.

659
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,490
Yeah.

660
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,090
Then I became the grill shift and I think
I was making four 75 an hour of five

661
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:39,770
bucks an hour to do three fucking
jobs. And I would be out there and, uh,

662
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,360
I would be,

663
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,630
I was glassed in on a mesquite grill with
the chef hat and underneath my apron I

664
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:49,610
had the bow tie fucking, um, busboy
outfit. It was literally like, you know,

665
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:53,900
when Peter Brady had two dates
in one night, right. And, um,

666
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,800
okay.

667
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,540
I fucking wood duck down when I saw a
table almost done eating and I would run

668
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,760
out there, bus table, run back,

669
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,620
throw all the dishes in the dishwasher
and then run fucking back out without

670
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:08,940
washing my hands.

671
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,180
Okay,

672
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,510
this is just food. But
you still, you know,

673
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,320
I'm just handling your food and then
I would continue fucking cooking.

674
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,383
MMM.

675
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,950
And then that's when I learned that little
trick. You know, where you, you know,

676
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,760
I learned it this way. You
put shift, you put your, uh,

677
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:30,830
you just touch your thumb to your index
finger and then touch the fleshy part of

678
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:32,380
your,
uh,

679
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,280
of your hand that connects to your thumb
and you press on that. That's rare.

680
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,140
Then you just move it to your middle
finger. That's like medium rare.

681
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,000
Then the ring fingers. Well, and
then the fucking pinkies well done.

682
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,470
Now that fucking works
provided you're in an all,

683
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:55,850
but it all depends on how thick the patty
is and how high your fucking heaters.

684
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,110
So you got to balance all of that out so
you can use that because that actually

685
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:04,700
fucking works unless you heats up too
high and your meats too thick and then you

686
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:08,150
think it's well done and all you
did was Chad the outside and inside.

687
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:13,150
It's a fucking Friday the 13th so I'm
going to do that and have myself a tasty

688
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:18,680
fucking burger before
anybody even arrives.

689
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,120
I'm going to have my timer. I'm going to
adjust my fucking heat and I'm going to,

690
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm going to be ready for fucking
Freddy. You know what I mean? That's,

691
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:31,340
that's my deal here. Okay? That's how I'm
doing it and I'm going simple this year.

692
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:36,080
Burgers and dogs. Fuck
you, but you don't like it.

693
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:40,040
Get the fuck out this country.
I'm not smoking anything.

694
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,370
I'm not fucking,
I'm not doing any of this bullshit.

695
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,060
Burgers and dogs.
We got potato chips.

696
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,590
We have this standard fucking
condiments, lettuce, tomato,

00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,630

mustard. All right,

698
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,900
now fucking Asian and fused fucking
this already Italian influenced that.

699
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,600
Oh, Billy ballgame. I'm go on the
fucking, I'm going old school.

700
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,220
We got cheese. What kind of cheese you
want. You want the white or the yellow?

701
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,190
We don't have any margin.
We have butter.

702
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:19,810
Yeah,

703

on toast in the buns
unless you tell me otherwise.

704

738
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,500
Shit's probably already on sale.
I don't even know.

739
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,240
Speaking of other things
that I need to promote,

740
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,390
I did a movie last year
called the front row.

741
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,220
Okay.

742
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,850
All right. And, uh,

743
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,660
the trailer starring Hugh Jackman,

744
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,070
the trailers who's already getting Oscar,
Oscar buzz,

745
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,720
he's getting Oscar buzz all freckles. All
right. And I actually made the trailer,

746
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:00,950
um,

747
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,360
you realize how much I'm moving up in
the world that I'm actually in the movie

748
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:09,830
trailer. Now. I'm not saying that
if you drop a piece of popcorn,

749
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,670
you look down and kick it under the seat
in front of you that you won't miss me

750
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:14,420
in the trailer.

751
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,420
I'm just saying that I am in it for a
hot second with one of the best actors of

752
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:26,090
today who is getting Oscar
Buzz repeat Oscar buzz.

753
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,750
Um, this weekend I'm going to be in, um,

754
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,330
some casino north of,
uh,

755
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,070
the hell is it Sacramento.

756
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:43,190
And then the next day on going to the
Toronto Film Festival for the Premiere of

757
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:48,020
the Front runner starring Hugh Jackman,
who's getting Oscar buzz.

758
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,320
Okay. And then, um, and, and, and,

759
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,430
and the movie was directed by the
Great Jason Reitman, by the way,

760
00:46:57,431 --> 00:47:00,670
if you want to fucking win an Oscar.
Okay.

761
00:47:00,671 --> 00:47:04,750
It's starting to become
work with old freckles here.

762
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,040
All right.
We had to Oscar winners last year,

763
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,420
two or three from,
fromF is for family.

764
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,300
Fucking Sam Rockwell one
it Allison Janney won it.

765
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,220
I think Laura dern guy like a golden
globe. I don't watch award shows. Okay.

766
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,140
I don't have time. I'm busy focusing on
things that don't matter like sports.

767
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,600
Um,
and now we'll look what happens.

768
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:39,220
I have about seven lines in this movie
and all of a sudden, not coincidentally,

769
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,140
Hugh Jackman is now nominated or no,

770
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:48,790
he's getting Oscar buzz I should
say. Okay. And why is that?

771
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,080
Because he's unbelievably talented
because he puts the work in because he's a

772
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:57,490
pro maybe, maybe, but I think

773
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,363
more so

774
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:06,820
is that he had half a scene with
me. I think that's what it is. See,

775
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:11,821
once I go in the scene and they see what
I look like and where my acting is heck

776
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,450
at right. I almost said Hack
and act at the same time,

777
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,340
then whatever you're doing as the other
actor is just going to be so fucking

778
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:25,240
elevated, then all of a sudden you're, you
know, you're going to be in the running.

779
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,130
Okay. And that's what I bring
to Hollywood. All right,

780
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:34,390
put your box everybody and the all
things comedy festival. Oh, by the way,

781
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:38,890
congratulations to a Jason Reitman Ntu
Jackman for getting all this great and

782
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:40,720
everybody else sits in the fucking movie,
you know,

783
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,420
forgetting all this awesome reviews,

784
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:47,800
which is a very hard thing to do this
day in age with all the cuts out there in

785
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:48,190
the Internet.

786
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,910
It's really difficult to try and
get some sort of positive feedback.

787
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:57,130
Um, and I'm, I'm just happy just to be a
small part of it. You know what I mean?

788
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,940
I'm like, Bill Walton, when he joined
the Celtics, okay, my feet are fucked up.

789
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:01,930
I'm just happy,
you know,

790
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:04,600
every once in a while throw it to
me and I'll get a couple of points.

791
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,600
The crowd would go nuts because I
am on the scoring sheet that that's,

792
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,260
that's where I'm at. Put your box pork
at the all things comedy festival.

793
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:15,790
Hey Bill, huge fan. Just
riding into, thank you for
the butcher block. Block plug.

794
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,900
I'll listen to this. This dude tried the
pork chop that I've been raving about.

795
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:23,920
The heritage bread. Fucking pork. Okay.

796
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:25,540
You talk about the pork chops.

797
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,910
You talked about the pork
chops and how great they were,

798
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:31,960
so I had to get my hands on them.
My wife, who is an amazing cook,

799
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,320
seasoned these chops so well.
I have to share it with you.

800
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,650
She put extra virgin olive oil
on them and salt and pepper.

801
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,760
Then let them rest for like 45 minutes.
Look at that.

802
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:45,490
I mean that's about as standard
of rub as you could possibly get.

803
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,480
That's all you have to do.
About a half a teaspoon per chop.

804
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,490
Then she just cooked them in
the oven for like 25 minutes.

805
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:59,230
You said the over cook them in the
over for like 20 to 25 minutes.

806
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:01,120
I'm assuming that meant of it bill.

807
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:05,930
It was the best God damn pork chop
I ever had. I fucking told jump.

808
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:12,060
He goes, when you get a cheat
day, uh, try that recipe. Uh,

809
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,740
thanks again. Can't wait to
see you in Phoenix in October.

810
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:18,390
So I guess the tickets
are already on sale. Um,

811
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,590
yeah guys,
I'm telling you man,

812
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,300
who fucking knew that there was a
pure bred fucking pig out there,

813
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,890
which blood can be traced back
to the original white people,

814
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,330
the Oji whities over there in
Europe. Um, I'm telling you,

815
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,450
I did my differently.
I took out a black skillet and uh,

816
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:44,900
I got that heat going right? And
I just, I, I forget what I, I,

817
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,880
I don't even know what I
put on the fucking thing.

818
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,590
I probably didn't know in me German,
Irish guy that I am, I see both sides.

819
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,400
And then I finished it in the oven and
then I brought it out and I did a like a

820
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:58,770
rosemary, a butter Beth. Oh,

821
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,530
I mean, I didn't even need a fucking
side. Who's every bite I took?

822
00:51:05,531 --> 00:51:09,830
I was just punching the
fucking table. It was, it's,

823
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,790
it's that fucking good. All right.
If you're a kind of war there,

824
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,280
you got to get the fucking
heritage bread point.

825
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,980
They're not even paying me for this.
This is how fucking good is all right.

826
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,030
Urban mayor,

827
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,890
although that's a real slick way to get
some fucking advertising in for free.

828
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,870
Be Somebody that fucking writes
in with their own experience. Uh,

829
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,950
urban Meyer or mayor, how it's
spelled. Is that John Mayer,

830
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:36,990
but it's urban Meyer.
Is it John Meyer? Hey,

831
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:38,190
Billy Beluga whale.

832
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,020
What are your thoughts about
urban Meyer and the Osu scandal?

833
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,320
Do you think he should have been fired?
Oh, you know, I stopped following it.

834
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,090
Fired over that. What the fuck
was this? Is this jerseys again?

835
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:55,580
Urban mayor fired reason layer.
We go bump,

836
00:51:55,581 --> 00:52:00,350
bump, bump, Palm Bodo.
Why is urban Meyer, uh,

837
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:05,060
he's suspended. It doesn't
say, oh, he's not fired.

838
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:08,160
He suspended.
I'm going to say Jason Lie ahead.

839
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:12,080
What had been fucking tweeting all in
capitals at, at the whole fucking world.

840
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:16,340
Maybe he was. Why is urban
wires suspended? Here's the
short and the long answer.

841
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,990
I'll state suspended urban Meyer,
uh,

842
00:52:20,991 --> 00:52:24,890
for the first three games
of Ohio state's 2018 season.

843
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:28,310
Who the fuck are they
playing? Fuck, had you, is it,

844
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:32,450
this is the non suspension suspension
is misses the Buckeye season opener

845
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:36,500
against Oregon state a likely
blowout win four weeks,

846
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:38,270
two and three against Rutgers.

847
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:42,860
Another likely blowout win and Tcu
a tougher game and a trip to Texas.

848
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,970
Tcu is kind of fell off
while we won't happen at Tcu.

849
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,100
Come up from a mayor.

850
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:53,150
Can coach during the week before
sitting out the game itself or offensive

851
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:56,720
coordinator? Ryan Day is acting head
coach while Meijer is out. Yeah.

852
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:59,330
And he has a headset on the whole game.
Gee,

853
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,730
who the fuck he think he's talking to?
Uh,

854
00:53:01,731 --> 00:53:04,700
the short reason for the
head coaches suspension, uh,

855
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:09,080
school commission investigation decided
he mishandled domestic abuse allegations

856
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:13,850
against his former receiver's coach Zach
Smith. Oh, this is a little more serious,

857
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:15,530
but they didn't think,
is it bill?

858
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:18,320
Is it a little more serious than fucking
players selling their own jerseys?

859
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,120
But they didn't think mayors conduct
was egregious enough to merit firing.

860
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:27,260
One of the most successful coaches
in college history. Subtext. A,

861
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:31,400
it was only one broad. All right. We got
a national championship with this guy.

862
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,000
A below is the longer reason or
recap for the details. Smiths.

863
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:39,680
Now ex wife Courtney Smith has repeatedly
accused them of domestic violence

864
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:44,681
going back to 2009 so how does
this fall on on urban Meyer Meyer,

865
00:53:44,751 --> 00:53:46,620
he supposed to be a fucking cop too.

866
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,880
In 2009 Zach Smith,

867
00:53:49,881 --> 00:53:52,400
then a staffer under Meyer at Florida,

868
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,360
went to a party at Meyer's house.
Smith came home with a woman,

869
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:00,470
coworker who had been drinking and
planned to have her stay on Smith's couch

870
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,200
according to investigation. All right.
It sounds like a standard party.

871
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,480
They said Courtney Smith strenuously
objected and drove the woman to her home

872
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,700
that began a disagreement,

873
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,780
coordinate called nine one one and alleged
that Zack picked her up and threw her

874
00:54:15,981 --> 00:54:17,060
against the wall.

875
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,560
Police arrested Zach for Acra aggravated
battery and later dropped the charge.

876
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:26,600
Meyer says Zack and Courtney met with
them at his Florida office and told him

877
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:31,190
Zach's arrest was based on false
information. Courtney gave to the police.

878
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,201
Yeah.
In other words,

879
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:36,920
she told the fucking truth and then when
they fucking sobered up or calm down,

880
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:40,040
they were like, this could cost us
a lot of money. Don't do it again.

881
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,300
And we'll say that I lied.

882
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:46,810
Courtney denies that she attended that
meeting and Zach also recalled a to Osu

883
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:52,160
investigators that she wasn't there.
Okay.

884
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:55,940
So he sounds like he's lying,
uh, to the investigative team.

885
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:58,610
Courtney Smith denied
recanting her allegations.

886
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:02,990
She has never walked back any
allegations in public interviews either.

887
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,583
All right.

888
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,900
No charges were ultimately filed
against Zach for the 2009 incident.

889
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,120
Uh, yeah, cause they were working for
a big university when Meyer, well,

890
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,750
how does this go on urban Meyer?

891
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:19,990
Mayor Meyer hired him at Ohio state in
2011 a university background check didn't

892
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:22,280
turn up and arrest.

893
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,820
Meyer didn't tell anyone else at Ohio
state about it because he told Invesco

894
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:29,000
charges weren't filed and he didn't
think Zach had actually committed any

895
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:32,860
domestic violence between October
and November, 2050. And what,

896
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:36,980
what's the show that he even saw the shit,
uh,

897
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,230
in October and November,
2015 police twice went to court.

898
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,510
He's home to investigate abuse
allegations against Zach to this one.

899
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:48,280
These deals with, it's like, well you
just fucking break up already. Um,

900
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,410
that year Courtney texted with
Mayor's wife Shelly about Zach.

901
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:55,620
Shelly expressed sympathy and fear
for Courtney and her own message.

902
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:56,610
And Courtney has said,

903
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:01,530
Shelley told her she'd informed the
head coach about Courtney's allegations.

904
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:07,050
Yeah, but she could have been
lying. You know, both mayor

905
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,240
Meyer maintain to Osu investigators that
Shelly never did inform urban about the

906
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:16,540
text messages. But myra has
acknowledged both in a public statement,

907
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:21,190
early August and two investigators that
he did know of an allegation in 2015

908
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,820
I don't understand. So what, so he
knows about it. So call the fucking cops

909
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,880
like I don't understand
like why this is on

910
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,370
the football fucking program.
They are,

911
00:56:38,371 --> 00:56:41,910
they are not the cops. They are
not judges. They are not juries.

912
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:46,080
This whole fucking thing now where like
the judge and the jury and all of that

913
00:56:46,081 --> 00:56:49,790
shit is now on social media and all
of this shit. It's fucking, I don't,

914
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,670
I don't get this.

915
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:56,520
It's like if he fucking did something
called the cops, the cops go there,

916
00:56:56,521 --> 00:56:59,070
they fucking arrest him and
he fucking goes to jail.

917
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:05,510
I don't understand how the cops go there.
I re candidate. No you didn't. All right.

918
00:57:05,511 --> 00:57:07,160
We dropped the fucking charges,

919
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,670
but then the cops dropped the charges,

920
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,050
but then the school is supposed to
go. No, but you still fucking guilty.

921
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,833
I don't know.

922
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:25,140
I mean, unless he was there
and saw him doing that shit,

923
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:28,440
what the fuck is he supposed to do?
This is why you have cops.

924
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,430
This is why the cops don't
coach a football team. Um,

925
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:38,670
I dunno. I have no idea. I don't,
I don't get that. I get that.

926
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:43,730
If the university fired that guy,
you know,

927
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:49,440
I don't get why urban
mayor Meyer,

928
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,010
why that guy gets dragged into this shit.
I mean,

929
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:57,940
if he was beating the shit out of her
ed at a fucking football practice,

930
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,950
then I guess urban was there going,
hey, settle down. Settle down.

931
00:58:03,951 --> 00:58:08,930
Nothing to see here. And I guess he
implicated himself by that. I mean,

932
00:58:08,931 --> 00:58:09,764
I don't,
you know,

933
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,580
yeah.

934
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,940
I mean, these, these are,
these are fucking adults here.

935
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,830
That guy knows he's not supposed to be
beaten up his fucking wife. He's an adult.

936
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,950
So he should pay the fucking price.
I don't get why this guy has to do now.

937
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,910
You know what I mean? When some gold
digging horror fucking, uh, you know,

938
00:58:26,911 --> 00:58:31,380
take some guy's house. Uh, does she
go to jail? Does she lose her job?

939
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:34,410
Does her friend that knew she was a
gold digging hoard is she then lose her

940
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:39,020
fucking position in the fucking
world? I don't get just, it's just,

941
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,650
it's just like,
it's a fucking one side street here.

942
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:47,610
If a guy does something to a
woman that he shouldn't be doing,

943
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,400
not only is he going to get punished now
everybody around them is going to get

944
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:53,940
fucking punished. But if a woman does
something to a guy, eh, it's all right.

945
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,350
Everything's fucking fine. It's
fucking bullshit. That's what I say.

946
00:58:58,351 --> 00:58:59,670
I think it's fucking bullshit.

947
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,310
If they are doing this on both
sides of the fucking fence,

948
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,520
if you could somehow prove that this
guy actually fucking knew this shit.

949
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,390
Granted, I'm just going off of
one website here. All right.

950
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,580
From what I read on the Internet,
which doesn't mean shit. Now,

951
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:15,330
what do you guys asked me these fucking
questions. All right, dancing. Hey Bill.

952
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:17,430
I'm a 16 year old kid from Minnesota,

953
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:21,390
Minnesota and I'm starting my
junior year in high school week.

954
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,510
I'm not a loser and I'm not the coolest
kid either. I'm right. Yeah, there you go.

955
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,710
You're in the mill.
That's where I was.

956
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,860
I feel like I'm being held
back by my inability to dance.

957
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,570
What do you go to fame high school.
It's not that I don't have rhythm.

958
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:34,680
I play three instruments.

959
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:37,950
My Band leader told me to dance
like I was playing an instruments.

960
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,210
The problem is I never know what to do
with my hands and it can't exactly be

961
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:46,560
playing air sacks at dances this year.
I really don't care that much.

962
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:51,150
It's just that I know I can dance,
but I haven't figured out moves yet all.

963
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:52,740
Then start dancing there buddy.

964
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:54,060
Okay,

965
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,610
go on the fucking Internet.
I'll go on the Internet right now.

966
00:59:56,611 --> 01:00:01,611
Find you a fucking video and then practice
by yourself and do it in the mirror

967
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:06,360
like the chicks do, right?
All right. You Tube, you tube,

968
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:10,530
you can dance to. All right. Search.

969
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:11,890
Okay.

970
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:16,890
Basic dance moves to not look stupid.

971
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,880
I just felt stupid with an e at the end.
What the stupid.

972
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:25,570
How to dance with confidence.
Not Look like a Dork.

973
01:00:25,571 --> 01:00:28,990
And I gotta tell you this
Guy Club dance moves for men.

How to not look stiff and
awkward. Bam. There you go.

975
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,293
Here we go.

976
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:39,300
A three minute video after this fucking
stupid God damn guide tells me about

977
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:41,960
great nuts standing on
a fucking mountain does.

978
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:46,480
I'm always just started running naked.
How to dance for men.

979
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,750
It's an Asian kid with the cool hat. You
know he's going to be good. There you go.

980
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:56,350
Bam. The name of this video
is club dance moves for men.

981
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,200
How to not look stiff and awkward
for beginner. All right dude,

982
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:03,880
I found that in two fucking sec. Second.
So right. There you go. There you go.

983
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,743
You're in.

984
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,490
So just fucking do that for a while
till it's second God damn nature.

985
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,150
Put a little stank on your face and uh,
you know,

986
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,340
pump up fucking couple of
drinks in yourself. Now. I
know you're under age. Uh,

987
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:23,770
you'll be fine. You'll be fine.
Just do it. Learn how to, how,

988
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:28,390
how did you learn how to get
good at saxophone? Did you
sit there going, you know,

989
01:01:28,391 --> 01:01:31,180
I know I can play saxophone, but you
never did it. Just go out and do it.

990
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:35,740
You'll be fine. All right,
Solo. Fucking dear bill.

991
01:01:35,741 --> 01:01:40,150
This old house. I'm a home owner
like yourself and like yourself.

992
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,990
I looked into solar power.
Hey Dude, not for nothing.

993
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,600
I want to be a contact or do you
have you paid off your house?

994
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,450
Cause he'd be haven't paid off your
house. You're not a homeowner. All right.

995
01:01:49,451 --> 01:01:53,600
What you own is the debt on the house.
Okay. I hate when people go, oh, you,

996
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:56,800
you ran home. I am. No,
you dumb. You don't know.

997
01:01:56,801 --> 01:01:58,240
You don't own it until I give it to you.

998
01:01:58,241 --> 01:02:03,220
That did fucking God damn piece of
paper. Sorry. And like yourself.

999
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:05,170
I looked into solar power bill.

1000
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:09,070
When I tell you I spent over 200 hours
reading up on solar and talking to

1001
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:10,840
different installers on
telling you the truth.

1002
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:13,870
I had zero luck finding
anything that made sense. Yeah.

1003
01:02:13,871 --> 01:02:15,850
I think there's a lot of taxes and shit.

1004
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,950
There's a lot of oil and coal kind
of jockeying against that shit. Um,

1005
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,370
the more research I did,
the more discouraged I got.

1006
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,640
I went in thinking there was no way I
wouldn't come out with some type of solar

1007
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:28,820
panel subsidizing the energy I use.
Yeah.

1008
01:02:28,821 --> 01:02:30,530
Now they do this thing
where the electric company,

1009
01:02:30,531 --> 01:02:31,930
they used to buy back your power.

1010
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:36,260
Now they just claim the shit that you
don't even use. Um, I hate to be cynical,

1011
01:02:36,261 --> 01:02:39,350
but I feel like solar is useless
till the technology gets better.

1012
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,590
I don't know if you've ever
followed through, but I was
hoping to get an update.

1013
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:46,140
Um, I don't think it's
useless. I understand. Um,

1014
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,450
anything that is going to help us
slow down fucking global warming.

1015
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:52,140
Okay.

1016
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,140
Is going to be an asset if you can't
afford to do it. I understand. Um,

1017
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:59,040
I have not done it yet.
Um,

1018
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,200
I keep telling my wife I want
to do and she's just like,

1019
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:05,850
this is going to be loud.
And then it's just like, you
know, I would love to do it.

1020
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,020
I have some Spanish style,
not are on all the whole roof.

1021
01:03:10,021 --> 01:03:13,080
My roof is flat and then there's
little lip of Spanish tiles,

1022
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:18,030
but like a Tesla is allegedly
coming out with those,

1023
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:22,680
those Spanish tiles that
are also solar powered. Um,

1024
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:27,360
I mean that fucking guy is like actually
addressing what's going on and I wish

1025
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:31,350
there was a way that he could fucking
hire coal miners to fucking work in the

1026
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:35,550
solar industry so they didn't have to
take away 30% of our beautiful public

1027
01:03:35,551 --> 01:03:40,551
parks to continue using this fucking
form of energy that is fucking with the

1028
01:03:40,861 --> 01:03:43,920
planet. That for some reason you're
not allowed to bring it up. If you do,

1029
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:45,330
you're crying snowflake.

1030
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,293
MMM,

1031
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,020
I dunno.
It's

1032
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,453
okay.

1033
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,860
I have no idea. And I have not write up
as nearly as much as you have a, I have,

1034
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:01,200
I have not even overheard as much
as you've probably read on it. Um,

1035
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:05,280
I'll read up on it. I should do
it. I would love to do it. Um,

1036
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:10,400
you know, but I just, every time
I fucking go to do something,

1037
01:04:10,401 --> 01:04:11,660
I'd fucking something in my house.

1038
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,050
I only tell you guys what I'm
fucking dealing with right now.

1039
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,400
I don't even want to fuck on failure.
What on the fucking deal with them. Uh,

1040
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:23,260
have you ever heard a
roof? Rats, roof rats?

1041
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,810
Uh,
evidently we somehow,

1042
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:29,620
some way we have a crawl space between
our roof and you know, you can't stand up,

1043
01:04:29,621 --> 01:04:33,130
but it was enough that these
fucking mice get up there and I,

1044
01:04:33,131 --> 01:04:35,350
we have an exterminator come up there.
You know,

1045
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:36,910
God knows what they did in the walls.

1046
01:04:36,911 --> 01:04:40,960
Thank God they didn't chew through
any fucking wires. And, uh, you know,

1047
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:44,320
so then I got to go up there and,
you know, get rid of the dead mice.

1048
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:48,550
Okay.

1049
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:52,470
That's my life. Okay.
Sobriety. Hey Billy Bama set.

1050
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,360
Yeah,

1051
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,450
I'm a 27 year old male and I just wanted
to truly say thank you for helping me

1052
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,600
onto the wagon of sobriety.
Forget the past few months,

1053
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:02,690
every since he started listening to your
podcasts and have heard you bitch and

1054
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:04,880
moan the whole time about
being sober from drinking.

1055
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:09,320
This made me think to myself, hey, if
this can, this can can do it. So can I.

1056
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,770
It's been a few weeks now and I've been
clean from drugs and alcohol and I've

1057
01:05:12,771 --> 01:05:16,700
never felt better. Yeah, it was
fucking amazing. Not living a clean,

1058
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,680
I mean at night it sucks.
That's when you get squirrely.

1059
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:24,820
But if you just fucking push through
it and you wake up in the morning stone

1060
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:27,910
sober, it's, it's like you feel
like you've compared to, you know,

1061
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:31,810
being hung over and shit. And I never
even fucked with drugs other than alcohol,

1062
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:34,340
which is a drug in all fairness.
Um,

1063
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,970
you feel like an eight year
old when you wake up. He says,

1064
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,730
I don't have friends because
they're dead beat drug addict,

1065
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:41,630
losers every day at my job I list,

1066
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,260
I literally listened to eight hours
of the podcasts a day. Um, see,

1067
01:05:46,261 --> 01:05:49,480
see you're learning how to take your
addictive personality and it had been

1068
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:51,310
pointing it at shit that's more positive.

1069
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:53,380
Hopefully this positive
is more pod positive.

1070
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:57,100
So in a sense you're my only
friends so thanks for that as well.

1071
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,220
Thanks for helping me through these
trying times and I really look forward to

1072
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:04,300
maybe seeing your set at one of your
Chicago shows in November. Hey, you know,

1073
01:06:04,301 --> 01:06:07,630
I was hanging out Friday night with a
buddy of mine who's been sober for nine

1074
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:11,410
months and he just wanted to do it
for a month, but just after a month,

1075
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:12,790
all this shit that
you've been putting off,

1076
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:14,590
all of a sudden he started
getting shit done. He said,

1077
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:17,620
I'm going to go two months and
now he's just staying sober.

1078
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:21,900
He was saying just start a superstition
that I don't want to go back to that.

1079
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,790
And,
um,

1080
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,461
that's a great thing.

1081
01:06:25,461 --> 01:06:30,260
So I'm going to try to go September
without drinking today. I have,

1082
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:30,741
I have,

1083
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:35,741
my big cheat thing is I have a glass
bottle of grape phanta that I am going to

1084
01:06:38,121 --> 01:06:43,100
have, um, with my burger and then I'm
right back on the wagon, but a pretty,

1085
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,120
but I'm going to be eaten,

1086
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:45,963
you know,

1087
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:49,480
eating healthy the rest day.
I hate that when people say I'm eating,

1088
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:50,630
I've been eating clean,

1089
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:53,380
you know,

1090
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,360
I like, I, I just, I don't like that.

1091
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,280
Okay.

1092
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,800
Yeah. You know, just clean
eating, but eating clean.

1093
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,410
It's like you don't even know
what the fuck you're reading.

1094
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:05,950
I go to these farmer's markets and you
have no idea where this shit came from.

1095
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,340
Okay.

1096
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,360
There's nobody down there play.

1097
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:11,750
I've heard like the FDA basically
polices like 3% of the food.

1098
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:13,730
You have no idea where
the fuck it came from.

1099
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:15,280
Okay.

1100
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,450
You have no fucking idea.

1101
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,360
You have no idea what it's been
sprayed with and all of that shit.

1102
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:22,960
But it says organic and it gets in your
fucking hair. UHMM Leeton fucking clean.

1103
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:25,630
You have no fucking idea
unless you grew it yourself.

1104
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:29,340
Um, dilemma. Um,

1105
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,340
all right,
dear Billy Brown belt.

1106
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:32,510
Okay.

1107
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:35,750
Would you rather be forced to eat protein
bars every meal for the rest of your

1108
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,900
life or eat one meal every four days?

1109
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:41,650
MMM.

1110
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:43,240
Can I survive?

1111
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,760
Can I survive eating one
meal every four days?

1112
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,190
Okay.

1113
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,720
I don't know if he could
survive doing that,

1114
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,000
man.
That's a good one.

1115
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:55,940
No,
I'd rather you one meal every four days.

1116
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:58,250
I think it would be more healthy than
those protein bars cause you don't know

1117
01:07:58,251 --> 01:07:59,480
what the fuck's in those things either.

1118
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:02,930
You mean you flip that thing over like a
Django anyway. Thanks. Fucking overrated.

1119
01:08:02,931 --> 01:08:04,040
GNC.

1120
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,030
Okay.

1121
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:09,170
All those powdered fucking
chemicals like that Maca powder.

1122
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:11,450
Every time I put that in there and go,
what the fuck is this shit?

1123
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:13,783
You know,

1124
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:16,240
plant based protein powder

1125
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:21,070
and all that. It's Cisco. We'll go
eat a fucking plant. Um, anyways,

1126
01:08:21,071 --> 01:08:24,040
number two. All right.
Now that dilemma. Um,

1127
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,780
I wouldn't want to be Billy Clif
bar for the rest of my fucking life

1128
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:34,180
cause once every four
days I could actually, uh,

1129
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,780
yeah,

1130
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,310
I could actually have
something that I liked.

1131
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:45,050
Beto chicken and dumplings, some shit
like that. Something really fancy. Let me,

1132
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,000
there'll be like having a death
row fucking meal every four days.

1133
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,300
Yeah, that would be
tremendous. Um, as long as you,

1134
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:55,700
I could do that in a healthy
way. Yeah, I would do that.

1135
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,750
You get used to that quick. Um,
number two, you're going to die,

1136
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:05,010
but you can save your life if
you succeed at one of two things,

1137
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,980
which do you have more
confidence in doing successfully?

1138
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,420
Having one year to study and get a
perfect score on the sats. Fuck that.

1139
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:16,050
Or come in first place
in a game of monopoly.

1140
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,350
I have one year to come in,
first place in a game of monopoly.

1141
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:25,780
How many games can I play?
Um,

1142
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,700
is it a monopoly tournament?

1143
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,310
My plane with a bunch of old ladies that
have been playing it since the fucking

1144
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:33,340
depression and they're going
to kick my ass. All right.

1145
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:37,120
Having one year to study and get a perfect
score on the sats. You know what, Dude,

1146
01:09:37,121 --> 01:09:39,010
I would love to try to do that.

1147
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:40,700
Okay.

1148
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,940
And it would take me way more than a year
with the math.

1149
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:49,520
Um, all I know is that
I took a college, uh,

1150
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:54,270
sat prep course and I still got,

1151
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,340
I got a three something combined.

1152
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:02,150
I'm not even fucking lying to you
guys. Like I, that sounds like a joke,

1153
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:05,750
but I mean an Uber, you can
do the two porches to signing
the paper. Yeah, I know.

1154
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:07,733
I know.

1155
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:14,430
I forget what I got. I got, did I get
a four, 10 or a three 90? It was bad.

1156
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:17,100
And I remember getting
laughs at my sat score.

1157
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:19,723
Yeah.

1158
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,650
That's how, you know,
that's how I always say no,

1159
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:27,210
he's fucking made fun of myself and I,
and I got laughs so I actually,

1160
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:28,520
okay.

1161
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,790
I remember I didn't give a shit.
I never gave a shit.

1162
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:34,050
I always kind of always kind of had
this feeling that I was going to do all

1163
01:10:34,051 --> 01:10:37,010
right in life.
You know,

1164
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,510
I had an overall positive outlook
despite everything that I was doing.

1165
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:44,570
You don't have two years of a language.
Yeah.

1166
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:49,160
He all his fucking stupid shit.
You know what I mean?

1167
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:53,630
That's not a, life is not
about those things. All right?

1168
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,250
I'm not saying don't try,

1169
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,890
don't fucking try to do well on
the thing and all of that shit.

1170
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:00,970
I'm not fucking saying that.
Well, what are you saying, bill?

1171
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,720
I'm just saying there's, there's a
million ways to skin a cat. Okay.

1172
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:10,580
How the fuck did that come about?
Huh? I will look that one up.

1173
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,930
It's more than one to skin a cat.
Right?

1174
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,080
There's more than one
way to skin a cat origin

1175
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:27,710
and early appearance is in
way down east to Jesus Christ.

1176
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,220
Okay.

1177
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:32,770
What, what, what? Okay.
Etymology of the phrase, this
more one. More than one. Which,

1178
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,900
you know, so many times when you look
these up, it's just not satisfying.

1179
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,580
Okay.

1180
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,413
MMM.

1181
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:45,200
So there's actually only two ways to
skin a cat while it's alive or while it's

1182
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:49,040
dead. Well, I mean,

1183
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:52,070
you could also start at the head.
You could start at the back.

1184
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:55,370
Didn't want to say the ass.
There are two ways. One,

1185
01:11:56,450 --> 01:12:00,890
one of them is you skin a cat
cause you are a bad person.

1186
01:12:00,891 --> 01:12:03,830
The other is you don't skin a cat.
You are a nice

1187
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,220
yeah.

1188
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,890
Or the cat never existed.
The third one,

1189
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:12,720
weight is both you skin a cat and
at the same time you don't skin it.

1190
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,180
Okay.
This is just people writing.

1191
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,470
I find your use of boiled down
in this context disturbing.

1192
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:23,310
You knew this would, this would bring
out all the fucking animal lovers, right?

1193
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:28,170
Let's see if there's any comments from the
fucking Peta people, Peta people, Peta,

1194
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:28,980
Peta people.

1195
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,910
There's more than one way to skin a cat
is not referring to the removal of flesh

1196
01:12:32,911 --> 01:12:34,200
from our feline friends,

1197
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:38,730
but rather a phrase that originated
from the Mississippi River region that

1198
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:42,600
pertains to the preparation of a catfish.

1199
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:43,470
Okay.

1200
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:45,220
Oh,

1201
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:47,803
okay.

1202
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,770
Oh

1203
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:54,800
well maybe that's what it is. I have
no idea. I don't fucking know. Anyways,

1204
01:12:55,790 --> 01:13:00,740
that's the podcast.
Happy Labor Day to y'all.

1205
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,350
Happy Labor Day to you.
Woo.

1206
01:13:03,351 --> 01:13:08,351

in on you this Thursday.

1207
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,380

01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:14,060
