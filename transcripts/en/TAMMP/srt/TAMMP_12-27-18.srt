1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,100
Hey, what's going on? This
fucking damn thing. I, you know,

2
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:11,240
I ordered the stupid part. I swear
to God. I'm picking it up today.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,550
God dammit. Let me hold it on to it
like a terrorist for the last time. Hey,

4
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:20,540
what's going on? It's Bellbird is
time for the Thursday afternoon.

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:25,240
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Dan. Ah,

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,700
just checking in on you.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,870
How the fuck was your God damn Christmas.

8
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:37,490
Why is this wire all fucked up?
God fucking dammit.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,350
I swear to Christ. I said this was the
last fucking time I was doing this.

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,600
Did Not.
It was not what I said.

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,383
Okay.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:47,761
You know,

13
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:52,480
it's really fucking amazing
is the abilities for wires
to just get off fucking

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,870
hard. If you look at it, it's
like, how did that happen?

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,020
How the fuck did this whole fucking
thing go down like this? The headphones.

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,540
The fucking headphones.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,140
All right. Hang in there.
For Fuck's sakes. Yeah.

18
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,820
You feel better because
I'm losing my shit.

19
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:14,620
Does that make you feel better about your
fucking cubicle dwell and fucking lie?

20
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:15,670
Well,
I hope it does.

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,050
I hope it does because I'm all about
the positive vibes in the two to the one

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,190
MSI, Tory 19. Um,

23
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,820
how are you?
Did you have,

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,880
hey,

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,430
merry little Christmas.

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,960
Did you get through it without arguing?
I forgot to give you guys a pep top.

27
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:40,470
Don't take the fucking bait.
All right?

28
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,160
If one of you have siblings is a Trump
supporter or they're a fucking liberal

29
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:52,161
Larry or their there
centrist centrus Susan

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,790
never picked the side.

31
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,710
Jesus Christ.
Only fucking person

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,070
I know could be a serial
killer and be like, wow,

33
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,620
I guess I can understand
why you need to feed.

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,080
Oh yeah. Really talked to me. When
you end up in a trunk, Susan. Um,

35
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,430
there's no reason to do that. There's
no reason to do it because the gear,

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,130
you're not going to get what you want,

37
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:21,890
which is the satisfaction
of the other person going,

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,530
oh my God,

39
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,050
I never realized how right you are.

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,320
It wasn't until you called me a closed
minded fuck head that I just stopped and

41
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,090
paused and was like,
wait a minute.

42
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,690
Okay.

43
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,370
Am I close my eyes and my
cousin, I, you're a fucking,

44
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,890
you're a fucking believe what Cath
candidate comic. Cause my fac hair.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,010
Yeah. And Christmas, it's like, Hello

46
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,060
Colin. You stocking much. You
know what? I fucking can't stand.

47
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't stand when new speak comes out.

48
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,140
Okay.

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,830
I get it. Back in the day, you know when
we were cave men walking around like, oh,

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
ah,
ah,

51
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,100
doing that shit. You know, you had
to come up with some fucking words

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
so you wouldn't like be asking for,
you know,

53
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,090
some water but yet sound like you were

54
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,080
going off.
Ha ha ha.

55
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,020
Ah, that's the noises I make. Um, it's
why I do at my garage. I don't want to

56
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,850
while there anybody,
no.

57
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,030
And I also understand it if
something new comes along.

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,460
Yeah.

59
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,293
You know?

60
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,120
Yeah.

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,580
Like an iPod.
What were you supposed to call it?

62
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,340
Okay.

63
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,450
A little stereo. I don't fucking
know. Right. I understand those words.

64
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,130
I just hate when new fucking words come
around and then everybody just starts

65
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:52,990
fucking saying them.
It drives me up the fucking wall.

66
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:56,540
Especially like on Twitter
when there's the new uh,

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,270
or Instagram.

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,500
Okay.

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,250
And, and they just come when they
go, remember the for a while,

70
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,550
like when you posted something,
someone will just go this,

71
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,703
you know?

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,710
Yeah.

73
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,200
And then with what? Some other,
that's stupid shit out there.

74
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,420
I can't fucking stand. Just drives
me up. It's so fucking under rich.

75
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,090
I just had somebody give me shit saying
something I tweeted wasn't funny and

76
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:23,850
they used the Gif. It's,
and I brought the guy back.

77
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,850
At least I'm fucking right in my
own jokes. You're fucking hack.

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,220
Someone had to like fucking think of a
funny response to my unfunny joke for you

79
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,250
with a little video on it.
And now you feel like you're clever.

80
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,100
I just drives me. What the fuck, you know?

81
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,170
Okay.

82
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,300
I just got back into working out.
Right.

83
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,550
Fucking if I hear one more fucking young,
cause I got those, those TRX bands.

84
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,760
Yeah.

85
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,690
All right. If I hear one more dose,
tell me that I'm engaging my core.

86
00:04:55,691 --> 00:05:00,500
He made working my abs.
You fake Tan cunt.

87
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,070
Okay.

88
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,580
And what's great about these is
you're always a little off balance.

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,960
You're always engaging your core,
you know, board a plane anymore.

90
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,080
You expedite the boarding process.
Step back like you got to do great.

91
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,840
You're fucking waitress.
Um,

92
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,800
do you guys get that? Put your jackets
to the overhead required me to,

93
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,280
we can expedite the boarding.
Bragg says,

94
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,830
do you want to sound like you
have a fucking law degree?

95
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,430
You're on here for one fucking
reason only and that's cheap airfare.

96
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,150
Stop acting like it was a dream.
I like to travel.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,450
Okay.

98
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,220
I like to wear a uniform.

99
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,920
Yeah.

100
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,390
I like to expedite the boarding
process while engaging my core.

101
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,224
This.

102
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,030
Okay.

103
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,470
Hashtag shaking my head
yes.

104
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,760
You fucking Twitter of question.

105
00:05:56,761 --> 00:06:01,761
How Times have you hashtag shaking my
head and you actually were shaking your

106
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:03,014
head.

107
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,843
Okay.

108
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,631
Okay.
I'm trying to think.

109
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:10,080
Last time I fucking shook my head
and I should probably do it a lot.

110
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,960
It's fun when I try to keep my,
my fucking cool.

111
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,860
I'm driving is fucking guy. Oh my God.
These fucking assholes out here on,

112
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,830
on the highways. The way they pass you on
the right hand side, it's unbelievable.

113
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,890
You can get into the left lane doing
like 40 miles an hour. You, you,

114
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,210
you want to get off the highway,

115
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:31,710
you got to be doing like 120 and you
watch them pass, you can do an 80,

116
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,530
and you look in their lane and there's
a guy a quarter mile away and they're

117
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:36,240
going to have to stop
on the fucking brakes.

118
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,990
I think it's just psychologically
psychological outta here that, that,

119
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:43,530
that there's so much traffic that you
just think to yourself like, you know,

120
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:47,260
anytime there's an open space, you're
like, ah, you just fucking Florida.

121
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,100
Well maybe I'm just that dose shoe has
like the baby on board sign in his head.

122
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,280
I have no idea. Um, but speaking of cars,

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,930
my latest obsession,
but I was going to buy a car right now.

124
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,520
All right? If I was a single
man, if I didn't have a child,

125
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,800
if I had a full head of
hair to flow in the breeze,

126
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,050
I would get the Porsche Targa
the fast one. All right.

127
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,820
In lava orange, she
just liked my pubes. Um,

128
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,910
because I am a child of the 70s,

129
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,950
and she remember that Shit
in Boogie nights when Philip
Seymour Hoffman rest his

130
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:32,370
soul, he's talking to mark
Wahlberg's character. Any,

131
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:37,260
any says how the corvette
is in a competition? Orange.

132
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,230
That was my favorite fucking detail.

133
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,720
Yeah.

134
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,010
Uh,
seventies detail competition orange.

135
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,450
Oh, he didn't wait. He didn't have
one. He had the, he had a, uh, oh no.

136
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,770
Mark Wahlberg's character got the
corvette and competition orange and then

137
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,450
Philip Seymour Hoffman showed up with
like a Datsun two 40 z or something.

138
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,760
Still a decent car. Right. Um,
but it's, it's no corvette.

139
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,160
Um, anyways, I got to see
what that looks like is,

140
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,970
I hope it's not a red orange. I'd
want an orange, orange. You know,

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,630
there's a lot of things right
now it's just like, I don't know,

142
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:21,090
everybody's got to start fucking
with the colors, but that thing,

143
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:24,770
and it's got the automatic
fucking a rooftop.

144
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,460
It was actually Porsche enthusiasts who
are engaging their core when they press

145
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:33,170
the fucking send button
on the youtube comment.

146
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,230
We're complaining actually complaining.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
The old one you did.
You had to,

148
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,910
you had to do it by hand and then fold
up the cloth top and then put it in the

149
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:48,260
bonnet is, they say overseas,
put it under the fucking hood.

150
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,400
Now this one,
you just push a button.

151
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,080
Okay.

152
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,120
The backend lifts up a little bit and then
the top fucking goes down like the ED.

153
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:01,530
It's, it's, it's a fucking work of art and
there's all these cuts, right? And like,

154
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,070
ah, leave it to the Germans
to take something really
simple and make it a fucking

155
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:06,510
what?
Make it fucking perfect.

156
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,360
Yeah.

157
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,780
Someone's like going, I would be
concerned if I, there were so many could,

158
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:15,650
but behind me, I mean, that comes a
good two feet up behind the car. Well,

159
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:18,230
they fucking pull up the tires,

160
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:20,810
do one rotation and then push your button.

161
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm amazed that when they designed this,
are you amazed

162
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,140
the fuck are you ever designed?
Oh, why am I in such a mood?

163
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:38,860
You know what? I just, I had a bad night's
sleep. I had this dream that I was,

164
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,390
I was playing the Wilma theater in Boston,

165
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:48,060
Massachusetts. One of my favorite
promoters out there, Bill Bloom and Reich,

166
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,740
he was in my dream and he
was talking the way right.

167
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,190
Talks to him. Right Bro? I saw that
article I wrote about your word. You,

168
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,530
you're really shared some
mean things about mers.

169
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,920
I was like, are we talking about, I
would never say mean things about you.

170
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:01,560
I love you.

171
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,380
No,
just kind of car came off a little mean.

172
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,140
So I felt like an asshole.
Like however I was joking about him,

173
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,390
somebody it came off
his fucking main site,

174
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:16,050
apologized to him and
then I go out on stage.

175
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,360
Okay.

176
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,360
This was a stress dream cause I hadn't
been on stage in like five fucking days.

177
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,700
Uh,
and I got this European tour coming up.

178
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:28,550
So I just booked myself with the
comedy store starting last night,

179
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:32,180
right through Sunday. Just going
to do as much stage time as I can.

180
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:36,200
And I had a great set last night.
I Dunno. It's just, I think, uh,

181
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,660
you know,
I just know I got a fucking,

182
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:41,840
I needed to do all these nights and
then I'll then I'll be fine when I go to

183
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,710
Europe,
but whatever.

184
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,923
MMM.

185
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,950
So I go out on stage in my dream on the
Wilbur theater and if for some reason

186
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,880
it's like six stories in the air,
six stories up,

187
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,420
and there's people way down
below who clearly can't see me.

188
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:01,700
And I feel like I have to
walk to the edge of the stage,

189
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:05,870
but I don't want to fall down and I'm
making fun of it and nobody's laughing.

190
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm just bombing. And for some
reason I'm on eye level, um,

191
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,530
with the six story balcony level and
they're just staring at me and I'm not

192
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:16,364
doing well.

193
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,680
Yeah.

194
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,000
And then halfway through my set and
there's all these obstructions to like,

195
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm walking and all of a sudden I'm
like behind some giant pole and nobody's

196
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:29,090
laughing. And I'm like, oh my
God, what the fuck am I doing?

197
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,380
And at one point I was laying down on
the stage crawling towards the edge

198
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,830
because it was also really dark.
And I couldn't see how deep it went down.

199
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,770
I dropped the Mike down there,

200
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:45,020
somebody turned on a record player and I
shut it off. And it was just like, hey,

201
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,790
slowed down. Wasn't that song? I
don't know why I just picked that.

202
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,970
Maybe cause I'm a dancing monkey on stage.
I have no fucking idea.

203
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,360
And then halfway through it,

204
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,370
one of the few comics that I don't like
in this business came fucking walking

205
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:06,371
out like the selfish cunt that he or she
is and picked up like a little square

206
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:09,890
fridge that you'd have the when you
lived in like a studio apartment.

207
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,320
Okay.

208
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,470
And I was like, really? And the
person was like, yeah, really?

209
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:18,070
And they just fucking took and started
walking out. And I said the person's name,

210
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,190
I said from the bottom of my heart,
I fucking hate you.

211
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,680
And then I quickly shut up,

212
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:28,260
cause I knew everybody in the crowd was
going to film it. Um, and what's funny is,

213
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,260
is I don't really hate this person in
real life. I just fucking avoid him.

214
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,540
You know?

215
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,810
That's what a great thing about getting
older is you stop hating people.

216
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:41,410
You just sort of like, you avoid them.
Even if you're sitting next to him,

217
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,640
you just mentally avoid them. He
just like, okay, I know who you are,

218
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:48,310
I know how you act and
this is what I expect,

219
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,560
so I'm not going to get upset. I'm just
fucking knocked gauging it, you know?

220
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,640
And uh,

221
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:55,780
okay.

222
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,460
And then somewhere along the line they
turned the lights on and I realized that

223
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:02,020
I wasn't six stories in the air.

224
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,300
Okay.

225
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,000
That the stage was still the
same height it usually was.

226
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,960
And then all of a sudden the
microphone worked and I could start,

227
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,900
okay.

228
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,310
You know, doing my job and
I started killing again. So
maybe the dream was, Bill,

229
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,660
you have an irrational fear about taking
four or five days off from standup.

230
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,640
I will tell you last night I fucking,
uh,

231
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,340
I went on stage and I got this new Bush,
Michelle Obama bit that was bombing,

232
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,020
you know, cause she's so fucking
precious. You know what I mean? I don't,

233
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,010
I don't know why,
out of all the first ladies,

234
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:40,780
every first lady has always been made fun
of her for some fucking reason is like

235
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:45,100
off limits. So you know, as a
comedian something is off limits,

236
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,730
you know, you kind of have to steer
the ship towards it at one point just,

237
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,050
just for the fun of it.
Right.

238
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,120
Okay.

239
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,650
So last night was the first night,

240
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,503
uh,

241
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,580
I started to get that started
to get it to work and um,

242
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,510
I tried a another bit,
you know, about this,

243
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,650
this gay kid,
you know,

244
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,920
parents didn't know she was gay and the
parents were like fucking people that

245
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:16,880
think he can pray away being gay.
Um,

246
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,040
what can you pray away? Oh, I went to
church by the way. I got there late,

247
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,720
you know, I felt bad. I got there,

248
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,040
register fucking guy was starting
his homily and I was like, ah, fuck.

249
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,530
And then part of me was psyched because
I didn't have to sit through the first

250
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:31,364
two readings.

251
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,893
MMM.

252
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,690
And uh, they really switched up the
words a lot. The shit that you say,

253
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:43,200
they switched it up a lot. I was like,
is this like some west coast thing?

254
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,320
My mother in law like Nah, they
kind of changed it up. You know,

255
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,701
he used to be peace,

256
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:54,140
be with you and also with they like
added a bunch of words like peace be with

257
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:55,760
you.
And I uh,

258
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,380
I concur that also and would
wish that upon use to sir.

259
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:04,400
Slash Ma'am you've got to say all that
before you should fucking shake hands

260
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:08,450
with somebody. Um, I dunno,

261
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,590
I haven't been to church in a while.

262
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:12,230
I literally thought my suit was going
to catch on fire when I walked in there.

263
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,200
That's when you know you're
a piece of shit. You know,

264
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,240
you haven't been there in awhile.

265
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,700
You just walk in and you're just thinking
of all this shit God would be saying

266
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:28,120
to you if he really exists and you just
walking in and going, I know, I know.

267
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,070
You know. And then after a while he gets
stubborn and be like, well, you don't do,

268
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,190
you know, technically you made me
so whatever my fucking flaws are,

269
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,910
I know you have this convenient excuse
of the devil. You know what I mean?

270
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,250
I mean, what the fuck? Hey, you know,

271
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:49,920
I made you perfect, but you
listened to the devil. Well,

272
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:51,390
did you make the devil toe?

273
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,710
Okay?

274
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,560
Isn't all of this you're
fucking grand scheme,

275
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,773
right?

276
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,010
I actually, when I look at God that
way, right? If he exist, you know,

277
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:05,130
and it is a he. Okay. Because
at the end of the day, you know,

278
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,690
when you really look at the world,

279
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,320
most of the great things that
were created were done by men.

280
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,120
And I don't know why I have to shy
away from that and this progressive,

281
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:15,954
but you know,
ladies,

282
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,190
why don't you put your fucking brains
where your mouth though and fucking start

283
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,150
inventing some shit.

284
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,890
And I know you're going to come
at me with this fucking list that,

285
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:27,880
that is impressive to you.
But I,

286
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:32,881
what I also want you to Google my
feminist little friends is what have men

287
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:37,980
invented? And you watch that fucking
there. It's fucking Dan Marino,

288
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,270
1984 48 touchdowns,

289
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:45,900
5,800 fucking yards when you could still
beat the shit out of a wide receiver

290
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,220
and a quarterback. Um, having
said that, I uh, I respect,

291
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:55,090
love it and I feel you're very brave at
a time you put out your lab coat ad set

292
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:56,820
out to make a new widget.

293
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,900
Okay.

294
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,800
And it's so much harder for
a woman to put on a lab coat.

295
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,370
I'm just trying to make
sure I have it all down. Um,

296
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,100
just someday I would like to host an award
show and I have to make sure that I'm

297
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:15,350
the fucking Zombie that
they're looking for. MMM,

298
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,601
I'll do,

299
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,690
I'll come out and do a monologue just
talking about how dumb men are and how we

300
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:24,020
can't even figure out how to dress
ourselves without women. You know,

301
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,300
all of that shit and they'll
just fucking eat it up.

302
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,270
This is another thing I fucking hate.
You know what I hate?

303
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:33,710
I hate when a co a running back gets
like fucking 40 caries and he has like 47

304
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:37,760
yards and then he finally breaks one
for about 15 and then he gets up and he

305
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,330
does that. I'm eating a bowl of
oatmeal thing. It's like, buddy,

306
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,910
we've been feeding you the
fucking ball all God damn game.

307
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,950
Once you go look at your
fucking yardage average,

308
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,190
you're 2.7 yards per carry cunt.
Um,

309
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,190
okay.

310
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,560
Hey Bill, how about something
positive? All right.

311
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,030
I got something positive for you.

312
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:59,270
I watched this fucking Celtics
first of Philadelphia, 76, six,

313
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,570
you know, fucking blew me away in that
game. Was that Joelle, Joelle and beep.

314
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,340
So you say his name. I'm not looking
it up because I can't spell it. Um,

315
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
evidently that guy played a soccer
or football as they call it over the,

316
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,700
over the fucking sees there.
Um,

317
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,010
yeah.

318
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,960
Until late in his life.
I gotta tell you something.

319
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:24,961
That guy is like a ridiculous factor when
he's on the court and I know he's one

320
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:27,580
of the guys in the league, but
I don't, I don't think, uh,

321
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,020
yeah,

322
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,030
I don't think he's getting
the respect he deserves.

323
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:32,980
That fucking guy is a problem.

324
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,320
Okay.

325
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,410
On both ends of the court blocking shots,

326
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:39,690
getting rebound scoring points.

327
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,770
Fucking asis moves great for a big man.

328
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,420
Um,

329
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,430
okay.

330
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,400
I am praying to the basketball gods.
Look at me,

331
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:52,730
I'm going to church and I'm fucking
all about every God out there now.

332
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,010
Okay.

333
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,910
Um, I can't, you feel the, the joy
that's coming back into my life, my life.

334
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,430
It's like the end of the
Grinch, isn't it? Um,

335
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,200
I am praying to the basketball
gods that the, the, uh,

336
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,780
that the Celtics in [inaudible] 76
is a gonna fucking play again. Um,

337
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,510
I don't even care if we lose. That's
how much I enjoy that playoff series.

338
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:21,910
Some back in the day when I used
to watch Andrew Tony and Dr Jay,

339
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,440
Bobby Jones, Billy Cunningham, all
his mother fuckers coming at town,

340
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,040
Daryl Dawkins the first time
through and then it was Moses.

341
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,103
MMM.

342
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,350
Anyways, the fuck was I just going
to talk about, oh, I remember. Oh,

343
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:43,270
so I'm reading this book on Bob Cousy and
uh, Bill Russell called the last pass.

344
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,420
Does that really count as reading
by the way, to read about sports?

345
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:50,650
I don't think it does. It's like a long
sports page as far as I'm concerned. Um,

346
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,680
okay.

347
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,420
I don't know if I brought this up already.
I forget,

348
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:56,860
but like for the longest time I thought,

349
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:57,810
okay.

350
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,890
That the first

351
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,130
NBA basketball player with the
sneaker deal was Michael Jordan.

352
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,340
Now he might've had wait
his name on the sneaker,

353
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:14,120
but then I found out that
those red and white converse,

354
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,670
we're called the doctor J's,
but the,

355
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:21,440
I don't remember them having his
name on it initially. So then,

356
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,270
um,
I'm reading this book.

357
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,100
Okay.

358
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,100
And I find out that Bob Cousy and
likes 1962 or 63 had his own sneaker.

359
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:35,990
He signed a deal with pf flyers and
it looks like a bootleg chuck Taylor.

360
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,800
And I found a pair on,

361
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,920
on fucking Ebay for 155 bucks.
I didn't buy him,

362
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,640
but cause I'm not a
sneaker head. Yo. Uh, Yo,

363
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,330
you see the dude Jordan 48, um,
what are they up to by the way?

364
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,760
What are they up to?
It is amazing that 30 years has gone by.

365
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,500
He must have a new sneaker every year.
I would say they're on the Jordan 32.

366
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:05,650
So let's look this, well, let's
finish this story. So Bob Cousy,

367
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,370
that's the one that I want, you know,
I'm kind of fascinated by that whole

368
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,363
mmm.

369
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,590
A sneaker culture as far as like,

370
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,470
okay,

371
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,520
you know, all the different, like do you
get the Sundale three fours or whatever,

372
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,354
you know,

373
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,780
Jordan's 2019 let's see
what they got coming up.

374
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,250
What do they got in the, in the,
in, in the fucking sneaker barrel.

375
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,940
Air Jordan.
One retro sample.

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,833
Okay.

377
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,950
Oh, it was a sample. So that's not
exactly what they came out with.

378
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:46,840
And they want $4,000 for those. Are
you fucking kidding me? What do you do?

379
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:47,750
How do,
what do you sneak hedge?

380
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,040
So you put them on the wall so you feel
like you're always in a footlocker. Uh,

381
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,080
Air Jordan release 2018 all right,
let's see. What are they up to here?

382
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,680
Air Jordan.
12

383
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,570
okay.

384
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,320
How the fuck are they? Only on the
12th. All right. Air Jordan nine

385
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,670
dude verse, he sent me a text
the other day was fucking
hilarious. He's like, dude,

386
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,840
Jordan,
three MOCHA fucking over.

387
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,490
And it was the Jordan threes with
this mocha color cement thing

388
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,620
and I fucking died laughing.
I mean, he's, he's like,

389
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,370
he's like that fucking chick
day with the thin head.

390
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,740
Sarah Jessica Parker on sex in the city.

391
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,970
So rather than talking about fucking
high heels, he's talking about sneakers.

392
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,433
MMM.

393
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,550
Anyway,
so Bob Cousy,

394
00:22:41,551 --> 00:22:46,551
he had a pair of pf flyers and you know
with a little circle is on the chuck

395
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:51,390
Taylor was his face and it said Bob Cousy
on it and they were black and they had

396
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:52,620
a little green trim on them.

397
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,120
So that's as far back for all
you fucking sneaker heads there.

398
00:22:57,121 --> 00:23:00,420
I know Kareem Abdul Jabbar, he had
his own, did he have his own sneaker?

399
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,440
Ucla low top Adita I dunno,

400
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,020
but w who was like the first guy actually
he had like his name on it though

401
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,540
because I think maybe the technically,

402
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:10,930
okay.

403
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,770
The doctor Jay Converse just said,
um,

404
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,360
we're just nicknamed the doctor J's,
but they said converse on. He says,

405
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:23,820
let me look that up,
Doctor Jay. Conversely,

406
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,830
this is why I like talking shit about
things cause then I ended up getting into

407
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:30,460
it like fucking the pro,
the premier league.

408
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,373
MMM.

409
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,330
All right, let's see here.
Yeah, those are the classic

410
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,430
classic converse all stars. I
don't see his name on it. Oh.

411
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:45,680
And then eventually they did.
But the original one,

412
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,250
one of the cleanest fucking
shoes ever that for some reason

413
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,220
I think the newer ones said when I was
a kid, they didn't say dr j on him.

414
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,190
And now I'm looking at a really
old pair and those ones say dr j.

415
00:23:57,191 --> 00:24:00,190
So I think after a while they said doctor
Jay and those things look like they

416
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:04,960
came up before the year Jordan. But as
far as I can tell the Bob fucking cozy.

417
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,140
Okay.

418
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,670
The koozie ones do.

419
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,480
There was somebody fucking way back to
God coochie ones with a pork pie hat

420
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,940
fucking over Shea. Um, all right.
Let me look at some stuff here.

421
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,140
Uh,
I missed the last two Liverpool Games.

422
00:24:23,141 --> 00:24:26,830
I get all wrapped up in the holidays
and I cannot fucking believe this.

423
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:30,100
I don't know anything about
the Wolverhampton Wanderers,

424
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,680
but somehow we lost to them.

425
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,120
Okay.

426
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,480
We beat new castle United four to nothing,

427
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,690
but the fucking wolves means guys
don't even look like they, they there.

428
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,470
There's nothing premiere about their,
their uniform, their fucking name

429
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,180
or anything.
What happened?

430
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,073
Yeah.

431
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,620
Mohammed Silo and virtual van Dutch
struck to claim, oh no, they won.

432
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,420
Yeah.

433
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,370
Wait a minute.
And that doesn't make any fucking sense.

434
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,500
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

435
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,970
Cause we beat Manchester United three
to one and it says three to one.

436
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,190
Yeah.

437
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,980
And then it says Fuckin zero two.

438
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,190
Yeah.

439
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,250
So I guess they do that all
cause that was an away game.

440
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,280
Yeah.

441
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,750
Ah, your cheeky cons. All right. I learned
something else. That's how they do it.

442
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,673
Okay.

443
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,540
So they got arsenal one nil
arsenal coming up. The only one,

444
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:39,010
only Premier Li game, uh, I've ever
been to. I told you they played Everton.

445
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,600
It's fucking hilarious.

446
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:43,480
And they went up one to nothing and
they started singing one Neal arsenal in

447
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:45,820
halfway through the fucking
song ever written scored.

448
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,100
And this little blue
puff of smoke came up.

449
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:51,770
Yeah.

450
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,080
The 40 Everton fans,
we're going fucking nuts.

451
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:58,580
And all the arsenal people had to shut
the fuck up. Uh, I love when that happens.

452
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,300
Yeah.

453
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,020
I was watching a ranger game earlier
this year and fucking as always,

454
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:08,580
Henrik Lundqvist was playing unbelievable
and the whole garden is going and rig

455
00:26:08,581 --> 00:26:11,430
lug was Henrik Lundqvist or whatever.

456
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:14,070
And as the chance that the
other team fucking scored.

457
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,990
Uh Huh.

458
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,150
It's what you get. All right. Let's
look at some Google news here.

459
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,940
We'll start with the greatest country in
America, the United States of America.

460
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,160
All right? After Trump visits, Iraq,
lawmakers demand US withdrawal.

461
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:37,640
Finally,
let's get the fuck outta their way.

462
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,030
We're going bankrupt.

463
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,240
Iraqi lawmakers demand withdraw Baghdad,

464
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:46,740
Iraqi lawmakers.

465
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,450
This is the greatest thing that could
fucking happen to us if we combine it with

466
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:52,590
solar power.

467
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,060
Yeah.

468
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,320
In electric cars.
All right?

469
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,680
You gotta hit them where it hurts.
Just like the feminists do.

470
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:06,210
The feminists go after the money.
They go after the advertisers.

471
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,930
This is what the fuck you got to
do in the Middle East. All right.

472
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,210
Truly, the great thing though, as if we
pull out, I believe they'll just go back.

473
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,570
Unfortunately, because I don't have
a problem with Middle Eastern people.

474
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,190
I just have a problem with cunts. Okay.
And cuts. They're everywhere. Right.

475
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,120
Um, as long as you're not a client,
I don't have a problem with you.

476
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:30,980
So I think that they'll go back
to trying to fucking, you know,

477
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,020
deal with each other. Hopefully
not in a violent way, but you know,

478
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:35,854
it's going to be,

479
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,790
but I always looked at it like the way
when Russia withdrew from fucking Europe,

480
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,710
everybody was like, okay, where were we?

481
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,080
And they just picked up what their
fights again. It's really se I, I,

482
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:51,280
for the life of me,
I'll never understand how war is legal.

483
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,913
MMM.

484
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,633
You know,

485
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,020
we're sitting here like working on gender
neutral bathrooms while war is still

486
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:05,620
legal. I mean it's just fucking nuts. You
know what it is. I think it's cause they,

487
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,090
they keep updating the
war, the, uh, the weapons.

488
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,110
So it seems modern,
you know,

489
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:16,590
but if you still went out there like the
Braveheart days, and there was, you know,

490
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:19,980
two people standing on opposing hills
and then they just ran down the hill

491
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:20,814
yelling,

492
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,683
oh,

493
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,350
just fucking met in the valley. And
they had those sticks with the fucking,

494
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,670
uh, the, the, the, the fucking cannon
ball with the spikes coming out of it.

495
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,950
You know,
basically you're dressing a raider fan,

496
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,940
except you can actually hurt somebody.
You don't have the rubber points.

497
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,850
You wouldn't want to put somebody's eye
out when you're intimidating somebody.

498
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,390
Raider fans. Um, all right. So politicians

499
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,440
from both blocks of Iraq's divided
parliament called for a vote to expel US

500
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:58,590
troops and promise to schedule an
extraordinary session to the debate,

501
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:02,370
the matter parlor. I think that they'd
taken control of their country. Again,

502
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:06,810
parliament must clearly an
urgently express its view
about the ongoing American

503
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:10,710
violations of Iraq.
Sovereignty. Said Salaam,

504
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:15,770
I'll Shamira a lawmaker
loyal to the populace cleric
mock Tada Owl Satta through

505
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:23,340
the fucking balls you have over there to
be any sort of a leader of men. I mean,

506
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:25,290
you're really,
I mean,

507
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,610
I hope what they're doing over there
works because what we're doing is not

508
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:32,400
stopping terrorism. Maybe it's
stopping it from coming over here.

509
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:35,850
I don't fucking know. But all I
know is when I look at the ledger,

510
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,410
uh, you know, we're,
we're fucking bankrupt.

511
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,340
We just keep raising our amount of debt.
Why don't we fucking good back here?

512
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,840
Get back here. Bring the
fucking kids home. All right.

513
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,380
Fucking get on.
Get into this electrical shit.

514
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,100
I didn't give a shit if it hurts the
environment more just like so he can,

515
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,230
we can pay this shit off.
All right.

516
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,230
With the money we make from exporting
all the weed that we're growing,

517
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,110
the God damn it. If I can figure out
how to solve the world's problems, kids,

518
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:11,420
somebody in a suit and tie a,
all right,

519
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,840
let's see what's going on in Germany.
That's my first stop.

520
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,120
Germany army could recruit EU
citizens. Ah, for fuck sakes. It just,

521
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:21,770
Jeremy,
they really doing this again.

522
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,493
Okay.

523
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,320
All right. Slowly loading.
Slowly, slowly loading.

524
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,140
It is really bizarre how Europe,
if they're not unified, they did.

525
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,520
They just fucking, they will start
a world war, you know? I know.

526
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,070
Then what do we get? We get shit for
border. What's the worst thing we did?

527
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:45,970
We get fat.
Is that all we're doing a Nobel,

528
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,560
I think you're doing a little more than
that in the world are right. All right.

529
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:54,561
German army could recruit EU citizens
seven years after Germany scrapped

530
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:59,550
conscription, whatever the fuck that
it, it's defense chief has said,

531
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:04,551
employing EU citizens is an
option to fill expert posts.

532
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,960
Army general inspector Ybor hard Zorn.

533
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:11,830
Okay.

534
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,880
Said the forces had to
lock, handle, sorry.

535
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:20,881
Lock look in all direction in times
of lack of qualified personnel such as

536
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:23,950
doctors and it specialists.
Oh Wow.

537
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:28,030
Have they outsourced all their shit in
their country to the armed forces have

538
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:30,700
been beset by years of underinvestment.

539
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,970
Germany aims to increase its military
by 21,000 personnel by 2025 well,

540
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:41,370
what the fuck are they getting ready for?
Ah,

541
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,300
Jesus Christ. Oh Man. You know,

542
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:47,920
this is why you don't read World News.

543
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,640
This is why you just sit around and you
try and find a new sport that you can

544
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:52,474
get involved in.

545
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,590
All right, let me, let me do the one
read here for this week. All right,

546
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,860
and by the way,
my little thing for my headphones came.

547
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,140
I just have to go pick it up. Um,
all right, let's get over here.

548
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,760
Um, by the way, made it through
Christmas. What's up without Busan?

549
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,390
33 fucking days in 33 days in.

550
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,940
I'm going to go to the rose bowl sober
and then I'm going to go on my tour and I

551
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:21,380
am going to be fucking ready.
Bay Baby,

552
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,380
a butcher box.
Everybody

553
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,950
butcher box delivers healthy.

554
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:33,520
100% grass fed and grass
finished beef free range.

555
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:36,520
Organic chicken and heritage. Bread. Pork,

556
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,600
the greatest pork chop I've ever cooked.
Yeah.

557
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,740
MMM.

558
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,690
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to

559
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:50,160
raising animals humanely and
free of antibiotics and hormones.

560
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:52,200
They rub their bellies
before they murdered them.

561
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,300
Cook with the peace of mind knowing
you're eating holiday, high quality meat,

562
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:59,760
grass fed and grass finished products.

563
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,630
These aren't pigs eat nother fucking
pigs like the God damn animals in this

564
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:07,470
country. The hell. See it's choice
you can make for your family.

565
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:11,580
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat meat,

566
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,450
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

567
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,560
You can choose from five
different box types. All beef.

568
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,263
All right?

569
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,113
Okay.

570
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,760
All be for the racist, uh,
beef and chicken for somebody.

571
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:31,200
Every once in a while we'll bang
somebody outside their race. Uh,

572
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,580
beef and pork old school,

Free Bacon and $20 off your first box.

It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

584
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,570
December 27th,

00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,280
2010 the final Monday of 2010. How,
what are you going to do with it?

586
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,050
Huh? Are you going to make this
the greatest Monday you'd like?

Don't you hate when that goes. Fucking
motivational speakers is sitting there.

588
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,680
You're trying to get motivated to
not be a negative con like myself,

589
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,290
right? And then this guy
comes out, you're getting,

590
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,300
you're getting all excited to fucking
have something positive be said to you.

591
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:00,590
And what does the Guy Do?
He keeps,

592
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,500
he gets you all nervous with
this fucking ridiculous,

593
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:09,370
heightened sense of urgency
for just a regular fucking day.

594
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,570
This is Monday. Think about that.
If you buddy, this is Monday,

595
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,450
December 27th,
2010.

596
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,120
Does anybody know what that means? Well,
I mean there's no history. Don't you hit,

597
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,890
that's the worst part too.
When they start acting like somebody else.

598
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:32,520
Talk to them. Well, John,
there's no historical, uh,

599
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,450
thingamajig for December 27th. This
is just a regular day. Think about 10.

600
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:40,810
If you buddy,
it's just a regular day.

601
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,900
Is this just a regular shirt and my,
just a regular person.

602
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,740
Is that how I'm going to live my
life right there. Fucking Bam.

603
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,790
Blow his fucking brains out right
there. See, it wasn't a regular Monday.

604
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:56,130
You're fucking Douche.

605
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,430
It was a Monday you died because no
one wants to hear your current speech.

606
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:05,080
All right. I think I've said
58 times already. Um, anyways,

607
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:09,980
it's December 27th, two days up to
Christmas. It's 72 motherfucking days.

608
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:14,030
And to me not drinking, I can need
five more days. No, four more days.

609
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,200
And I break my record for uh,
you know,

610
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,060
being sober. I'm going for a hundred
days and uh, it's good. It's going good.

611
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:28,080
Oh yeah, I'm having a great
fucking time. Uh, Jesus. Um,

612
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,880
anyways. Did you guys have
yourself a merry little Christmas?

613
00:38:31,881 --> 00:38:35,420
Do you have a good Christmas? Did you
get the things that you wanted? Um,

614
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,680
I had a fucking awesome Christmas once
I was able to finally relax cause uh,

615
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,640
people out there who do the
road truckers are the comedians,

616
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,880
lounge singers actually
lounge singers don't travel.

617
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,300
That just stuck at that same
fucking place. You know,

618
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,700
like Jack Nicholson in the movie, the
shining just slowly going fucking crazy.

619
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,980
Playing handball off the wall of
their red roof inn. Fucking sweet.

620
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,480
Um, yeah, when you travel as much as I do,

621
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,010
uh, your brain, I dunno,

622
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:15,670
it can't slow down at the needs
like four or five days to slow down.

623
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,620
And uh,

624
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,940
you can't sit down on a couch
and a lay down on a bed for like,

625
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,000
at least I can't feel
like more than 10 minutes.

626
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:29,050
Your brain is just fucking go and go
and go and go and go. And, and uh,

627
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:34,051
it took me like four or five days and
then I was finally able to relax and in a,

628
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:40,720
and enjoy the holiday. I actually a,
I was so wound up from doing the road.

629
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:44,200
I actually wanted to be a,
wanted to be alone.

630
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,870
Don't, even though I didn't want
to be alone, it's Christmas.

631
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:54,050
I don't want to be alone, but I did. I
just didn't want to deal with any sort of,

632
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:59,050
uh, people. And I've discovered
when you become an adult,

633
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,400
truly become an adult is a
Christmas is not about you anymore.

634
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,760
It's about making sure everyone
around you had a great Christmas.

635
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,620
And then after all the frenzy is
sitting back and your enjoyment is that

636
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,330
everyone around you had a great Christmas.

637
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,750
And I finally figured that
out this year. And, uh,

638
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:23,740
I became a jolly son of a bitch.
I really enjoyed my Christmas,

639
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,340
you know,
and I got to admit,

640
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:31,540
on December 26th yesterday I went out
and bought something that I wanted.

641
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,950
Um,
um,

642
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:39,150
gradually putting together
a John Bonam fucking,

643
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,700
uh,
I don't know if I'm going at out as,

644
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,020
as him on Halloween or a fun fucking,
uh,

645
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,250
gonna make a stupid youtube video.
I don't know what,

646
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,320
but I'm gradually putting together shit
that looks like stuff that he wore.

647
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,630
And a, I can grow a beard. I'll dye
it brown. We'll see what happens.

648
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,800
You know what I bought? I bought his
Adidas sneakers that he wore at the, uh,

649
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:07,060
the Seattle concert.

650
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,081
And you know,

651
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:13,990
you're a fucking John Bonham freak
for those of you weren't in a music.

652
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:18,700
John Bonham is the greatest fucking
drummer I ever heard, you know? Um,

653
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,190
just as far as the shit that I
like, I know you can say, oh,

654
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,130
Max Roach and all those fucking guys.
Who Buddy rich.

655
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:26,500
I'm not trying to be a dick
here. All right. But like,

656
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:30,790
except for the kids who think Neil Peart
is better than John Bonam. All right.

657
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,000
And if you think that you

658
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,650
are a monotone jackass, um, all right.

659
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,830
But anyways, yeah, if you go
on youtube and you look up, uh,

660
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:46,670
it's actually Moby Dick rare
clip and it's him in Seattle.

661
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,090
And at that point they weren't
calling it Moby Dick Anymore.

662
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,180
They will calling it, uh, I something,

663
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:56,270
I guess over the top because Robert
Plant Goes Joan Henry bottom over the top

664
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,660
and then they got like
this, this, this 1970s, uh,

665
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:08,950
what is it fucking technology where
it goes over the top, top, top weight.

666
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,150
You know, it's supposed to be
like blowing people's minds.

667
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,420
And if you look at the arrogant way,
Robert Plant walks away from the mic.

668
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,110
You really want to throw something at
the back of his bushy head. But, uh,

669
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:22,460
if you watch John Bonam play, he's got a
pair of I believe, uh, the Adidas dragons.

670
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:28,190
Huh? Anybody old out there? Remember
that deed is dragon's Adidas country, uh,

671
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,190
the Adidas dragons.

672
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,140
So I have those and all I need is a pair
of white fucking pants and they sell a

673
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:36,140
replica. That tee shirt that he
wore in the song remains the same.

674
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:38,060
So right there I got the fucking outfit.

675
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,560
Then I've got to do is just get
a wig and I'm good to go. Uh,

676
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,150
maybe I'll do that for you guys next
year. I'll make a fucking off. You know,

677
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:48,200
there'll be a riot.

678
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,670
I should do that and not
say it's me and I'll,

679
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,530
I'll just put a youtube video up and
it'll be John Bonam cover and I'll butcher

680
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:01,380
it, one of his songs. And you guys
can all laugh at how bad people trash

681
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,200
for actually buying the entire
outfit. I'm not above it, dude.

682
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:09,920
I am a total fucking music geek like that.
I will actually buy some.

683
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,710
Speaking of that, I want to
recommend a book here before I am.

684
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,530
I don't know if I've even said anything
funny other than revealing how fucking

685
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:20,210
pathetic my personal life
is. Um, what do I got here?

686
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,073
Um,

687
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:26,000
out of all the led Zepplin books out
there and there's a zillion of them and

688
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:28,550
they're all fucking
ridiculous for the most part.

689
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:33,551
They always have them selling their soul
to the devil and Jimmy Page muttering

690
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:38,300
some sort of a cult bullshit walking away.
Um,

691
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,320
you know of them fucking sticking
a flounder in some girls Twat,

692
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,790
which probably happened in Seattle.
I have no fucking idea. But, uh,

693
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,720
the best book that I
have found on it is a,

694
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:51,830
it's called John Bonam,

695
00:43:51,831 --> 00:43:55,880
the powerhouse behind led Zeppelin
and it's written by his brother,

696
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,510
Mick bottom.
And it says right on the back,

697
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,640
or is it on the inside cover? Why he
wrote the book? He basically says,

698
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:07,550
if I can just paraphrase here,
why don't I just,

699
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:12,110
I'll read you a little excerpt about
10 years ago. This is from his brother,

700
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,420
um, after, oh actually,

701
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:18,650
Linda Bonham wrote this about 10 years
ago after reading yet another load of

702
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:23,360
rubbish about his brother John.
My husband mic turned to me and said,

703
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,580
I should write a book about our kid,

704
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,260
if only to tell Zoho John's daughter
what a great bloke your dad was.

705
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,350
And with that, the seeds of this
book began to grow and it's fuck,

706
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:38,640
it's just a killer book. It's very,
very little of it is actually about,

707
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,990
you know, all the bullshit that those
other books are about, which is, you know,

708
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:48,720
and then they went to this town and they
drank this much and they did this and

709
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:51,510
they did that. It's, it's really, uh,

710
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:57,470
him growing up with John and John
being home in between the tours and,

711
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:01,890
uh, it's fucking awesome. I read
it in like a day and a half,

712
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,850
two days.

713
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:07,080
But when do you expect that considering
I basically expose myself to be like

714
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:10,920
that chick who whacks Selena. You
know, you know that fucking psycho,

715
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,240
uh, Jesus Christ's of John Bonham
was alive. What I be stocking him.

716
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:17,880
This is really getting creepy. All right,
let's, let's fucking plow ahead yet,

717
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:22,800
but I want to recommend that
book. All right. In this
big words and lots of pages,

718
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:24,390
by big words,
I mean big font,

719
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,680
lots of pictures and um,

720
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:33,720
yeah, definitely check it
out. Definitely check it out.

721
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,090
And a classic Englishman,

722
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,170
I can tell you that about John
Bonham in that like most Englishman,

723
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,780
he looks like he never
lifted a weight in his life.

724
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:48,090
Got that awful fish and chip torso yet
continued to wear tight shirts right

725
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:52,110
through this career. Never understand
that. You only see that you don't,

726
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:55,740
you do not see that here in America,
except with gay guys.

727
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:00,510
Gay guys will wear tight shirts no matter
what shape the rent. That's not true.

728
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,990
They will actually, if long as they
got a little peck action going on,

729
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:05,670
they don't give a fuck about this stomach.

730
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,270
You know that as long as that chest is
out a little bit further than the stomach,

731
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,650
they wear tight shirts too. But I've
been over to Europe and I'm telling you,

732
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:14,520
I've never seen it.

733
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,720
Like you can never did a
pushup and their fucking lives,

734
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,390
those types of bodies.

735
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,220
You got that seventh grade chest
and arms and then this fucking,

736
00:46:26,221 --> 00:46:30,270
I just drank a keg of beer
stomach and uh, this, you know,

737
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,240
this is like, you know what
it is? This is like they,

738
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:38,940
they made it big before Elvis fucking
died in Elvis is the first behind the

739
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:43,890
music as far as the rock star and
all that to, I know every one guy,

740
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:47,610
he stole all the music from the Blues
and Gospel Black Dudes. You know what?

741
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:51,810
Go Fuck Yourself. So sick of
that stupid ass fucking argument.

742
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,950
He didn't, he was influenced by him,
but because he's a different race,

743
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:59,640
they said he stole it. It's
such bullshit. You know,

744
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:02,400
if you're black and you listen to
a blues guy and you play blues,

745
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,610
you're carrying on a tradition. But if
you're white, you do it. You stealing.

746
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:11,070
All right, in a black dude fucking a
steel white music, they're sampling.

747
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,400
It's bullshit. It's all bullshit.
Nobody's stealing from anybody.

748
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:18,480
You're year of being influenced so
enough already with the fucking whining.

749
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:23,481
I'm so sick of fucking people pitching
that this unfair business is unfair.

750
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,240
Yes. Show businesses on fair
if life is unfair. Oh really?

751
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:29,440
Did you write it and then
you didn't get credit? Well,

752
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:31,300
fucking welcome to the club.

753
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,080
I never wrote anything that
I need to get credit for it,

754
00:47:34,081 --> 00:47:38,140
but I can tell you right now, I have
been a victim of some very creative math.

755
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,330
Yeah. You know what, Bill,
here's your royalty checks. Uh,

756
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:45,610
that's $4 and 98 cents.
Yeah.

757
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:48,790
We had a hundred grand
worth of white out that we,

758
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:53,290
and we had to buy a new typewriter
that costs us 30 grand, you know,

759
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:56,170
and all that comes out of your fucking
pocket. Yeah. It's been going on forever.

760
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:57,490
But the reason why I say,
uh,

761
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,610
Elvis is the original behind the music
is because he's the first guy who got as

762
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:07,360
far as I can tell, got lofted all
the way up into the stratosphere.

763
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,460
And uh, like everything he did
now is just so fucking cliche,

764
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:16,660
but he was the first guy doing it. So
nobody could really see it, you know,

765
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:23,040
and by the time he died as a drug
drug addicted fat fuck on a toilet,

766
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,120
that was 77, you know,
at which point, you know,

767
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:33,250
[inaudible] was approaching 30 years of
age. They were, it was already too late.

768
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,120
Right. Does that make any fucking sense?
I'm trying to, I'm trying to justify,

769
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,920
and this is also before,

770
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,430
like John Bonham never would have got
that if he was living today. I, I can,

771
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,200
I can't guarantee that
he wouldn't be dead,

772
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:48,910
but he definitely would have like a
95% chance and not being dead because

773
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:52,630
someone would be like, you know, say you
had a problem. That'd be an intervention.

774
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,070
And then also when he got out of shape
and he started getting the man tits there,

775
00:48:56,071 --> 00:48:56,960
they, they, they fucking,

776
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,310
he would've got the ship teased out of
him on youtube and just start a sheer

777
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:04,660
fucking humiliation. Uh, I think
you would have done some setups,

778
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,071
but you never know.

779
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:10,540
He is European and they just really don't
seem to be into physical fitness over

780
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:15,520
there.
This is coming from an American,

781
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,070
they're not obese,

782
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:22,870
but they are just some fleshy mushy sons
of bitches over there. Not all of them.

783
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,760
Not all.
You get your occasional one,

784
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:28,150
but they'll the occasional ones seems
like the ones that are born that way.

785
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,300
You know, like the dad was like a
fucking ship builder and his dad was the,

786
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:37,180
you know, fucking work with Thor or some
shit. You know what I mean? On a fucking,

787
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:39,310
now what? What am I talking
about here? Really? People. Huh?

788
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,560
13 minutes of absolute shit.
All right, let's, what,

789
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,580
what are we going to talk
about this week here? Um, oh,

790
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:52,160
you guys want to hear a story?
Because when his story here do you got,

791
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,120
you have to, do you actually have to
work right now? Does anybody know?

792
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,770
Does anybody working right now?

793
00:49:56,771 --> 00:50:01,600
Does anybody have such a fucking Dick
for a boss that he basically gave you new

794
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:05,440
year's Eve off and then Christmas
Day off and now it's Monday.

795
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,210
Now you're back to work. You know, this
is a really, I don't know about you guys,

796
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:14,110
but this is one of the most depressing
weeks of the year, you know,

797
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:18,640
is the week between Christmas and
New Year's. Once Christmas is over,

798
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,370
you know, it's like you see the
buildup of the tree. First of all,

799
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,380
you get your Christmas
tree and if you're like me,

800
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,620
everybody trashes the tree except for
this guy here who writes me this letter.

801
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:33,710
Hey Bill, fuck the haters. Fuck
the haters. Your tree is awesome.

802
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,440
Your tree is a noble fir,

803
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,790
which is a far superior tree compared
to those faggoty Douglas firs.

804
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,070
I love of this guy made to leak
just those trees are gay. Um,

805
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,760
anyways, where the hell am I?
Yes, they look a little sparse,

806
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:52,070
but there is actually room
to hang the ornaments.

807
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:56,240
I like to joke that most people decorate
their Christmas bushes by just throwing

808
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:58,550
shit at them and hoping for the best ever.

809
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,970
Notice all the ends of the branches
of Douglas Firs are freshly cut.

810
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,320
A Douglas firs do not
grow in a conical shape.

811
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,610
That means Christmas tree shape.

812
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:11,210
I guess they have to be trimmed in
order to look like a tree because they

813
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:15,560
normally look like a bush. Exactly. That's
why I never liked those fucking trees.

814
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,060
It looks like a shrub.

815
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,040
I've never seen a fucking tree looked
like a Christmas tree. That's why.

816
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:25,550
And that's why I liked the tree that I
bought because it looked like a fucking

817
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:30,140
tree. Thank you sir. Um, he said,

818
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:33,290
have you ever seen how they prune these
trees on the farm before this ship to

819
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:35,030
your local grocery store parking lot?

820
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,840
A dude would dude with the hedge
clipper tied to his back at an angle,

821
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:42,440
goes up and down the roads of
bushes and walks around each one,

822
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:44,480
cutting it into a Christmas tree shape.

823
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:49,550
Nobles aren't artificially shaped at
all and grow to be symmetrical and

824
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:54,230
perfectly proportioned. There
you go. So go fuck yourself.

825
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:57,470
They also had somebody else write me a
letter saying that fuck all those people

826
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:02,510
by, uh, my sister or somebody
is uh, ah, fuck, I wish I saved.

827
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:06,860
This is in, in some sort of artistic
design or something to like my Theresa.

828
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:10,110
You know what? I'm a little ahead
of the curve people you way,

829
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,944
you know what's going to happen.

830
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,210
One of these fucking emaciated celebrities
is going to get one and then it's

831
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:15,560
going to become all the rage thing.

832
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:19,250
We wearing uggs with the fucking
Santa Claus Thong, right?

833
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,490
With the midriff showing be like Anna God.
Like oh my God,

834
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:26,900
this tree is like Anna God and they're
going to be in US magazine and that's

835
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:31,140
going to be it. Matthew mcconaughey
will be naked playing bongos. Um,

836
00:52:31,141 --> 00:52:34,460
and it'll all work out, but you will
remember that you heard it here first.

837
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:40,040
You heard it here first. I actually bought
a fucking tree. You guys bought shrubs.

838
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,020
All right, so fuck you and your
holiday. Um, but anyways, yeah,

839
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:46,660
it's a really depressing week.
So anyways,

840
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,230
you go out and you buy the God damn tree.

841
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,980
So then you have the tree and as the
excitement of the smell of the tree,

842
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:55,340
it smells like Christmas. All my
God, it's got to happen, right?

843
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:59,630
It's that time of year. We're going to
actually get off the wheel for a second.

844
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,890
Joy, the people around us, hopefully,
you know. And then what happened?

845
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:07,310
And you decorate the tree,
you put a little skirt around it,

846
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,280
you dress up that little whore,
right?

847
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,530
You get even more excited that one app.

848
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:16,970
But you come home for work and one of
your family members of the person you live

849
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:21,260
with has wrapped a couple of gifts putting
in underneath. This is the buildup,

850
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:25,230
right? This is Elvis, 1954
right? For 40 fucking hit.

851
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:30,180
You know, and then what
happens? A couple more gifts.

852
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,640
So he puts on a fucking Christmas record.

853
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:38,030
Your balls have filled up just
waiting to fucking for Christmas Day.

854
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:41,590
And then Christmas comes,
alright,

855
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,890
Elvis on the fucking Ed Sullivan show.

856
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:49,740
Everybody's going fucking crazy people
opening gifts is fucking bitches

857
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:51,390
screaming outside your window.

858
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,850
You throw down a scarf at him,
everything is fucking great.

859
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:01,260
And then just like dad, it's
over. It's fucking over.

860
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,700
You know, you get drafted,
send you over to Jeremy.

861
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,860
I can't do this Elvis thing I
don't fucking own saying here.

862
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:10,440
You know what I mean? Dennis fucking
over. They need looking at your tree.

863
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,340
You know, it's still got the lights, it
still has to skirt. But what happened?

864
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:18,150
All the gifts, they're all God. You
know, it was a couple of pieces of paper.

865
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,790
It's like they peaked.
It's like your favorite band.

866
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:25,320
They had those three awesome albums in
a row and now they're about ready to

867
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:27,810
fucking spend their rest of their career,

868
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:31,170
trying to recapture those, the, the, the,

869
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:36,120
whatever the fuck they did in those
three albums. Right. And then that's it.

870
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,080
So over to say goodbye to everybody.
You start looking at your family members.

871
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:45,060
You see him there a year older.
She makes you feel older. Yeah. No,

872
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,720
nothing's on TV.
All the TV people are on vacation.

873
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,640
This show in something on a loop.
Mtvs finally showing fucking videos.

874
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,160
He gets quiet. You sit back and
reflect on what a nice Christmas it is,

875
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:04,200
but you just can't get over this feeling
of this wave of depression that's

876
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:08,340
coming because you know it's
about radius start all over again.

877
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,450
Another fucking year
with this fucking job,

878
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,500
with that fucking Douche
telling me what to do.

879
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,760
My fucking by fan, he a fucking
girlfriend or your wife or your husband.

880
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:24,870
It's going to be another fucking year.
You know

881
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,020
the edge of fucking tree,

882
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,860
just reminding you of your God damn
mortality because you're not, you're not,

883
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,890
you're not fucking water in it.
The way you watered it before Christmas.

884
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,070
You skip a few days,
branches start to droop,

885
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:42,060
couple start to turn brown
like the gray and your hair.

886
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,030
Look at this artistic little,
jot them on here,

887
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:48,230
you know,

888
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:51,960
and by the t and then what's the worst is
then you start walking down the street,

889
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:56,190
going out to your car and what happens
to body start piling up out there.

890
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,890
You see your first fucking Christmas tree,

891
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,380
that Bah humbug Douche
bag across the street.

892
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:05,190
Who throws the fucking thing out
at like one o'clock in the morning,

893
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:08,400
December 26th and it's sitting out there,

894
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:13,401
right laying on its side like a fucking
victim at the beginning of the first 48

895
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,850
you know,

896
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:21,720
just got one little piece of tensile
blowing in the wind because the rest of

897
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:25,270
it's shit got snatched off from around
it's fucking neck. Just lay there.

898
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:30,520
Dead is a fucking door.
Doornail next day you come out,

899
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:33,280
there's two more.
Start driving down the work.

900
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:37,750
And you just see them all over the
place. Just being the positive, you know,

901
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:43,710
like fucking former stars and boy bands
just littering the fucking highway and

902
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:47,890
it's fucking over this fucking over.

903
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,790
So what do you do then?
He got what?

904
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:58,570
You got New Year's eve coming up the
worst fucking holiday of the year.

905
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,670
You know, New Year's Eve is for young
people. It's not for old people.

906
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,400
You know,
that's when you know,

907
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:09,730
you've hit a level of maturity is when
you can go to bed at like 10 o'clock,

908
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:14,020
10:00 PM on New Year's eve and you
didn't go out. You didn't get drunk.

909
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:17,380
He stayed away from those fucking morons.
You know,

910
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:22,390
I'd say what's a great weekend to go out
as the weekend after New Year's eve and

911
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:23,224
all those guys who,

912
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:26,860
people are still fucking hung over
and they're still fucking sick,

913
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:28,863
you know,

914
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,190
from their overindulgent cause they
don't know how to drink and eat.

915
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,560
Then you head out, like I'll
tell you what's it, you know,

916
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:38,230
it's gonna be a great night. Uh, what's,
what's New Year's? He Friday night.

917
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:42,970
You want to be a great night to go out
drinking Monday night that my friends

918
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:47,650
will be a great God damn night. If you're
an antisocial fucking prick like I am,

919
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,770
that's, that's where you want to go. Um,

920
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:58,180
oh hey. Speaking of which, listen
to this shit. Me and Paul Versey,

921
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:03,340
we're coming down to the wire here.
We're actually tied. All right.

922
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,810
As of right before this weekend,
we are tight.

923
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,173
All right.

924
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:14,050
And I got to tell you something this
week I had a breakthrough in my gambling.

925
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,170
We picked four games a week.
Whoever wins it in the end,

926
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,490
it's only a hundred bucks,
but it's,

927
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:22,030
it's more just about the shit
talk and during the year, um,

928
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:26,500
so this year nobody has gone
undefeated yet. All right,

929
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:31,090
so you're talking 16 weeks ago gambling
32 weeks between the two of us,

930
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,840
nobody has gone for no,
we've had a, you know,

931
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,620
a number of three in ones,
but nobody has gone for an hour.

932
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And a Paul Versey actually
did the impossible.

933
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:50,920
What do we called the
unthinkable and the unimaginable,

934
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:55,270
the unimaginable is going for no,
he did the unthinkable. He went,

935
00:58:55,271 --> 00:59:00,271
oh and for so this week I don't
know what I was talking to one,

936
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:04,870
a knee,
his uncles and uh,

937
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:07,990
he was talking about going against public
opinion and there was this whole new

938
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:12,130
website and shit about going against
public opinion with your gambling.

939
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,810
And I decided to take a
little bit of that. All right,

940
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:18,191
cause this is,

941
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:23,191
this is what I realized the reason why
I could never break through three in one

942
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:24,500
and get to foreign no,

943
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,480
is because I kept picking people that I
thought were going to win every fucking

944
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:33,500
game. And I know that sounds crazy,
but to gamblers, that makes sense.

945
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,370
You know,
when you don't have money on the game,

946
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,090
you can actually sit there and fucking,
you know,

947
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,273
just say,
you know what?

948
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,410
Not only do I think this team's
going to cover the spread.

949
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:46,730
I think they're going
to win the fucking game.

950
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:50,490
But all of a sudden when you put money
on it, you alligator arm it and you,

951
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:52,490
you just start,
you know,

952
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,420
you get too scared to take a
fucking chance. At least I did.

953
00:59:56,421 --> 01:00:00,710
So this week I was like, fuck it.
I'm taking a couple of chances here.

954
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,440
All right. I went to safe. At first,

955
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:08,441
I picked Tampa over Seattle
and that dockers wearing
fucking coaching staff with

956
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:13,270
Pete Carroll. I said, fuck
it. I'm going with Tampa now.

957
01:00:13,271 --> 01:00:16,700
That was one that I was, that
was my plane. It's safe. Bet.

958
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:18,771
And then I don't know,

959
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:21,500
I was looking at Washington and
Jacksonville and I was like, you know,

960
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,630
it's in Jacksonville.
Jacksonville's going to win that.

961
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,770
You know they're going to win this game.

962
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:30,040
They're going to get the running game
going. They are going to fucking run over.

963
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:33,620
They got fucking rex Grossman
playing quarterback for Washington.

964
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:38,330
It's fucking over. But I don't
know why. I got a feeling

965
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:42,830
I got to feel and fucking Washington
is going to win this game just because

966
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:46,160
nobody thinks they're going to. So I
said, fuck it. I've bet on Washington,

967
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,090
you know?
And then continuing that line of thought

968
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,160
San Diego was going into Cincinnati.
Cincinnati is shit,

969
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:59,810
the bed the entire fucking year.
San Diego always plays well in December.

970
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,160
They're a heckle, a heckle and Jeckle.
Oh, fucking a, what do you call it?

971
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:08,810
Jekyll and Hyde. Fucking a
team. And I said to hell with
that, I don't give a shit.

972
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:14,100
I'm going with Cincinnati. And Lo and
behold, yours truly with three and Oh,

973
01:01:14,101 --> 01:01:18,290
yesterday three and Paul
Versey went one and two.

974
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:21,110
We had the Sunday night game,
but it got fucking snowed out.

975
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:25,280
I won game up on them. I'm sorry. We're
not tied. I am one game up on him.

976
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,180
All right. So I went through, you
know, yesterday he went one and two.

977
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,640
So matter what happens tonight,
you know,

978
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,680
if I lose my game, he, he wins his game.

979
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:40,640
I'm going to be up by two games
with one week to go. All right?

980
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:45,260
But if I win tonight and
go foreign over four, no,

981
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:50,870
I will have done the unimaginable.

982
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,350
I'll, I'll done it. And who do you think
I took tonight? Who would you take?

983
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,700
The spread is two and a half falcons at
home playing the saints. Who Do you like?

984
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:03,200
Who Do you like?
12 and two is that what a,

985
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:07,910
is that what the Falcons are Matty ice
at home? Just given two and a half.

986
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,750
It's their fucking year.
I said fuck it.

987
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,870
I'm taking the saints.

988
01:02:14,871 --> 01:02:19,871
It took the saints and the points with
drew Brees sticking with line of thought

989
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:24,900
of going against the,
playing it safe. I think a,

990
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:28,940
I don't think the falcons had
been tested yet this year and uh,

991
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,210
I just think that,
you know,

992
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,630
this is just going to be one of those
things that happens to a team like this.

993
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,900
I still think they might be a year
away from doing something huge.

994
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:39,630
And this is one of these games where I
just think they're going to get a wake up

995
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:40,291
call.
Like okay,

996
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:44,310
we're good but we s we but like we're
not like the saints that actually have

997
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:45,930
gone through the whole thing
on one of the super bowl.

998
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:48,510
That's why I took the saints
I'm looking to go for, no,

999
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:51,300
Paul Versey has got the
now Tuesday night game.

1000
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:55,770
He took the Minnesota Vikings getting
14 points and a, I'm telling you,

1001
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:59,400
if I go for no and he goes one and three,

1002
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,830
I'll pick up three games.

1003
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:05,760
I'll be up for games with one
week to go and we pick four games.

1004
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:09,660
All have to do is fucking win one game.
It's a goddamn extra point.

1005
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,310
It's a chip shot and I will get bragging
rights for the entire fucking year and

1006
01:03:14,311 --> 01:03:17,160
I will really be excited about that.
And with that,

1007
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,750
so they go for all of these though,

1008
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:23,310
all of you who are into the gambling
aspects of my life and I with that,

1009
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:28,290
somebody actually came up with this
awesome theory, um, about sports.

1010
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,080
Uh, this guy says, Bill, I have,

1011
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:34,980
I have a theory about sports that tends
to piss people off, especially women,

1012
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,380
which makes me think I'm onto something.

1013
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,940
And it's got nothing to do with
the unpredictability of sports.

1014
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,810
I think he's this, this, this, this theory
is basically why people like sports.

1015
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:50,370
He said it mainly applies,
um, to team sports.

1016
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:53,130
Some individual sports
too. Okay. So here it is.

1017
01:03:53,131 --> 01:03:57,930
It begins back in the day when armies
were in the field waiting to go into

1018
01:03:57,931 --> 01:04:02,931
battle and armies objective
was essentially to conquer
foreign lands and rape

1019
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:07,050
women in order to celebrate
the glory of their race slash,

1020
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:10,800
culture and they would train
for battles by making up games.

1021
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:15,000
These games were based around
themes of land grabbing and raping.

1022
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:20,670
In this theory, the ball,
football, basketball,

1023
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:23,910
whatever represents the seed,
the goals,

1024
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:29,090
either posts or a hoop or a net represents
the opposing team's women symbolizing

1025
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:35,520
either their legs up in the air or
their vantage or their womb, whatever.

1026
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,110
The opposing team represents the enemy
army and the objective of the game is to

1027
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:43,890
get your seed past the opposition
and impregnate their women.

1028
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:49,340
That's essentially the theory and it's
a abridged version and it's why some

1029
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:54,570
sports are like cracked and some are
just who gives a shit when a sport is put

1030
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:58,620
together. Right. It's a primal
source of highly addictive goodness.

1031
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:05,150
Did you ever think somebody who would
like basically compare sports to rape with

1032
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:08,790
then you know if you
were going to do that,

1033
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:11,360
you wouldn't think that they would
basically. Then just say yeah, and it's,

1034
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,030
you think that there would be trashing it.
Not saying that it's a,

1035
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,390
that it's a form of highly
addictive goodness. So there you go.

1036
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:24,220
Actually look that theory. I believe in
that. All that subliminal Shit, you know,

1037
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:28,360
and uh, yeah, I'll go with deck. What
do you guys think about that dairy?

1038
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:33,430
My the worst. MERV Griffin
ever. I have no studio audience.

1039
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:37,330
What do you guys think into the abyss?
Um,

1040
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:42,490
am I really going to do another
fucking, I got to, I got to be, uh,

1041
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:46,440
I gotta be balanced here, fair and
balanced when it comes to the sports shit,

1042
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:49,960
as it's becoming too much sports. I
got to, Oh, here's one for you. I,

1043
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:53,860
but I tell you, I was, I said I forgot.
I was going to tell you a story here. Uh,

1044
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:56,380
I took cleo out.
Uh,

1045
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,400
we went outside for a walk so she could
do her business and I'm walking up the

1046
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:05,050
street and I went around
the corner and Cleo is a,

1047
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:08,800
you know, she's going, number
one, she's taken a piss.

1048
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,690
So I'm standing there, right? And I,

1049
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:13,600
I looked and I see this guy
as Cleo is beginning to do,

1050
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:18,580
her thing is walking to his SUV,
like one of those little mini ones,

1051
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:23,020
like the Lexus sorta one. And I see him
looking at me, I just sort of look back.

1052
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:26,320
I didn't think anything of it. And cleo
is going in the bathroom and I'm going,

1053
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:29,840
that's a good girl. Good
girl. She'll go grow.

1054
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:33,010
You go to a bat boy as you go girl,
I'm doing that shit right.

1055
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:39,550
Slapping her on her fucking
muscular thighs and you know,

1056
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,500
she finishes does a Little Harlem
shake, you know, and then she fought,

1057
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:47,650
we start fucking uh,
walking up the street and then I said,

1058
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,920
the guy down at the SUV,
he all of a sudden you just say this,

1059
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,810
pick it up dude. I'm like, what?

1060
01:06:57,070 --> 01:07:01,250
This dude pick it up.
I go and I realized he touched,

1061
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:05,740
he took his shit, which she
didn't. I go, she went number one.

1062
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:08,530
I can't believe I said that, but I wonder
when the argument, I would be like,

1063
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:11,380
she took a pith and
when she went number one

1064
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:16,180
and then the guy just gets in his
fucking car such that getting this,

1065
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:21,070
it is little SUV thing. I go, what?
No, sorry. You Go. So I said sorry.

1066
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,310
Yeah,
not as loud as you said that other shit.

1067
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:27,280
Then he got in his car
and he fucking drove away.

1068
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:34,090
It's one thing I fucking hate about the
west coast is the way they confront you.

1069
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:40,600
The confrontation out here. I don't
know why they do it like back east.

1070
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:44,890
They would have been like, hey dude,
fucking Nino. Pick up your shit.

1071
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:50,080
You know out here. And so he's
like, I don't know what it is.

1072
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:55,810
They always calling you bro.
Hey Bro, what's up dude?

1073
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,530
Pick it up. Deved just fucking
annoys the shit out of me.

1074
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,170
It just fucking annoying.
I don't know.

1075
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:07,240
That's the only time it really bugs me
being out here is that that that surfer

1076
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:10,090
fucking way that they talk when
they think they confront you,

1077
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,400
Bro. What a Douche. And you know,
what kills me is that that affected,

1078
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,150
that affected me the way
I interacted with people,

1079
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,230
you know,
for like the next four hours.

1080
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,910
I just had that playing in a
loop in my head, pick it up.

1081
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,650
It was in my fucking
head everywhere I went

1082
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:37,280
when paper or plastic, you know, just
it's, you know, all he had pickup deed.

1083
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:40,430
I'm just fucking here that in my head.
And uh,

1084
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,880
what did you know what I mean?

1085
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:51,040
The proper way to do that is
just to be like, excuse me.
Did, did your dog just, uh,

1086
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,310
go number two and then not all she went,
number one, it'd be like, okay, I'm sorry.

1087
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:58,520
It's just lately people are leaving.
Okay. That's the way you do it. You know,

1088
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:01,790
just go pick it up, dude. Fucking,

1089
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:08,000
ah,
I wish I could train cleo.

1090
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:10,910
You know,
for those of you new to my podcast,

1091
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:15,350
she is a pit bull to just
do a mock charge. You know,
they do that in the wild.

1092
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:20,780
I just wished it just teeth
or I just fucking run,

1093
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:23,420
just have that guide p
his slacks a little bit.

1094
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,040
And then right to the point where he
thought he was going to get his fucking

1095
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:30,140
balls ripped off,
she just stops on a dime.

1096
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:35,600
It turns around and this fucking runs
up the beautiful way that she runs.

1097
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,960
I should take a video of
my dog running full speed.

1098
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:41,870
It's one of the most beautiful things
you ever gonna to see. It's literally,

1099
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:46,700
you could make like one of those
secretary movies, this fucking dog,

1100
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:51,690
she is shredded
I and like she should,

1101
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:56,510
she's awesome. And the way she runs
the level of power, first of all,

1102
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:57,650
when she runs,

1103
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:01,520
she gets like excited right before she
does and she does this move where she

1104
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:05,560
sorta throws her head back a little
bit and just throws her [inaudible].

1105
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,840
It's like, it's like a fucking
muscle car. It's unbelievable.

1106
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:11,180
Absolutely loved watching her run.

1107
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:14,930
And if I could just somehow train her
to run and scare the shit out of people

1108
01:10:14,931 --> 01:10:18,920
who say pick it up, deed, that
would really make me happy.

1109
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,040
So, uh, that's what happened this week.

1110
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:25,400
And then I went inside and that ended up
getting into an argument with Nia cause

1111
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:29,300
I was just in a bad
fucking mood. Uh, no did I,

1112
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:30,860
now she got mad at me
about something else.

1113
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:34,970
She was really pissed at me this
week. I don't what the fuck, you know,

1114
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,481
one of those deals.

1115
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,300
I think it was cause I was coming down
off being off the on the road and she

1116
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:41,330
thought that I was going
to be a dick. And, uh,

1117
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:44,600
no matter how many times I tell
her that I have to, you know,

1118
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:47,420
I need a few days to unwind.

1119
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:54,560
Like I literally have the urge when I'm
in the house to get up and just get in

1120
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:59,561
the car and just start driving around
because I'm so in travel mode and go and

1121
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:03,590
go and go and go and go and that it,
uh, it takes a fucking minute. So,

1122
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:08,810
uh, you know, I don't know. I don't
know if I've got to do yoga or whatever.

1123
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,980
I have no fucking idea. It's
definitely seems to be causing a rift.

1124
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,543
Um,

1125
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,800
but anyways, I just remembered
I was going to tell you, oh,

1126
01:11:16,801 --> 01:11:21,801
I know last night I went and I saw the
fighter starring Mark Wahlberg and a

1127
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:27,480
Christian Bale, and I can't
recommend that movie highly enough.

1128
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:31,260
That movie was fucking awesome. It was
a movie I wasn't going to see. I'm like,

1129
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:35,940
Oh God, here we go. Rocky all over again.
But what saved it was, it was Micky ward.

1130
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:37,171
And,
uh,

1131
01:11:37,171 --> 01:11:42,171
I remember his fights and I'm embarrassed
to said I didn't see that Arturo Gotti

1132
01:11:42,991 --> 01:11:44,460
fight until years afterwards.

1133
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:48,120
I actually watched it on Youtube and
I remember Colin Quinn coming into the

1134
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:52,180
cellar raving about that fight.
Um,

1135
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,500
in fact, there's two fights that
I remember that I was just like,

1136
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:57,600
I have to see this fight.
It was the Micky ward,

1137
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:02,630
Arturo Gotti fight after hearing Colin
Quinn Rave about it down at the comedy

1138
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:05,850
cellar. And, uh,

1139
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,650
the Diego Cora, uh, corrals, fights.

1140
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:16,800
Uh, was it corrals? Casteel fight
is, that's what was, yes. Diego,

1141
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:21,240
I can't fucking remember. She can
tell. I dip in and out of boxing,

1142
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,990
but, uh, that's a crap corrals.

1143
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,690
Casteel their first fucking
fight is unbelievable.

1144
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:31,590
And Charlie Murphy flipped out about
that when he told me he almost broke his

1145
01:12:31,591 --> 01:12:35,790
foot at the end of that fight.
Well, one of them is just, you know,

1146
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,940
knocked out, gets up
in this training, goes,

1147
01:12:38,941 --> 01:12:41,050
you better fucking get
inside now cause everything,

1148
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,480
I think I told this story before you guys,

1149
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:48,450
you better fucking get inside now when
he put his mouthpiece in him and uh,

1150
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:51,090
he turned around, they continue
the round, he fucking knocks.

1151
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:53,670
The other guy technically knocks
out the other fucking guy.

1152
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,820
And I guess that got Charlie
so fucking amped up. He,

1153
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:00,600
he stomped his foot down on the
floor and woke up his whole family.

1154
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,770
So those are the two fights. But
anyway, so this fight, uh, this,

1155
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:08,720
this movie is about a Micky Ward's,
uh,

1156
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:13,740
you know, ascension up to trying
to win a championship. And,

1157
01:13:13,741 --> 01:13:17,190
uh, I have to tell you, man,
it is absolutely phenomenal.

1158
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:22,860
I was rooting for like the Mark Walberg
character while he was fighting.

1159
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:27,030
It was fucking awesome. Maybe want to
get in great shape. And I gotta tell you,

1160
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,330
I don't think I've ever seen a movie
where they did the Boston accent better.

1161
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:33,570
You even just for that reason,
even if you're not a sports fan,

1162
01:13:33,571 --> 01:13:38,250
you got to go see there and see the
five women that play his sister's stiff.

1163
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,930
They're fucking unbelievable.

1164
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:43,560
And it reminded me of this period in my
life when I was underage and I used to

1165
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:48,561
go out to these dive bars in like Chelsea
and all those awful m towns north of

1166
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:53,830
Boston, Malden, Medford reveal.

1167
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,350
I used to go out to all of those places
because they didn't give a fuck cause

1168
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:02,850
most of them were actually, you know,
you know, people were doing coke,

1169
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:05,100
it was the 80s now some
people was selling coke.

1170
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:07,590
So like alcohol just
seemed like it was a joke.

1171
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:10,590
It's like somebody went up there and
asked for some juice so I could actually

1172
01:14:10,591 --> 01:14:15,150
get served my fucking 12 year
old boy ish face. And um,

1173
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,450
those five women that you see,
uh,

1174
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:24,700
in, in, in that movie that those are
the kinds of girls that you ran into.

1175
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:28,000
They will like 21 years old.
And they look like they were 40.

1176
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:32,320
They already had a kid and they
were jaded. I can't explain it.

1177
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,020
And so fucked up was, it
was a, it was like a 20,

1178
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:39,850
25 minute ride from where I lived,
which was a world away with no traffic.

1179
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:44,080
Of course with traffic, it took like
a fucking hour to get there. But uh,

1180
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,950
yeah, I just remember shooting the
shit with them and they'd be, oh,

1181
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:52,570
you like smash.
But anyways,

1182
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:55,850
those are my two recommendations for this
week. Get up, get the book John Bonham,

1183
01:14:55,870 --> 01:15:00,490
the powerhouse behind led
Zeppelin by Mick Bonham and uh,

1184
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,510
go see the fighter.

1185
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:05,080
I'm going to see true grit this week
and if someone's trying to talk me into

1186
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:09,700
going to see Toronto, but I, I just, I
could give a shit about science fiction.

1187
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:13,000
I've never been into it. I
never liked star trek. I,

1188
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:18,210
I liked star wars for maybe six months
in my youth just because everybody else

1189
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:22,870
liked it and I wanted to fit
in. So I kinda got into by
just, I don't give a shit.

1190
01:15:22,871 --> 01:15:27,220
I think those movies, they're
gay, they're gay. All right there.

1191
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:30,820
I said it all right.
You know,

1192
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,540
you've put on the afterburners,
oh,

1193
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:38,541
I'm doing the best I can hit warp speed
and this stupid fucking handshakes,

1194
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:42,210
Eh,
and the,

1195
01:15:42,211 --> 01:15:47,170
the aliens that they're friends with
and the gay names of the fucking space

1196
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:50,800
ships that they ride around
in. And it's just, it's, it's,

1197
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:56,080
it's for nerds. It's for people who
don't know how to get laid. I don't know.

1198
01:15:56,110 --> 01:16:00,850
That's not true, but it just, the
stereotype is true. And speaking of which,

1199
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:03,720
I wanted to read this, this
overrated for this week when, um,

1200
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,420
it's just reminded me of this.
Somebody wrote overrated Las Vegas.

1201
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:11,950
Somebody wrote a, I'm tired of everybody
going to Las Vegas all the time.

1202
01:16:11,951 --> 01:16:14,320
They throw that shit around.
Like they're going like,

1203
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:17,830
they're getting a free trip
to a space station. Like, Yo,

1204
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:22,810
anybody want to go to Vegas this
weekend? Like, it's just the wildest,

1205
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:27,460
craziest place.
It's not Vegas fucking stinks.

1206
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:31,480
It's really not that big a deal
there. It's too hot. The drive sucks.

1207
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,150
How do they not widen out that 14?

1208
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:38,200
It's actually the 15 or whatever
to be more than two lanes. Yeah,

1209
01:16:38,201 --> 01:16:41,590
that's the highway. And when you come
back on Sunday, it's a fucking nightmare.

1210
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,940
Always flying to Vegas.

1211
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:47,020
Never drive unless you plan on leaving at
two in the fucking morning. He said, uh,

1212
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:51,070
the other big thing I'm tired of with
Vegas is the media perception that it's

1213
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:55,630
the craziest place on earth that you never
know what kind of nutty shit is going

1214
01:16:55,631 --> 01:16:58,660
on.
And it's like that every day of the year.

1215
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:02,860
You should just go wild there.
Go home with three strippers,

1216
01:17:02,861 --> 01:17:07,780
party like crazy with your boys and
wake up with the most insane story ever.

1217
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:10,040
It's like that the hangover.

1218
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:14,330
It's like that Song Waking Up in
Vegas from Katy Perry. Woohoo. Yay.

1219
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:19,130
Let's go crazy. Um, well I'm
sorry to burst your bubble.

1220
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:22,130
That doesn't really happen there folks.
The 50s and 60s or over,

1221
01:17:22,131 --> 01:17:26,580
not much that that's hip and
happening goes on there. Uh,

1222
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:32,270
you don't see Sinatra and dean coming
out to deal blackjack and drink with the

1223
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:35,870
common folk unless you're bringing
in sick a six figure salary.

1224
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,820
It's actually pretty mundane.

1225
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,490
It's mostly full of sad old people
blowing their social security,

1226
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:46,491
her social security checks on slot
machines and shit and lousy food and ugly

1227
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:51,320
tourists with their stupid kids placed
the places like Disneyland with gambling

1228
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,960
and God help you.
If you wake up with a hangover,

1229
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:58,390
it's generally 117 fucking degrees out.
You walk out of Your Hotel and God,

1230
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:03,410
Vegas is not supposed to be. It's supposed
to be this out of control party place.

1231
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,270
It's not.
You want a story?

1232
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:09,440
Give Charles Manson a tab of acid and a
meat cleaver and let them loose on the

1233
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:13,940
strip on a Friday night. You'll have
a crazy Vegas story. Fuck that place.

1234
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,780
All right,
well sir,

1235
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,060
I 100% agree and disagree
all at the same time. See,

1236
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:28,061
what you did is you went there and you
just looked at what you saw like I did

1237
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:30,260
the first time I went there.

1238
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,320
I walked there and I was all
dressed up to do my shows,

1239
01:18:33,321 --> 01:18:36,860
like I was going to be in the fucking
rat pack and I saw all these fucking fat

1240
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:41,660
tourists with their flip flops and
going, wow, Vegas is dead. It isn't.

1241
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,440
You just don't know where to look.
First of all,

1242
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:50,120
you ever see those pretty girls playing
slots, you know, and you're like,

1243
01:18:50,121 --> 01:18:54,920
why is that pretty girl all
by herself playing slots?

1244
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:59,090
How come she doesn't have a boyfriend?
That's because she's a hooker, sir.

1245
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,650
You want to have your crazy fucking day.
You go right there.

1246
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:08,000
Did you like me? First Time I went to
Vegas, I thought a hooker was, you know,

1247
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:12,770
standing on a street corner snapping
her gum. Hey, like that was a hooker.

1248
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:17,990
All right. But no, they, they, they're
not supposed to be in the casino,

1249
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:19,670
but they look the other way.
All right.

1250
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,510
And I was actually at a bar
one time and Jimmy Dore told,

1251
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:26,510
and I'm sitting there hitting on this
girl and Bill Jimmy finally came out and

1252
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:30,290
goes, Bill, what the fuck are you doing? I
was like, what? This girl's hot. He goes,

1253
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:35,330
dude, you're hitting on a
hooker. And I was like, she's
a hooker. And he goes, yes.

1254
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:39,770
And then all of a sudden it was like the
Matrix. I could see it. And then I went,

1255
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:44,060
oh, she's a hooker. There's a
hooker, there's a regular girl,

1256
01:19:44,061 --> 01:19:47,030
regular girl hooker. And you all of
a sudden you could fucking see it.

1257
01:19:47,031 --> 01:19:51,440
Your problem is you don't know how
to see it yet. Put it this way.

1258
01:19:51,441 --> 01:19:54,620
I just did a road gig with somebody and
he told me his story. He went to Vegas,

1259
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:58,460
he won nine grand, walked up to one
of those girls, said, hey, come here.

1260
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,550
And she stopped playing slots,
walked right over to him. He goes,

1261
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:06,500
I want another girl like
you, uh, to uh, suck my dick.

1262
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:10,200
Come up to a whatever,
10 52. And they did.

1263
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:13,140
And they came up there and they were
gorgeous and they sucked his dick and he

1264
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:17,070
came on their face and he won nine
grand that night. So they, you go,

1265
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:21,150
it is a crazy, awesome fucking place
where shit can happen if you indulge.

1266
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:25,710
All right. If you stand back
like a fucking, you know,

1267
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,740
just shitting all over
the place. The, yeah,

1268
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:32,790
you're not going to have a good fucking
time. It is cheesy. It is awful. Um,

1269
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,100
there are a bunch of, you
know, they got malls there now.

1270
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:38,890
They tried to appeal the families.
All of that shit definitely goes on there,

1271
01:20:38,891 --> 01:20:42,420
but believe me. All right. I mean,

1272
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:46,170
I don't think you can go to Fox woods
and just go, hey, you and you, I mean,

1273
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:49,860
I give them probably do it, but they're
going to be old ladies. Um, it even there.

1274
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:53,370
I'm sure they have their hookers.
All right. But of course they do.

1275
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,810
But I'm telling you, go there
next time you go there. Alright,

1276
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,770
just look for those
pretty girls playing slots

1277
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,660
and you will have an, all of a sudden
Vegas will become, they just can't show.

1278
01:21:09,661 --> 01:21:12,510
They can't show that in the commercial.

1279
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:18,310
You know what was that Fox?
The Fox who was on that too bad.

1280
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:22,850
That baby does suck my fucking Dick.
You remember that corner?

1281
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:26,760
I forget how it goes.
That whole thing about being at Foxwoods,

1282
01:21:26,761 --> 01:21:27,840
like it's this crazy thing.

1283
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:31,590
You can't show somebody when nine you
can show that then winning nine grand,

1284
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:33,810
but you can't show that other
part where he goes, hey,

1285
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:37,560
you find another one just like
you who's dad didn't stick around.

1286
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:39,840
So now you suck Dick for living.
Get another one of those.

1287
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,340
Come back to my room and then end
the commercial bang. Boom. Xiao was,

1288
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:47,700
he fucking comes on their faces. Okay,
you're supposed to read between the lines.

1289
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:48,691
All right,

1290
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:52,590
so what I would do is I would stop going
to Vegas with the fucking nerds that

1291
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:56,130
you're going to Vegas with. You know? I
mean you're, you're going to Vegas, dude.

1292
01:21:56,131 --> 01:21:58,680
You're trying to solve the
transportation problem.

1293
01:21:58,681 --> 01:22:02,520
You're talking about the highways. You,
you, you're not looking at the right shit,

1294
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:08,460
you know? Yes. Frank and dean are
not going to be dealing pope. Yeah,

1295
01:22:08,461 --> 01:22:12,390
they're dead. They're
dead. Okay. Yes. Move on.

1296
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:16,170
Ashton Kutcher is going to be there
dressed like James Bond taking.

1297
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,670
I fucking hate those commercials.
I envy that guy's career. You know,

1298
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,520
I really envy that guy's career.
He's smart. Son of a bitch.

1299
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,670
Most people do a hit fucking
sick, common, and that's it.

1300
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:28,620
He got into producing very smart guy,

1301
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:32,190
but I hate those fucking commercials
with him sitting there with the stupid

1302
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:37,050
cameras and everybody's just enamored
with him. Look at the guy with the camera.

1303
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,670
Wait, we all have cameras and one in our
phone. This really isn't that exciting.

1304
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:47,160
Um, so there you go. Surf. I know I
trashed you, but go to Vegas again. Okay.

1305
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,680
Fucking pony up the fucking 70 bucks
and fly out there on southwest.

1306
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:57,960
Go down to the strip. Okay, gamble.

1307
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,720
Hopefully you win. If you don't,
you know, even if you don't,

1308
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:05,130
to save a little money and have a couple
of girls blow your cum on their face

1309
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:07,600
and I'm guaranteeing you,
you're going to go home with a smile,

1310
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:12,180
even if you have to sit in that
traffic on the 15. Hey listen,

1311
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:15,360
I know there's a lot of people listening
to this podcast and went to Vegas.

1312
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,850
I want to hear some stories and
don't make them up. All right?

1313
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,420
I want to get some actual goddamn stories,
okay?

1314
01:23:21,421 --> 01:23:24,270
And I'll see through the bullshit ones
unless you're a really good storyteller.

1315
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,210
Okay. Because the truth
is in the details. Uh,

1316
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,310
look at me talking shit like
fucking Rex Ryan. Oh wait a minute.

1317
01:23:31,311 --> 01:23:36,140
Did the jets loose again this week?
Oh, isn't that funny? Isn't that funny?

1318
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:39,510
It's almost like exactly what I said
was gonna happen. Fucking happened.

1319
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,340
You know,
and I know a lot of you guys,

1320
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:44,230
you probably can't remember
cause you know, you know,

1321
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:45,820
nobody can remember shit in this country.

1322
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:50,380
Like I used to do a bit about
that Geico Lizard, how, you know,

1323
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:52,080
everybody loves that fucking thing.

1324
01:23:52,081 --> 01:23:55,350
And I just look at that thing like that
thing has no credibility whatsoever.

1325
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,370
When those commercials started
out, he's like, no, I'm a Gecko.

1326
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:03,940
All right, get away from me. Fuck
you. And your insurance company.

1327
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:06,250
Then all of a sudden he
liked fucking sold out.

1328
01:24:06,251 --> 01:24:08,650
Now he sells the insurance and
no one calls him on the bullshit.

1329
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:12,840
Well this is my fucking a
Geico Gecko lizard moment.

1330
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:15,790
Here's Rex Ryan.
I'll play two clips.

1331
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:18,760
This is rex Ryan on hard
knocks back in August.

1332
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:21,190
Let's hear what he has to
say about his football team,

1333
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:24,580
which started my hatred of the
fucking jets. Here we go, everybody.

1334
01:24:24,581 --> 01:24:26,590
Let's turn up the volume.
Here we go.

1335
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,790
If we play at our best,

1336
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:34,590
we will be every team in this
fucking league playing at their best.

1337
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:38,970
So who's it on? Whose
shoulders as it? Bob.

1338
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:42,530
There you go. Could you hear that? Sorry,
I just fucked with the volume here.

1339
01:24:42,531 --> 01:24:46,580
Ready to crank that up. All right. That's
what he said. We will beat every team.

1340
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:50,540
He played up beds. We could beat every
fucking team and his fucking league.

1341
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:54,200
You know the usual bullshit. Okay.
For those of you forgot. All right.

1342
01:24:54,201 --> 01:24:58,460
Now here's him yesterday when they backed
into the fucking playoffs like they

1343
01:24:58,461 --> 01:25:00,020
did last year.
Here we go.

1344
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:05,980
That's the way I think
we're in class. God, dog.

1345
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:08,600
It ain't the way I wanted it,
but I'll take it.

1346
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,570
Hello? Hello? You fucking,
yeah. What happened?

1347
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:19,000
Rex fucking dope.
I swear to God was was I was.

1348
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:25,440
There's no reason for me to even bring
it up, but I have to bring it up. Okay.

1349
01:25:25,441 --> 01:25:29,070
That's the second major thing that I
was right about in football this year,

1350
01:25:29,071 --> 01:25:31,410
and as much as you fucking hate
to admit it, you know I'm right.

1351
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:33,510
I told you Peyton manning
was fucking overrated.

1352
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:36,360
I told you it was a regular season.
Statistical Juggernaut.

1353
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:40,860
He threw a pick six the lose the fucking
super bowl and he has yet to get shit

1354
01:25:40,861 --> 01:25:43,970
for it yet to get shit for it.

1355
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:48,480
It's fucking volume is way too high.
I'm sorry, let me bring this down here.

1356
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:53,300
He is yet to get shit for it. All
right, and I told you I didn't,

1357
01:25:53,301 --> 01:25:55,370
I didn't understand what
the jets were talking about.

1358
01:25:55,371 --> 01:26:00,050
I didn't understand why they felt
like they were the shit. You know,

1359
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,370
was it last year that they made the
playoffs because the cult sat half their

1360
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:08,270
fucking team wasn't it? Wasn't
it? That wasn't last year,

1361
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:11,120
isn't that how they got into the fucking
playoffs then this year they come in

1362
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:12,590
just talking all this shit.
Now look,

1363
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:16,190
I'm not saying that they couldn't go
on any team in the NFL at this point.

1364
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:17,750
If you get hot in the end of December,

1365
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:20,990
you can actually go on a run and win the
fucking super bowl like the giants did.

1366
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:25,130
All right,
that's another fucking hilarious thing.

1367
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:29,030
The giants losing again this week and
now they're questioning whether Tom

1368
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:31,430
Kauflin is worthy to coach that team,
that team,

1369
01:26:31,431 --> 01:26:35,600
that Amir two fucking years ago or
three years ago beat an undefeated team.

1370
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,000
14 point underdogs.

1371
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,460
What did the game suddenly
pass Tom Kauflin by at two
and a half fucking years.

1372
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,720
The York, this is a different
story in New York and Boston.

1373
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:52,810
Boston Jay is completely 100% negative
and they'll give you a little bit of

1374
01:26:53,721 --> 01:26:57,170
positive and the second they see
negative, they're like, the curse is back.

1375
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,450
They're awful that way.
But New York,

1376
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:03,770
they kind of do the ESPN thing
with a hype shit through the roof

1377
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,910
and say this is going to be the
greatest fucking thing ever.

1378
01:27:07,911 --> 01:27:09,110
And then when it doesn't happen,

1379
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:13,400
then they go the exact opposite way and
then it then and then just somebody is

1380
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:15,740
the worst fucking thing that ever
happened in the Goddamn sport.

1381
01:27:15,741 --> 01:27:19,730
And that's why mediocre guys like mark,
Mark Sanchez,

1382
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:23,060
who never really did anything in
fucking college foot. What did he do?

1383
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:26,180
He won the fucking Rose Bowl with
that team that had won the national

1384
01:27:26,181 --> 01:27:29,060
championship. I know there's a turnover
of players, but give me a break.

1385
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:33,710
Matt Lionheart did more than that
fucking guy and he's not even in football

1386
01:27:33,711 --> 01:27:37,790
anymore. I think he's playing in
like the fucking CFF CFL. Right.

1387
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:42,950
So there you go. People, but
I will tell you this, I uh,

1388
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:45,620
I do back Rex Ryan on
his foot fetish video.

1389
01:27:45,621 --> 01:27:48,500
I don't think there's anything fucking
wrong with dad. He's got a foot fetish.

1390
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,480
He made a video. I totally agree with him.
It is a private matter and uh, you know,

1391
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:55,640
the guy loves his wife.
That's what I got out of it.

1392
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:56,870
I didn't think he was a Weirdo.

1393
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:01,010
I think that was just one of those classic
fucking examples of every yet buddy

1394
01:28:01,011 --> 01:28:04,640
out there throwing sticks and
stones and all this fucking shit.

1395
01:28:04,641 --> 01:28:07,220
When we all have these skeletons in our,
in our closet.

1396
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,640
Does anybody else want to turn
over their fucking hard drive,

1397
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:14,840
their computer hard drive and let the
FBI go through it and look at all the

1398
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:17,780
fucked up shit that you've looked at on
the internet. Give me a fucking break.

1399
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:20,840
I'm a freak just like him.
I'm not into feet.

1400
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:25,160
You know some of the horrific shit
that I've looked at on the internet.

1401
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:28,910
I'm going to fucking judge this guy.
Then the end they, he kissed, kept going.

1402
01:28:28,911 --> 01:28:30,790
It's a personal matter.
I'm not going to talk about it.

1403
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:34,410
You can ask me 16 ways to Sunday.
It's a personal matter and I was like,

1404
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:39,230
that's exactly right, rex. It's exactly
fucking right. It's your own fucking life.

1405
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,900
It's a personal matter. I'm not
talking about it. Go fuck yourselves.

1406
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,730
I don't give a shit that
it's on the Internet.

1407
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:46,040
It's none of your goddamn business.
Watch the video if you want.

1408
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,910
I don't give a fuck. Then they go,
can you please talk about your wife?

1409
01:28:49,911 --> 01:28:53,390
And he goes, yeah, what can I say it
then with the for 23 years, I love her.

1410
01:28:53,391 --> 01:28:56,420
She's awesome. I was like, you
know what? This guy's a great dude.

1411
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:59,210
And I realized that I was wrong saying
that he was going to make an attempt on

1412
01:28:59,211 --> 01:29:01,380
his life one day because he has,

1413
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:03,270
because he has a great woman
in his life and that's,

1414
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:07,020
that's what's holding that man
together. And uh, told you,

1415
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:09,810
I told you once,

1416
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:14,250
psycho can spot another psycho from
across the rumps that God blessed Rex Ryan

1417
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:17,640
and his fucking foot fetish,
23 years,

1418
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:23,040
he still fucking got the hots for his
wife is making freaky videos about that.

1419
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:27,210
That was the shit gave me hope.
That's what it did. It gave me hope.

1420
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:30,780
I don't think that guy's a freak at all.
And that's like that tiger woods shit.

1421
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:35,670
And everybody sat there judging him.
Eh? People are full of Shit. You know,

1422
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,610
just listen to that quiet voice in the
back of your head that's calling you a

1423
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:43,350
hypocrite. When, when you're at the dinner
party trash and tiger woods, you know,

1424
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,030
when you think of some
of the shit that you've,

1425
01:29:45,031 --> 01:29:49,230
you know that you rubbed one
out to your wife's sister, Huh?

1426
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,470
What if that ever got, I wonder if
there was fucking video of that.

1427
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,500
You fucking fucking rub one out to your
wife's fucking sister and we could see

1428
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:00,570
the fucking video that's playing
in your God damn head. Really?

1429
01:30:00,571 --> 01:30:02,430
You're going to judge this
guy cause he's into feet.

1430
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:04,650
I don't judge him for that Shit.

1431
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:08,890
I do judge them for being a shit talking
jackass who sounds like one of my moron

1432
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:11,940
buddies at a fucking sports bar.
I will trash him for that.

1433
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:15,960
So with that, who do you guys think is
going to win the Superbowl? Because I,

1434
01:30:15,961 --> 01:30:20,070
for one have no fucking idea.
I have no faith in my team.

1435
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:24,120
I don't even know who they already
more, they'll let my, my patriots,

1436
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:27,060
they like a drug addict,
you know,

1437
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,990
are they clean? Are they cleaned
this week? And they're going to play,

1438
01:30:30,991 --> 01:30:35,400
they're gonna play fucking defense.
Are they just gonna? Uh, I dunno.

1439
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,260
I Dunno.
And I don't like that,

1440
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:41,610
that we basically showed a loss
to the fucking packers. Uh,

1441
01:30:41,611 --> 01:30:44,850
but Aaron Rodgers was out and even then,
we still should have fucking loss,

1442
01:30:44,851 --> 01:30:49,020
but they didn't manage the
clock. Right. And, uh, you know,

1443
01:30:49,021 --> 01:30:51,960
we lost to the jets once jets
could come in and beat us,

1444
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:54,480
they could still come in and beat
us in our own fucking place. I mean,

1445
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:56,580
that's still kind of way
football is right now. So,

1446
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:00,810
which is why I don't understand the whole
rex Ryan shit-talking that's what it

1447
01:31:00,811 --> 01:31:05,130
was about. So there you go. Let's see.
Let's move on to something else here.

1448
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:07,050
Let's go with advice. Uh, Bill. Hey,

1449
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,650
I just want to write you and say
I got let it go for Christmas.

1450
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:16,350
Um, I really needed it to, my
girlfriend dumped me on Christmas Eve.

1451
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:20,160
Uh, so you know, my Christmas suck,

1452
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:22,530
but your DVD really helped
me out a lot last night.

1453
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,360
I know what you say about breakups.
Six weeks of pain and then it gets easier.

1454
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,320
I said we were together for nine months
and out of the blue on Christmas Eve,

1455
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:34,260
she called me up and said she needed
time for herself and her daughter.

1456
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,370
That makes it tough too. I got really
close to her kid. Here's my question.

1457
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,600
What's the worst breakup you've ever had?
And have you ever,

1458
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,150
have you ever been dumped
over the holidays? All right,

1459
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:49,050
there's a number of things going
on here, sir. First of all, uh,

1460
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:53,100
that's a real honest move on her part.
You know,

1461
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:57,180
that whole fucking thing where you just
go through a Christmas cause you don't

1462
01:31:57,181 --> 01:32:01,930
want to hurt somebody's
feelings. You know, it's,
there's no good time for a break.

1463
01:32:01,931 --> 01:32:06,190
And she just could not go through the
phoniness of celebrating Christmas with

1464
01:32:06,191 --> 01:32:07,960
you when she knew she was
going to fucking drop.

1465
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:10,870
The other shoe of that
fucking expression goes.

1466
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:15,670
So I gotta give her props for being
fucking honest. But uh, and then also,

1467
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:19,240
do you know, you can do
better than hooking up with
some chick already has a kid.

1468
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,590
And I hate to be mean.

1469
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:23,650
I'm not trying to trash women out there
who have fucking kids in this single,

1470
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:26,350
in that type of shit. But I'm trying
to give this guy something positive.

1471
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:31,030
All right? You know, it's like, yeah,

1472
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,610
you got it. You got it down to
six weeks, it's going to suck.

1473
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:35,890
This is what you want to do.
Just go to the gym,

1474
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:39,730
go to the fucking shit.
This is what women do.

1475
01:32:39,731 --> 01:32:41,620
Women fucking cry it
out with their friends.

1476
01:32:41,621 --> 01:32:45,130
They get out of this system and then
they go to the fucking gym and the next

1477
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:47,440
time you run into them,
they want you to have that moment.

1478
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:50,260
Why the fuck did I dump? You went,
guys, we never do that. What do we do?

1479
01:32:50,261 --> 01:32:51,850
We get fucking drunk.

1480
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:57,120
Get a big fat fucking John Travolta head
and then go out and try to bang some

1481
01:32:57,251 --> 01:33:00,850
skank at three in the morning. Don't
do that to yourself. All right?

1482
01:33:00,851 --> 01:33:04,210
Just know it's going to hurt and fucking,
you know,

1483
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:10,080
go for spoon with your pillow and cry
it out and then go to the fucking gym.

1484
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:14,770
Put on some music that's gonna motivate
you. Go see that movie the fighter.

1485
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,050
All right, go get fucking motivated.
We'll do that shit. And then, uh,

1486
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:23,770
then just go out and just start hitting
on chicks at a completely way out of

1487
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:28,540
your fucking leak. And, uh, you
know, just go talk some shit.

1488
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:30,790
And then he got the out.
I'm not ready to be in a relationship.

1489
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:33,880
I got broken up with on
Christmas fucking eve.

1490
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:37,030
I'm not even trying to talk to women.
You do that.

1491
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,630
You fucking do the reverse
sell you backing up,

1492
01:33:40,631 --> 01:33:43,750
they're walking towards your Dick.
That's how you do it. You know,

1493
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:47,320
you'll get a sympathy, blowjob or
some just open your fucking mouth.

1494
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:52,150
Don't be negative. Keep them fucking
laugh and spent a couple of plates.

1495
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:54,370
Something will happen for you. Next
thing you know, he'd be like, Wow dad,

1496
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,860
that I almost get involved with the fuck.

1497
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:59,350
I almost was thinking about
getting married to some
woman already had a fucking

1498
01:33:59,351 --> 01:34:02,830
kid, you know, who's never really
gonna consider you her dad.

1499
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,610
It's going to have a bunch of issues
and a dad's not going to be around when,

1500
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,520
when her daughter goes
through her her slot years,

1501
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,250
cause she's trying to find
another father figure.

1502
01:34:12,251 --> 01:34:15,700
You don't want to be around for that shit.
You did. All right. So anyways, he said,

1503
01:34:15,701 --> 01:34:16,540
here's my question.

1504
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:21,700
What's the worst breakup you've ever had
and have you ever been dumped over the

1505
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:26,470
holidays? Uh, worst
breakup I ever had was I

1506
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:31,270
broke up with this girl who
then ended up stalking me.

1507
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:36,880
She told me she was pregnant.
Uh,

1508
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:40,750
I believed her.
I got back into her life.

1509
01:34:40,751 --> 01:34:42,220
And then obviously I've realized,
you know,

1510
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:46,930
when she was never showing
that she wasn't pregnant. Yeah.

1511
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:47,711
I had one of those,

1512
01:34:47,711 --> 01:34:52,670
just a complete fucking psycho with
stock me at my day job and all that.

1513
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:55,270
She was a fucking nightmare.
Um,

1514
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:59,090
had one those and have ever been dumped
over the holidays. No, I haven't.

1515
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:03,310
I've mainly been the person,
uh,

1516
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:08,300
that's dumped people. But I did get
dumped, uh, the fuck did I get dumped?

1517
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:13,130
It was in September.
Yeah. It was September.

1518
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:18,980
September. Yeah. Yeah.

1519
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:21,800
And it was, it sucked. It was fucking
brutal. And I did the dumb shit.

1520
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:26,780
I went out and I drank and
um, I didn't that, that's,

1521
01:35:26,781 --> 01:35:30,310
you know, something that's the basis of
my advice that I give you guys when you,

1522
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:34,190
men are women when you go
through a breakup, is just

1523
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:40,610
allow yourself to know that it's gonna
suck. Yes. It's going to suck. Yes.

1524
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:41,350
You're gonna come home.

1525
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:45,110
The phone isn't going to ring and you're
going to be sitting there trying to put

1526
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:46,220
the pieces back together going,

1527
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:50,330
what the fuck did I used to do
with all this extra time and

1528
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:57,380
just go through that is the best thing
that I can tell you in fucking embrace it

1529
01:35:57,381 --> 01:36:00,560
and just know it's going to hurt.
And uh,

1530
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:04,700
that's the best advice I can give
you because I did not do that.

1531
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:07,580
The worst thing you want to do was go out,
start booze and shot a bank,

1532
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:10,040
somebody else, and then go into
a fucking rebound relationship.

1533
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:12,650
I did that a couple of times.
It's fucking brutal.

1534
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:17,540
It's not what the fuck you want to do.
So, uh, I know we had a cup of questions.

1535
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:21,380
Somebody I keep getting questions about
on the opiate Anthony show a Patrice

1536
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:26,380
O'Neal and a Kevin Hart talked about
this detrashing that I took and uh,

1537
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:31,640
it was a long fucking time ago. I
haven't listened to the audio yet. Uh,

1538
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:34,670
just look it up on Youtube.
I'm sure they have the audio up,

1539
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:38,540
uh,
without even listening to the audio.

1540
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:41,900
Whatever they said is more than truth.

1541
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:46,280
It was an epic 50 fucking
minute trashing that I took.

1542
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:51,980
Um, what the fuck was his
story? St at the comedy cellar.

1543
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,170
All right,
how do I go to,

1544
01:36:54,171 --> 01:36:57,470
where do we start to see the Yankees
were playing the Braves in the fucking

1545
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:00,240
world series and I guess it was deuce.

1546
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:05,450
These groups of people from Atlanta
wanted to, uh, we're going to take,

1547
01:37:05,451 --> 01:37:05,780
that's right.

1548
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:10,780
They were taking two buses
to Yankee stadium to go to
the game and they wanted a

1549
01:37:11,181 --> 01:37:16,181
comedian to perform on the
bus on the way to the stadium.

1550
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:20,210
All right. Which obviously is
the most nightmare gig ever.

1551
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:23,840
They were going to pay you like 500
bucks and give you a world series ticket.

1552
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:24,733
All right?

1553
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:29,210
So that the Gig was offered
to meet like SD was like,

1554
01:37:29,211 --> 01:37:31,870
who's the two biggest sports fans I know
we don't hear. And so she offered an,

1555
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:36,560
and actually don't have enough money in
the bank will actually consider doing

1556
01:37:36,561 --> 01:37:40,700
this. So she approached me
and Jim Norton about the Gig.

1557
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:43,580
So me and Norton are just
talking about it going through,

1558
01:37:43,581 --> 01:37:45,180
this is going to be the
worst fucking Gig ever.

1559
01:37:45,181 --> 01:37:47,630
But you get to go to the world series
and we were both thinking about it.

1560
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:52,280
So the next day over 24 hours Norton and
just goes, fuck that. I'm not doing it.

1561
01:37:52,281 --> 01:37:56,570
So I was going to do
it. I was like, fucking,

1562
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,550
I mean it's not gonna be that bad a gig.
That's the thing about it.

1563
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,170
It wouldn't have been that bad a gig.

1564
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:06,710
I basically was going to get paid to go
to a world series game and to get paid

1565
01:38:07,351 --> 01:38:09,540
to do what the fuck I
was going to do anyways,

1566
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:13,050
which is trashed the Yankees all
the way up to Yankee stadium.

1567
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:15,300
That's the only part about the story.

1568
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:18,960
That's bullshit is them talking about
what a horrific gig it would have been.

1569
01:38:18,961 --> 01:38:23,130
It would have been a fucking cake walk
compared to those college gigs I did

1570
01:38:23,131 --> 01:38:26,220
where they didn't have a
fucking microphone and they
stand you in a hallway.

1571
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:28,560
It would be a bunch of drunk fans,

1572
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:31,650
excited to see their team that
didn't have a shot in fucking hell.

1573
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:34,770
A beating the Yankees and all I was
going to do was tell him what a fag Jeter

1574
01:38:34,771 --> 01:38:37,920
was for fucking 30 minutes,

1575
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,980
a half hour fucking set
would have been a joke.

1576
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:44,160
All I would have to do is trashed
the Yankees the whole fuck away up.

1577
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:47,250
I get 500 bucks and I get a world
series ticket and the second I get off,

1578
01:38:47,251 --> 01:38:48,084
I can screw.

1579
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:51,090
I can leave those guys and they get to
go to a world series game and fucking

1580
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:54,450
Yankee Stadium. So I'm like, I'm
going to fucking do it. Right.

1581
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:57,780
So I didn't know that Jim had said
that he wasn't going to do it.

1582
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:02,280
So we're sitting down there at the table
down at the cellar and it's starting up.

1583
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:06,180
Everybody's giving each other shit. So I
start giving Norton Shit about whatever,

1584
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:10,950
about as chinless face, uh,
his little ears or whatever,

1585
01:39:10,951 --> 01:39:13,470
fucking awful hooded
sweatshirt that he was wearing.

1586
01:39:13,471 --> 01:39:18,000
And then I got him with a couple of jabs
and he felt the overhand right come in

1587
01:39:18,001 --> 01:39:21,840
and he needed to stop it. And
he just goes, whatever, bus boy.

1588
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:27,210
And it was like ef Hutton.
Everybody fucking stopped and went,

1589
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:30,390
what,
why did you just call them busboy?

1590
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,610
And I immediately was like,
he's going do it too.

1591
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:38,070
And Somehow Jim got out of it and just,

1592
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:41,070
he literally threw me under the bus and
then they found out I was doing the Gig.

1593
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:45,570
And it just so happened that
night that all the fucking,

1594
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:50,190
the big boys where there was
Patrice Norton was there,

1595
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:53,910
Kevin Hart, Rich Vos, Keith Robinson,

1596
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:59,880
right fucking there, the Tyson
Holyfield, George Foreman,

1597
01:39:59,881 --> 01:40:04,770
all of that. And I'm standing
there like fucking a tex Cobb.

1598
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:09,720
And I took a 50 minute, I took
a headlining set, killing,

1599
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:14,400
standing ovation set of
shit for doing that Gig.

1600
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:15,480
And I was still going to do it.

1601
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:18,880
I was still going to do it
even after the fucking trash.

1602
01:40:18,881 --> 01:40:20,580
And cause I'm thinking I'm going
to the fucking world series.

1603
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:22,650
I don't give a shit,
you know.

1604
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:26,760
And Patrice was trashing me and I
didn't give a fuck what he said.

1605
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:32,000
His advice I never would've listened to
because Patrice was one of the biggest

1606
01:40:33,211 --> 01:40:36,870
pussies when it came to
performing hell gigs.

1607
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:39,520
Like when we used to do colleges,
uh,

1608
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:41,880
this guy used to book us on
colleges and it would be me,

1609
01:40:41,881 --> 01:40:44,760
him and Robert Kelly or meet
him in Norton or whatever.

1610
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:48,840
And this dude never wanted to go on first
cause first sucks because you've got a

1611
01:40:48,841 --> 01:40:52,200
warm up the crowd and he never wanted
to go on last because you had to follow

1612
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:53,980
the other two acts.
He

1613
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:58,750
always wanted to go on second and he a
and then he'd go on second and he would

1614
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:02,980
go over his fucking time like
the selfish country is. And uh,

1615
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:05,410
so I was just thinking, Hey, you
know this guy, this guy fucking a,

1616
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:10,750
this guy retires from comedy every two
weeks when he sees a hack kill on stage.

1617
01:41:10,751 --> 01:41:12,340
I don't give a fuck what he thinks.
But it was,

1618
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:16,930
it wasn't until the end when he actually
looked at me when the trashing was over

1619
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:21,250
and he said, Bill, he goes, I
will stand in front of that bus.

1620
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:25,240
Don't do that Gig. I'll buy you a ticket
to the world series. Don't do that.

1621
01:41:25,241 --> 01:41:28,960
And then I was sitting there going
like, wow, this is actually like,

1622
01:41:28,961 --> 01:41:33,490
he's not even joking right now. He's
trying to tell me for the love of God,

1623
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:39,040
have a little bit of self fucking worth.
And he shit.

1624
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:39,821
That was the thing.

1625
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:44,821
After a 50 minute trashin isn't
as embarrassing as that was,

1626
01:41:44,921 --> 01:41:47,080
nothing was worse than the shame of him

1627
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:51,640
telling me that I could actually afford
a world series ticket. At that point,

1628
01:41:51,641 --> 01:41:52,900
I wasn't really even thinking that.

1629
01:41:56,290 --> 01:42:00,520
So I decided in that moment
I decided not to do the Gig,

1630
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:02,290
which I don't think came out
on the opiate Anthony show.

1631
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:04,450
They think I did the Gig.
I never did the Gig.

1632
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:09,990
And I actually passed it off to another
comedian who was further down the ladder

1633
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:14,860
than I was. And uh, he didn't even ask me,

1634
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:19,480
but I always made a promise that I
would never say who did the Gig. And uh,

1635
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,490
I don't know.
Next time I go on opion Anthony,

1636
01:42:21,491 --> 01:42:24,670
I'll talk to the dude who actually did
the Gig and see if he wants to call in

1637
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:28,390
and talk about the Gig. But that's the
only, I haven't listened to the audio yet,

1638
01:42:28,391 --> 01:42:32,320
but whatever jokes that they said,
there was some classic ones.

1639
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:35,470
I remember Portree say, well,
hey bill, when they bring you up,

1640
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,320
are you going to come out of the bathroom?

1641
01:42:38,321 --> 01:42:40,690
Are you going to walk up
up those little stairs?

1642
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:46,600
That and then also me finishing
my set. Go and hey, thanks a lot.

1643
01:42:46,601 --> 01:42:51,010
And then I sit down in the bus seat and
then look over my shoulder and shake

1644
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:54,700
everybody's hands as they go to get off
the bus. Was I going to fucking hold the,

1645
01:42:54,701 --> 01:42:59,020
uh, you know, the bus intercom thing,
what I do it over that Yada, Yada,

1646
01:42:59,021 --> 01:43:03,010
all that and fit and this will kill me.
They had jokes for 50 fucking minutes.

1647
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:05,050
All that was true,
but I never did the Gig.

1648
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:09,130
I never did the GIC and a,
and I still maintain,

1649
01:43:09,131 --> 01:43:11,950
it wouldn't have been that bad of
a fucking Gig. It wouldn't have.

1650
01:43:11,951 --> 01:43:14,290
But what have been a joke,
bill?

1651
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:17,020
Get on a bus for a half an
hour and trash the Yankees.

1652
01:43:17,021 --> 01:43:20,320
Do you think he can do that? We'll give
you 500 bucks in a world series ticket.

1653
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:24,890
Absolutely. I would have been
drinking with them at anytime.

1654
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:28,150
I ran out of shit to talk about the
Yankees. He just look out the bus,

1655
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:31,660
hey look at the tits on that fucking
whore and they'd all go nuts.

1656
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:35,770
All I had to do is support
the south in the civil war.

1657
01:43:35,771 --> 01:43:38,080
There was so many different ways that
I could then what it would have been a

1658
01:43:38,081 --> 01:43:42,700
fucking cakewalk of fucking cake walk.
And I didn't end up doing it.

1659
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:44,170
I didn't end up doing it,

1660
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:48,430
which actually was better because the
first time I went to a world series ended

1661
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:52,400
up being a,
I went to game two with a 2004,

1662
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,660
that boring ass world series. But it
was exciting cause we finally won it.

1663
01:43:56,661 --> 01:43:59,960
So they, he goes to that.
That is the story. Yes. They
trashed the shit out of me,

1664
01:43:59,961 --> 01:44:01,670
but I never did the Gig.

1665
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:06,730
I was shamed out of doing it and I gave
it to another comedian who will remain

1666
01:44:07,221 --> 01:44:08,870
nameless. Actually, you
know what, here, let me,

1667
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:11,330
let me do a little cross promotion here.
Uh,

1668
01:44:11,331 --> 01:44:15,380
I will reveal the name the next
time I do the opie and Anthony Show.

1669
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:18,290
If they still give a fuck,
if they still give a shit,

1670
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:22,430
if the story has legs as they say in
the business. So a, so there you go.

1671
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:24,800
There's that fucking story.
All right.

1672
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:27,850
And I'll try to remember the name of
this podcast in case it gets so many,

1673
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:31,700
a couple of more questions about it and
I'll just say refer to the podcast on

1674
01:44:31,701 --> 01:44:35,210
December 27th. Um, all right
you two videos of the week.

1675
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:40,220
Um, these are all going to be
on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1676
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,890
You can watch all of these uh,
the so called white man.

1677
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,890
Somebody sent a great
video of somebody they do,

1678
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:48,080
didn't have a microphone but he was,

1679
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:51,650
he was talking about all
how the white man, you know,

1680
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:55,940
is fucking with everybody the way he
twisted up religion and all that shit,

1681
01:44:55,941 --> 01:44:59,990
which is totally true. But in the end he
goes, cause God is actually a black man.

1682
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:03,920
So basically it's like everything
that white people just did.

1683
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:06,380
I am now going to do from my perspective,

1684
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,670
which is the one thing that I've learned
when I being on the road that everybody

1685
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:13,160
is the same and it includes the bad shit.

1686
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:19,300
You know that liberal thought that
you know everybody is the thing,

1687
01:45:19,301 --> 01:45:24,140
but it's only good shit. Everybody
has the ability to be a scientist,

1688
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:29,180
to be a doctor. You know a fucking
teacher. Everybody has. Yes,

1689
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:34,210
yes they do and they also have the ability
to be a fucking CEO at Enron to be a

1690
01:45:36,021 --> 01:45:39,710
rapist and to be a fucking serial
killer and all the bad shit.

1691
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:44,660
Everything to be a war criminal, a
fucking dictator, everybody that is not,

1692
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:50,020
that is not an exclusively white thing
because white people get blamed for evil.

1693
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:52,700
Like we're the only evil ones
in the planet. We are not.

1694
01:45:52,701 --> 01:45:56,930
We are just the best at it. We are the
Michael Jordans of evil. Everybody.

1695
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:03,380
I challenge your race to top my race
with the evilness, but you got it in you.

1696
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:08,140
You got to know that. All right.
You got to know that you have in,

1697
01:46:08,141 --> 01:46:12,530
in you the same way you have it in you
to be a doctor or a lawyer or a teacher.

1698
01:46:12,531 --> 01:46:15,990
You also have it in you to be a,
a,

1699
01:46:15,991 --> 01:46:20,030
a complete fucking sociopath.
Uh, so there's, there's,
there's my fucking 2 cents.

1700
01:46:20,031 --> 01:46:23,210
All right. Clumsy report
or knocks down. Uh,

1701
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:26,390
I don't even know how to say Jenga Tower
and he wanted this leaning tower of

1702
01:46:26,391 --> 01:46:28,850
Pisa.
Uh,

1703
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:32,520
Fva tow rope fail.

1704
01:46:32,521 --> 01:46:35,690
This is somebody towing their friend's
car down the street with a rope and it

1705
01:46:35,691 --> 01:46:37,970
doesn't go that well.
Merry Christmas bitch.

1706
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,270
Need I say more Harvard sailing team.

1707
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:46,660
Boys will be girls and on from
funny or die drunk history.

1708
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:52,620
And I think it,
I think that's it for the podcast.

1709
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:54,930
This has been a very long one.
I Gift Card really quick.

1710
01:46:54,931 --> 01:46:59,310
Let me read this gift card, Dude. What
is your deal with gift certificates?

1711
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:02,070
This guy right here is the exact reason
why I don't like gift certificates.

1712
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:05,790
Would you rather get some shitty
sweater or boxer beast from your aunt or

1713
01:47:05,791 --> 01:47:09,840
brother in law or a gift certificate from
Amazon or best buy where you could buy

1714
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:12,330
something. You actually
like, Hey, fuck head.

1715
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,930
Why don't you not go out and buy
a shitty sweater? A boxer briefs.

1716
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:20,310
See you on creative content.
Maybe you should give out a gift card.

1717
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:22,110
That's why I don't like
it because you know,

1718
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:25,890
it's like you're out there and you buy
somebody a great fucking gift and then

1719
01:47:25,891 --> 01:47:30,360
they go, hey, you go shop for yourself.
Fuck face. It's lazy. That's why.

1720
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:32,820
That's why I don't fucking like
it. I don't mind it. If I get,

1721
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:34,740
if we both agree to get each
other gifts certificates,

1722
01:47:34,741 --> 01:47:37,590
I don't mind that when I'm out there
actually trying to buy you a fucking

1723
01:47:37,591 --> 01:47:40,620
coolest gift and you come up with that,
you just write me a check.

1724
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:45,240
You know like I'm some drunk whore going
to say you fucking son raped somebody

1725
01:47:45,241 --> 01:47:48,090
and you're running for Senate and
you need the problem to go away.

1726
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:52,530
That's why I don't like it. So go
fuck yourself. I'm all right. Revenge.

1727
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:56,430
I got to read this quickly here. Um, which
is gonna cause all kinds of problems.

1728
01:47:58,110 --> 01:48:01,440
Uh, all right. I went to a local
junior college, oh wait a second,

1729
01:48:01,441 --> 01:48:06,360
I jumped in too far. Uh, this may be more
of a story of lashing out than revenge.

1730
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:10,080
I actually think this is a story of
revenge and I like the story cause this is

1731
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:14,370
eyeball to eyeball even though it
was a little off Samuelson here. Uh,

1732
01:48:14,371 --> 01:48:16,920
my senior year I dated a
beautiful underclassmen.

1733
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:20,340
She was my first love and firstly
we dated through the summer.

1734
01:48:20,341 --> 01:48:25,190
After graduation I went on to
a local junior college. Um,

1735
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:29,820
the next year, Jesus Christ shop
class guy right here. All right. Uh,

1736
01:48:29,821 --> 01:48:32,880
we were still dating when
school started up the next year.

1737
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:35,580
I had a lot of friends that were still
in high school and one of my friend's

1738
01:48:35,581 --> 01:48:39,420
friends told me that he started seeing
my girlfriend hanging out at school with

1739
01:48:39,421 --> 01:48:42,810
another good friend of mine.
Uh,

1740
01:48:42,811 --> 01:48:46,620
my girlfriend was acting shady,
so I knew something was up. Um,

1741
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:48,750
for years during the football season,

1742
01:48:48,751 --> 01:48:52,590
a big group of guys would get together
on Sundays and play a game of tackle

1743
01:48:52,591 --> 01:48:53,760
football.
Uh,

1744
01:48:53,761 --> 01:48:57,210
this guy who was seen with my girlfriend
was among the guys that showed up to

1745
01:48:57,211 --> 01:49:00,780
play with me though to play with
the, uh, everybody. Me and this guy,

1746
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,960
this other guy, you name it all names.
I'm trying to skip over the names here.

1747
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:06,780
Me and this other guy
would normally play Qb,

1748
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:10,650
so we would be the two to
pick teams each week. Um,

1749
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:13,530
the quarterback on the other team
was also a good friend of mine.

1750
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:17,460
The friend of mine,
all these fucking names here,

1751
01:49:17,461 --> 01:49:20,280
the friend of mine who was messing
with my girl didn't know that.

1752
01:49:20,281 --> 01:49:24,540
I was aware that he and my girl had been
flirting at school. So I asked my buddy,

1753
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:29,010
the QB on the other team to pick this
Douche who's messing with my girl.

1754
01:49:29,011 --> 01:49:33,000
And at some point during the game,
send them in on a hard five.

1755
01:49:33,001 --> 01:49:36,010
And in I, I don't know what
that, is that like a postpaid,

1756
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:38,370
I guess that's a crossing
pattern and lead them high.

1757
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:41,580
He's basically going over the middle.
He's gonna throw them,

1758
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:45,540
throw the ball high and
just out of his reach,

1759
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:48,520
leaving this guy completely exposed.
So anyways,

1760
01:49:48,521 --> 01:49:52,780
he goes a few plays into the game.
They come out of the huddle and my buddy,

1761
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:56,890
the QB on the other team gives me a look.
He goes,

1762
01:49:56,891 --> 01:50:00,040
I called a two one two defense.
Jesus Christ,

1763
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:04,150
the most professional
pickup football game ever.

1764
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:06,100
So I bring in the nickel defense.

1765
01:50:06,101 --> 01:50:08,740
I had to call a timeout because
we had too many men on the field.

1766
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:12,880
I call it a two one two defense
and took the short ride zone.

1767
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:17,680
The ball was snapped and this douche
bag who's flirting with my girl came off

1768
01:50:17,681 --> 01:50:22,570
the line, took a hard left and
in slow motion, ran into my zone.

1769
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:27,790
I delay one or two seconds and
begin the path to the collision.

1770
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:30,130
My buddy let him perfect.

1771
01:50:30,131 --> 01:50:35,131
So he had to pick up a little speed to
get to the ball and he extended both arms

1772
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:36,190
to the sky.

1773
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:41,800
And of course he's looking back at
the quarterback to Jesus Christ.

1774
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:46,360
The second the ball hit his hands.
I bury my shoulder into his stomach.

1775
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:51,660
I grabbed the back of his knees and I
pull up and drive them into the ground.

1776
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:56,880
Now I can't define the word squelched,

1777
01:50:56,881 --> 01:51:01,720
but he definitely let out a sound that
old that I can only describe as squelched.

1778
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:03,730
Uh, yeah, it really that,

1779
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:07,270
that word makes it sound like you
actually hit a really ripe melon.

1780
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:10,960
The entire field erupted with a holy shit.

1781
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,920
My little league coach would have given
me two stars on my helmet for this

1782
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:15,754
fucking hit.

1783
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:19,720
I felt good about it for about three
seconds and the than the remorse,

1784
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:23,890
and I feel bad to this day for
setting this guy up the way I did.

1785
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:28,180
It took a few minutes for him
to get up. Uh, but he was fine.

1786
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:31,860
I don't know about Karma,
but a few weeks later, uh,

1787
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:36,870
this dude that he drilled into the ground
was banging his ex girlfriend and I

1788
01:51:37,391 --> 01:51:40,720
met my rebound that I dated
for the next five years.

1789
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:45,430
She turned out to be the devil or herself.
I might not believe in God,

1790
01:51:45,431 --> 01:51:46,264
but I've hooked up.

1791
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:51,280
I've looked the devil in her evil eye
as I shot a load into her evil cunt.

1792
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:57,220
Jesus Christ. Um, I don't think
Karma got you. I think, uh,

1793
01:51:57,221 --> 01:52:01,540
he was going banger no matter what. And
I think he got a nice shot in there. Um,

1794
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:06,460
it was a little cheesy that you had
your friends set them up, but uh,

1795
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,770
but fuck him. That's what
he gets. That's your girl.

1796
01:52:08,771 --> 01:52:11,460
He shouldn't have been doing that.
He was wrong. You were right. And uh,

1797
01:52:11,461 --> 01:52:15,850
as far as Karma goes,
I view Karma is like,

1798
01:52:15,851 --> 01:52:19,540
uh, what's that shit where you look at
the stars to see if you're going to get a

1799
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:23,080
chicken sandwich that day. What
do you call it? Is it astrology?

1800
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:27,430
Astronomy is the study of
stars. Astrology. Yeah.

1801
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:32,290
Like I don't believe in astrology.
You know, and anybody who does,

1802
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:36,430
you go, okay, you believe in it. I,
you just go, what's your sign? And I,

1803
01:52:36,431 --> 01:52:40,060
and they tell you this sign and
then read somebody else's horoscope.

1804
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:43,600
If they're a gem and I read
a Taurus and the garden,

1805
01:52:43,601 --> 01:52:46,100
how does that pertain to your
life? The, okay. It means

1806
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:50,030
this, this, and this. And Go. Yeah,
see that was Taurus. So there you go.

1807
01:52:50,031 --> 01:52:53,810
You can fucking, this is so vague.
You can attribute it to anything.

1808
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:58,550
Something wonderful is going to
happen today. Just be careful.

1809
01:52:58,551 --> 01:53:01,160
You don't close it off or it won't happen.

1810
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:05,000
So then if something wonderful doesn't
happen, yeah, then walk while I,

1811
01:53:05,001 --> 01:53:06,260
I must've been closed off.

1812
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:09,500
I need to be more open and then
they get off Scott free. Right?

1813
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:14,090
I feel the same way about Karma.
Karma is something that if you,

1814
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:17,990
there's ups and downs in
life, okay? And if you just,

1815
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:19,610
you're waiting for
something bad to happen,

1816
01:53:19,611 --> 01:53:22,760
something bad is going to fucking happen.
No matter how good you are,

1817
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:26,420
something bad's going to fucking happen.
You know, buy brand new pair of sneakers,

1818
01:53:26,421 --> 01:53:29,960
someone's going to step on him. You know,
you're like, why I starve a fucking,

1819
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:34,670
I starve. I sponsor a starving child.
I don't fuck around. I'm a good guy.

1820
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:38,860
Why did somebody step on my sneaker?
Because the world is full of content.

1821
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:42,170
It's impossible not to run into him.
You know,

1822
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:45,980
I think Karma exists if you believe in it.
I think if you don't believe in Karma,

1823
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:50,060
like you never really, you don't
really have any bad shit happen to you.

1824
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:52,400
There you go.
That's what I think about Karma.

1825
01:53:52,401 --> 01:53:56,180
I am an hour and 17 fucking minutes
into this podcast. Ladies and gentlemen,

1826
01:53:56,390 --> 01:54:00,380
I think it's time to watch to end the
podcast here. I hope you enjoyed it.

1827
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:04,700
Hope you guys all had a very
merry Christmas, a happy
Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah,

1828
01:54:04,701 --> 01:54:09,440
or maybe it just said fuck it all.
And I'm going to take a few days off and,

1829
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:14,190
uh, that is it. That's the
podcast. Please, please.
Oh, please. Well, the shows,

1830
01:54:14,191 --> 01:54:18,740
they're all sold out. So go scalp a
ticket. I, speaking of Jim Norton,

1831
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:21,110
the man who threw me under the bus,

1832
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:24,860
and it took them 10
years to make up for it,

1833
01:54:24,861 --> 01:54:27,410
actually made up for it when you put me
on down and dirty and he hooked me up

1834
01:54:27,411 --> 01:54:31,850
with opiate Anthony. Uh, but let's
say I don't count those, you know,

1835
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:36,290
cause I'm into astrology. He hooked
me up again with this awesome Gig, uh,

1836
01:54:36,291 --> 01:54:40,730
that he does every year
at the, uh, uh, fuck.

1837
01:54:40,731 --> 01:54:44,300
I'm gonna screw this up down in Atlantic
city. And this year he was like,

1838
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:46,520
you know what,
why should I take it all for myself?

1839
01:54:46,521 --> 01:54:50,150
Why don't I share it with some
friends and I'm doing a show at the,

1840
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:52,850
the fucking casino down
there and the Atlantic city.

1841
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:57,020
Why don't I know the name of it? Fucking
internet doesn't work on my bedroom.

1842
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,870
Whatever. It's fucking sold out
anyways, but it's me, Jim Norton,

1843
01:54:59,871 --> 01:55:03,350
Jim Breuer and David Tell it's going to
be a fucking unbelievable night at three

1844
01:55:03,351 --> 01:55:06,020
shows. If you can't make that,
if you didn't get tickets,

1845
01:55:06,021 --> 01:55:08,870
it's cause it's already sold out.
Um,

1849
01:55:21,921 --> 01:55:25,760

going to be at the Improv in Dallas.

Steve Gorman from the, uh, black
Crowes has its own podcast. Of course,

1855
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:47,520
I don't have the fucking
link because I'm an idiot.

1856
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:51,150
Steve Gorman sports sgs is
the name of the podcast.

1857
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:56,440
Great podcast.
He interviews Kevin Useless and uh,

1858
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,660
[inaudible] he just,

1859
01:55:57,730 --> 01:56:01,630
he's got a great interview style where
he just gets the other person to relax

1860
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:05,300
and he starts talking about
just all kinds of cool shit.

1861
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:07,630
Favorite ballparks,
favorite restaurants.

1862
01:56:07,631 --> 01:56:11,550
If you're into sports performance
enhancing drugs, Pete rose,

1863
01:56:11,551 --> 01:56:16,551
should he be in the hall of fame
or not having entourages uh,

1864
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:20,010
team chemistry, all the shit you
want to tell. And it's great.

1865
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:23,010
It goes on for well over an hour and
it's totally fucking entertaining.

1866
01:56:23,011 --> 01:56:26,280
Highly recommend that podcast keeps
getting better every time I hear it.

1867
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,770
And that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1868
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:32,060

1871
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:43,740
And I am going to be stone
fucking sober this year.

1872
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:47,520
I know you guys are all born right now
cause you want to hear the happy drunk

1873
01:56:47,521 --> 01:56:50,650
stories where I'm sick of
being a drunk on that day.

1874
01:56:50,651 --> 01:56:52,500
I would like to remember like I,

1875
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:56,970
I went to a game and Sanchez
played the USC Penn State.

1876
01:56:56,971 --> 01:56:59,490
I went to that game and I had
never even heard of Sanchez.

1877
01:56:59,491 --> 01:57:01,860
That's how drunk I was.
So the thing that I could have been alive,

1878
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:06,270
booing that guy, I would've
made a different seat. They
still fucking killed the,

1879
01:57:06,271 --> 01:57:09,000
uh, they still kill Penn
state. All right? Whatever.

1880
01:57:09,001 --> 01:57:12,060
That's the podcast to this week. God
bless all the, uh, have a great week.

1881
01:57:12,061 --> 01:57:12,610
Don't take anything

1882
01:57:12,610 --> 01:57:13,960
shed.
And I go fuck yourself.

1883
