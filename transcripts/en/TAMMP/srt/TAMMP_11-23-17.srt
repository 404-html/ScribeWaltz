00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,490
Hey, what's going on is bill burn is time
for the Monday morning. Now it isn't.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,310

afternoon, just before Friday,

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:09,880
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,190
Ah,

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,990
just checking in on you and the volumes
too loud and the volumes to lab.

6
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:24,260
What's going on? Hey, hey. Hey,

7
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:26,810

Happy Thanksgiving to you.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,800
Happy Thanksgiving to you.
Woo.

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,520
Happy thanksgiving.
United States of a man.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,990
Ah,

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,750
happy Thanksgiving to you.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,060
What's going on?

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,650
Happy Thanksgiving to the United
States of America's citizens.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,540
Each and every one of you.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,500
I am thankful to be in America,

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,670
sitting here with McGovern,
eating the fucking doughnut,

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,230
getting fat and Ham.
Fun The my wife miles off to me.

19
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,940
Go and slap her in the face.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,740
Get Marcel some pie and then
make fun of another race.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,080
Hey, all right, what's going on?

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,400
This is it while you were around the world
and you want to know what the fuck at

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,110
Thanksgiving is all about.
This is what it's about.

24
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,020
It's about sitting down and overreading
celebrating the fact that on this day,

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,630
thanksgiving, 17, 76,

26
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:36,260
the United States of America kicked
the shit out of the fucking bread.

27
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:39,860
It's British people at the
battle of thanksgiving.

28
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,870
You know, this black dude
Crispus addicts, attic,

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,470
Eric's Attica,
whatever his fucking name was,

30
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,860
he came walking out and he said,
he said, Yo, motherfuckers,

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,770
what's, what's your
pattern when pitch. Right?

32
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,840
And then the English will like,
you can't talk to me like dad,

33
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:04,610
especially with dead skin complexion.

34
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,830
Then they tried to shoot nobody fucking
Stab King Henry the, uh, the eighth.

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,820
Yeah, right in the throat with the, uh,
with the Turkey bone, broke his larynx.

36
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,670
The guy survived. We took it
out on his wife, you know,

37
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,880
beat her to death with a chastity belt.
This is all true and you can look it up,

38
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,820
but at the end of the day,
the end of the day,

39
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:27,650
that small act was what
created this country. And,

40
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:28,484
um,

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm thankful for Crispus
addicts where his name was,

42
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,230
go back to my history classes.
You know,

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,330
was that the only black guy they
talked about? I think it was,

44
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,070
they sort of touched on slavery.
Um,

45
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,710
all these white guys
did this amazing stuff.

46
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:52,970
Slavery and then they
built the White House.

47
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,250
Um, anyways, I don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about and who cares that

48
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,760
Oh, here we go. We're back. Went
Back. Yeah. I don't give a shit.

49
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,790
This is one of these podcasts. I don't
care. I don't care from entertaining you.

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,680
I don't care if I'm confusing you.

51
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:16,320
I don't care if I'm ruining your fucking
meal because I am in a resentful moved.

52
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,870
A lot of people are thankful today.
I am not thankful and I'll tell you why.

53
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,220
Cause I'm working right now.

54
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,080
I'm doing a podcast so you can hear my
daughter screaming in the background.

55
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,430
She's already half in the bag.

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,660
Everybody's boozing and having a
great time and old Billy. No Fun.

57
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,930
No Fun is continuing with his streak.
Why is he continued with his streak?

58
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,100
Is it cause he's vain?
I don't know why I'm continuing.

59
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,320
I just don't want to be a fat
booze bag again. Can I do,

60
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm just going to ride out the rest
of the year. I'll see what I'll see,

61
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,040
what the vibe is for 2018.

62
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,970
You know that first day when I roll
out of bed I'll see how I feel.

63
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,600
Granted I'll be at the rose bowl
so I'll be very excited. Um,

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,450
which this year is going to be a,
I was one of those semifinal plas.

65
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,100
I think the Miami hurricanes
are going to be there. Um,

66
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,950
somebody was saying that I have no idea.
All I know is I'm going,

67
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,670
I'm going right that,
that that's what I did.

68
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:20,410
I bought some tickets for myself and my
friends for the rose bowl cause I was

69
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:25,150
giving thanks to living in this wonderful
country that has the stadiums you can

70
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:26,770
go to,
right.

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,190
It used to be able to get drunk and have
a good time. Can't do that anymore. Ah,

72
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,120
you can't do that anymore.

73
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,740
Somebody was jerking off vigorously with
the fucking shrimp cocktail and now ne

74
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,970
everybody shut it down.
It's going to be no fun anymore.

75
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,680
No Fun in the comedy clubs,
Dude.

76
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,920
Fucking the vibe and comedy clubs
to pending on what you talk about.

77
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:57,370
If you talk about absolutely nothing,
I'm sure nothing has changed,

78
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,520
but if you even remotely
touch on fucking anything,

79
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,740
there's so many subjects now and these
fucking millennials, they swear to God,

80
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:09,070
they just, they just sit there.
It's like doing a cruise ship Gig.

81
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,990
Can you imagine? Sorry,
didn't mean to scream,

82
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:18,700
but can you imagine the fucking midlife
crisis that millennials are going to

83
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:21,910
have?
They're not having any fun.

84
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,760
This sitting around staring
at the goddamn screens,

85
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,440
they're afraid to say anything.
Everything's been judged and labeled.

86
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,630
It's like this, this fucking bizarre
like way back in the day, oh hey,

87
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,750
back in the day they, they used
to say that the government, right,

88
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,850
they're going to come down
on you, man, you're going to
take away free speech, man,

89
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,710
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. Wasn't social media.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,410
Social media has made
everything so fucking important.

91
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,680
Your quote,
everybody's on eggshells.

92
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,840
It's really different the amount of
times I have to sit there as almost a 50

93
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,810
year old man and tell young
people to snap out of it.

94
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,640
And then they always applaud like,
Yay, we want to snap on him. And what

95
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,930
I'm calling this right now,

96
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,270
I don't know what's going to come out of
this at the very least is going to be a

97
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:22,920
great wrestling character.
You know, if I were,

98
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:26,700
if I actually could take the beating,
the punishment of professional wrestling,

99
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,540
you know, and I was a younger fellow, my
character's name would be the millennial,

100
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,180
right. And I would be
fucking sanctimonious my,
the word I learned this year,

101
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,840
self-righteous, which is basically the
same thing, set in a different way,

102
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:42,870
isn't it?
And I would act like how much I cared,

103
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:46,020
and then I would go into the ring and
be a selfish fucking prick who just

104
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:49,530
cheated and fucked over everybody all the
way to my victory. Something like that.

105
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:50,850
That's,
that's the loose,

106
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,180
or maybe maybe it's not too late
for me to be a wrestling manager.

107
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,780
I'm too old to be a millennial.
I'll be proud of my millennial children.

108
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,720
I don't fucking know. This
is why I don't rest. Well,

109
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:07,160
I don't write for the fucking WWF or
whatever they're called now, the WWE.

110
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,170
Um,
Jesus Christ.

111
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,330
Jesus Christ. So how was your guys'
Wednesday, just before thanksgiving.

112
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:20,190
How was it?
Did you go to the local bar

113
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,420
and did you see that lady?
Did you see that fella?

114
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,150
Maybe you wanted to bang one of your
teachers? Did you hook up? Did it happen?

115
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,030
I is a creepy teacher. That's what
I would do. You know what I mean?

116
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,790
To keep my job.
I wouldn't try to bang one of my students,

117
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,540
but I would hit every fucking Wednesday
before Thanksgiving at the local

118
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,810
watering hole, you know,
by then when the fucking,

119
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,760
whoever the hell I wanted to
bang was of age and I'd show up,

120
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,760
you know what I mean?
Just fucking chalk dust on my pants.

121
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,850
Do a little dance. Mega Little
Love Bug your teacher. Um,

122
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,890
hey ladies, have you ever gone
the Wednesday before thanksgiving?

123
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,050
Did you just check in on one of your
teachers if you ever done that? You know,

124
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,770
not an old crusty guy, but
they had new guy. All right.

125
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:17,550
The guy who was like in his
thirties seemed like he had
it all together at least

126
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:17,851
to you.

127
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:20,640
And you were sitting in your class
before you realize these probably make it

128
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:25,140
only 18 grand a year with no benefits.
Of course he has the whole summer off,

129
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,780
which would be great for the
kids and the above ground pool,

130
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,520
underrated above ground pool under
fucking rated the above ground pool.

131
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,490
I mean,
how much into the water do you need to be?

132
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,280
As long as it goes up to your neck, you're
fine right there in the winter time.

133
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,230
You let it freeze over
and you can skate on it.

134
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,210
Actually bill for above ground pool,
little of water. Shut the fuck up up.

135
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,030
Nobody cares about your sites.
So listen to this.

136
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,030
I told you last week I fucked up my ribs
or I fucking the cartilage around them.

137
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:05,660
I don't know what happened. So, uh,
I went to him with Seuss, you know,

138
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:08,810
which is what you wanna do.
You want to go to ah, fuck.

139
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:11,750
You want to go to an a Seuss just
sitting up purse. If you want to go to,

140
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,110
you want to go to a fucking misuse
that knows what the fuck they're doing.

141
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,140
Cause basically all my muscles were spasms
and this guy fucking fixed all of it.

142
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,790
And I walked out of there
and they felt great.

143
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:27,650
And then like the German Irish asshole I
was, I'm like, well you know about 60%.

144
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,250
I guess I can go play drums at
a 100% now and see what happens.

145
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:35,460
And I came out of there and I felt
like I got hit by a fucking car. Um,

146
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,780
in a way it is because they'll bill,
he's working on his double bass pedal.

147
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,360
He's got the double pedal now.
Huh.

148
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,780
And you know what the deal is if you're
a white guy and you're fun and you're

149
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,150
white drummer if you're a warmer,
right.

150
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,570
What are the first couple of
songs you're going to learn? Huh?

151
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,850
Motley Crue live wire

152
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,840
before you move up to
Pantera cowboys from hell.

153
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,891
That's what it is.

154
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,850
And I'm actually finding that fucking
triplet like is easier than actually just

155
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:09,260
playing 16th, 16th pass,
like fucking 95 100 bpms.

156
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:11,420
I just sound like a Horse
Gallop and down the street,

157
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:15,350
but I didn't realize was how
much I was engaging my obliques.

158
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,080
And the right side is all fucked
up. So whatever. I have a, uh,

159
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,320
I have another appointment
next fucking week. But dude,

160
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:25,360
I got to tell you something right now.
You guys out there,

161
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:26,770
all you old fucks like me.

162
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,810
If you have aches and pains in your
body before you go to a doctor,

163
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,270
I'm telling you go see him as Seuss.
All right?

164
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,680
That actually I a top shelf messsage
that knows what that understands the body

165
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,730
and how it fucking works.
Cause I'm telling you right
now, if you go to a doctor,

166
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,900
you, you know what they gonna do. What
is it? Heart. This is my specialty.

167
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:49,770
I'm a knee doctor,

168
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:52,680
so I'm just looking at your fucking
knee and then they're going to give you

169
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:55,680
prescriptions. They're going to give
you some pain medications, you know,

170
00:10:55,681 --> 00:11:00,500
next thing you know, you're, you're
fucking on heroin. You don't need, Oh,

171
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:04,480
you could just go to [inaudible] and
not play drums at the end of the day.

172
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,250
And I think you'll be fine. As always.
I have no idea what I'm talking about,

173
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,590
but it does warm my heart
on things I do give.

174
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:15,220
Thanks right now thinking that I'm,
I'm possibly ignoring,

175
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,180
not ignoring annoying
somebody in the medical field.

176
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,050
Okay.

177
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,330
That's not true on the new doctor.

178
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,070
I take in consideration the
hip joint to fucking pharynx,

179
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,940
your larynx, pharynx, the
hypothalamus, pharynx.

180
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,330
I think I just invented
a body part that she, ah,

181
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,620
it's your thyroid and your
larynx where they connect.

182
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,450
It's like the taint
between the two of them.

183
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,790
Larynx is somewhere in your
voice box and your thyroid.

184
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,770
I don't where there that
isn't that in your neck

185
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,720
of a swollen thyroid. Yeah. And you also
got something on the side of your mouth.

186
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,900
So if you don't pick up the conversation,

187
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,130
I'm walking away cause I don't give a
shit about you fucking can I say that?

188
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,730
Can I say that on the podcast?
Will I offend thyroid Americans?

189
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,930
Um, anyways, so I, uh,

190
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,680
I fucking made of sweet potato pie first
time this year. And what I learned was,

191
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,690
uh, there's no sweet potato and a sweet
potato pie. It's actually fucking yams.

192
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,380
I didn't know that I'm
white. I don't know. So I,

193
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:31,330
it was the least of fucking sweet potatoes
I got when I fucking boiled them and

194
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:34,270
got the skin off them, they will, they
will Hawaii. So I was thinking, all right,

195
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,690
maybe the cinnamon and nutmeg and
that shit turns it Brown. It did not.

196
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,700
I basically made a sweet,
uh, I made a potato pie.

197
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,260
The had a little bit of sweetness to it,

198
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,970
so I had to fucking get rid of that
thing. Went back, got some yams. You know,

199
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:53,971
you got to understand people that I'm
essentially going to be one of the few

200
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:58,540
white people at my Thanksgiving dinner.
And rather than making a Hawaiian Pie,

201
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,750
I'm making a pie that is the staple of
the black communities as far as I've been

202
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:07,990
told. So there's all this
fucking pressure. Um,

203
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,350
I'm thinking I'm going to take a
pounding today as far as like, you know,

204
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,410
I should have put these,
should have put some vanilla in there.

205
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:17,080
You should have done this. You should've
done that. We'll see what happens.

206
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,770
We'll see how I survive.
You know what I mean?

207
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,300
Which is probably a good thing that I'm
not drinking today. You know what I mean?

208
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,720
Cause then, you know, I would
have all that alcohol in me,

209
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:33,100
everybody be criticizing my Pi and
then I'd start crying like a sad drunk.

210
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,450
Speaking of sad,
I realized I just fucking set back,

211
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,870
which is not what you want to do because
now I've got to make that noise again

212
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:44,980
when I fucking sit up.
Um, anyways, congrats.

213
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:49,981
You know what I'm thankful for something
else and I'm thankful for is the Celtic

214
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:51,940
16 game winning streak.

215
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,870
What an absolute gift
to start off the season.

216
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,230
I'm thankful for Danny Ainge
or as I like to call them,

217
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:03,160
Bill Belicheck junior.

218
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,200
Look what this man is doing with draft
picks. Look what this guy has done.

219
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,770
Anybody can be like the Lakers
and just sit around and go,

220
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:15,790
who's the best players in the league?
I will have them. Thank you very much.

221
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,980
Oh did you already developed them?

222
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,970
But to actually sit there and hold on
to your draft picks for years and then

223
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,860
exquisitely use them to trade,

224
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,240
to move up in the draft to pick
the guys to assemble the pieces.

225
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,910
Who's kidding?
Who were in the east?

226
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,100
So everybody in the east is
doing the exact same thing.

227
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:39,550
We're waiting for Lebron to get old.
You know?

228
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:41,950
It's like everybody in
the AFC east and football.

229
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,810
It's just how long is this motherfucker
Tom Brady going to be great for?

230
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,813
You know,

231
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,000
you know what the turning point his
career was was getting with Jazelle.

232
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,090
All right, so what she
has him on, she eat,

233
00:14:56,091 --> 00:15:00,950
he's like on that fucking wheat grass
yoga diet. He's all flexible and stuff.

234
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,813
You know what I mean?

235
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,830
He's eating like a stab and model.
Right.

236
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,620
You show when he came into the league,

237
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,200
came right in out of the fucking
dorms eating fucking Jalapeno poppers.

238
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,500
Did they even have those back
then? That's how old he is, like,

239
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,810
like a new appetizer has come around
since he started in the league.

240
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,080
That's when you know your old,
you know what I mean?

241
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,520
When all you want is those little mini
fucking hot dogs with the mustard on them

242
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,200
and somebody go, we have Jalapeno
poppers. What? What? What are those?

243
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,460
I am not familiar with those.
Do you want some?

244
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,290
A one set fucking weird one that's
smores. Let's say one. Every.

245
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,820
All those other weird families.

246
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,410
You know what the weird families are
that basically people that cook the shit

247
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,470
that you don't eat,
you know that's smores.

248
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,970
Not Charlie Brown's, what do they
call him? I said some chocolate thing.

249
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,880
It just sounds like a sweet
name for taking a dump.

250
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:01,640
I can't remember what the fuck it is. They
have no, he's he, you want one of these?

251
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,520
It's like, no I don't, I don't.

252
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,810
I'm hoping the lovely Nia will come
in here and join me at some point on

253
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:13,260
Thanksgiving,
so I give thanks for having a lovely wife.

254
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,920
I was hoping that that was going
to happen at some point, you know?

255
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,050
You know what?
My wife is like,

256
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:27,051
she's like Louie Depalma on fucking taxi
as far as the way she always gives me a

257
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,910
fucking other jobs.
Sick.

258
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:34,911
She's like dispatch every time I'm out
driving around you got to shut your phone

259
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:39,450
off. Cause if you don't, you're just
going to get all these assignments. Hey,

260
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:42,270
are you like 40 miles
away from the dry cleaner?

261
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,120
Could you go over there
and pick up some stuff?

262
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,360
Yes.
How many are trashing you?

263
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,180
Happy Thanksgiving to you bought a Booboo,

264
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,860
booboo. Hurry guys, like today. You like
the lines. Do you like the cowboys? Oh,

265
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:11,060
here we go. Oh look
who's here. There she is.

266
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,770
Mrs Mrs burb up Baba Baba Baba booboo.
Boo.

267
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,920
A triumphant return making a triumphant
maternal. Aw Man, I was just trashing you.

268
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,430
Can you, uh, can you pull up the, uh, the,

269
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,910
your chair there I was comparing
you to Louie Depalma on taxi member.

270
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:32,480
How he's in dispatch and it was always
telling the guys where to go and pick up

271
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:33,140
stuff.

272
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,410
You're 10 years older than me and I don't
does this references a lot of times I

273
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:37,790
don't get, well, it's classic.

274
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,650
Have you ever seen the Maltese Falcon
in college, but I don't remember it. Oh,

275
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:46,250
you don't? Oh, that's right. What's
your plan? What is my point of?

276
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:49,320
I like how aggressive you're going into
this. This is very offensive. I like it.

277
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,050
But you just said to me, you
trashing me, so why wouldn't I be I,

278
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,250
I wasn't saying that it was wrong.
What was your point?

279
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,630
Is it me or is there a lot of tension
for a holiday? Yes. Yes, there is.

280
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,590
I was just saying that I'm going
to start when I go out and about,

281
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,110
when I drive around Hollywood,
checking out the scene,

282
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,220
I'm going to start shutting off my phone.

283
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,013
Okay.

284
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,290
Because you're always giving me jobs.

285
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,390
Do you notice when you go out, I don't
call you up and be like, Hey Nia,

286
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,470
can you go by the two page
shop and pick up my, my rug?

287
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,740
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

288
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,810
yeah. I mean it's a real, it's a
real hard time for you. I understand.

289
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,080
It's difficult for you.
I get that kind of thing.

290
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,310
You're just going to go with arrogance.
So beyond your capabilities.

291
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:47,200
So that's cool. I'll manage
my expectations. Thank you.
Thank you. Can you do that?

292
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,930
Can you stop giving me assignments? It's
really hot in here. Does it just me?

293
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:57,460
Is it really? It's really hot in
here. So take off your bathrobe.

294
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,230
Um, come on, stop it.
Be Fun on the podcast.

295
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,700
Just cause I went in there and I trashed
you right out of the gate rather than

296
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,090
being thankful. Oh my God. Oh my God.

297
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,840
Hey did you, um, where were you giving me
shit for coming in? So late last night.

298
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,210
Cause I was wondering where that Effie,
where I was upstairs. First of all. Okay.

299
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,690
I came home and I went to turn on the
fucking TV to watch the Bruins first.

300
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,290
The New Jersey devils and the fast forward
button worked and then I couldn't get

301
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:34,100
it to stop. But you always
worse. It was on one. Oh No,

302
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,180
it was actually trying
to watch it like Ah,

303
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,850
and I realized it needed new batteries.

304
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,710
First world problems. Right. All right.

305
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:49,220
So tell me what happened with your
Thanksgiving dinner. Oh Wow. You know,

306
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,190
I don't like to trash
people in the podcast,

307
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:56,550
but I will say that this
particular company that I
ordered from you promised you

308
00:19:57,191 --> 00:20:00,430
a peach cobbler and you got there
and it wasn't there, you know?

309
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:04,480
And so I made it known via a very short,

310
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:09,170
simple email that I was disappointed
in that fact. And you know,

311
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,190
I was waiting two and a half
hours to pick it up and you know,

312
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,530
nobody could have nobody came
out and said, hey, listen,

313
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,720
doesn't look like the peach
cobbler is happening. I'm so sorry.

314
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:18,400
Because then I would've been like,
okay,

315
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:22,330
well let me maybe run out and try
to grab something. But you know,

316
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:25,990
I waited for two and a half hours in
the parking lot and got my food and came

317
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:26,920
home.
I was exhausted.

318
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,830
And you're going to write those people
back because they responded to your email

319
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:33,580
with like a four page Gettysburg address.
I'm telling you,

320
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:34,480
she write him back and be like,

321
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:39,070
if you spend as much time making my
peach cobbler rather than giving me four

322
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,680
pages of excuses where you're the victim,

323
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,410
here's a good one for your
business in the future.

324
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,920
Don't promise what you can't deliver.
That's much

325
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,210
what I yeah, yeah. They said you ordered
really late and don't take the order.

326
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,070
Yeah, they sent us that now. All right.
Um, hey, but they were doing me a favor.

327
00:20:57,071 --> 00:21:01,820
Is is basically the tone that I got back
was that they were doing me a favor and

328
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,440
you know,
um,

329
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:08,000
it was difficult to get my
payments information but
it's like I missed a couple

330
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,850
of phone calls cause I was with the baby.

331
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,360
So now you have excuses and then when
they would call a pod here on a third

332
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,830
time, I gave them the information
and for the full amount,

333
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,440
not the half deposit that
they initially requested,

334
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,940
I was like go ahead and do the
full amount. But you know, um,

335
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,390
three guys think that when
will there be a second date?

336
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,870
Do you guys think you're ever going to,
this is the second date per call.

337
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,290
So this is this, there will
not be a third date. You know,

338
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,950
life goes on and uh,
yeah,

339
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,480
that's why you cook your own fucking meal.
I'm telling you,

340
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:45,640
I see that some have to deal
with other people. Bullshit.

341
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,890
You know, it's, it's, it's fine though.

342
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:51,400
It's like I expected this response back
because I have dealt with this person

343
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,800
before. So, you know,

344
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:58,801
this isn't surprising that it would be
like a whole list of reasons of excuses,

345
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:01,030
I should say. Not even
reasons. It's excuse.

346
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:03,940
I loved how she kept complimenting
you and telling you to have a happy

347
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,470
thanksgiving. Oh, all in catalytic.

348
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:10,471
Just the air getting on an airplane
and we're jetting away to enjoy our,

349
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,430
the anger as opposed to being like,
I know you're disappointed.

350
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,580
Sorry about that. Sorry, we promised
something that we couldn't deliver,

351
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:22,510
but here's four pages of excuses.
Yeah. Here's a bunch of excuses why.

352
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,610
And then to like, you know,
bring my mother into it as
well, which is very classy.

353
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,210
Very, very classy on, on this
person's part. But you know,

354
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:35,230
I feel like Andy Cohen Roginos like I
wish the other person who didn't make the

355
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:40,000
sweet potato pie was here.
Sweet Potato Pie guy.

356
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:45,010
I don't, oh, come on. So Nia,

357
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,900
um, I have to do what? Have you started
your Christmas shopping yet? No, I have,

358
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,690
I am fucking crushing it.
Nieces, nephews done. Okay.

359
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,660
You done what's I'm done with you.
I'm breaking up with, you know,

360
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:00,700
Christmas gift for you. No, I'm actually,

361
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:04,450
I'm going to wrap some shit and
then I'm going to wrap my presence.

362
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,470
Sorry.
Can't read a little bit.

363
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,170
Did you see the Christmas wrapping
paper that I got for you? For the kids?

364
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,220
I thought it was cute. Like peanuts
and then like Rudolph or Mickey,

365
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,320
your gifts are always going
to be wrapped in that.

366
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,740
We have other wrapping paper. All
right, let me read this thing here.

367
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,330
This frigging side feel so much
better today after not moving.

368
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:32,680
I think the key, the key to letting
your rib cage heal is to not move.

369
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,820
So I want to let you know today.
I'm not avoiding you and your relatives.

370
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,820
It's just not, I'm nursing my side. Okay.

371
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,650
Are you going to be able to handle a
sober me on the holidays? I mean having,

372
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,070
I've been handling it for the last

373
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,050
however long. You haven't
been drinking? No,

374
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,390
but on the holidays usually
get all drunk and belligerent.

375
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:54,290
Start telling everybody around the room
with their problem is, it's anytime.

376
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,830
I'm a happy drunk. I liked it. So
silly and goofy and you're very loving.

377
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,680
You're one of those drunks that calls
me up at four in the morning and telling

378
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:08,310
me how much you love
me. I do. It's so funny.

379
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:14,030
That's why I don't need weed, man. I don't
need the we, I'm done with that shit.

380
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,080
You say that all the time. Yeah,
but I don't smoke that much,

381
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,510
so every time I do I just ate. Always
fucking burns my throat. I don't get it.

382
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,270
I just don't know how to control your
inhale. Yeah. And I just don't get it.

383
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,890
You're just doing like these bong rip
type of things and like I do shots.

384
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,320
What do you want? Because you're
trying to get that same effect.

385
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:37,480
It doesn't work like that.

386
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,280
Got I not just trying to
fucking inhale and fill it out.

387
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,410
I don't know. Yeah. I don't want to get
good at it. I don't want to get good at,

388
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:48,650
but whenever I don't drink then I'll,
every once in a while I'll come around.

389
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:50,340
It'll be all right.
I gotta I gotta do something.

390
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:51,800
I got to break up the monotony here.

391
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,980
Thank God you're not into heroin
or I'd be doing that, but heroin.

392
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,180
I made a sweet potato pie. I feel
like I'm down. I feel like I'm woke.

393
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,690
All right. Frame Bridge. Everybody.

394
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,500
If you've previously
listened to this show,

395
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,330
you've heard me talk about frame bridge.

396
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,900
They make it so easy and affordable to
co two custom frame favorite things from

397
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:17,690
art prints and posters to
the photos on your phone.

398
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:22,070
I actually collected all the pictures
of our lovely daughter and put it on a

399
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:25,040
hard drive and there was so many of
them that I was like, you know what?

400
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,030
I think frame bridge could really help
me out with this one. There you go.

401
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,080
That's a personal story.

402
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,290
Men's health says frame
bridge has disrupted the
custom framing industry making

403
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,120
what has typically been a
frustrating and expensive process.

404
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:46,150
Easy and affordable shots
fired in the custom big frame.

405
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,010
Take that.
Yeah,

406
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,830
custom framers and with the holiday
around the corner of frame bridge is the

407
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:56,831
perfect way to send truly one of a kind
gifts without that much thought out,

408
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,800
right to everyone on your list. This
is perfect. This is what you need.

409
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,620
The thing about it is,
is so many people that you don't like,

410
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:08,360
but you have to get him something.
You know what I mean? That's perfect.

411
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:12,020
You don't have the fucking time. Just
scroll through your Goddamn cell phone.

412
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,700
Go past the Dick Pics.

413
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,320
Go Pass that dead dead picture
of the directions. Okay.

414
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:20,270
That you have saved on
there for whatever reason,

415
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:24,680
and find that picture of you and this
person you just required to get a stocking

416
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:26,000
stuffer for right?

417
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,610
And go in there and just send it up
and then it's done and then it's done.

418
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,760
There you go. There you go. What's
a way did you go during all of that?

419
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,650
You just fucking started staring a
hole through my giant head here. Um,

420
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,870
what do you think you're
thinking about the meal, right?
I am. You're a little off.

421
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,130
You're a little off on this
podcast. I'm sorry, I'm bx.

422
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm trying to figure out if I'm going
to respond to this email or not.

423
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:51,330
I don't think I'm going
to, oh, I would have to,

424
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,010
I would just real quickly,
I would just be,

425
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,340
I would just pay something along that
and going back and forth and back and

426
00:26:56,341 --> 00:27:01,260
forth about it. You know what I mean? Like
it's just going to be more of the same,

427
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,130
you know,

428
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,130
I said what I had to say and that was
that they said to say and you know,

429
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,920
there you go.
You know what you guys both said,

430
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:13,010
but you had to say and I think she's
supposed to be thankful that you, uh,

431
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,000
you know why I'm doing this and
highly favored equal letters.

432
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,590
Do I keep doing this?
What I'm thankful for is I fucking hate.

433
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,060
That's the one thing about Thanksgiving
that I cannot stand is listening to

434
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:27,930
adults.
No.

435
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,340
Like just you don't think that's a nice,

436
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:38,430
I don't like listening to it because
I am so jaded that I'm just like,

437
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,730
I just feel like people try to top one
another about like what they're thankful

438
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:48,900
for and how much more they understand
what's really makes you happy in life.

439
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,680
Yeah.
Um,

440
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,690
it's like when people have a baby and
they tried to sit there and talk about

441
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:58,170
like how much they love their babies,
so then they have to top the other person.

442
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,850
Oh my God, my heart is just filled
to the brim with love. Oh yeah.

443
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,420
I feel like my heart is on the outside
of my body now and then they just keep

444
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:10,560
fucking going about their heart
and she's like to, to begin at elm.

445
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:13,170
You can't love your kid.
Yes, I get it. Oh my God.

446
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:16,980
Is it standing up like all babies
eventually do. That is incredible.

447
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,850
Actually. Some babies can't and that's
what we need to be thankful for.

448
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,010
That's right. All right. Just go
to frame bridge dot. Yeah. Calm

449
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,600
blowed your photo from your computer
or directly from your Instagram feed.

450
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,470
Fucking ribs being messed up. You can't
sneeze and you can't laugh. I mean,

451
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,620
that is basically, that's my
wheelhouse of emotion. I live,

452
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,210
I live between laughing and sneezing.
I'm going to be robotic today.

453
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,400
Do we have ribs for as a, as
part of our entrees. Well,

454
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,260
I hope you didn't get into the peach
cobbler fight before they made those

455
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:55,630
goddamn things.
No,

456
00:28:55,631 --> 00:29:00,631
I waited until I just pictured him
pictured him taking the ribs and running.

457
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:03,060
It'll right along the crack of his ass.
No.

458
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,510
Is Your glaze for your mother fucker?
I don't think he would ever do that.

459
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:09,520
He's actually very classy,
I think.

460
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:14,160
Who wants sticky buns or if
you have a physical item,

461

they'll provide secure prepaid package
so you can mail it in for free.

462
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,230

online in any frame style.

463
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:25,190
Choose your favorite or get free
help from the talented designers.

464
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:27,050
He's a great idea.
Somebody you don't like,

465
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,500
you just take a selfie if you scowling
at them and then get it framed.

466
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,680
Yeah. And have a tee shirt on that says,
don't call me, you know, like that.

467
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,210
I like it. The, uh, the
expert team at frame bridge.

468
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,370
We'll custom your item in days,

469

470
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:51,370
loved ones along with the handwritten
gift or note. Here's one to send to an ex.

471
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,380
You'd somehow just having great fun with
a maniacal smile waving and with the

472
00:29:56,381 --> 00:30:00,640
tee shirt says, I'm moving on. You
can have a lot of fun with these.

473
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:04,600
The best part, instead of the hundred
shoe pay at framing a framing store,

474
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:08,560
their prices start at $39 in all
shipping is free. You know it isn't.

475
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:11,770
The best part is this copy's going to
keep going even though everybody already

476
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:16,210
gets the concept frame.
Bridge even offers a happiness guaranteed.

477
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,670
Unlike those peach cobbler people,

Hey,

483
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:36,340
next year we're going to
go back to cooking our own
meal, right? Oh, absolutely.

484
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:38,200
This is just because we got
the little one this year.

485
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,610
I feel like vinyl over as this like
a little overwhelming. So, you know,

486
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,820
I thought I could like you have a cheat
on a test and then he'd get it back and

487
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:50,710
you have kind of that feeling of
guilt. I never did. Uh, me undies.

488
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:54,720
Everybody. Ah, Ba du, Du, du [inaudible].

489
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,810
Where's my fucking pie? Du Doo.
Do Doo me undies me undies.

490
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:00,670
Make it as someone's gonna die.

491
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,110
I don't give a fuck about all your
excuses. Make the fucking thing,

492
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,360
put it in the caboose and I'm
going to drive away nice and happy.

493
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,990
I guess we don't get to zero. You'd
fucking cones there. All right.

494
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,430
Every year millions of people receive
the least light gift of all time

495
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,850
underwear. But we, I like what,

496
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,590
you know what's funny is buying
your wife sexy underwear. I mean,

497
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,200
is that really a gift?
Hey, put this on dressing.

498
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:34,270
Who Does d flower? You, you
like lingerie? I love lingerie.

499
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,940
You just like the word makes you
feel bilingual. Um, lingerie on,

500
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,940
but we still give it to try it.
We still give it to our family.

501
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,920
That's what you do. You take a picture
of underwear, you get it framed,

502
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,690
and then you send it to
somebody. And that's two for
one. That's weird, isn't it?

503
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:57,220
Sounds like some weird like Jeffrey
Dahmer Shit. It's just the underwear.

504
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm not saying you're in it with a stiffy,

505
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,340
but we still give it to our families and
our loved ones who just don't want it.

506
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,950
Uh, but maybe it's not, I
couldn't even just chuckle there,

507
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,160
but it's not that underwear to go.
Ha ha ha.

508
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,740
Oh that wasn't a bad one.
But maybe no,

509
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:23,500
because what happens is the muscle
spasms and they'll just fucking,

510
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:28,060
they start locking up. Okay. You know,
it's funny, he's trying to sneeze.

511
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:28,894
Relaxed.

512
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,710
When I tried to do was just exhale as
much air out as I can and then he'd just

513
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:35,980
go, who needs and it doesn't
get out. And then it just,

514
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,260
yeah, you need that Guy Barnes from
platoon and your face gone take the pain.

515
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,370
But maybe it's not that an underwears
the problem. It's the kind of underwear.

516
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,210
Let, Oh, let, let me
tell you about me undies.

517
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,010
The only underwear that makes for
an amazing gift, soft, flexible,

518
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:59,300
like the whore up the street waistband
three times softer than cotton.

519
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,220
Naturally sustainable sourced fiber.
The undies made underwear.

520
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:08,600
The perfect gift that everyone is going
to love. Just going to love you for,

521
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,210
you know it's funny.
Did they break up with modal modal?

522
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:14,390
Cause they don't talk about the fabric
anymore. Can they send me some underwear?

523
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,460
Underwear.
Can I have some too?

524
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,420
I don't want you walking around and
guys underwear. Oh wait a minute.

525
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:23,030
They also make them for the lady.

526
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,560
It's a Goddamn holiday miracle this year.
Don't give it. Don't give underwear.

527
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:28,670
It gives me undies.

Two more. Jesus Christ lift.

533
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,610
Nia. Can I come back? Oh absolutely.
I'll turn down the volume.

534
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,830
Change change into what?
Did you buy lunch at a Turkey dress.

535
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,770
Do you have the little Wu Shin
Peach Cobbler? That was a,

536
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,840
that sounds like a wrestler. Oh,
maybe that'll be my restaurant name.

537
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:13,220
Peach Cobbler. Peach Cobbler. I like
it. I was going to go as the millennial.

538
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,230
I just think it's a great
wrestling character.

539
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:18,950
You just get offended by everything
and then you go when you do some self

540
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:23,510
righteous con. Yeah. I'm going to be
peach cobbler. I like it. Okay. Okay.

541
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,740
There she goes. Everybody. All right.
I wonder if I use two microphones.

542
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:32,180
Will I be half is funny or twice as
funny? All right, lift everybody.

543
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:37,181
Lyft knows that drivers are what keeps
them moving so they do everything they

544
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:41,000
can to make sure their drivers
are happy on every trip.

545
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,940
Lift believes that being a ride
sharing drivers should be fun.

546
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,110
Oh, don't have too much fun. You
fucking drive in the car, man.

547
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,830
That's like when you fly one of these
stupid airlines in the stewardess says as

548
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:58,680
a singing songs like on southwest,
it's like,

549
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,950
will you shut the fuck up and
try to be remotely professional?

550
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,970
My life is in your hands.
You know,

551
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:10,971
I hate more is the people that laugh and
applaud and just egg them on and we got

552
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:15,780
a free show. I don't even know why we
have to get off the plane in Vegas. Uh,

553
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,830
lift believes that being a ride sharing
drivers should be fun if you have a good

554
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:22,910
time. So are the passengers. Um,

555
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,680
if you're choosing a Roger's
picture and everybody boozing it up,

556
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,240
we're having a great time,
right?

557
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,830
You're all going to be okay.
I said it God damn fucking words.

558
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,480
If you're choosing a ride
sharing company to drive for,

559
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:36,520
go with the company
that treats you better.

560
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,310
Lift Lyft was the first to offer in
APP tipping. When you drive for lip,

561
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,290
you get 100% of the tips.

562
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:48,060
Drivers have been paid over 200 million
in tips since the feature was introduced.

563
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,270
Lyft has taken the
guesswork out of pickups.

564
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,580
The new amp device.

565
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,260
Is it supposed to be app amp device uses
color coding to help passengers find

566
00:35:58,261 --> 00:35:59,820
their drivers? Well, that's
the light and the car.

567
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,540
You can earn hundreds of dollars a
week plus tips. One earned money,

568
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,620
drive more time. You want to earn
more money? Everybody worked more.

569
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,230
It's never been easier
to give yourself a raise.

570
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,040
It's a simple formula that's not a race.
Uh,

571
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:17,430
raises you make more an hour.
A raise is not you work more.

572
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,900
Jesus fucking Christ. I suck at math
than even I saw too. That bullshit.

573
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,520
It's as simple formula.
Happy drivers mean happy passengers make.

574
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:31,440
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides
get a perfect five star rating. Yeah,

575
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:36,030
and one out of 10 are good at math. Uh, s
of Jesus built. Don't burn this one down.

576
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:39,270
I love Lyft. I love Lyft.
Do you know what I mean?

577
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,190
Less people die from drinking and
driving because of Lyft. I love Lyft.

578
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,070

the podcast? Oh 38 minutes.

606
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,270
Are you guys thankful for the extra
eight minutes that I gave you?

607
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,490
Um, so I got my Christmas shopping
started. I'm very excited about that.

608
00:38:57,491 --> 00:39:00,100
I think I'm actually going to do
a family Christmas card this year.

609
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,600
Every year we were like, we should do
that and we never did it well this year.

610
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:07,420
God dammit we're going to do it
cause we've got a kid now, right?

611
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,700
If you don't have a fucking kid, you know,
past a certain age is, if it's just you,

612
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,180
you, your significant
other and your family pet,

613
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:18,940
don't you start feeling like
the other people judging you?

614
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,780
They haven't reproduced. What's
wrong with them? I don't know.

615
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:27,550
Maybe they're informed, they understand
how much you know, population.

616
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:31,330
Let's not get into the population problem.
Hey, hey. Hey. Fair enough. Fair enough.

617
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,440
Speaking of, fair enough, the
throwback podcast for you,

618
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,010
for those of you who are new to my
podcast and you're listening for the first

619
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:42,010
time,
which I am so thankful for,

620
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,680
I just feel it for me. If I
have board lists and Aries, um,

621
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,700
Andrew who I am also thankful for the
wonderful producer who picks out the music

622
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:58,420
every week. When we do the, the, uh,
after I, I babbled for a half hour,

623
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,020
we then had listened to some music
little interlude and then we go into a

624
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:07,021
classic podcast from a Thursday gone
by and another year or possibly earlier

625
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:12,130
this year, evidently last year,
one of these years I gave the uh,

626
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,540
the now classic.

627
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,590
I like to call it a classic
because I would like to do
something classic in life.

628
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,590
So I'm going to say that what I did
was classic. Ah, the fair enough.

629
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,360
Like how to get through your Thanksgiving
dinner with the simple phrase.

630
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,880
Fair enough,
Huh?

631
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:33,070
You don't feel that a
boarding a child is murder.

632
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,750
Fair enough. It is. You
killed something. Right?

633
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,590
Cause if you didn't do it, I mean dead,
dead based something. Fair enough.

634
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,090
I like doing that. I like arguing
the opposite side of political shit.

635
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,040
Like if I was in a conservative,

636
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,860
a conservative fucking state,
I would argue pro pro choice.

637
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,880
When I'm in La I argue
prolife and nothing,

638
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,340
none of it has to do with the
fetus or anything like that.

639
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:08,370
All it has to do with is me annoying
the person that I'm talking to them.

640
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,940
That's what I do. Anyways, that's,
that's the Thursday afternoon,

641
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:16,330
just before Friday. Monday morning
podcast. God bless all of you.

642
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,640
I am so thankful.

643
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,800
I'm so thankful to be able to go out and
tell jokes every night and I just feel

644
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:26,980
like for me,
all right,

645
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:32,050
have a great thanksgiving weekend you
cunt and I will talk to you on Monday.

646
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,130
I cannot wait to watch the football

647
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,910
game. And unfortunately, my wife has gone
into that fucking Westminster dog show,

648
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:41,420
which I really enjoy except for the fact
that it comes on at the same time as

649
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:43,130
the football game there.
I set it by

650
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:21,050
[inaudible]

651
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,980
the Turkey day to you all,
you know,

652
00:42:34,981 --> 00:42:38,850
stuffing and potatoes and pie and beer,

653
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,930
cranberries and gravy and
your cousin who's gay.

654
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,850
Um, hey, what's going on? How
are you? Happy thanksgiving.

655
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,480
Happy not having to fucking
go to work today. Huh?

656
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,730
You around the table.
You're sitting down yet both.

657
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,290
You haven't gone downstairs yet.
I got, I got some advice for you.

658
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,550
Today is going to be a day.

659
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:05,220
I think that's going to be
a lot of fucking arguments.

660
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,900
A lot of fucking arguments at the
table, right? The big fucking election.

661
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:12,270
Some people wanted the
guy with the eyebrows.

662
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Some people wanted the fucking
lady with the pants suit,

663
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,560
right? Um, this is what
you gotta do is see you.

664
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:24,090
You're already going to have a fight,
right?

665
00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:27,720
There's already going to be your older
brother. There's going to be this person.

666
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,960
There's going to be another per,
somebody's going to say something, right?

667
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,630
And you're going to be, you're going to
have a couple of wild fucking turkeys.

668
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:35,100
He's just standing over there,
you know,

669
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,150
eating a fucking appetizer or two and
somebody is going to be getting on your

670
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:43,740
nerves. Maybe somebody fucking
wife who won't shut the fuck up,

671
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,390
right? Why the fuck did he marry?
Or maybe maybe it's the husband,

672
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,850
Jesus Christ.
What is she doing with this guy?

673
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:52,770
All he does is fucking talk about himself.

674
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,460
Something's going to drive you up
the fucking wall. If it's not this,

675
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:58,920
it's going to be that this is,
this is the phrase,

676
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,300
this is a phrase that's going to save your
day. Okay? Save the whole fucking day.

677
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:06,240
Cause you're not going to change anybody's
opinion. Oh, these fucking jerk off.

678
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:09,060
Still yelling. He Hug. Well,
could you vote for Trump? Well,

679
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:11,010
what the Fuck About Hillary?
You're not changing.

680
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:12,510
You're just gonna fucking
yell at each other.

681
00:44:12,511 --> 00:44:16,440
So here's the phrase she got to use to
get through this fucking day. All right.

682
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,260
Along with the alcohol or whatever
drug you fucking want to use.

683
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,660
Fair enough. You know? Hey, fair enough.

684
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,640
That's all I, that's all you gotta do.
What'd you say? Hey, hey guys, guys, guys,

685
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:32,650
fair enough. Fair enough. Whatever.

686
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,270
You don't need to see
him anymore right now,

687
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:38,970
if you're younger and you still live
there, that's kind of fucking tough.

688
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,910
I don't know what to tell you, but if
you've already moved out of the house,

689
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,800
why are you still arguing
with these people?

690
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,950
Why are you still trying to
change their fucking minds?

691
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,430
You're not going to change their
minds. All right? I don't give a fuck.

692
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,960
If you majored in debating it,
you stupid fucking skull in the woods,

693
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,280
whatever the fuck it is.
You did the,

694
00:44:57,281 --> 00:45:01,260
now you're coming back and now you think
you know something and you think that

695
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:05,160
you fucking siblings want to hear it.
You know what? They don't the same way.

696
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,700
You don't want to hear the way
they fucking eat. When they had,

697
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,110
they've had a couple, two, three,
right? And all the sudden the man,

698
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,100
everything just sounds like they're
eating fucking mashed potatoes. You know?

699
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,730
You start having these murderers
fucking thoughts, you know,

700
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,700
just fair enough. Hey,
fair enough. Whenever it,

701
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,510
whenever it was that what
you think is that it's there.

702
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,470
How you look at the world. Hey God bless
Ya. Pass the fucking peas and carrots.

703
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,650
Fair enough. Fair enough. You know,

704
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,810
and that's all you got to do that
eventually the meal's going to be over.

705
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:37,950
All right,

706
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,380
and you're going to get in your fucking
car and you're going to drive away

707
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,210
unless you stay in there for the weekend,
then you've got to go out to,

708
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,220
I don't know, you got to.
Oh, but you gotta write,

709
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,810
you gotta get the fuck out of
there. Yeah. Thanksgiving is a,

710
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,000
it's such a great day.

711
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,020
There's no pressure to get any
gifts eaten a bunch of great food.

712
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,470
All of that is tremendous. Okay. Unless,

713
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,640
unless you go into her fucking
family's house or his family's house,

714
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,770
that's a weird one because you know,

715
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:10,710
you're used to all your
family's food and thanksgiving.

716
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:13,140
You know how it's supposed to taste
that you're going to go somewhere else.

717
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:15,960
It's going to taste a little
bit different. You know,

718
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,250
this is like a classics standup
bit like here's how it usually is,

719
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:24,180
but when you're fucking blah, blah,
blah, it's a whole different story,

720
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,220
right? Then you just got to suck
it up and just be like, you know,

721
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:34,710
worst case scenario, this
absolutely fucking sucks, you know,

722
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,220
in which case, fair enough. You know,
you don't know how to cook. Okay,

723
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,030
you're supposed to cook
today. You know, it's,

724
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:46,010
it's like when it's somebody's birthday,
most people can't sing, but God dammit,

725
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:50,880
you got to sing the songs. So they
do the best they can. Happy Birthday,

726
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,720
right? They do what the
fuck they can. Well,

727
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:56,210
sometimes she got to take the,
the,

728
00:46:56,211 --> 00:47:01,211
the same fucking theory of a tone deaf
person singing happy birthday to you

729
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:06,240
because they love you. Right? You
get, you got to apply that to food,

730
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,640
which is a motherfucker,

731
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,720
which brings it to how do I make it
look like I ate the shit when I really

732
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:16,980
didn't? Well, oh Jesus,

733
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:20,730
I don't know how to do this one. What you
gotta do is you've got to fucking, uh,

734
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,130
you got to engage in a lot of conversation
as you just sort of fucking hit and

735
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:29,260
the plate with your fork a little
bit as if you almost like, you know,

736
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:31,810
that noise people make when they
want someone to make a speech.

737
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:35,650
That annoying fucking
thing, you know? Oh my God,

738
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:38,110
nothing fucking makes
my god damn blood boil.

739
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,950
Like when I'm in the middle of a fucking
conversation at some con starts hitting

740
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:45,760
the glass with the fork and then for
whatever social fucking reason I have to

741
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:50,440
now shut up, you know? Oh
my God, that gets me going.

742
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:54,990
But not today. Not Today. Everybody.
Hey, fair enough. Hey somebody sounds so.

743
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,690
He's down the fucking street
over there with a little,

744
00:47:56,691 --> 00:48:01,620
a little fucking stone knocking
against some glass. You know,

745
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,480
I guess we all have to start as adults.
We have to shut the fuck up, right?

746
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:07,630
Yeah.

747
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,840
Like we're working for this asshole
bay. You know what? Hey, fair enough.

748
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:16,270
Fair enough. You know, he
just fucking sit there. Oh,

749
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:20,460
here we go. Oh good. Oh, here's a cliched
what? I'm thankful for speech. Oh,

750
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:23,200
is that what you're thankful for?
You know what? I'm thankful for lady.

751
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,100
Every fucking word that comes out
of your mouth is one less worry.

752
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,590
It was one word closer to the end of
whatever the fuck it is you're saying.

753
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,323
You know?

754
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,953
Okay.

755
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,090
That's when you know you're the passive
aggressive movies is when someone's in

756
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:39,240
the middle of that is you. You fucking
as some, it is just kind of pointed.

757
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:43,230
Somebody pointed some a plate,
you know, little fucking,

758
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,740
give me that bottle right there.
They're still yammering on. You know,

759
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,270
you know back in 1983 when we
first saw this house, right?

760
00:48:51,271 --> 00:48:53,220
And you just sit there
butter in your fucking roll.

761
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,450
Oh is this why the fuck are going to
go every God damn year from 1983 hey,

762
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:05,430
you know what? Fair enough. Fair enough.
Yeah. I didn't want to wear this sweater.

763
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,353
Right.

764
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:07,950
Okay.

765
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:12,120
He's fucking have these potatoes
instant these fucking potatoes it. Hey,

766
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:16,200
fair enough. Hey, you didn't, you didn't
have time to fucking cook rail once.

767
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,770
Maybe they ran out of them down the quiz,

768
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,210
the last fucking time they
ever ran out of potatoes.

769
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,150
They never run out of
potatoes and this country,

770
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:28,390
it's why so many fucking Irish people
over here, right? Fucking Irishmen.

771
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,140
And they tapped out on their
own country one fucking time.

772
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:31,980
And their whole history,

773
00:49:31,981 --> 00:49:35,550
they run out of potatoes and
everybody fucking jumped ship. Right?

774
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,110
But not the real Irishman.
The Real Irishmen and real ladies,

775
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:41,610
they fucking stuck around.

776
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,000
Okay.

777
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,550
I like these cowards that all
move to fucking New Jersey. Um,

778
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,620
but you know what a fair enough,
you know, they wanted some potatoes.

779
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,130
This is one of these days people, you
know, and if you're a younger man,

780
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,580
you got to enjoy the holidays cause
cause they're never going to get,

781
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,420
it doesn't get better then, you know,
cause you don't know any better.

782
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:11,350
So the food tastes the way the fucking
food is supposed to taste in your world.

783
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,410
Right? Everyone who's
supposed to be there is there.

784
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,653
You know,

785
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,410
it's when you get older and you start
expanding your fucking world and all of a

786
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:24,160
sudden you know Jesus Christ. I mean,
you're sitting there with somebody,

787
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:26,520
you might even, we have me and might be
sitting at their fucking table being,

788
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:31,060
I don't even know if with the right
person right now, what the fuck am I day?

789
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,340
You know what, hey say
what? Be Fair enough.

790
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,620
I'm with somebody that I probably was
never really in love with but didn't

791
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:43,700
realize what love was. You
know, and now here I am,

792
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,200
okay.

793
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,200
And all I gotta do is not getting
in an argument for one fucking day.

794
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,450
I can do this right by Saturday,

795
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,380
I want to be out of this
fucking relationship and you
know what all I'm going to

796
00:50:57,381 --> 00:50:58,610
be thankful then

797
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,170
you bet your sweet ass.

798
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,410
MMM.
Oh my God.

799
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:11,560
If it starts going into politics,
if it starts going into politics,

800
00:51:11,561 --> 00:51:15,300
she almost need like a referee
during this period of us history.

801
00:51:15,301 --> 00:51:19,620
She just literally step in with one of
those footlocker fucking athlete's foot

802
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,990
ref shirts.
Blow a fucking where's so,

803
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,920
and just send the two people
to opposite fucking Lazy Boys.

804
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,730
Let it go.

805
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,760
Let an AA. It's all she went
home. She went home solving.

806
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,920
Okay. She's not coming back. I don't
think she's got a third runner.

807
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:42,200
All right. Sit down. Sit
down. Sit Down Buddy.

808
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,230
Nobody's building a wall today.
Okay. Just fucking relax.

809
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,420
Maybe it could be the peacemaker.

810
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:52,940
Who knows who the fuck knows.
Um, I'm actually very excited.

811
00:51:52,941 --> 00:51:56,810
You wouldn't know it this
year for Thanksgiving because
I'm back in my house. Um,

812
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,770
yeah, there's going to be a
lot of arguments today and
it'll be a victory if I'm,

813
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,090
you know,
if you don't get in,

814
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:10,350
what maybe it could be that person that
keeps everybody out of it is everybody

815
00:52:10,351 --> 00:52:14,170
starts screaming and yelling. You know,
you know, he's a fucking sex offender,

816
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,680
blah blah, blah. Well,
she's a fucking day,

817
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,800
all that type of shit and you
can be in the back. I like,

818
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,683
Yay.

819
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,640
Just walk right in the middle of it.

820
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,240
Okay.

821
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:26,691
Oh Man.

822
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:31,250
I want to see a compilation of youtube
videos of the political fucking,

823
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:33,330
okay.

824
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,770
I've almost said discourse.
That's probably the wrong fucking word.

825
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:40,360
You realize how many fucking words I
know that I don't even know what the fuck

826
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:44,140
they mean. I just know what
words they go with. You know,

827
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,990
discourse goes with political,
political discourse.

828
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,990
You know, you use the word or
Nate when you were in a theater.

829
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,290
I don't know what it means.
I remember, you know,

830
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:03,690
I got a computer I can look at.
Hey, fair enough. I can look it up.

831
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:05,160
Why am I going to bore
you guys with the ship?

832
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:15,600
[inaudible]

833
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,550
can we switch?

834
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,090
Hey, what's going on?
It's bill burr and it is,

835
00:53:55,091 --> 00:53:58,170

00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,010
Does it sound sexy?
Um,

838
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,370
I just got back from the Improv in Tempe,
Arizona and uh,

the road in the last couple of weeks.

841
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,260
Well, that doesn't make sense.
Mathematically. I whatever,
I been on the road a lot.

842
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:21,480
My fucking voice is tired. So, uh,

844
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,860
I imagine some of you will complain.
I liked it better when you were angrier.

845
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,230
Go Fuck Yourself. How about that?
Is that angry enough for you? Okay.

846
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:40,950
I don't really have the fucking
energy to get as mad as I usually do,

847
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:45,870
but just know you know that I'm
thinking hateful thoughts towards you.

848
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,640
All right? You fucking angry. Cons. See,

849
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,920
that's why you got to watch out who you
surround yourself with is because when

850
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:57,700
you actually make a positive step
in your life, for example, uh,

851
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:01,920
being less angry, they actually, they try
to make it seem like it's a bad thing.

852
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,800
Dude, you changed man. You fucking change.
Look at you, you're smiling, you're happy.

853
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:12,900
You know, what are you doing? You
know what I'm doing right now?

854
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:17,490
I'm sitting here on my fucking couch
in the living room and it is my fucking

855
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:20,260
couch. If I was on the Selfie,
just sales on the software.

856
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,910
That's what I have in my living room.
I have a sofa and I have a fucking couch.

857
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,790
The fucking couch is fucking comfortable,

858
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:32,270
hence its name and I'm on it
because I'm fucking tired. Um,

859
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:36,310
let's try to hype my shit. Let's try
to be smart with this podcast, uh,

860
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,670
to begin with. Um, all right.

861
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,700
I'm doing a standup special I next hour
long special of filth and silly faces,

862
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,070
which might be the name. It'd be a
good name, Huh? Filson silly faces. Um,

863
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:56,370
maybe this, I don't fucking know. Listen
to me. I'm exhausted. Fucking exhausted.

864
00:55:56,371 --> 00:55:57,270
All right.
Uh,

865
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:02,271
I'm going to be taping it at the Fillmore
in San Francisco on December 17th.

866
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:06,840
I'm doing two shows,
one at one time and one at another time.

867
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,810
I don't have the information, but I
do have the link right on my website.

868
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:17,280
If you go on to [inaudible] dot
com and you go down to a, you know,

869
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:20,810
scroll down in the lower left hand corner
and you will get to the link and it'll

870
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:23,980
take you to live nation.com
we'll see tickets for

871
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,670
Julio Iglesias,
um,

872
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,340
fucking men at work.
You know,

873
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,540
what's the name of that other group
is the name of that fucking group.

874
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:35,740
What was the name of the group?

875
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,890
It was the name of the song and it was
the name of the album and lead singer

876
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:41,680
killed himself.
There's a trivia question.

877
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,120
Do you remember early
eighties big country,

878
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,210
there was a band called big country.

879
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,660
They had an album called big country
and the name of their hit song was big

880
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:54,820
country.
Needless to say,

881
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:58,330
with a well of talent
like that to pull from,

882
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,060
I dunno how they only had one hit song.

883
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,230
We're called cupcake is our thong
cupcake for our album. Cupcake.

884
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,200
Fucking calve.
K toodaloo and then that's it.

885
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:15,850
I mean what the fuck is wrong with you?

886
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:18,730
Don't think about switching
it up a little bit.

887
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:21,880
It's actually isn't funny cause the
lead singer ended up killing himself.

888
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,230
Okay.

889
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:27,370
You know the song should have been
called continent I. What was I thinking?

890
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,530
Um, anyways, so if you go on
ego on the live nation.com,

891
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:36,700
let me see if I can even fucking do it.
If I even can find tickets to my special,

892
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,280
I'll go to [inaudible] dot com
I ain't blue. I'll look at that.

893
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,610
What a good looking guy.
All right,

894
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:45,520
I'm going to click on the link and it
takes me to live nation.com let me do this

895
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:49,480
with you because so many of you fucking
idiots are going to it. Couldn't find it.

896
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,650
I clicked on the link and it
didn't do everything for me.

897
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,380
I don't know what to do.
You know what it's like?

898
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:59,860
That's like those Douche bags
you see on youtube. By the way,

899
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:02,910
you can learn how to play drums,
guitar of fucking Sitar.

900
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,570
Whatever you want to
learn right on youtube.

901
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:08,530
Somebody is going to show you how to play.
You know a Didgeridoo.

902
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:12,580
So these fucking guys get on
there and they show you. Exactly.

903
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,310
They slow it down and they
show you how to play it.

904
00:58:15,311 --> 00:58:20,200
And people still ask for tabs. Great
Video, but do you have any tabs?

905
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,460
Why didn't you just ask the guy to fucking
go over there and put your fingers on

906
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:27,580
the Fret Board for ya? You Lazy.
Fuck. Oh, there's Lampinelli.

907
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,770
They got a nice picture
of Lisa Lampanelli on.

908
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:32,740
Now let's see if my picture comes up.
No,

909
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:36,930
it goes right to fucking you too.
Okay.

910
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:41,820
And some guy with a cowboy hat named Brad
Paisley on his American Saturday night

911
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:45,360

there's some sort of search here.

912
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,110
Okay.

925
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:42,110

926
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:46,790
find fucking tickets cause I just
did it in real time. All right.

927
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:47,660
So anyways,
as I said,

928
00:59:47,661 --> 00:59:51,080
I'm sitting on my fucking couch here and
I'm actually watching a replay or the

929
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:55,910
Bruins sabers game. I don't know who wins.
Don't fucking tell me. Um, as what I do,

930
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,430
I take all the hockey games and I come
back like a fucking scout and I watched

931
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,090
like seven games. I already watched
when the Bruins beat the, uh,

932
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,680
Atlanta thrashers and I
gotta tell you something.

933
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,910
They got a great fucking team and I
don't know why they have an NHL team in

934
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:14,660
Atlanta because you should,

935
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:17,570
you should have seen the amount of
sales look like a fucking a AA meeting.

936
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,430
That's how many people were there for
the fucking thrashers game, you know?

937
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,960
And they got eagle yet Coleville Chuck
and a couple other fucking guys with

938
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:29,210
names. Like they should be
working the Russian border,

939
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,400
but they're fucking great players. But I
don't understand why did they put what,

940
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:35,660
what the fuck is wrong with the NHL?
Why did they put another team in Atlanta?

941
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:37,730
You know,

942
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:41,870
I don't understand cities that fail in a
sport and then get another opportunity.

943
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:43,161
You know,

944
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:47,480
I'm one of the few people that understands
why Los Angeles doesn't have an NFL

945
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:50,410
team. Well, let's say you
had two of them and you'll,

946
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,430
they both left you. Now,
right there, I mean,

947
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:58,100
granted, I don't know why the
fuck they left. Typical me.

948
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,690
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about,

949
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:04,940
but all I know is you don't put
fucking hockey in Atlanta. All right?

950
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,040
If the fact that the,

951
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:10,760
the original Atlanta
flames left 30 years ago,

952
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:12,290
if that wasn't enough of a tip,

953
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,020
why don't you listen to parliament
and they'll let you know that it's a

954
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:16,010
chocolate city.

955
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,210
You know who the fuck is
from Atlanta Little Wayne.

956
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,680
You've got everyone from like
little Wayne to like rem.

957
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,080
And I'm going to go out on a limb here
and I'm going to say Michael Stipe is,

958
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,880
he doesn't strike me as a
fucking hockey fan. You know,

959
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:37,760
the fuck is wrong with you. So
anyways, I'm watching the game.

960
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:40,790
There's like 30 people in the crowd.
There's no fucking energy whatsoever.

961
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:43,340
But now I'm watching the
Bruins sabers and I always,

962
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,700
never the Bruins play the savers.
I have to listen to the, uh,

963
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:49,490
the Sabres announcer.
I Dunno what the fucking guy's name is,

964
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:51,350
but I swear to God he could make,

965
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,220
he can make watching somebody sit
waiting for a bus. Sound exciting.

966
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:57,710
He's one of the best guys in the league.
So I always watch that fucking guy.

967
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:02,030
So that's what I'm doing. Was that boring?
I hope it was. Cause I'm fucking tired.

968
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,370
I'm really country this week. Um,
uh, why am I being an asshole?

969
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:11,150
It's thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is
come up is coming up. Let me, uh,

970
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:14,180
let me switch the tone
here. Um, you know, people,

971
01:02:14,181 --> 01:02:17,090
this is a week when everyone,

972
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,340
all Americans should sit down no chain.
When those fucking

973
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,850
Douche bags get on TV,
you know,

974
01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:27,960
with the ear muffs and their
little fucking NBC gloves,

975
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,870
they're fucking overcoats with the
floats going by in the background,

976
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:34,440
they start telling you about why you
should be so fucking thankful for your

977
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:38,140
fucking miserable life. You know, we not,

978
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,030
maybe if I was on network television,
you know,

979
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:44,700
with the cashmere coat that I
didn't have to fucking pay for,

980
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:48,540
I could enjoy my Turkey a little
more. This year. You know,

981
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,740
you know what all Americans
should be given. Thanks right now.

982
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:56,670
They should be sitting around going, what
the fuck happened? For whatever reason,

983
01:02:56,671 --> 01:03:00,690
everything from the bankers did that
fucking Twat who dropped you out nowhere.

984
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,610
Supposed to sit there and happy and you're
catatonic state with cranberry sauce

985
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:10,490
dripping down your fucking chin.
You know I can't. That's, you know,

986
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,230
this is such a great fucking holiday.
If you don't listen to anybody,

987
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:15,630
you know you don't have to buy any gifts.
And by the way,

988
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:20,370
Wednesday of this week,
for all you drunks out there,

989
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:21,750
I know you know this information,

990
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:25,440
but just bear with me for all you
amateur drinkers, drinkers out there.

991
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:26,580
This is the best.

992
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:31,890
The Wednesday before Thanksgiving is
the best night of drinking all year.

993
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,470
Hands down. All right? It's not new years.

994
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:38,730
You know when all his fucking idiots
go out with their silly hats and those

995
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:43,020
noise makers, why anyone goes out
that night? His fucking beyond me.

996
01:03:43,021 --> 01:03:45,930
Unless you're out there telling jokes
trying to make money, which I understand.

997
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,023
All right?

998
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,530
That night and Saint Patrick's day and
everyone's got their green plastic hats

999
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:58,600
and they're singing those stupid fucking
side green alligator and along net

1000
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:03,400
goes, why are all eating corned beef
sandwiches? Let me ask you this.

1001
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,230
During the course of the fucking year,

1002
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,930
the amount of times you go out
to eat and grab a sandwich,

1003
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:11,880
do you ever order a corned beef sandwich?
She had doubt cause she'd know.

1004
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,620
Does anybody even know what animal
that comes from? Cause I don't

1005
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,840
corn beef is ETA. That's
cattle, right? Beef.

1006
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,340
Pork is a pig.
Oh fuck it though.

1007
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:25,923
You know,

1008
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,650
you know I was riffing about this week
and I'll actually talk about it here in

1009
01:04:29,651 --> 01:04:32,650
the podcast because I don't give a fuck
about burning this joke just cause it's

1010
01:04:32,651 --> 01:04:35,770
a topical joke. Why did they
stop calling it the swine flu?

1011
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:41,290
Did all the farmers complain? We ain't
going to be a wholesale no fucking pig.

1012
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,620
You keep calling it
the swine flu you want,

1013
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:49,030
you want bacon up to your fucking eyeballs
in every fucking pig warehouse out

1014
01:04:49,031 --> 01:04:51,190
there.
You know,

1015
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,070
and don't even act like a don't affect
he because government is going to have to

1016
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:57,250
buy it back. So why don't you come
up with a new fucking name forward?

1017
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,290
H One n one is not the
name of a fucking plague.

1018
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:09,580
The black death. That's the name of
a plague. All right. You know what?

1019
01:05:09,581 --> 01:05:10,870
Let me fucking look that up.

1020
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,590
That's what it's pissing me off
here is we finally got a plague.

1021
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,190
You know something that I've been for for

1022
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,490
a long fucking time.
Imagine if I ended up getting it.

1023
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:25,200
They'd play this at my
funeral. Well, you know, we uh,

1024
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,170
he died the way he wanted to die. I
mean, the guy was into the fucking

1025
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,000
swine flu and let me, let
me, let me search here.

1026
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:37,270
Great plagues.
There's no way.

1027
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:40,840
I'm not on some FBI fucking watch
list after this goddamn search.

1028
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,020
How the fuck do you self spell plague?
I know it's not that way.

1029
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:48,670
Pla gue great plagues.
Did you mean I liked that after you,

1030
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:52,420
you fucking spell it wrong and then
Google is like, did you mean this?

1031
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,760
You fucking moron?
Of course I did.

1032
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,980
Yeah.

1033
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,200
All right. I guess there was
one called the great plague.

1034
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,970
What do I need to search?
Awesome plagues. Plagues.

1035
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,920
How would I just search plagues? All
right. This is a long fucking way to go.

1036
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:11,830
Just tell you why that they should
still call it the fucking swine flu.

1037
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,230
The 10 plagues of Egypt, Jesus
Christ, and one of the fluff.

1038
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:20,190
So fucking skinny over there, Huh? Time.

1039
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,650
You turn around them as a great way
to lose weight. 10 plagues in a row,

1040
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,420
even if you survive it,
right?

1041
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:28,810
There's no way you're gonna be more
than a buck 40 are Egyptian skinny.

1042
01:06:28,811 --> 01:06:32,830
I don't even know what they are. You only
a gypsy Shin. I know. Is Anwar Sadat,

1043
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,680
right? The 10 plagues. Ah.
Who gives a fuck? All right.

1044
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:42,940
Wait. The plague of lice.
The plague of flies.

1045
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:45,970
What does it some biblical Shit I fucking
give up. You know what I'm saying?

1046
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:50,200
They swine flu. That's a great
name. We'll think about it.

1047
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:52,900
If you could just put yourself a
hundred years in the hit in history.

1048
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,610
If you look back and they talk about,
you know,

1049
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:58,630
if when we're old we talk about it,
you know,

1050
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,240
every day much going. Great. And
then in 2009 the swine flu came,

1051
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:09,640
Ga Ga grabber.
Where did the swine flu come from?

1052
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,120
I'll show you where it came from.
Some foreign are fucked or fucking peg.

1053
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,960
Have you guys noticed that?
All the new diseases,

1054
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:25,460
there's never any sort of scientific
explanation of where they come from.

1055
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:30,590
So all you can do is go get down to
your local bar and listen to people

1056
01:07:30,591 --> 01:07:35,270
hypothesize. I don't know if you've
noticed, but anytime you go into a bar,

1057
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:39,470
if you ask where a disease came from,
that's the answer you always get.

1058
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:44,510
Somebody from another country had sex
with an animal and now we're all gonna die

1059
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:49,220
ever since age. Remember that? Do
it. I'll tell you what happened.

1060
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:53,000
Somebody fucking blew a monkey and
then they fucked this. Store this in.

1061
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:57,710
There you go. You know, you always have
to have some sort of nationalism in it.

1062
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,800
You know, dude, you don't see anybody
fucking pigs in this country, right?

1063
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,620
It's why we need to close the borders.

1064
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:09,310
Oh fuck yeah. I think the swine
flu would be great. You know,

1065
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,610
it'd be a nice cleansing,
a nice cleansing,

1066
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:16,070
get rid of bunch of, you know, you're

1067
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,910
not going to die of it. Just
take some vitamins, put on
a sweater, you'll be fine.

1068
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:23,120
It's just going to kill the week.
And that's what needs to happen.

1069
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:27,470
If you notice every other animal,
all the strong survive,

1070
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,380
all the weak die.
And that's why there's no,

1071
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:33,650
there's no traffic in the
squirrel community. Have you ever,

1072
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:37,970
have you ever just seen just a
fucking highways worth of squirrels,

1073
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,590
you know,

1074
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:42,800
peaking over each other's shoulders trying
to figure out what the fuck is going

1075
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:46,280
on upfront as are all waiting
to try to get some fucking,

1076
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,440
not a whatever the fuck they eat.
You know, you don't, you know why?

1077
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:54,380
Because they cause the weak don't survive.

1078
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:59,440
And the problem is is we have
medicine and we keep saving people.

1079
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,600
And that's why you can't get an empty row
on a plane anymore because seated next

1080
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:10,310
to you, a two fucking people who should
have died 30 fucking years ago. You know,

1081
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:11,990
and if you don't believe me,
watch them.

1082
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:15,020
Try to get their oversized
bag into the fucking, uh,

1083
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:18,500
overhead compartment and
watch how their brain works.

1084
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,830
As you're sitting there visually seeing,
why doesn't he just turn it sideways?

1085
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:25,460
If he has it going that way,
there's no way the door can close.

1086
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:29,270
I can't believe he just tried to close
the door again. Are you a fucking moron?

1087
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,730
And then I like when they're
sitting there with a suitcase,

1088
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:36,200
which I don't know if you've
noticed, is a solid object. Okay.

1089
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,430
And it's in the shape that it's in.
You can't push it in further.

1090
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:45,380
Like it's a fucking beanbag and it's going
to take the shape of the compartment.

1091
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:49,820
Like it's some sort of water based
thing. Alright. Jesus Christ,

1092
01:09:49,821 --> 01:09:54,620
Cleo. Oh my God, the fucking
dog just farted really bad.

1093
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:59,600
Really? You just got to lay there.
That's, you know, that's what kills me.

1094
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:03,230
It's not that my dog farts, it's the
complete lack of guilt on her face.

1095
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,580
She just doesn't give a shit.

1096
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:06,690
Okay.

1097
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:10,690
Evidently that causes a lot of stress,
doesn't it? Holding farts in or whatever.

1098
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:14,170
Some sort of methane gas.
I can tell you right now,

1099
01:10:14,171 --> 01:10:16,810
there's not a fucking ounce in my dog

1100
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:19,603
clout.

1101
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,080
Okay,

1102
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:25,640
why I button you that nice big bed.
I bought my dog this fucking insane.

1103
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:30,380
That cost me like 200 bucks,
you know and I,

1104
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:32,030
you know who spends 200 bucks in a bed?

1105
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:34,820
I'll tell you I'd fucking dog owner dies
because that's how much she love you

1106
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:39,050
dog. Right? And I swear to God I've
gotten this thing there and it literally,

1107
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,640
it loves his bed so much. You know
what it looks like when it's sleeves,

1108
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:46,310
how hard this fucking dog sleeps on
that bed. You guys watch pro football,

1109
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:50,420
you haven't noticed when somebody gets
knocked out for some reason when a wide

1110
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:52,880
receiver gets knocked out,
this always ends up happening there.

1111
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:57,640
Legs always end up crossed and then
they got that one arm like don't,

1112
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,110
he's like stuck up in the air.
You know,

1113
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:02,000
like they will right in the
middle of making a point.

1114
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,590
Like they were pontificating.

1115
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:06,080
If anybody that you haven't noticed
that that's how she fucking sleeps.

1116
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:10,130
Her back legs get crossed and one of her
and she lays on her back and one of her

1117
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:13,290
pauses up in the air. Like she just
got drilled by fucking Ray Lewis.

1118
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:18,240
Um, anyways, I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about here. Uh,

1119
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,390
now I'm interested in
this 10 plagues of Egypt.

1120
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:23,640
This has to be some sort of biblical Shit,
right?

1121
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,120
That they're still fighting about today
that makes them want to kill Jews in

1122
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:29,730
Egypt and Egypt and
Israel as number three.

1123
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:33,740
They always end up arguing about,
um,

1124
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:38,610
I say you let them fight it out. That's
my solution to the Middle East. You know,

1125
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,190
why don't we just pull up stakes
and let them have at it. You know,

1126
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:47,490
you want to fucking kill each other. Go
ahead. It's great for the environment,

1127
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:49,683
you know,

1128
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:55,170
sort of a manmade plague.
All right. That's what I do.
The week of Thanksgiving,

1129
01:11:55,171 --> 01:11:59,790
I say, Oh, I'm pro war. Um, all right,
let's, let's talk about football.

1130
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:02,970
I got a lot of shit last week
from people who are fans of, um,

1131
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:08,850
Peyton manning for, uh, talking about
what a cry baby that cry baby is.

1132
01:12:08,851 --> 01:12:11,270
And then a lot of points
that people brought up. Uh,

1133
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:14,850
for some reason I can't fucking find them.
I don't know where the hell they are.

1134
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:18,920
Maybe they're in junk, but I'll
basically paraphrase it. They're like, Oh

1135
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,070
God, you're going to, you're going
to give Peyton manning shitty.

1136
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,170
And you can say Brady's not a cry baby.

1137
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:28,040
What about that time earlier this year
when he turned around and asked for a

1138
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:32,090
flag and got the call?
What do you mean? Oh,

1139
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:36,860
that's your example of Brady being a cry
baby because he got hit and he turned

1140
01:12:36,861 --> 01:12:39,620
around and asked for a fucking flag.
What you mean?

1141
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:42,290
Like every wide receiver
when they don't catch a ball,

1142
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,180
every fucking play in the NFL.

1143
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,210
Every fucking guy gets up
bitch and looking for a flag.

1144
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,400
He got the flag.

1145
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:53,690
The same way Michael Jordan is allowed
to push off people and doesn't get called

1146
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:57,540
for a foul cause. He's one of the
stars in the fucking league. All right,

1147
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,490
and other points somebody tried to make,
they're talking about all the roughing,

1148
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:04,380
the passer,
the Tom Brady rule.

1149
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:09,330
Tom Brady did not fucking
campaign for that rule. He didn't.

1150
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:12,630
That was a fucking NFL rule where
they're like, wait a minute.

1151
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,330
If our pretty boy
quarterbacks aren't playing,

1152
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:19,650
the viewership goes down and we make
less money. That was a business decision.

1153
01:13:19,651 --> 01:13:22,140
Tom Brady didn't campaign
for that fucking rule,

1154
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:25,110
which brings me back to the crybaby,
Peyton Manning,

1155
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:29,730
who lost a playoff game that the patriots
and fucking cried at the end of the

1156
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:34,440
fucking game. And then he and his
coach, Tony Dungy made a fucking a tape,

1157
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:39,480
a game tape, sent it to the league. They
cried some more at the fucking pro bowl.

1158
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,810
Two weeks later, a week after
the Patriots won another title,

1159
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:46,920
they're fucking crying again about it.
And then he cried about it at the draft.

1160
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:48,600
That's why he's a fucking baby.

1161
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,170
And I forgot to bring up the fact when
he didn't win the Heisman trophy that's

1162
01:13:52,171 --> 01:13:55,770
on fucking youtube.
I believe Ricky Williams won it that year.

1163
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,260
And when he didn't win it,
the look of entitlement,

1164
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:01,860
Uber to put your professional quarterback.
I was bred for this.

1165
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,680
That fucking look on his face.
He's a fucking baby.

1166
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,020
Tom Brady has never lost a game and
then thrown his teammates under the bus.

1167
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,460
Peyton manning.
How many fucking

1168
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,920
more examples do you need?
All right.

1169
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:18,670
You Jack Asses with the fucking
surrogate fucking team out there.

1170
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:22,090
It's the Baltimore Colts, by
the way. All right. Or Colts.

1171
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:26,860
When I say boss Baltimore Coats, I don't
fucking know. Fuck all of you guys.

1172
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:30,400
You just fucking hate the Patriots because
we fucking win. And what did I say?

1173
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,940
Did I not say that the Patriots
were going to fucking kill the jets,

1174
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:37,150
which we did yesterday.
Other than that little brief hiccup,

1175
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:43,270
31 14 all right.
And I called that Rex Ryan Shit too.

1176
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:48,190
I've been saying it since the third
week. Rex Ryan, that poor bastard,

1177
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,540
the guy's out of his fucking mind.

1178
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,930
He's gonna make a halfhearted
attempt at his life this week. I did.

1179
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,240
My prediction is he's going to break his,

1180
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:59,110
he's going to break his tailbone
trying to hang himself and yes,

1181
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:03,340
that is a fat joke. All right. I
think I already did this on a podcast.

1182
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:05,380
My psychological breakdown of Rex Ryan,

1183
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,800
this is when I knew that guy
was out of his mind. Okay.

1184
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,650
When he first said when the Patriots
were going to play him and he was like,

1185
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:15,220
you know, I'm not here to kiss their
rings. I thought it was funny and I like,

1186
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:18,250
I like this guy, you know,
even though he's a coach of
the jets, he's talking shit.

1187
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:22,840
But then there was that week when a
player from another team said something

1188
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:25,450
derogatory about them and
he actually responded to it,

1189
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:30,160
a hedge co head coach responding to some
player on another team and he's trying

1190
01:15:30,161 --> 01:15:32,860
to act all cocky and confident and
it was something about his smile.

1191
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:33,850
I saw it in his face.
I'm like,

1192
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:38,470
this guy fucking cries himself to sleep
every night with a pint of fucking ice

1193
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:39,304
cream.

1194
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:40,613
You know,

1195
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,300
this is what I think happened.
All right? His Dad, Buddy Ryan,

1196
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:49,620
one of the great defensive coaches
came up with the 40 60 fence, you know,

1197
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,890
won a Superbowl. I'll tell
ya, doing something like that,

1198
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:55,820
you don't have time to raise your kid
and you don't have time to be there for.

1199
01:15:56,070 --> 01:16:00,530
So all this shit talk and fucking Rex Ryan
does all the shitty sane is this shit.

1200
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,730
He wished his dad said to
him when he was a kid kid,

1201
01:16:02,731 --> 01:16:05,070
so he could have built up some
sort of confidence, but he didn't.

1202
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:06,000
He wasn't around.

1203
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,380
So the combination is still looking for
his dad's fucking approval and living in

1204
01:16:10,381 --> 01:16:15,381
the shadow of a man who created the 46
fucking defense has caused this guy to be

1205
01:16:15,961 --> 01:16:18,780
an insecure shit talk and psychopath.

1206
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:24,260
And I think in his head he knows that
he can coach at the professional level,

1207
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:29,990
but the the fucking deafening
voice of doubt that he goes,

1208
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:33,390
that fucking is in that guy's head. I'm
telling you, that's why you overeat.

1209
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:37,940
He's one of those guys, you know
when that voice in his head's gone,

1210
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:41,660
racks, what are you doing coaching
at the professional level?

1211
01:16:41,661 --> 01:16:42,830
You're not as good as your dad.

1212
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,500
They're going to find out what
you're going to get fired.

1213
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:47,930
You'll never coach again.

1214
01:16:47,931 --> 01:16:49,880
You're going to have to move
home with your fucking parents.

1215
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:53,880
They're going to kick you out.
You get to be always [inaudible] fuck it.

1216
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,830
Oh yeah.
That's why eats all that ice cream.

1217
01:16:57,831 --> 01:17:00,830
He gives himself that fucking ice cream
headache and that's all you can focus on.

1218
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,310
It only takes a couple of Tylenol pms,

1219
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,500
and then he goes to sleep and the next
day he wakes up with all that dairy

1220
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:10,640
product rolling around in his fucking
intestines and he's hung over from all the

1221
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:12,890
Tylenol PM's and then he
does a press conference.

1222
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:15,650
He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.
He's like one of those wrestlers,

1223
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:20,540
you know, he's got the sickness. He's
like, Jake, the snake. If he was fat,

1224
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,430
Hey, you know what? Speaking of which,
somebody asked me a question. Um,

1225
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,900
this week they said a bill,

1226
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:31,280
you always drop references to
wrestling on your podcasts. Um,

1227
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,790
and during your appearances a,
the ric flair mentioned suplex thing,

1228
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:38,040
a girl you've said that
during your standup special.

1229
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:42,690
So are you actually a fan or were you
a fan back when you were a kid? Um,

1230
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:43,081
I don't think,

1231
01:17:43,081 --> 01:17:46,260
I know one adult in real life who
watches wrestling and I don't blame him

1232
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:49,870
because a lot of the time it's corny
and it's Corny as hell help. Uh,

1233
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:53,520
I'm still a fan and it's just one
of those things I never grew out of.

1234
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:56,290
And if you're a fan, who is your
all time favorite? All right. Uh,

1235
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,900
your first guess was correct.
I was

1236
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,540
each fan when I was a kid and,
um,

1237
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:05,440
but Rick Flair, I have to
admit, I got into ric flair

1238
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:08,750
because of one of the listeners here
when he brought up the flare chop and I

1239
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:13,400
started watching Rick flair and I realized
what a fucking genius he was. So, um,

1240
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,980
I watched the WWF when I grew up,

1241
01:18:15,981 --> 01:18:20,630
so ric flair was in something else.
I think with the von Erickson,

1242
01:18:20,631 --> 01:18:22,390
I kind of used to watch that,
but I,

1243
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:27,391
I watched WWF and when I first started
watching Bob Backlund was the champion.

1244
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:34,240
And I want to say Bruno Bruno Sammartino
might've been Ted dibiase was the

1245
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:38,870
intercontinental champion until Pat
Patterson took that foreign object out of

1246
01:18:38,871 --> 01:18:43,040
his trunks, smashed him in the face with
it, and somehow the ref didn't see it.

1247
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,750
Then Pat Patterson became Unicon
Anelle champion and a, let's see me.

1248
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:48,890
I sound like the fucking rain man,

1249
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,430
as I always do when I try
to remember this shit.

1250
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,393
Uh,

1251
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:58,230
the tag team champion was Tony
Galleria and Larry's a Bisco and uh,

1252
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:01,580
okay.

1253
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:06,110
I don't know fuck else.
Ivan put ski Polish Power Bulldog Brower.

1254
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:07,400
Okay.

1255
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,690
Mr Fuji, Mr Sido, the moon.
Remember the fucking moon dogs,

1256
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:14,150
those three fat hillbillies
with their overalls.

1257
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:15,150
Yeah.

1258
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:18,320
And then one wouldn't be laying on the
floor with the dog bone. And I was,

1259
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:22,730
I was scared shitless to them. You
noticed as used to scare me with George,

1260
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:25,610
the animal Steele when he came out with
a green tongue and he'd be eating the

1261
01:19:25,611 --> 01:19:30,200
belt buckle. I thought it was
fucking real is fucking Harry back.

1262
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:35,620
Killer Khan the way you used to scream
that big Mongolian son of a bitch used to

1263
01:19:35,661 --> 01:19:39,300
scare the shit out of me, you
know. Then I realized like George,

1264
01:19:39,301 --> 01:19:42,890
the animal Steele was like a fucking
substitute teacher on to Detroit and it

1265
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:44,720
just kind of all fell
apart. So then I, you know,

1266
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:49,140
I watched it right through Mr.
Wonderful Rowdy Roddy Piper.

1267
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,170
MMM Jesse

1268
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:57,780
the body Ventura when he used to call
a Tito Santana used to call him Chico

1269
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:01,030
Santana.
I don't care about no Chico Santana.

1270
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:04,840
I used to watch back then and then I
briefly 10 years ago I got back into it

1271
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:09,841
cause I was roommates with Robert Kelly
and he started watching the Rock and

1272
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:16,440
stone cold Steve Austin.
I got into it briefly during then,

1273
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:20,360
but I used to mainly watch, uh, just
the shit talking on the mic but,

1274
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,230
and it hasn't been good for a while,
so there you go.

1275
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:27,630
There's my long drawn out question.
Fucking answer to your question there. Um,

1276
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:30,910
all right, let's get on with the
podcast here. Um, oh wait a minute.

1277
01:20:30,911 --> 01:20:31,980
I have to hype one other thing.

1278
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,880
I'm really all over the place
as opposed to the usual.

1279
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:38,990
I'm even more so all over the place.
Um,

1280
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:45,060
I have a new website out there.
It's called a uninformed radio.com and a,

1281
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:49,920
that's the radio show. I deal with Joe to
Rosa and myself. Uninformed, no reading,

1282
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:54,480
no research, just strong
opinions. It's our radio show. Um,

1283
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:57,840
we are unable to get it onto iTunes
because we're not going through some big

1284
01:20:57,841 --> 01:21:02,040
conglomerate. Um, so we're just
going to be putting them up for free.

1285
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:05,070
You can listen for free and eventually
you'll be able to download them for a

1286
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:08,220
buck of whack. So there you go.
That'll be your options. You know,

1287
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,181
if you don't want to pay,

1288
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:11,220
you can just sit there and
listen to it at your computer.

1289
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:15,000
But if you know you want to take it on
your iPod and become the hit of the year,

1290
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:17,970
the next party you go to,
you know,

1291
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:21,240
just in case you go to a party and
they don't have a fucking computer,

1292
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,220
you can download it, you can
download it for a buck. So, uh,

1293
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:30,930
we're going to be trying to get that
up as quickly as possible. And, uh,

1294
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:35,490
and that's it. So anyways,
really been all over the place.

1295
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:38,460
You know what I did last last week?
No, Bill, what the fuck did you do?

1296
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,220
I went and I saw,
uh,

1297
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:45,840
the best rock show I've seen in a
long time. I went to go see, uh,

1298
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,880
uh, what does it them crick, those crick
them crooked vultures. So what the fuck?

1299
01:21:50,881 --> 01:21:54,750
I kept calling them crooked buzzards,
them crooked vultures.

1300
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:59,560
I went to go see which is uh, uh, I
guess it's, that's super group. Scott,

1301
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,910
John Paul Jones from led Zeppelin,
uh,

1302
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:07,590
David Grohl on drums and I don't know
how to say the lead singer's name cause I

1303
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:11,370
never heard anybody say is that Josh
Hommie from Queens of the Stone Age and

1304
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:12,390
eagles of death metal.

1305
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:17,130
I've been listening to all those bands
for years just because, uh, you know,

1306
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:20,130
I've been a big fan of Dave girls drama.
And so whenever he would go, you know,

1307
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:22,710
do like killing joke or he'd
be in Queens of the Stone Age,

1308
01:22:22,711 --> 01:22:26,670
I got into those guys. So anyways,
I went to go see the show. Um,

1309
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:29,640
and I bought their new album.
They were actually selling it on vinyl,

1310
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:32,430
so I had to get it so I could
seem cool at my next party.

1311
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,940
And if you get a chance,
um,

1312
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:39,720
I mean their whole album is up on
youtube, so listen to it. If you like it,

1313
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:43,590
don't be a cunt. Go out and go buy
it and then go see them on tour. Man,

1314
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:44,670
they will fucking unreal.

1315
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,630
And Dave Grohl might be the best
live rock drummer I've ever seen. Uh,

1316
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:53,370
the guy that he's just, he's fucking
unreal. The guy was the shit. And uh,

1317
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:58,140
I dunno man. I felt like I was like a
fucking kid watching that were, you know,

1318
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:00,930
even when you watch a great band and you
just wish you were up there doing it,

1319
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:02,190
and then as you're driving home,

1320
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:05,380
you start thinking all the cool stuff
that happened and then were actually

1321
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:06,100
fantasizing

1322
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,280
that it was you that did it. Like
that's how fucking good the, uh,

1323
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:14,070
that's how I was just fucking
awesome. They just a fucking
killer band and uh, uh,

1324
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:17,620
it's all I've been doing is listening to
this shit. So, uh, if you get a chance,

1325
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:19,030
definitely go check those guys out.

1326
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:20,500
Or if you want to see
the show that I went to,

1327
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:25,300
what's already up on fucking youtube
because people record everything. Um,

1328
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:31,440
just search them crooked
vultures will turn w I l,

1329
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:35,010
T, e, r, n and then Los Angeles
and you'll get to see the fucking

1330
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,150
show. I saw it. You know, I haven't,
I've been fucking sitting here.

1331
01:23:39,151 --> 01:23:43,470
I got the God damn game on mute here.
Who's winning?

1332
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:45,120
Is it still one to one

1333
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:56,140
my allowed to do that or am I on some
sort of copyright infringement here? Oh,

1334
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,480
it's one to one the third period.

1335
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:58,933
Okay.

1336
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:02,950
Buffalo's got a fucking great goaltender,
sons of bitches.

1337
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:07,660
You know something I wouldn't mind seeing
buffalo winning poor bastard. You know,

1338
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:12,240
you got fucked in 99.
What else did you go to the finals.

1339
01:24:12,241 --> 01:24:15,750
So you go to the finals in the 70s.
Was that Saint Louis?

1340
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:19,410
Do you lose to the flyers? I don't
fucking know. No one gives a shit bill.

1341
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:24,470
All right, let's plow ahead here. Uh,
last week I did the answer to the, uh,

1342
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,790
the women thing.
Why is it never enough?

1343
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:31,920
And that created an
absolute shit storm and a,

1344
01:24:31,921 --> 01:24:34,650
of basically misogynistic
trashing of women.

1345
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:38,640
So let's continue it. No, I'm kidding. Uh,

1346
01:24:38,641 --> 01:24:42,120
we're going to try to balance it
out here. I actually, I took one,

1347
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:46,950
two comments from women,
one supporting what we said last week,

1348
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:49,770
and another one who just really brought
up the point that should have been made

1349
01:24:49,771 --> 01:24:53,700
from the beginning. So let me read the
first one. All right. Uh, first off,

1350
01:24:53,701 --> 01:24:56,440
bill loved the podcast.
Especially this week's,

1351
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,910
I have rarely heard someone so succinctly
describe what is wrong with the

1352
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:04,470
predominant attitudes of
women, even men today. Um,

1353
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,890
you know what most women really
want from men? It's not material,

1354
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,310
nor is it being spontaneous.
It runs deeper than that.

1355
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:16,530
Women wants sacrifice. Did I read this
last week? I can't fucking remember.

1356
01:25:16,531 --> 01:25:21,400
Maybe I did. I'm losing my
mind. Women, one sacrifice.
Most women will tell you, uh,

1357
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:25,440
your dreams are selfish if
they don't revolve around them.

1358
01:25:25,441 --> 01:25:29,280
And that real love is
compromised and commitment. Uh,

1359
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:34,010
they want you to drop. I'm just trying
to remember, did I already read this?

1360
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,840
I have fucking,
I'm going to plow ahead.

1361
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:37,610
They want you to drop
your hopes and dreams.

1362
01:25:37,611 --> 01:25:39,530
They want to see the moment you give up.

1363
01:25:39,531 --> 01:25:43,490
I emphasize that because once that moment
has passed and you have nothing left

1364
01:25:43,491 --> 01:25:44,271
to sacrifice,

1365
01:25:44,271 --> 01:25:48,810
you become that 30 to 40 year old loser
that they will leave to the guy who asks,

1366
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,000
why is it never enough?

1367
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:53,150
It isn't until you've given up
everything that is important to you.

1368
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,170
This is what love is for most women.
It's not even that they are selfish,

1369
01:25:57,171 --> 01:26:01,400
but propose precisely the opposite.
It's the complete other lack of self.

1370
01:26:01,401 --> 01:26:02,810
I think I already read this,
didn't I?

1371
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:06,830
The nature of love is not
that of a host and a parasite.

1372
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:11,750
Love is only possible between two complete
our independent individuals who do

1373
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,910
not require sacrifice from one another.

1374
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:17,420
Real selfish people do not need
approval or love from others.

1375
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,050
They simply would not give a fuck.
I don't know if I agree with that.

1376
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:26,320
What you're basically saying is you need
a significant part of your life that

1377
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,520
it's not two overlapping circles.

1378
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:31,160
It's two intersecting circles
is basically what it is.

1379
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:35,570
So where you intersect is your lives
together and where you're not is your own

1380
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:38,780
fucking life that you're allowed to lead.
Um,

1381
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,830
sign off. That was a bunch
of generalizations but
that's what we do here.

1382
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:45,980
But this, this lady here just basically
sums up the whole thing. She says,

1383
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:46,890
Bill Lady,

1384
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:50,060
you've been talking about men who have
been doing all these nice things for

1385
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:53,540
women and the women have been
complaining about it like selfish cuts.

1386
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,220
My response is this,

1387
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,300
men need to stop allowing women to get
away with anything they fucking want.

1388
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:04,370
Seriously, it's the pursuit of pussy turn
men into all men and to whiny bitches.

1389
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,940
All these guys have been whining about
the way these girls react when they do

1390
01:27:07,941 --> 01:27:10,340
something they think is nice.

1391
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:14,840
What these guys really need to do is
stand up for themselves and tell these

1392
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:19,460
chicks they have two options. Say thank
you or I don't get number two. It says,

1393
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:23,150
try to be nice and let them
and let him complain about it.

1394
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,310
I don't know what that means.
Um,

1395
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:28,700
these guys are writing to you instead
of country confronting these women.

1396
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:32,750
So the women aren't even aware that
their behavior needs to change.

1397
01:27:32,751 --> 01:27:34,730
They are only making it worse.
Exactly.

1398
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:40,070
That's really the truth of all
of this shit. You know, I mean,

1399
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:44,390
I actually ran into the guy when I
was in Tempe who wrote that, uh, that,

1400
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,030
that letter of why isn't it enough?
I met his girl,

1401
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:49,310
she was a sweetheart and everything.
It's just kind of a,

1402
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,760
it just was a great question to ask.

1403
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:57,200
That set off a lot of fucking
frustration and a yeah.

1404
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:58,890
What the reality is,

1405
01:27:58,891 --> 01:28:03,891
is what this woman wrote here is that
100% true is that you really shouldn't be

1406
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:08,570
writing me bitching about it. You
should be talking to you, a woman.

1407
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:11,780
But you know, some of it is, you
know, people just want to vent.

1408
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:16,460
And then there's other times people are
there in fucked up situations and by

1409
01:28:16,461 --> 01:28:20,680
fucked up situations, I mean,
they're married. So, um,

1410
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:24,830
I think what a lot of guys learned quickly
is when they get married is now that

1411
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:28,220
they're legally bound to someone
and if they break up with them,

1412
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:31,520
they lose half their shit.
It becomes,

1413
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:36,410
it's not a balanced situation,
you know,

1414
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:42,320
if, I shouldn't just just put that
on guys, but it's whoever has more,

1415
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:45,590
whoever brought more into the
relationship when you get married,

1416
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:48,920
you fucked because you stand to lose more,

1417
01:28:48,921 --> 01:28:51,440
which we can in you're arguing position,

1418
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:56,810
which you have to do is get to that zen
place where you don't give a fuck about

1419
01:28:56,811 --> 01:29:00,350
materialistic goods and then you can
really go off on whoever the fuck you're

1420
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:04,110
with. But the reality is, you know, same
thing, like when you see like, you know,

1421
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:05,670
the big thing,
when I first started doing comedy,

1422
01:29:05,671 --> 01:29:08,640
as I used to always see female comics
would go on stage and they'd be joking

1423
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:13,470
about how guys don't know what they're
doing in bed. Debbie. Like, oh my God,

1424
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:17,790
they have no idea where it is or what
the dual ba Ba ba Ba, Ba, you know,

1425
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:22,350
which I understand the frustration
of that. But it's like, so you know,

1426
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:27,570
I'll wait. Sam Kinison did the bit,
just tell us, tell us what to do,

1427
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:31,380
we'll fucking do it. Um, I think
that's what a lot of complaining is.

1428
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:32,890
God knows a lot of my complaining.
I said,

1429
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,550
well why don't you just walk up to the
person or thing that you're bitching

1430
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:39,660
about and tell him how you feel and
just take out all the fucks and the

1431
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:42,990
insulting the,
the insults,

1432
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,310
I dunno, you know, at this
podcast fucking sucks.

1433
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,720
I'm going to call it out before you guys.

1434
01:29:48,721 --> 01:29:51,570
It's just podcast is just
sucked this week. All right,

1435
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:54,750
I'm all over the fucking place.
I'm fucking exhausted.

1436
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:57,000
It's a Goddamn holiday weekend.
You can you guys and really,

1437
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,380
how hard are you work in this week?

1438
01:29:58,820 --> 01:29:59,653
You know,

1439
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:04,230
hasn't somebody gone come in and brought
a pie in and somebody is wearing an

1440
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:08,190
awful brown and orange
Thanksgiving sweater. You know,

1441
01:30:08,191 --> 01:30:12,180
maybe it's your manager to show
that he has a human side. You know?

1442
01:30:12,181 --> 01:30:13,950
Isn't that the worst when
you hate your fucking boss?

1443
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:15,030
And then around the holidays,

1444
01:30:15,031 --> 01:30:19,050
all of a sudden he just lets up a little
bit and tries to act nice, you know,

1445
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:22,290
or it's a female. She gets a
little bit nicer, you know,

1446
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,170
and the whole time she's sitting there
wishing you a happy thanksgiving.

1447
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:29,580
You just want to fucking kicker
right in the box, you know?

1448
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:31,800
But you can't,
you fucking can't.

1449
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:38,430
Well, I was sad. What the fuck is it?

1450
01:30:38,431 --> 01:30:42,030
It's one to one 1515 minutes left
in the third period you don't,

1451
01:30:42,031 --> 01:30:44,340
one of the hardest things to do I think
is to be an announcer for hockey now

1452
01:30:44,341 --> 01:30:46,890
that they took and taken out the red line,
the fucking game.

1453
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,520
You'll break your neck sitting
there watching the fucking game.

1454
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:53,460
That's why I like it watching it on TVs
because I don't have to keep turning my

1455
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:57,570
head. The camera, the camera moves
for me. It does all the work.

1456
01:30:58,350 --> 01:31:01,170
What? I'm literally out
of Shit to say, you know?

1457
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:02,670
I feel like right now the south bad,

1458
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:06,030
this podcast is when you bomb is a
comedian is that works. When, when,

1459
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,720
when shit is going great,
when everything you say is killing,

1460
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:13,200
when you're on stage,
basically what happens is,

1461
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:17,910
is you've done about 20
minutes of material and you
look down at your watch and

1462
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:20,340
you watch says you've been
up there for 55 minutes.

1463
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,030
That's when you know that you're
fucking killing. And conversely,

1464
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:25,620
when you're bombing,

1465
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:30,650
you will do an hour's worth of material
in 17 minutes and all you have left is

1466
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:32,250
your closing bit.

1467
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,310
And you look down at your watch and you
realize that you've been on stage for

1468
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:40,230
just under 20 minutes and
you're like, wow, now what
the fuck am I doing? You know,

1469
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:44,610
your mouth gets dry. That's when
you start going into the crowd.

1470
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:49,080
Hey is, you know, so what's there
to do around here and a Raleigh,

1471
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:53,430
North Carolina. Look at
this guy over here. Ah,

1472
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:59,070
what do you do sir? Oh,
you're a plumber. Really? Oh,

1473
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:03,520
so a, I bet your butt crack is
always shot. Fucking kill me.

1474
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:07,340
You know, then you just,
you just fucked. Hey,

1475
01:32:07,341 --> 01:32:11,320
how about a round of applause for the wait
staff, you know, keep it going for him.

1476
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,840
You know, and I just want to
thank all you guys for showing up.

1477
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:17,200
I know it's a recession and I appreciate,
uh,

1478
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,790
you know how bad I am for the
tropes. You know, you know,

1479
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:23,500
whether you support going to war or not,
you know,

1480
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:27,220
these kids are out there that laying
down their lives and they're away from

1481
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:29,230
their families in thanksgivings this week.

1482
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:34,231
I think we should all sit back and give
thanks and be appreciative that I've

1483
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:37,300
already done an hours worth of fucking
jokes and you conserve and laughed at

1484
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,134
anything.

1485
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:42,940
So now I'm technically in overtime
even though contractually I already,

1486
01:32:42,941 --> 01:32:47,590
I owe you like another 40 minutes
of fucking comedy, you know,

1487
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:52,750
and let's not forget all the people who
have died in boating accidents this year.

1488
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:53,860
You know,

1489
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,650
a lot of people don't know that boating
accidents is one of the leading,

1490
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:00,160
leading causes of death.
When human beings are out in the ocean

1491
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:07,930
and you start remembering jokes
from the early party, your act,

1492
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:12,820
and you start telling him, you know,
yeah, they did a study the other day.

1493
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:17,350
They said, you know, 90% is shark attacks
actually happened in shallow water.

1494
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,950
No Shit. That's where the people are.
It's called the fucking beach. Oh yeah.

1495
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:27,920
What are their people swimming to Europe?
Let's go to France. You pussies. Ah,

1496
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:31,500
you like that joke.
That's a joke for my act in 2001.

1497
01:33:31,501 --> 01:33:35,940
I'm too fucking old jokes in my act.
What else did I used to fucking do?

1498
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:37,510
Okay,

1499
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:40,980
I already did one of those. My
original jokes. You guys see these uh,

1500
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:45,850
rap group criss cross warm it up, Chris.
Warming up, Chris. Hey, go to bed.

1501
01:33:45,851 --> 01:33:49,180
Chris. What do you like
nine years old? Oh.

1502
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,150
Oh my God.
I had horrible jokes.

1503
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:56,240
Okay.

1504
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:00,230
Easy jokes about working in a dental
office. A people, I got news for you.

1505
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:05,550
Six years and neglect is not cured by
a tic tac in the waiting room. Hey,

1506
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:11,990
you guys ready for your next deck? Too
Bad. I still got another 30 minutes to do.

1507
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:18,060
Ladies back me up. Guys are crazy, right?

1508
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:23,080
I mean, you know, where are we?

1509
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:28,210
We don't give a shit that's going be
just searching for shit to say what,

1510
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:33,300
but I'm, it's, it's great to be here
in Raleigh. You know what I mean?

1511
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:38,040
It's guy, you know, you come out here
to Raleigh, you know, they got a,

1512
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,800
he got a mall. All right folks, I'm
not gonna lie to you. I'm out of jokes.

1513
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:46,350
I wish you could just do that and
just fucking become honest. I'm,

1514
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:49,020
I'm out of fucking material. I don't
know what the fuck you guys want from me.

1515
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:52,920
Come on. Tic, tic, tic, tic, tic,
tic, tic, tic. All right, 41 minutes.

1516
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:56,100
Does that qualify as a podcast?
Oh, I actually, you know,

1517
01:34:56,101 --> 01:34:58,010
I forgot one story was
supposed to be here. I think

1518
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:02,720
I got one other question. This is a
Phillips some time as I scroll down,

1519
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,430
what's up with scrolling?

1520
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,930
There's another when you won't do a full
conclusive Haber with some old rolling

1521
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:10,730
on. All right, unacceptable. Here you go.

1522
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,880
Here's a classic example where somebody
should just have used the phrase

1523
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:17,060
unacceptable and I really want to
go into this bar with this guy.

1524
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:21,620
When there's a classic
fuck over. Um, so bill,

1525
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:25,790
I show up to this local sports bar at
11:00 PM the night before my birthday by

1526
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:28,880
myself. While do, that's
your fucking fault, you know?

1527
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:30,570
Yeah.

1528
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:31,830
I don't know what your problem is.

1529
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:34,800
Stop lashing out at the people
around you right now. Look at me.

1530
01:35:34,801 --> 01:35:37,770
I'm taking it out on you cause I'm out
of material here and whatever the fuck it

1531
01:35:37,771 --> 01:35:41,010
is, I've lost my stream of consciousness.
Still one to one, by the way,

1532
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:45,990
with 12 minutes and 32 seconds to go.
Hey,

1533
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:49,200
if anybody knows the name of the announcer
for the, uh, the Sabres I'd love,

1534
01:35:49,230 --> 01:35:51,840
I'd love to know the guy's name.
I mean, I guess I could Google it,

1535
01:35:51,841 --> 01:35:55,320
but I know when I do, there's going
to be like fucking 58, you know,

1536
01:35:55,321 --> 01:35:58,950
buffalo sabers.net backslash org.
And I don't want to go through that shit.

1537
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,540
All right. So anyways, Bill,

1538
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:04,680
I show up to a local sports bar at
11:00 PM the night before my birthday by

1539
01:36:04,681 --> 01:36:08,760
myself. All right. He goes, the bartender
asked for my id, I give it to her,

1540
01:36:08,761 --> 01:36:11,040
she hands it back and
ask me what I would like.

1541
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:14,550
Now I'm not looking for comments,
but you would,

1542
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:19,110
you would think the bartender would be
aware of the date and time and have some

1543
01:36:19,111 --> 01:36:23,250
snide remark about hanging out by myself.

1544
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:24,990
Um,

1545
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,290
okay.

1546
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:29,370
This close to my birthday.
Well,

1547
01:36:29,371 --> 01:36:32,100
I think she's just trying to see or he's
trying to see if you're of age and hunt.

1548
01:36:32,101 --> 01:36:34,710
Right? I don't fucking know.
Anyways. Uh, I'm not upset.

1549
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:39,300
I'm just expecting a stupid comment.
So I ask, uh, what the specials are.

1550
01:36:39,450 --> 01:36:44,430
She tells me that the large domestics
are three bucks and well drinks or two

1551
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:47,820
bucks. I see they have blue
moon on tap. I'm not a huge fan,

1552
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,600
but as 22 ounces of beer for three bucks,
I'll suck it up.

1553
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:56,250
I order. She says, okay. And serves
it. Fast forward to the bill,

1554
01:36:56,490 --> 01:37:01,490
it seems a tad high and I
see I was charged for 50
for each of the three beers.

1555
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:06,780
I ask about the bill and she said, oh,
only domestics are $3. My reply was,

1556
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:11,550
blue moon is a domestic beer. It's
made in America, and she says, no,

1557
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:15,240
domestics are Bud Miller and
course. Now, wait a minute.

1558
01:37:15,241 --> 01:37:17,940
I thought Blue Moon wasn't
that made and fucking Belgium.

1559
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:22,380
Now I got to fucking look it up before
I take your side here because I really

1560
01:37:22,381 --> 01:37:26,250
want to be blue moon.
All right.

1561
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:30,630
Blue Moon brewing company. All right,
here we go. Let's see what we got here.

1562
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:37,340
Oh, Jesus Christ. It's a whole
fucking website isn't Blooma.

1563
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:41,670
It's not a Belgian beer date of birth.
Enter.

1564
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:43,330
Okay.

1565
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:46,690
I have to give you a valid date
of birth to read about beer.

1566
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:49,750
Are you fucking kidding me? All
right, let's go to Wikipedia.

1567
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,280
God knows that's fucking accurate,
right?

1568
01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:56,790
A blue moon is a full moon. It's
not what I want. Blue Moon bear.

1569
01:37:56,791 --> 01:38:00,750
You fucking, no one gives a shit
about space. Actually, I do.

1570
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:05,610
My brother's really in this space
and I learned the other day I thought

1571
01:38:05,611 --> 01:38:08,190
something was the north star. He's
like, that's not in the north star.

1572
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:11,340
That's Jupiter. I don't get the fuck out
of here. He goes, yeah. First of all,

1573
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:15,120
he goes, stars, twinkle
planets reflect light.

1574
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,690
So ever since then I've been
looking up at the sky and go on.

1575
01:38:18,691 --> 01:38:19,860
That's a fucking planet.

1576
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,340
I want to know what that is and
I want to go buy a telescope.

1577
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:26,610
But there's no way to buy telescope
without looking like a fucking pervert.

1578
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:27,743
You know what I mean?

1579
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:32,190
That's yet another thing that pervert to
fucking ruin the same way gay guys have

1580
01:38:32,191 --> 01:38:37,140
ruined cowboy boots, cowboy hats, and foo
man shoes. You can't fucking, you know,

1581
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:43,190
you can't wear any of that shit unless
you're on a fucking ranch rustling of

1582
01:38:43,221 --> 01:38:46,220
fucking cow to the Goddamn ground rules.

1583
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:49,380
People think you're out
there blowing someone. Um,

1584
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:50,470
okay.

1585
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:52,140
All right. Blue Moon Beer. Let's see here.

1586
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:58,290
Blue Moon beer is Molson
Coors brewing company.

1587
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:02,040
All right, so Yaz fucking right, good.

1588
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,090
Now I can side with you because
I really want to go off on this.

1589
01:39:04,091 --> 01:39:06,600
So the fucking dude is ordering
a domestic beer and she goes,

1590
01:39:06,601 --> 01:39:10,290
no domestics or Bud Miller
and cores. Two things. First,

1591
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:14,640
why couldn't she mentioned that Blue Moon
is not considered a domestic beer when

1592
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:18,750
I ordered, but second, let's look at
the bigger picture. I'm sure bill,

1593
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:22,380
you've run into this. You're told
domestics are on sale for happy hour.

1594
01:39:22,381 --> 01:39:23,730
So you order a Sam Adams.

1595
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:27,210
At which point you told Sam Adams
this is considered a domestic beer.

1596
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:30,900
Well actually, um, you
may have thought, yes,

1597
01:39:30,901 --> 01:39:32,970
Sam Adams is a domestic beer.

1598
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:37,080
It was made by the blood of the
American patriots. He had dumb cunt.

1599
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,020
I liked this guy. Uh,
who made the decision?

1600
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:43,110
Who made the decision to call
Shitty Beers? Domestic beer.

1601
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:47,790
What kind of a euphemism is that?
Whenever this happens in the future,

1602
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:51,420
I'm going to ask for a manager and tell
them that not including all domestic

1603
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:54,450
beers with their domestic
specials is unacceptable. Dude,

1604
01:39:54,451 --> 01:39:57,840
you should just fucking said that unless
this is actually made an a different

1605
01:39:57,841 --> 01:40:01,470
company, a country and Molson
Coors brewing just bought it.

1606
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:03,270
You guys want to hear about it?

1607
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:08,720
Blue Moon is a Belgian style wheat beer
brewed by the Molson brewing company in

1608
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:09,960
Golden,
Colorado.

1609
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:15,470
It's a fucking domestic beer was launched
in 1995 in Canada is marketed as a

1610
01:40:16,921 --> 01:40:20,130
similar beer called Rickard's white.

1611
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:25,820
Why do they not have blue moon's up there
is blue moon offensive and it's brewed

1612
01:40:27,091 --> 01:40:31,830
in Montreal, Quebec. All right, so some
of it is brewed in another country.

1613
01:40:31,831 --> 01:40:36,750
Is that they're out? Well then it should
be called Rickard's white, right dude,

1614
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,750
bottom line is you got fucked.
Yeah, that's what they should say.

1615
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:44,751
Our are cheap ass beers are a r three
bucks and anything with any sort of hops

1616
01:40:45,151 --> 01:40:48,180
and flavor in it is going
to be for 50 they go,

1617
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:51,960
that's the big outrage of the week.
This dude get fucked. All right.

1618
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,130
That's the end of my lackluster one.
You know what I mean?

1619
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:58,300
What the fuck do you guys want from me?
I do one of these every fucking week.

1620
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:02,050
I'm running out of stories to tell you.
I already did that. Gay Guy joked before.

1621
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:05,110
I've already done the fucking,
I think I need to take a break.

1622
01:41:05,111 --> 01:41:08,350
Just like the foo fighters. You know
when they sold out Wembley Stadium,

1623
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:11,230
they sold it out twice and
they were sitting around going,

1624
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:14,150
what the fuck else can we
do? Just like when, uh,

1625
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:18,280
the Beatles sold out Shea stadium
or the police sold out Shea stadium,

1626
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,790
that's when you just realized, well,
the only way to go now is to go down.

1627
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:26,830
I think I've begun the backward slide.
I'm sliding down the backside of a,

1628
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,850
of the podcast and I was
actually thinking about that.

1629
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:35,530
How long am I going to do this
podcast? You know, Oprah's retiring.

1630
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:42,460
She's calling it quits
after 25 fucking years.

1631
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:44,550
Okay.

1632
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:44,881
I mean,

1633
01:41:44,881 --> 01:41:49,230
I've basically done one episode every
week for the past two and a half years or

1634
01:41:49,231 --> 01:41:52,170
two years. Two months. So 52 weeks a year.

1635
01:41:52,171 --> 01:41:57,171
That's 104 episodes plus like another
20 maybe move up to 125 episodes.

1636
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,620
All right. Back in the
day, if you did a sitcom,

1637
01:42:01,621 --> 01:42:04,140
you needed a hundred episodes
to go into syndication.

1638
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:08,940
I'm in syndication right now, so
think about that shit. I'm like,

1639
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:13,110
if this was the drew Carey show,
I would be in like the seventh season,

1640
01:42:13,111 --> 01:42:16,440
you know when they've added the
fat chick with the crazy makeup.

1641
01:42:16,441 --> 01:42:19,800
Cause we're on a story ideas,
you know.

1642
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:23,910
So my question to you is how,
how much longer should I do this?

1643
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:26,580
When do I bow out gracefully
and come out with a new,

1644
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,310
a new form of a,

1645
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:33,610
what do they call this
shit on the Internet? Huh?

1646
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:39,900
Viral. Do I, do I take it to
the next level? I do a video.

1647
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:45,330
Maybe I'll do a video podcast next and
I'll do like, I'll, I'll have puppets now,

1648
01:42:45,331 --> 01:42:47,880
right? I'll have the cont puppet. Right.

1649
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:52,200
What'd you just be sorta some twice
shape tortilla with a red lips on it,

1650
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:55,860
you know, that can talk
and uh, whatever. I'm,

1651
01:42:55,861 --> 01:43:00,780
I'm just sort of brainstorming here
and a fucking, I'll puppets a creepy,

1652
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:02,500
you know,

1653
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,790
you ever go back and watch
Mr. RogersRogers' and
just see how creepy those

1654
01:43:05,791 --> 01:43:09,450
fucking puppets are. You know why?
Cause their mouse did move king Friday.

1655
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:10,810
Yeah.

1656
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:12,630
Hello Lady McMullen.

1657
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:17,920
My name is much think I'm
out of my fucking mind.

1658
01:43:17,921 --> 01:43:20,590
I actually did it in the living
room this week. You know,

1659
01:43:20,591 --> 01:43:23,270
that's why I had the Nice
Carnegie Hall sort of, Ah,

1660
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:27,800
acoustics in here.
All my dog fucking walked out on me.

1661
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:31,790
You don't have really think my dog finds
me annoying. You know, my practice,

1662
01:43:31,791 --> 01:43:34,100
my guitar,
she has a habit of going,

1663
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:41,840
gives me like a big fucking exhale.
And if I'm practicing anything up high,

1664
01:43:41,841 --> 01:43:44,690
like I was trying to learn how to play
the beginning of, for those about to rock,

1665
01:43:44,691 --> 01:43:47,600
we salute you,
which is way up on the neck of the guitar.

1666
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:51,050
And I was trying to play it the way
Angus plays it, which is a combination,

1667
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:52,130
a using a pick

1668
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,070
and plucking with two other fingers.
So needless to say,

1669
01:43:55,550 --> 01:44:00,230
it sounded like somebody was choking
a sparrow. And, uh, my dog, you know,

1670
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,750
she sort of got,
you know,

1671
01:44:02,751 --> 01:44:06,830
just lifted her head up and sort of looked
at me and I laughed because I knew I

1672
01:44:06,831 --> 01:44:07,551
was bugging her.

1673
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:11,660
And then I was so focused on trying to
be able to play this for some stupid

1674
01:44:11,661 --> 01:44:14,360
fucking reason. And, uh,

1675
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:18,710
when I came out of my fucking comatose
state, I looked and the dog had left.

1676
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:24,320
So, uh, I don't know what the point of
that was. You know what the point was?

1677
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:27,070
The point was to somehow get
to 50 minutes because um,

1678
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:31,000
if I don't do it for 50 minutes,
then I can't continue to,

1679
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:34,430
to not get paid for this.
Um, let's hype my website,

1680
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:39,230
[inaudible] Dot com I'm once
again go there and a fucking,

1681
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:44,390
I dunno, go to my show in Cleveland or
go to my show at Sacramento. It was in a,

1682
01:44:44,391 --> 01:44:46,010
in a,
the punchline is Sacramento.

1683
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:50,720
There's the next two weeks I have coming
up and a or come on out and watch my

1684
01:44:50,721 --> 01:44:53,540
live taping. Oh, somebody asked
me a question and they're like,

1685
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:56,330
which one of the two shows
are being taped that night?

1686
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:59,060
Are both of them being taped?
And if you take both,

1687
01:44:59,061 --> 01:45:04,050
will you combine both and
make one special? Yes. Okay.

1688
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:06,030
Yes I will.
That's what happens.

1689
01:45:06,031 --> 01:45:09,960
You take both of them and if I just have
one set that's just fucking awesome and

1690
01:45:09,961 --> 01:45:12,450
I loved it. Wire to wire, which
I hope is going to happen.

1691
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,620
I'll just take that cause I'm,
I'm really big into a,

1692
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:20,480
you know, not creating a
performance that didn't happen. Um,

1693
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:25,280
my CD is all one show. Why
do I do this? We only did,

1694
01:45:25,281 --> 01:45:29,840
we only taped one show, so that's
all one show. Uh, my HBO special,

1695
01:45:29,841 --> 01:45:30,680
we did too.

1696
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:35,780
And I forget which one joke is from the
first show and the rest was all from the

1697
01:45:35,781 --> 01:45:36,321
second show.

1698
01:45:36,321 --> 01:45:41,321
It's so it's basically
one performance and um,

1699
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:46,430
yeah, so that's what I'm hoping for.
So yes. If you're wondering, yes,

1700
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:50,240
both shows will be taped and um,

1701
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,280
this is what you basically hope for.

1702
01:45:52,281 --> 01:45:55,250
What you do is you go out and you
fucking rock on the first one. See like,

1703
01:45:55,251 --> 01:45:55,551
all right,

1704
01:45:55,551 --> 01:46:00,110
I've got a great special already and
then you can just totally relax and fuck

1705
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:03,290
around on the second one. You know,
kind of the way you, you know,

1706
01:46:03,291 --> 01:46:05,470
you get into like your head,
like you just in a club rather than,

1707
01:46:05,471 --> 01:46:08,780
than doing a special, that's
where you want to be. Um,

1708
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:11,270
and that's what I want to try
to hope to do. So that's it.

1709
01:46:11,271 --> 01:46:14,900
I need to rest my voice. I hope
everybody has a wonderful thanksgiving.

1710
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:19,250
I would have played a Thanksgiving
song on my guitar, but uh,

1711
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:22,520
none of them exist.
There aren't any thanksgiving songs.

1712
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,260
And I'd like saying Shit like
that cause there's always a,

1713
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:29,420
actually there is one.
The Lawrence Welk Orchestra did.

1714
01:46:29,421 --> 01:46:31,440
Why nobody gives a fuck.
There's none. There's no

1715
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:36,250
claims. Is there a famous
one? You know what,

1716
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,380
this is the last thing I'm
going to Google this week.

1717
01:46:38,381 --> 01:46:42,230
Let me see if I can find a fucking
thanksgiving song. You know,

1718
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,200
we used to do for Thanksgiving,
me and my family,

1719
01:46:44,201 --> 01:46:48,280
we are the family that I was part of.
It really wasn't my family.

1720
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:49,883
MMM,

1721
01:46:50,710 --> 01:46:51,200
okay.

1722
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,670
We used to fucking, uh, we used to,

1723
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:55,460
we decided we were going to play football
one year and it became a tradition.

1724
01:46:55,461 --> 01:46:57,890
We would play football and it was great.

1725
01:46:57,891 --> 01:47:02,891
It divided the family in half and it
would always be sleeting and raining and

1726
01:47:03,471 --> 01:47:06,590
uh, we would end up getting into
huge fights. Like, fuck you,

1727
01:47:06,591 --> 01:47:11,570
fuck you fist fights. And,
uh, it was really bizarre.

1728
01:47:11,571 --> 01:47:15,290
And then we'd sit down, we'd all
be fucking soaking wet, you know,

1729
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:18,500
grass stains and,
uh,

1730
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:23,570
that the food was great. You know,
still one of my favorite days.

1731
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:28,620
Thanksgiving
music.

1732
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,293
Okay.

1733
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:32,680
Get the fuck Outta here.

1734
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:34,150
Okay.

1735
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:35,440
Thanksgiving songs.

1736
01:47:37,630 --> 01:47:40,420
They actually have thanksgiving music.
You fucking kidding me?

1737
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:45,670
The Fuck Outta here.

1738
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:47,210
Okay.

1739
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:48,320
No, you don't. You know what this is.

1740
01:47:48,321 --> 01:47:51,890
This is a classic thing when you go to
search something and it's just music shit

1741
01:47:51,891 --> 01:47:54,530
just came up. There's no
thanks. Wait a minute.

1742
01:47:54,531 --> 01:47:57,710
We go to fucking the evil that is iTunes.
This is the last thing I'm gonna do.

1743
01:47:57,830 --> 01:47:59,690
This is overtime people.
You don't have to listen to this.

1744
01:47:59,691 --> 01:48:03,260
This is all for me right now.
Just checking this out for
me. All right, let's see.

1745
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:05,720
Itunes.
Let's click on that.

1746
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:07,120
Yeah.

1747
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:07,481
You know,

1748
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,970
it really is time to end this fucking
show when you guys listen to me just

1749
01:48:09,971 --> 01:48:14,730
fucking googling. Um, all

Giving music.

01:48:20,270 --> 01:48:20,890
Yeah,

1752

Susan Boyle.

1753
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:27,250
The thanksgiving waltz.

1754
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:28,860
Okay.

1755
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:31,770
The harvest home come.
Ye Thankful.

1756
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:37,210
A Charlie Brown thanksgiving. Let's listen
to that. Let's have a listen to that.

1757
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:53,200
Am I the only person who finds Charlie
Brown music? Unbelievably depressing.

1758
01:48:57,850 --> 01:49:01,240
Get off the black keys. You
can't, I'm trying to be happy.

1759
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:05,710
Jesus Christ with the miners.
Is that minor chords in
their minors or sad? Right?

1760
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:10,900
Majors are happy. Somebody is taking
guitar lessons. Actually I'm not.

1761
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:19,410
What is that fucking
we're out of potatoes.

1762
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:29,570
I wish I knew about classical music. I
could have made that funny. This is where,

1763
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:30,423
uh,

1764
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:31,290
yeah,

1765
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:34,050
we're out of potatoes. The fifth
movement, whatever the fuck they say.

1766
01:49:34,051 --> 01:49:35,310
This is the harvest home.

1767
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:43,180
Is that the same?
I hate that.

1768
01:49:43,181 --> 01:49:47,950
Fucking inbred music at Bluegrass Shit.
He's Ye thankful.

1769
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:58,230
There you go. That's some, uh,

1770
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:02,470

enjoy thanksgiving. Don't have sex.

1771
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:05,860
You're all going to hell. That was the
name of that song. All right. Yeah,

1772
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:09,100
I guess there was Thanksgiving music.
Who gives a fuck? Um, all right,

1773
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:13,870
everybody have a great thanksgiving.
It's still one to one, as far as I know.

1774
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:18,390
Hey, you go brings it into the
zone. Craig g wheeler, right?

1776
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:29,380
How about a score?
There we go for 41 left,

1777
01:50:29,381 --> 01:50:33,760
one to one and a stoppage of play and
a stoppage of the podcast. All right,

1778
01:50:33,761 --> 01:50:37,180

and I'll talk to you next week.

1779
