1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,261
Hey,

2
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:04,920
what's going on is bill burns is time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:09,240
November 18th, 2018 what's
going on? How I, yeah.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,970
Um, as you can tell, uh,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,770
I am not using my fucking
mixer or anything right now.
I left everything at home.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,790
Um,
I'm,

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,910
I'm doing a little staycation with
my wife staycation all I ever wanted.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,430
Um, and we're having a
great time. All right.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,060
And if there's other married people out
there, I highly recommend it. It's cheap.

10
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:37,440
It's a great way to reconnect with
your spouse and be like, oh yeah,

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,290
we love each other. Remember,
I totally forgot. You know,

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,970
he'd get all caught up in your job.
You got the kid, the, the, the,

13
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,980
the fucking termites took
over your fucking house.

14
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,510
Whatever the hell's
going on in your world.

15
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:55,110
He didn't just start taking
each other for granted. Um,

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
so we've been out here for a couple
of days, having a good time. Um,

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,910
it's weird though.
Once you have a kid,

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,590
then you go on a staycation
and you're loving it,

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,130
but then you know your kids staying with
the relatives and then you miss your

20
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,670
kid. So you know, I don't know,
whatever, what are you going to do?

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,740
And he is hilarious. I smoked a
cigar last night, right. And um,

22
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,730
I didn't finish it. So this
morning I went down to the, uh,

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,360
the hotel pool,
which was fucking gigantic.

24
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:25,410
And I already had it in my head that I
was going to do 10 laps there and back

25
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,280
counting is one.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,910
And this thing was like the one of the
biggest fucking pools I've ever been.

27
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:33,870
And it was like literally two
and a half times the size of, uh,

28
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,860
you know,
even the average hotel pool.

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,730
I mean the deep end was
eight feet and then 10 feet.

30
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,460
I mean this is an old school law in
anything but a diving board. You know,

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,281
that's how old I am.

32
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:51,570
I remember you'd go to a fucking hotel
and not only did the hotel have an actual

33
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,910
deep end, you know,
cause now you go there.

34
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,980
The things that like
fucking four feet deep,

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,750
no diving is written all
around the whole pool. Um,

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,730
but back in the day,
man,

37
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,680
you'd fucking show up and it was
a giant pool at the deep end,

38
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,590
they'd have a fucking diving board
and they would just say, hey man,

39
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:13,050
you want to break in? That
could drown yourself. You know,

40
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:17,310
we have all the facilities out there
for you to succeed. It just that.

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,980
Um,
so anyways,

42
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,010
I went down there and I swam around and
like I always have to go like the length

43
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,990
of the pool underwater and
like in order to make it,

44
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,250
I had to come up to the surface and then
do the crawl really quickly just to get

45
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,460
to those final like four feet.
Um,

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,160
and I was so god damn out of breath and
I still get like freaked out when I'm in

47
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,890
pools and shit because I
saw jaws at a certain age.

48
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,740
It's why I can't go in the fucking ocean.
And I was still thinking like,

49
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:50,100
what if there's a, there's a
fucking alligator, you know,

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,370
some Douche bag drug dealers,
you know,

51
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,530
our fucking boxer or rich person, you
know, those are the people, you know,

52
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,650
some fucking Saudi Arabian fucking print
buys a house in the Hollywood hills,

53
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,060
you know, they always, they always,

54
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,540
they always like fucking have a
pet cheetah or some shit, you know,

55
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,830
and then everybody has the exotic cats
and how this dude's got to top everybody

56
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:19,270
else and he gets a fucking alligator
and the thing gets loose and then slips

57
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,790
into the pool.
I think that's like,

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,270
that's the shit that I think about
when I go swimming fucked. Um,

59
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,950
especially in a pool that big where
I felt like I was in a lake. Um,

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,980
but anyways, so nia ends
up coming down, right.

61
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,640
And I told her it was like 10 in the
morning and I still had like the,

62
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,810
a little bit of that cigar left.

63
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,930
I got Michael Back to Rome since smoke
the rest of that cigar, she goes,

64
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:44,500
grows at 10 in the morning, you're going
to smoke a cigar at 10 in the morning.

65
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,690
She goes, what? Wait you, what
are you a fucking crime boss?

66
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,220
Uh, I did. I really married
a fucking hilarious woman.

67
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,190
Um, but anyways, um,

68
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,330
before I tell you more about my
staycation, all I ever wanted,

69
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,790
um, I got to tell you
about the, uh, the Patrice.

70
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,980

00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,000
then I got a fucking UK,
Scotland run

144
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,750
started in February, February
26th. I'm going to be in
Liverpool. Never been there.

145
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,800
She loves you. Yeah. Yay. Yay.
Right. The fucking Beatles.

146
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,810
Um, the next day I'm going
to be in Glasgow, Scotland,

147
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,270
and he virgins Glasgow. Remember that? Bon
Scott, when he sang the Jack Live there,

148
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,670
um, Birmingham, um, in England,

149
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:41,650
Manchester on the 2nd of March.
And then I'm going to be in London,

150
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:45,790
England for return engagement
at Royal Albert Hall. All right.

151
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,480
And then, all right, I know
all you fucking Americans up.

152
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,670
Fast forward to this cause you
don't give a shit there you. Um,

153
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,690
okay.

154
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,340
April 29th, I'm going to be in
Reykjavik, Iceland. All right.

155
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,990
Which you can be my next
little vacation there.

156
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:06,730
I'm going to go there a few
days early. Take my wife, um,

157
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,720
Copenhagen, Denmark on the
30th, then Stockholm, Sweden.

158
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:15,260
I've been there for fucking
ever on the 1st of May.

159
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,460
Helsinki on the second
Oslo, Norway. I mean those,

160
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:22,520
those are the first ones when I
was going overseas. Stockholm,

161
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,210
Helsinki also love those
places. And then, uh,

162
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,370
Amsterdam, was that my first?
Maybe that was my first one,

163
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,331
not Amsterdam.

164
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:36,050
I went to Rotterdam and then I also
did the Kilkenny Ireland festival.

165
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:40,340
Those are my first two international
date. So there you go. And uh,

166
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,590
and then later on that year,

167
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:46,010
I'm going to do a whole fucking
run through a Australia.

168
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,720
So next year I'm going to be all
fucking international. Billy. All right.

169
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,170
With that, let's get back. Let's,
let's talk. Let's talk about,

170
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,260
I dunno what I want to talk about,
man.

171
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,430
Other than fucking
staycations fucking rule. Uh,

172
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,460
let's talk about the Ohio state
fucking buckeyes. All right?

173
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Can somebody explain to me how the fuck
those guys are always in the playoff

174
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:14,570
talk.
It just blows my fucking mind.

175
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,070
How will you ranked 10th in the country
and you're still going to be one of the

176
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:20,630
top four fucking teams.

177
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,730
Okay.

178
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,520
How come college football
cannot get that fucking right.

179
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,290
I don't get how you could let up 50
over 50 fucking points to the Goddamn

180
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,290
Maryland. Terrapins you got a
football team had been there.

181
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,090
They're fucking mascot. Is a turtle
fucking drops 50 fucking points on you.

182
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,930
They just, they're always in it. I don't,
I don't get it. That fucking year two,

183
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:46,800
when they had the same record is Penn
state and Penn state beat them head to

184
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:50,010
head and Penn state stays
home in Ohio state goes,

185
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,220
I don't know what the fuck what
they have on the board there.

186
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,870
But once again, once we,
in the end it, you know,

187
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,270
something I used to like Ohio state,

188
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,250
but now to me that becoming like the
Alabama of the fucking north and now I'm

189
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:10,630
just fucking rooting against them. They
get all these fucking calls, it gets kids,

190
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:14,350
kids. It's fucking ridiculous. Um,

191
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,260
so Michigan,

192
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:21,280
Ohio state is going to be the
motherfucking game next week.

193
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,170
I cannot wait for this game.
I don't really hate Ohio
state, but I just, you know,

194
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,400
that that always bugged me that Penn
state didn't fucking get in. You know,

195
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,080
it's hard cause I love Jason Lawhead
and these in Ohio state fans,

196
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:35,170
so that there was that,

197
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,180
that's the one thing that prevents
me from fucking hating on Ohio state.

198
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:42,820
But you know, even Ohio state Buckeye
Fan, she got to admit, I mean,

199
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:47,170
what the fuck did this, there's something
going on. You're not going to admit it.

200
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,011
You know,
it takes a,

201
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:51,650
it takes a huge fucking sports fan to look
at his team and be like, oh, you know,

202
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,390
yeah, yeah. And did that, that
was probably wrong there. Um,

203
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,860
it's not like I fucking do that. Right.
And I fucking stick up for all my teams.

204
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,490
I'm a hypocrite. What do you want from
me? I'm the typical fucking guy. Anyways,

205
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,600
Michigan,
Ohio state.

206
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,580
This is going to be the fourth time Jim
Harbaugh is going to go into Columbus or

207
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,780
staying at home,
whatever.

208
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:13,480
He's going into Columbus this
weekend and he's got to go in.

209
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,310
He has to fucking good at gun.

210
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,340
He doesn't have to get it done cause
there's no better head coach out there.

211
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:19,390
So I think we'll be fine.

212
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,650
But Michigan is fucking do.

213
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,470
All right.
And I actually think that the,

214
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,150
that'll have the fact that
Ohio state led up 50 points,

215
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,120
um,
against God there.

216
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,670
Maryland is actually a bad thing
for Michigan because, you know,

217
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,260
I mean,
I've listened.

218
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,430
I've been just fucking reconnected
with my wife all fucking weekend,

219
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:50,140
which has been awesome. So I've been like
sports mia, so I didn't see any of it.

220
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:54,280
I just saw the highlights and,
uh, there's fucking coach there.

221
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,490
Jesus Christ. And I
mean, he, he, he, every,

222
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,300
none of that looked football related.
It looked like he fucking, you know,

223
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,080
his house burned down.
His fucking wife left them.

224
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:09,580
I mean the emotion that I went to
ask, what's his name? Jesus Christ.

225
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,690
Irvine. Urban. Urban Meyer.
That's what the fuck it is.

226
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,060
Poor bastard man.

227
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,080
He was acting like dead fucking guy there
that was trying to get on the supreme

228
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:24,280
court.
The hell was his name.

229
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,830
Cavenaugh right.

230
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,460
That's fucking like how fucking
weird is that guy's life right now,

231
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:33,040
Kevin on where he's just sitting
there like what the fuck was that?

232
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,790
What was that like to get catapult it
to that level of fame for something so

233
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:43,540
fucking horrific. And
then they just like, yeah,

234
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,320
I guess there wasn't enough
there. Anyways, get on with
your life and your dream.

235
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,340
See you later. Like I what?

236
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:55,090
This has to be a name for that cause now
it's like he isn't famous anymore or is

237
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:57,900
quickly going to go away.
Like I'm

238
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,270
that guy there.
They were going after with a for Sean,

239
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,370
Shandra Levy Levy, right. Remember that?
And everybody always goes, Oh yeah,

240
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:14,371
the nine 11 came and that knocked that
fucking story off the front page and it

241
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:17,740
wasn't that guy relieved and it
turns out he didn't fucking do it.

242
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:21,580
So it kind of fucked over his whole
God damn career. But that, that is,

243
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,520
is there a name out
there in the Zeit geist,

244
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,640
that fucking word that
I've learned this week?

245
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,470
Is there a name so that that you have
that level of fucking pay fame for

246
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:37,120
something horrific
and then all of a sudden like you know,

247
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:38,890
it just, it, you get
acquitted or whatever,

248
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:40,840
just fucking goes away and then
you just sit in there like,

249
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:41,674
what the fuck was that?

250
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,700
Okay.

251
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,410
Does it have a name? It's
got to be somehow related to
Oj Simpson. You know, guy,

252
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,410
the trail or the fucking century.
Everybody's saying he fucking did it.

253
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,470
At least on the fucking white people
were saying that country got all fucking

254
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:59,200
divided. Then all of a sudden
they're like, no, he's innocent.

255
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,950
Then that's it.
Then he just fucking drives around.

256
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,433
Okay.

257
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,560
He could've got his life back together
if she didn't kill two people that were

258
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:15,770
the dominant, like as far
as numbers, like population,

259
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,190
you know what I mean? Like so
white people cared. So you know,

260
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,340
and white people are fucking
everywhere for the most part, you know.

261
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,700
So then Oj, you know, Jay likes to golf,

262
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:32,540
so he's going to run into a bunch of
white people. You know, he fucked up.

263
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,010
Next time he does a double murder.

264
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:37,370
He needs to pick a group of
people that aren't represented

265
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,390
so well at country clubs.

266
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,090
Then I think he'll be able to, you
know, kind of slip back into a society.

267
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,570
Am I giving Oj, uh, tips on how to kill
the next to people? I mean, I think I am.

268
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,640
Oh, guess what I fucking did. Guess
what all fucking freckles did. Uh,

269
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,290
I went out and I bought three pairs of
slacks and I'm really comfortable with it.

270
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,580
I'm 50 years old and I finally decided
that I'm going to dress my age.

271
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:13,220
I'm going to look good. Does,
I'm not going to lie to you.

272
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:15,920
I was looking in the mirror, you
know, I'm in fucking great shape.

273
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:20,180
I put a few pounds on what this
day case and all I ever wanted.

274
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,000
I put it on a few,
um,

275
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,030
some fucking calories.
I've had a few,

276
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,740
but then again,
too few to mention.

277
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,650
Um, I'll tell you right. And I am a
beet salad eating motherfucker. Man.

278
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,020
That shit fucking keeps me on track,
you know,

279
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,420
that's a nice fucking wake up call.
You know,

280
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:51,140
if I could just fucking lay off the God
booze, I get my flat stomach back again.

281
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:54,410
But you know, I have a little hangover
for being on the road, you know,

282
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,530
the same way if I went out and
ate Mcdonald's and fine, you know,

283
00:17:57,531 --> 00:18:00,770
I started craving that.
I was fucking hitting the bottle too hard.

284
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:03,680
So I got to, uh, you know,

285
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,730
that's what's cool about hanging with my
wife because she doesn't throw it down

286
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,940
the way I do, you know, just something,
she's just like, all right bill. Okay,

287
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,490
all right. And I'm like, all right.

288
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,630
And then she also drinks shit that I don't
like, like champagne and fucking wine.

289
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:21,080
So I'm like, you want another glass
of wine? I'm like, Eh, not really.

290
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,790
I like grapes, but I mean, how many
can you fucking have? You know,

291
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:33,480
it's weird. Um, anyways,

292
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,820
fuck was I talking about slacks?
Right.

293
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,930
So we went out and I bought
myself a pair of navy blue,

294
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,150
a pair of black slacks or near kept
calling him trousers. She's like,

295
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:50,310
are they going to him your trousers?
Right.

296
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,290
Which always reminds me of that fucking
Louis Ck joke when he was talking about

297
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,060
a,
whenever he would call phone sex,

298
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:00,200
he would always get that 80 year
old woman on the phone going,

299
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,190
I'm taking off your trousers.
Um,

300
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,030
anyways. Uh, yeah.

301
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:12,730
And I got to admit last
night I wore my fucking,

302
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,090
my trousers on stage and a benefit
for the American Legion out here.

303
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,583
Um,

304
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,220
yeah.

305
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,970
And it had a sport coat on the whole
fucking thing. Just dress my goddamn age.

306
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,220
And other than being a
little more hot on stage,

307
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:29,840
because I basically was wearing a jacket

308
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,930
I like, is there a name for
that? Talking through a yawn.

309
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,580
Okay.

310
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,940
No Dad used to always do that. He goes,
you know, I'll tell you bill, you know,

311
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,460
can I have a good show tonight?

312
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,050
Um, but anyways, I did a show
last night, so John's sites,

313
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,270
the American legion, me, it started off,

314
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:58,480
it was just going to be me and
Joe to Rosa. He goes, you know,

315
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:03,310
to raise some money for the
veterans, um, and all of that shit.

316
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,630
And uh, so I was like, yeah man, I'd
love to do it. And this fucking place,

317
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,470
I always forget them, the number
of it, it's American Legion forget,

318
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:16,190
but it's a legendary
one and the main room,

319
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:20,090
they're like everybody from
like led Zepplin to like
Humphrey Bogart has been in

320
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:21,750
there like Zeplin I guess,
uh,

321
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,370
one time after one of their gigs at the
form of some ended up chilling out there,

322
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,940
possibly jam and an or something.
I don't know what, but um,

323
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,750
they used to have like, you know, rallies
and stuff, stay away back in the day. I,

324
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:37,751
it goes back to like world war one
and they have like all of this stuff

325
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,830
upstairs.
All this,

326
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,273
yeah,

327
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,160
memorabilia. It's weird, right?

328
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:46,250
For wars and stuff like weaponry and
all that type of shit is really fucking

329
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:51,070
amazing. So it started, you know, we're,
Joan was just like, hey, you know,

330
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,960
you and to Rosie want to come down.
And you know,

331
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,510
we always go down there and shit.
And he goes,

332
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,670
we'll make you fucking
honorary members and all that,

333
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,100
but they get the fuck outta here.
We can't be members were not veterans.

334
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:04,120
They're like, no, no, no, no,
no. We'll fucking, uh, you know,

335
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,810
we have guys like you that never did
shit that we actually give you a little

336
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:11,800
fucking one of those cub scout army hats.
I was like, all right, we will laugh.

337
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:15,220
And we're like, oh yeah, we'll fucking
do it. So next time I talked to John,

338
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:19,180
he goes, all right, listen, it,
it, it got a little bigger, a Kale,

339
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,570
wk Los got behind it,
the radio station.

340
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,810
And then next thing you know,
um,

341
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,880
we're doing a comedy show upstairs and
after the comedy show downstairs in the

342
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:34,210
VIP,
the Slutkin Eagles of death metal,

343
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,930
you know, I, I've done a play a show.
I was like, get the fuck out of here.

344
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,080
You kidding me? He goes, yeah, now. And
he was just like, you know, hey, you know,

345
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,230
they're saying they'll jam with the,
you want to do a song.

346
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:48,560
And like I just didn't have,

347
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,040
I didn't have time to get
something together or whatever.

348
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,430
And I also just wanted to go down and,
uh,

349
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,770
and just watch the band. Um, cause
I've always wanted to see them.

350
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,680
There's so many fucking bands I've
always wanted to see live. It's just,

351
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,250
I'm always on the Goddamn road. So,
and it's always like a, hey, we,

352
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:11,050
we have, we have a show out here. And
it's like, oh yeah, when's your show?

353
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,040
And it's always right as I fucking leave,
you know,

354
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,590
so I miss everything. So, uh,
anyways, I finally got to see, uh,

355
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,630
Jesse Hughes Fuck live man and am Timan
and one of the fucking greatest front

356
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:29,740
men I've ever seen in my life.
The way he was performing downstairs.

357
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:32,230
And by the way, downstairs at
the, in this American legion,

358
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:36,880
that bar was when they did, um, um,

359
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,980
the, the, the scene in the shining when,

360
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,790
when Jack Nicholson was
talking to the bartender,

361
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,200
the shot that's over his
shoulder from the, the,

362
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:50,350
the bartenders POV point of
view in the business there, um,

363
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,780
was actually up whatever the
fuck they shot in Oregon.

364
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:56,230
I forget what they shot up, but
like, but when they did his over,

365
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,100
um, for the bar, they shot it down there.

366
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:03,640
So that's the bar over in the corner.
And then on the stage,

367
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,710
the eagles of death metal,
a plan.

368
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,800
And there Jesse Hughes was
like the performance he put on,

369
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:14,740
he would have murdered at Madison Square
Garden and he was downstairs in front

370
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:19,090
of like 120 people.
She has fucking pouring sweat,

371
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,670
fucking just, you know,
all the front men moves.

372
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,700
He was so fucking good.
At one point I just started laughing like,

373
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:31,840
how the fuck do I even consider myself
a performer when there's a guy like this

374
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:35,860
out here? Then he had this bad ass chick
on base. The drummer was fucking kid.

375
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,830
All they had for drums
was, did they? Like,

376
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,650
it was a bass drum of floor Tom
and a snare, like quest love's,

377
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,530
uh, set up back in the day. And, um,

378
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,490
and the amount of music that that drummer
got out of it, it just, it was just,

379
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,500
it was fucking unbelievable.

380
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,540
And I got to meet some of the people in
the band afterwards. It was a really,

381
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:01,020
was a incredible night. I
tell you, man, you know,

382
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,810
I'm not gonna lie to you,
man. My life does not suck.

383
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,620
So, um, anyways, do look
at that fucking score,

384
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:13,370
man.

385
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,370
The fucking cults absolutely smoked the
titans and the titans absolutely smoked

386
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:23,870
the Patriots. And I believe we beat the
cults. Like, how the fuck do you bet?

387
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,420
How does anybody fucking gamble
on the NFL this year mean?

388
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,880
It doesn't make any fucking sense.
There's like no consistency.

389
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,723
MMM.

390
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,990
Anyways, it's thanksgiving. Everybody.

391
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,140
Okay.

392
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,860
It's thanksgiving. And guess
what? I got a new fucking, uh,

393
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,960
I got a new person that
I've been following on a,

394
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,930
well, I can't follow them
on youtube because I don't,

395
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:56,040
can't figure out how to fucking
figure out what my password is.

396
00:24:56,041 --> 00:25:00,780
So it always tells me to sign in. It's a
big pain in the ass, but it's just guy.

397
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:01,614
Uh,

398
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,850
okay.

399
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,270
Johnny,
he's brought,

400
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,280
it's spelt the Italian way and he's
out of San Francisco and he goes,

401
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:12,820
uh,
like it looks like almost like,

402
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:16,930
it almost looks like Giovanni
Kinda by of a mild dyslexia.

403
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:18,700
So I can't quite remember
how it's spelled,

404
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,230
but he just goes by Johnny and
he goes like, go z. He's like,

405
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,170
my name's Johnny.
I live on the hill.

406
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,660
Oh, here it is. A Gi,

All right,

409
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,970
so it looks like Gianni, but he says
Johnny and he starts all his fucking,

410
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,070
this guy is such an incredible, listen

412
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,940
I love this fucking guy.
Here we go.

413
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,710
But every day I go down to the village
to buy the food that I'm going to cook.

414
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,950
Welcome to what's left of the Italian
emerging neighborhood in San Francisco.

415
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,750
And that's it right there. And he's
just staring into the camera. Like,

416
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:16,730
this guy's just a fucking real deal.

417

mashed potatoes that he
may his eggplant Parmesan.

421
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,410
And I just been like sitting here watching

422
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,130
potatoes. It's like, man, I'm going
to fucking make those four. Um,

427
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,580
Do you have that? A little bit of
Turkey, some stuff and cranberry sauce.

428
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:03,210
He fucking kid mates over.
You're going to have a great um,

429
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,060
great guide them
thanksgiving. So, um, anyways,

430
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,540
I've just been sitting here
watching all of that shit.

431
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,070
And then I was watching his fucking thing.

432
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,920
I don't even know how I'm going to
be able to do this fucking justice.

433
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,780
I might have to just put up the clip,

434
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,930
but I ended up watching
this other random guy,

435
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,960
this Canadian dude who was smoking and
drinking while he's cooking and he was

436
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:35,720
making a Sunday gravy in his apartment,
was hot as shit,

437
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,390
and he had the fan going and he
was dropping like he think I curse.

438
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:43,790
This guy was dropping f
bombs like you can't believe.

439
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,750
And then out of nowhere he just
starts telling this story about this.

440
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,420
One of the things that I hate the most
about human behavior other than war and

441
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,940
all the dumb shit that we do,
um,

442
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,810
the obvious dumb shit is when you're
next in line in someone's trying to creep

443
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:04,300
into the side just to
fucking ask a quick question.

444
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,050
Like nothing gets my fucking blood going.
Right?

445
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,540
So he tells us hilarious story about
how this woman's angle and in and how he

446
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:18,541
fucking basically made a quick move and
fucking got both his forums up on the

447
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:23,410
desk. And then the lady goes,
he's just randomly Texas.

448
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:27,280
A smoke break tells this story.
She goes,

449
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,380
then she goes, excuse me, sir, I
think I'm next. And he's like, oh,

450
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,320
that's way you have it wrong,
because if you are next,

451
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,750
you'll be standing where I was standing.

452
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,700
And then he did an edit and it just
cuts to him going back to cooking.

453
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,220
He's got the cigarette dangling
his mouth that he goes,

454
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,640
you push the fucking cunt to try to fuck
with me on a hot fucking day when I'm

455
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:54,130
trying to get my drugs.
So my doctor

456
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,870
gives you fucking wait like everybody
else. You have fat fucking whore.

457
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,660
And then he just goes.
Anyway, it goes back to cook.

458
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,510
I must have sent that clip to
like fucking 20 people. Um,

459
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,840
my wife obviously didn't find it
as funny as I did, but I dunno,

460
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,720
they just, I don't know. You
know what kills me? I actually,

461
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:22,000
I called and Kathleen Madigan's,
uh,

462
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Sirius radio show and gas we'll give
him was on and Lewis Black was on.

463
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,410
And uh,

464
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,380
it was fucking hilarious cause I was
telling them how much I like to cook and

465
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:39,020
all of that. And they were all going
like, oh my God, I had no idea.

466
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,310
Like this is just, this
is, this is almost weird.

467
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,410
They hear that you're
into this type of stuff.

468
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:48,670
Like I think like they'll like most
people that they just think I'm this angry

469
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:52,180
guy. I have anger issues. Um,
I wish people didn't think,

470
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,960
I hate that people think that I, I mean
I, it's my fault that people think that,

471
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,500
but I hate that people think that I just
walk around like fucking cock sucking

472
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:03,730
motherfucker. I'll, I don't,
I mean that's just how I react

473
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,330
to most social situations. So I
guess, does that make me an angry guy?

474
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,510
I Dunno. I don't fucking
know. But I was kind of like,

475
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,050
I was loving talking to those,
cause I'm a huge fan of all of them,

476
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,330
but I was like taken aback.
Like, wow. They like,

477
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,130
they really think I'm a
fucking psycho and uh, I dunno.

478
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,660
I haven't really done anything
to make them think otherwise,

479
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:36,340
so I guess I got to own it. Um, anyways.
All right, let's plow ahead here.

480
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,330
I'm going to read a, I'm
going to read some of the, uh,

481
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,470
the advert advertisement here for
the week. All right? And then,

482
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:48,160
you know what I'm going to do as a special
fucking treat while see if I'll see

483
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:50,110
if nia wants to do it.
Although I'm going to,

484
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,430
I'm going to ask her while I'm
on. Could I, I'll hit pause.

485
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:58,390
I'm not going to be a dick. Hang on a
second. All right. She said yes. Okay.

486
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:02,590
She's going to be here for
the questions. Okay. Um,

487
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,140
all right. Oh, look,
Crucey out. Jesus Christ.

488
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,750
We've started right off with the classic,
right. But, uh, they'll do [inaudible] me

489
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,380

Do Do to,

490
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,670

491
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,510
Don't stick him in.

492
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:27,240
You run the where with the garlic and
abbyy flaky balls on a staycation.

493
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,810
She'll fucking hate you. Ah,
Jesus. You know, and it's not,

494
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:35,330
not often that I fucked this song
up, but you know, you got to say the,

495
00:31:35,331 --> 00:31:39,340

With a dumb fucks that say
you're entering the meal. Okay?

505
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:14,320
It's the main fucking course.

506
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,790
I don't know how over here in the United
States it started being called the

507
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:23,380
entree. Um, you go to France
with that word is from that.

508
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,920
They're talking about the beginning,
the appetizers. Shut up bill.

509
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:31,210
You fucking arrogant con. Alright, okay,
fair enough. You're right. Anyways,

510
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,660
but let's get back to me on, he
said, okay, you can't do, you can't.

511
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,720
What you can do is stuff the fucking
stockings. Perfect stocking stuffer,

512
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,890
and that's usually the in the
end where you're like, ah, fuck,

513
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,750
okay.

514
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,400
You know,
we got to stick something in there.

515
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:48,050
You put the fucking underwear
and the goddamn stock. All right?

516
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,170
You don't put it on a tree like you just
got somebody at God damn playstation or

517
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:57,700
whatever the fuck these kids want. Yeah,

518
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,230
You when can you want
to see your kids cry?

519
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,350
You want to see kids finally realized

however you want to. Fucking had some
Acouto mall to your fucking Christmas.

521

She'd go to Goddamn me undies. There we

522
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,820

524
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:21,960

you know, fucking if you want to Turkey
on your balls, are you on your ass?

532
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:54,810
Maybe that could be cool me. It will be
a little weird if you weren't in March.

533
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,190
But I mean, I don't know about
you guys. I eat Turkey all year.

534
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,640
Was that good?
All right.

535
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,470

647
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:50,770
all fucking time. Lumping him in with
drew Brees. Why are they doing that? Okay.

it is to reconnect with your spouse on a

675
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:36,150

get off your phone here and help me out.

677

678
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,980
How are you doing this?

679
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,160
I'm all right.

680
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:56,690
Instagram Chata Instagram
chat or do you remember,

681
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:01,220
uh, when we discuss, you
know, that woman, um,

682
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,310
she started posting yes.
You know,

683
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,790
she went from just posting regular
pictures to sort of, uh, you know,

684
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,900
not overly hoary, but she wouldn't show
them to her parents types of pictures.

685
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,780
And then her male friends who
were in relationships, uh,

686
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:19,370
their significant others were
having difficulty with it
and blah, blah, blah, blah,

687
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:23,600
blah. Right. This, this
one is from a lady. Okay.

688
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,530
Uh, she said just dare
bill bird. Just, uh,

689
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:32,150
just wanted to reach out and say thanks
for touching on that Instagram topic

690
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,900
with uh, the female too close
for comfort with the husband.

691
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,250
Um,

692
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,840
I been with my boyfriend for almost a
year and have issues with his social media

693
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:46,550
habits. I'm 25 and he's 21. Oh my God. Uh,

694
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,950
hello darkness had,
I mean,

695
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,133
you know,

696
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:58,010
he's actually like emotionally a
bang in a fucking younger dude.

697
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,400
He doesn't have money to pay for food and,

698
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,330
but he'll fuck you.
I want to read the rest of this.

699
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,530
So those sun in the morning,
sorry,

700
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,800
I'm 25 and he's 21 and I didn't realize
how unhealthy it was until I was 23 so I

701
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:25,290
keep excusing it, talking
about his behavior, but it
makes my skin fucking crawl.

702
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,420
I don't feel comfortable when he
snapchats his single female friends he had

703
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:35,190
before we together because the techs
go away and they send pictures.

704
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,660
He makes me feel like I'm not trusting
him but I would never do that with

705
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:43,410
another male and it's just not
something I want to have going on in any

706
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:47,010
relationship with my, I don't agree
with 100% of the things you say,

707
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:52,220
but I agree with a lot and it was cool
to hear a male perspective on it that

708
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,510
isn't biased towards the situation,

709
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,000
especially yours because
from what I can tell,

710
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:59,040
it seems like you have a healthy marriage,
huh?

711
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:01,500
Jesus.

712
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,050
We didn't do this staycation.
I think you were going to kill me now.

713
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,300
It took a weight off my shoulders
that I'm not unreasonable for feeling

714
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:14,070
uncomfortable with it. Uh, love the show
makes washing dishes more enjoyable.

715
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:19,020
How just a little though,
cause I hate touching soggy
food. Am I right? Absolutely.

716
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:20,820
You are.
Soggy food is the fucking worst.

717
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,000
That's what they invented those
rubber gloves for. Exactly.

718
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,740
It wasn't to save your hand.

719
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,780
Hashtag relatable. Oh
such a millennial. Yeah.

720
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:31,614
I mean

721
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,360
no, but she made the little space
there with the tongue sticking out.

722
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:37,930
Like you know, yes, I know
that it makes fun of that.

723
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,690
Right. Uh, okay. Yeah.
Um, yeah that's, yeah.

724
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,470
Your boyfriend's 21 honey,
like

725
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,760
that's just like I said,
are you high right now? No.

726
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:54,110
I mean I just smoke earlier but like,
yeah cause like,

727
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:58,220
hey honey. Oh, but he is, like
I said, he's 21 but you know,

728
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:02,600
emotionally he's 17 years old and he's
not gonna you know, he's going to be like,

729
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:05,810
Whoa, why are you becoming such
a big deal? That's called guests

730
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,570
lighting. Um, so all right,
slow down white person here.

731
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,930
Gaslighting.
I know it's not like a black word

732
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,950
that does not something
gaslighting for white people.

733
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,110
Gaslight outside of a town house.
No

734
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,640
gas lighting is like making
somebody like question, you know,

735
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:33,330
there there's sanity or their reactions
to things when they're having like

736
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:37,500
actually a normal reaction to
something. So she says, Hey,

737
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:41,010
I don't feel comfortable with
you snapchatting all these girls.

738
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:45,030
You're my boyfriend. And he says so many
effective, like what are you talk like,

739
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:48,570
what are you freaking out about? Like
we're just not a big deal. Yeah, yeah.

740
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:52,260
That's gas lighting. Oh like you
know God damn well, like she says,

741
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:55,470
she doesn't deal with any of her male
friends. If she was snap chatting,

742
00:46:55,471 --> 00:46:58,470
hanging out with a bunch of dudes,
he would probably feel some type of way.

743
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:01,890
It might. It's so, that's fascinating.
So for the other white people listening,

744
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,150
does gas lighting live in the
flipping the script world? No

745
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,320
Way. What happened? [inaudible] it's not,

746
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:17,250
it's not even as like that was part of
the English white man. 50 years old. I,

747
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:21,290
I've never heard that. Oh
just went away. It died.

748
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,240
Oh my laptop died. Oh Jesus. Wait.

749
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:29,380
Cause I saw the next things and banging
the neighbor or banging my neighbor.

750
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,040
What was lacking

751
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,380
in my room now to that one. Sorry.
Now I have to go onto my phone.

752
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,850
Oh, there's no way you look up
gate. When you in the meantime,

753
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:41,000
look up fucking gaslighting.
You. Tell me when the,

754
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,890
when that came out because
you know I could be wrong.

755
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,600
God knows I am more times than not.

756
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,393
MMM.

757
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,380
All right. These are the
reeds. Let's see here.

758
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,413
Come on

759
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:56,510
now. Watch this one fucking load because
I'm on my God. Here we go. There we go.

760
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,180
What the fuck is this?

761
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,043
Hold on.

762
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,320
Um, I, I, you know something.

763
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:09,940
I swear to God I can't fucking win for
losing on these damn things. Great emails.

764
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:13,780
Here we go. And we go. All right,
let's get to the bank and the fucking,

765
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,710
where the hell is it?
All right.

766
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,230
Factory Nets. Yeah. Did you look,
are you looking up gas line?

767
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,760
Yes. No, you're not.
You're texting somebody

768
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:31,270
freaking out about, man. I mean, I'm just,
hey, your guess. Like right now, man,

769
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:34,930
you're making it seem like I'm
not all right. Sliding verb.

770
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:35,860
It's in the dictionary.

771
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:40,120
Manipulate someone by psychological
means into questioning their own sanity.

772
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,340
That's in the dictionary.
The dictionary.

773
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,610
Well, we'll look at that and yeah,
once again, I'm wrong. I apologize.

774
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,970
11 warning signs of gas lighting.

775
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:52,090
How to know if you're a victim
of gas lighting as a whole.

776
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:55,121
Yeah,

777
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:59,260
but there's also like a gas light that's
outside that you can't tell me some

778
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:02,290
point wasn't, wasn't at some point
slang and then the dictionary was like,

779
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,100
all right, enough people are
saying and now it's a word.

780
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,030
I mean that that does happen, right?
Yeah. I'm trying to look at articles.

781
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,290
Did Ben Franklin started?
Yeah,

782
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:13,430
it was used in 2016 I don't know
when people started using it,

783
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,630
but you're right, it like, yeah,

784
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:20,130
the last couple of years it's become
a word that people use to describe,

785
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,510
you know,

786
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:24,470
like the word Zeitgeists. I
finally know what that means. But

787
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,230
here's the thing, Bill. Just cause you're
just now finding out what it means.

788
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,064
It doesn't mean that it

789
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,960
didn't,
you know,

790
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,090
exist before.

791
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,550
No, no. I'm not saying I'm well read,

792
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:38,000
but I talked to a lot of people and I
hadn't heard anybody say it like all of a

793
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:41,210
sudden not. That's the fucking
thing. People were saying.
All right, what do I know?

794
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:45,300
All right, 15 I'm finance.
So it goes back a little bit.

795
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,460
[inaudible] you're like
a paralegal over there.

796
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,100
Really know how to use the Google.
All right,

797
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:55,440
nuts. Um, listen, lady
motors. Listen Lady,

798
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,040
are they giving me shit?
This somebody

799
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:04,740
you keep regurgitating bullshit
about the apple phone factory nuts.

800
00:50:04,741 --> 00:50:08,510
The people who died jumped
because of insurance payoffs.

801
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:14,060
fox.com had a clause in oh pay outs and
the employees contracts that states a

802
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,310
Foxcom. If they died on the job,
the family will receive 50 k.

803
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:24,200
That's why all those people jump out
to give their family a lump payout.

804
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,090
Who was I? Shit. No, but here's the thing.
Even if it did well, if you weren't so

805
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,920
fucking underpaid, so you're, you're
basically, you're going to jump out the,

806
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:36,580
I'll fucking kill yourself for
a teacher's salary. And exactly.

807
00:50:36,581 --> 00:50:40,270
And so what does that mean? Is that
somehow make it better that blag no,

808
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,280
they're doing it because
they wanted the insurance.

809
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:46,180
It's like that's a horrible thing
regardless. I know they've put nets up,

810
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:47,830
they put nets up so he wouldn't jump up.

811
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,040
And then they'd played soothing
music to try to calm that down.

812
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,940
And then they were considering,
uh, elevating their pay,

813
00:50:54,941 --> 00:50:58,930
which was obviously the fucking problem.
So Google dance shit.

814
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,640
Fuck up Steve Jobs, Dick out of your
mouth and stop trying to make it like,

815
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:07,810
you know, it's, it's, you
know, all they're just doing
it for the payout. It's like,

816
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:11,330
what kind of Weirdo are you
to even say that? That's fine.

817
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,780
That's one of my favorite
jokes from I act white people.

818
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:16,930
It's another thing when white people like
white people tell black people how to

819
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:19,960
behave around the cops.
Just do what they say.

820
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:24,310
I don't understand what the problem is.
Why is it not my experience?

821
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:27,970
Can I read the next one? Alright.
Yeah. Banging my roommate.

822
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,390
I'm reading the fallout as read

823
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,550
by the lovely Mia.
Hey Billy bitch sits.

824
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,850
I'm sure you don't block the
microphone down the bottom.

825
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:45,670
I'm 22 years old in my last semester of
university and I live with one girl who

826
00:51:45,671 --> 00:51:46,600
happens to be hot.

827
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:52,060
I found myself in the situation by only
needing a four month term sublease to

828
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:53,500
finish my final semester.

829
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,430
A friend of mine who was moving out of
state to complete her nursing placement,

830
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,420
offered to sublet her room to me at a
very reasonable price for the quality of

831
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:04,990
apartment I accepted without knowing
or meeting my soon to be roommate.

832
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:08,350
The hot roommate was briefed on me
and was okay with living with a guy.

833
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:12,040
Fast forward two weeks in the living
together were banging on the couch. Well,

834
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:16,770
that escalated quickly.
Oh,

835
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:21,880
there's somebody at the
door. I'll keep reading. Um,

836
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,470
we're banging on the couch from
this moment to about mid October.

837
00:52:26,471 --> 00:52:30,610
I was untouchable. Insert picture
of Muhammad Ali after a knockout.

838
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,020
It was around that mid October point
where she decided to stop putting up with

839
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:37,720
me because she started talking
to another guy from her hometown.

840
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:38,890
Seven hours away.

841
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,510
Where I have a problem is not
with a heartbreak or heart
feeling. So come on now.

842
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,950
It's more with the level of resentment
on her side. She has gotten really cold,

843
00:52:47,951 --> 00:52:49,930
standoffish,
and passive aggressive with me.

844
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,810
It's to a point where she goes
to her room. When I get home,

845
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,050
we don't really talk anymore.
What have I done? How do I fix it?

846
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,180
I'm not sure I see a future with her,

847
00:52:58,181 --> 00:53:00,580
but she's cool and I'd
rather not have her hate me.

848
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,910
She was a pretty laid back person and
her mom constantly bugging her about

849
00:53:03,911 --> 00:53:07,300
getting a real job. She was a
waitress at the beginning of November.

850
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,790
That is a real job.
At the beginning of November,

851
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:13,360
I got a job at a consulting firm,

852
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:14,830
which I worked really hard to get.

853
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,820
She didn't care in the slightest
while we were hooking you up.

854
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:22,780
She also told me constantly about the
other guy she was talking to. Oh baby.

855
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,960
We agreed to be open, but I found it
a much looking for a game plan here.

856
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,910
Long Time Fan of the show. Thanks. And
Go fuck yourself. So what happened?

857
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:33,690
They started paying somebody
caught feelings. What happened?

858
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:38,180
He caught feelings even though he said
where I have a problem is not with a

859
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,320
heartbreak or hurt feelings.
Yeah.

860
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,150
She basically banged him
because she was talking,

861
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:46,920
it was cause she was trying to get
over some, some guy while we were,

862
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,120
because were all we were hooking up.

863
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:51,060
She also constantly told me about the
other guy she was talking to. Right.

864
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,890
So this was um, this was, uh,
between guys bang. You know,

865
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:57,810
it's kind of like a buffer.
Like cause you,

866
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,080
you're in between a rebound or you're
kind of wishing to be with somebody else.

867
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,780
So you ended up bagging somebody who's
really into you and it's giving you a lot

868
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:13,590
of compliments and you know, the Dick
is right next door cause your roommates.

869
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:17,160
So that's super easy and got to like get
up and get all dressed up. It's like,

870
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:22,110
you know, you'll just take it cause
you think I'm the best and um,

871
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,940
you know, you got used, you got
played. Um, and, and you get used,

872
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,930
you got to bang a hot chick, but
he does it. But you didn't really,

873
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,290
did you not hear the rest of it? Like
answered the door. You don't remember. Oh,

874
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,180
right now he's,

875
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,750
he's upset because she just dropped him
like a hot potato and she's being really

876
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:44,510
cold to him and it's not really
talking to them. Shit. She,

877
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:48,630
she fucking shit. It's
over. That's fucking great.

878
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,920
And it's a thing.
Who gives a fuck?

879
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,370
You've got to bang this hot
chick and then she's fucking,

880
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:00,150
she acted the way a guy usually acts,
which is the best.

881
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:05,120
We just walk away from
it. Women were all right.

882
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:10,530
She just walked away. Get on with your
fucking life. Exactly. It's done. Yeah.

883
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,400
Get on with your fucking life.
You're 22 years old,

884
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:17,460
so perhaps you haven't heard the
saying don't shit where you eat.

885
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:23,120
Don't ever fucking your roommate because
when it goes bad or when it's over,

886
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:28,470
very rarely can you just
exist and it's not exactly,

887
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:32,340
that's why it's fucking awesome because
now she's just totally blown them off.

888
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,800
They live together and
then it's like perfect.

889
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:36,570
So I would just sit down and just say,
hey listen,

890
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,390
I realize we're not hooking up anymore,
which is totally cool.

891
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,830
But like you barely even talked to me.

892
00:55:40,831 --> 00:55:45,240
Like I don't have any fucking
hard feelings over it. So like,

893
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,440
you know, you want some
fruit loops? Yeah, yeah.

894
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:54,220
Maybe try to like Kinda call her out
on being immature about the situation.

895
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:54,541
And it's like,

896
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:58,050
you don't gotta treat me like shit
now just because we're not fucking,

897
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,310
cause Alyssa, I, you know, I
was sort of teasing you before,

898
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:06,480
but it's not cool that she's just rude
to you now that she's had your way with

899
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:09,540
you and she's done with your
deck and she's so funny.

900
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:11,430
She's like the greatest roommate ever.

901
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,660
All she wanted to do was fuck you
for awhile. And then she left.

902
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,610
What is the problem? She's on my mount
Rushmore of fucking roommates. I mean,

903
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,370
the fact that you got some bangers for it,

904
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,200
cause you could have gotten friend zoned.
She's literally,

905
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:28,800
she's sitting there constantly talking
about other guys that she's seeing.

906
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,090
You could've gotten friends zone.
So you know, at least she got laid.

907
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,500
Jesus Christ silver lining.
But glass is not half full.

908
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:40,530
The glass is full and
your bowls are empty.

909
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,490
Them all right,
condoms.

910
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,250
Uh, hey, really stretched
nuts. It's a lady.

911
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,050
I don't know what that means. Oh, from my
lady. The ladies are all writing in now.

912
00:56:54,051 --> 00:56:55,520
I love it.
Uh,

913
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,300
my boyfriend can't bust and
not what the condom on. Wait,

914
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,860
did I believe they're in parentheses?
Lose it.

915
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,700
Now let me read it again because
I'm not having fun reading condoms.

916
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,210
Just make sure you're talking to my dog
and we've just done, isn't it right here?

917
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,830
Where's the microphone? No, but
somewhere on the phone, on the minor,

918
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:21,120
my boyfriend campus to know
the condom mind loser. Um,

919
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:25,430
he insists it's because of the condom.
You know,

920
00:57:25,431 --> 00:57:26,930
he's lying to you,
right?

921
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:33,170
We got into a big argument about it. We
have about it. The sensation is different.

922
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,860
Duh. Of course it is. But when I told
him it was different for both of us,

923
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:38,600
he didn't believe me.
Listen guys,

924
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:41,420
the walls slash hurdles
between us work both ways.

925
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,360
It's like a pap smear and went away.
What does it keep going away?

926
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,350
I Dunno.
I hang on putting the password in.

927
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,960
Ooh,
okay.

928
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,890
Um, it feels like a pap
smear. Is it smears?

929
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:03,530
It yet issued the fucking
house and you're a woman.

930
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:06,470
You should know what it is or
putting a beer bottle and my cooter.

931
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:11,420
It's just friction. Oh, you're one of
the, I taught just like the guys. Girls.

932
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,010
Huh?
By the way,

933
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,230
you look like someone stretched
Alaskan condom over skeleton.

934
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,130
That's so me.

935
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:27,410
What are your learn views about the
condoms situation? My boyfriend is a,

936
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:31,130
we don't say that word anymore.
If Nia is around, maybe ask her,

937
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:34,190
would love to hear your views. It's
still waiting on that nut. Oh my God.

938
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:36,980
I love this email. All
right. I can answer this.

939
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,330
She's taking this personally
subconsciously because
he's not getting there.

940
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:42,860
That that's a reflection on her.

941
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,460
He is lying to her about busting and not,

942
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:51,470
and a condom just wants to rob dawg her.
Oh,

943
00:58:51,471 --> 00:58:56,210
I thought he was already fucking her with
a condom and he couldn't do it. Oh. Oh,

944
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:59,370
I thought she was saying my
boyfriend campus condom on.

945
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,680
So I dunno if that means no,
this guy's like listen,

946
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:05,170
if you've just fucking are constantly,
if you're not,

947
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,950
if you weren't wearing a condom in your
last relationship or you weren't in a

948
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:12,160
relationship and you were just fucking
jerking off with your hand when you put a

949
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:16,250
condom on, it feels like you still
wearing your pants. All right. And,

950
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:21,220
and yeah, and if you know this, all
kinds of things that can fuck with you.

951
00:59:21,221 --> 00:59:22,210
Watch too much fucking

952
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:24,910
porn, you can have performance
problems is all that.

953
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,940
I just think she's taking
this like personally,

954
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:30,940
I mean the fact that he can't bust it
out with a condom on know then she's goes

955
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,330
loser. That's like not cool.
That's like hostile. Yeah.

956
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:35,770
And so that's like defensive.

957
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:40,440
That's what I'm guessing because
there's a bunch of guys that are like,

958
00:59:40,441 --> 00:59:44,740
like a bunch of guys that like fucking
are in longterm relationships to come up.

959
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,160
I had that problem for a minute. I was
going to say, I feel like that's normal.

960
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,480
Yeah.
Like so what you got,

961
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:54,490
what you got to do is for him tell him
to start jerking off with a condom on.

962
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,830
It sucks. Get used to it. Yeah.

963
00:59:56,831 --> 01:00:01,831
You just sort of get used to it or don't
fucking do anything for like a week or

964
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:05,620
something and they'll be able to really
be ready to fuck a fucking desk at that

965
01:00:05,621 --> 01:00:09,160
point and maybe that'll help. I would have
my doctor drew, I don't know, but like,

966
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,143
but I can tell you this

967
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,190
name, calling him and saying that he's
a loser and all of that type of shit is,

968
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,960
that's not the solution.

969
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,200
Also it feels like a pap smear or putting
a beer bottle in my cooter is just

970
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:23,520
friction. Okay. Here's the thing.

971
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:29,210
I feel pretty confident that this is a
male pretending to be a female writing in

972
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:37,440
because no woman would ever say it
feels like a pap smear. What is it?

973
01:00:37,441 --> 01:00:38,880
Shmita Shmita is he,

974
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,410
it is or a beer bottle in my
cooter it's just friction.

975
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:47,850
Women don't talk like this to stop
playing around with these fucking email.

976
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,780
He can file and they're fake.
No,

977
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,800
but sometimes people also feel like they
have to be as dumb as me or as crude as

978
01:00:56,071 --> 01:01:00,750
I am. Listen guys, the walls slash
hurdles between us work both ways.

979
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,690
It feels like a passionate or print.

980
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:07,920
Why is just friction a patch like no,

981
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,110
because if you've had a pap smear,
you would never,

982
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,750
Matt, I had one now. You did that. No,

983
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,750
I got a complete checkup
and you did not pass. I do.

984
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,920
I make sure they checked
me for everything.

985
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,000
Fake letter. Fake News. You say
that spoke. I don't know. I'm,

986
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,290
I don't think it is. Yep. 100%. Okay.

987
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:34,310
Roommate ran someone over,
old Billy,

988
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:39,050
the boner burglar. Um, as another
person that I'm not good looking.

989
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:43,560
This is the way it was good to, this is
the shit that you get when you listen.

990
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,950
This comes with putting
yourself fucking out there.

991
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:50,060
That's why when all these fucking
women go on there, let me good God.

992
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:53,090
People would never say this to a guy.
Look at this person just said,

993
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:58,010
I look like a fucking allows gang labs.
He comes stretched over on a scale isn't,

994
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:02,030
or a skeleton. That was
brutal, but it was funny.

995
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:05,810
It's fucking hilarious.
And I can't argue it.

996
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:10,980
I miss the fucking pretty accurate. I just
know I don't like what I see. Oh look,

997
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,710
I can kind of override skeleton. I don't
give a fuck what that person thinks.

998
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm a good looking guy and I got
a smoking hot wife, so hey, that's

999
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,270
not bad, right? Not Bad for
a fucking lambskin condoms

1000
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:28,980
and a beautiful baby and everyone does
their baby's beautiful. So take them.

1001
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:33,960
So that's it. Everybody likes us and
we're popular. All right. Anyways.

1002
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:38,930
Oh, belief of boner burglar. I'm
a 20 year old gay. It never runs.

1003
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,400
It's like, it's so never ends with a, the
of people trash the way I looked at it,

1004
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:45,370
it has no effect on me.
A, uh, so it's actually

1005
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,740
kind of a good thing that doing for me.

1006
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,410
I'm a 20 year old guy in and I say what?

1007
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,740
I'm a 20 year old guy in
and I stay with a roommate,

1008
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:01,020
I think as a test. Fido. All right.
I stayed with a roommate who's very,

1009
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,260
very close friend of mine.
I'll get right to it.

1010
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:08,700
I took a couple of mushrooms and was
tripping my ass off for the first time.

1011
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,440
Everything was great until my roommate
came in at the peak of my high and said

1012
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:16,560
he had something to tell me
that was going to make me laugh.

1013
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,770
He proceeds to say he just ran a bitch
over with his car and he said it like I

1014
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:26,370
should be proud of him.
Bill. His ignorance about
the situation was killing me.

1015
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,320
Yeah, that's assault with a deadly weapon.
Aside from the situation being crazy.

1016
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,890
He thought this to me.

1017
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,530
He brought this to me mid trip.

1018
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,830
He kept saying nobody saw
his plates and all that shit.

1019
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:45,060
Oh Jesus Christ with no regard for
what he just did. What do I do bill?

1020
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,970
This guy really didn't give a shit.

1021
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:51,300
He ran somebody over
and he killed my high.

1022
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:56,220
We also just signed a lease.
FYI. The girl is okay.

1023
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,800
Much love to the lovely Nia over
there and the little one. Big Fan.

1024
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:02,634
Big Fan

1025
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,210
living with a psychopath,
you should probably get out.

1026
01:04:06,211 --> 01:04:07,860
Cause if he's couldn't
do that to a stranger,

1027
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:11,490
what do you think he's going to do to you?
That's a great point. Cause I was just,

1028
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,570
I was going to say she's all right.
Well I think gives us

1029
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:19,480
also, I like to leave, but he killed
my high, like within the same sentence.

1030
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,470
Not only did he run somebody over,
but he showed my,

1031
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,310
now what do I do? I really, I
really liked how it said the also

1032
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:32,350
doing it while you are
tripping on mushrooms for you
to really draw the line on

1033
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:35,650
the line. I think you need to sit down
with them and be like, listen man,

1034
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,030
hold our young and yeah,

1035
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,760
I
mean

1036
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,320
listen, I think you just need to sit
down with your roommate and just say,

1037
01:04:48,321 --> 01:04:50,210
hey listen man.
You know,

1038
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:55,240
if every time I'm tripping you're going
to come in and talk about how he ran was

1039
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,060
over and ruin my high.
This isn't going to work out.

1040
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:05,330
So what we need to do is get a schedule,
put it up on the refrigerator,

1041
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,270
you know,
I'll tell you what I'm doing shrooms.

1042
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,620
And then you just don't run over
anybody that day. And if you do,

1043
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,670
and if you two just don't fucking
tell me about it til I'm done.

1044
01:05:16,671 --> 01:05:18,180
Fucking giggling in the corner.

1045
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,710
Who are you people living
with that goes for roommates?

1046
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:23,600
That you got to get it.

1047
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:27,860
Who were running people for Bang
you and then not speaking to you.

1048
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:32,360
Like you guys need to make
better life choice. No,

1049
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:37,080
that's like, well the first
one, it was like a money
situation. Like she, you know,

1050
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:40,680
he got the apartment because it's
friends, you know, Blah Blah Blah.

1051
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,350
And then who are you people dating?
Is it like a pad?

1052
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,780
Nia or a bottle of my
cooter like, Ugh, man,

1053
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:53,630
I'm fucking lies and stupid emails.
What is wrong with you?

1054
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:57,300
And you know, it's hilarious. I'm
annoyed that this batch of emails today,

1055
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:58,140
I really am.

1056
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:04,220
As you sit in here, watch rewatching
season one of fucking, uh,

1057
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:09,270
the real housewives, but come on
and listen. I'm a correct Mara.

1058
01:06:09,271 --> 01:06:13,870
And I can go with it. So my, all right,
well this has been the hypocrite. Um,

1059
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:18,720
Nia, how do you write the
staycation? One to 10, 10,

1060
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,900
10 out of 10 and fucking great.

1061
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,480
I can't believe we have to come
back tomorrow to real life.

1062
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:29,680
I know what I miss my little boo
bear. I know. Me Too. So, uh, no,

1063
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,780
but I mean I think like a, you know,
we ought to, we ought to do these.

1064
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:35,160
This was good for us.

1065
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:40,110
It was great for us is the best we've
gotten along for fucking ever. Yeah, yeah,

1066
01:06:40,111 --> 01:06:43,860
that's true. Yeah. All of a sudden you
can just fucking chill for just literally,

1067
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,610
I mean we wasn't two and a half
days. Nothing. Yeah. Nothing.

1068
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,570
You still stay in a, and I would
think whatever the fuck you live,

1069
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:54,420
you could still, I don't give a fuck
if you live outside of de Moines,

1070
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:59,870
go rent a nice place in de Moines
order room service if they re yeah.

1071
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,080
Ah, Jesus shitting on everybody.

1072
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:09,310
The waitress at brunch today. Uh, I was
saying, Oh yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

1073
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:10,720
Cause I was asking her if she's,
you know,

1074
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:13,780
working the shift tomorrow cause
she was so nice and I was like,

1075
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:16,540
oh we're leaving tomorrow. And she
goes, okay, when are you coming back?

1076
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:19,060
And I was like,
see that part?

1077
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:23,830
What part that uh,
even ever heard that before.

1078
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:24,723
That part?

1079
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,430
No,
it's just more gas lighting.

1080
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,730
No, no, no. That's like a,
that's definitely a slang.

1081
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,840
That's definitely an
urban slang. Um, okay.

1082
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,640
Anyway, you don't have to
explain it. Oh well. All right.

1083
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,680
Have Your own little special language
and you can feel special. Got It. Um,

1084
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,770
all right. So you see people,
you see why I need a staycation?

1085
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:50,130
Like I don't know what happened to you.
You would like so chill and relaxed.

1086
01:07:50,131 --> 01:07:51,990
They just got the claws out.

1087
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,170
Are you getting ready and you're going
to go back and we're going to go back to

1088
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,120

1094
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,990

Oh, is she is in the 80s? Yeah.

1096

This is an old, uh, like reality
show. I'm, oh, it's cinematic.

Hi, I'm Brenda. Hi. I'm Brenda.

1100
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,590
I consider myself a sexy older
Italian girl. She's like,

1101
01:08:44,591 --> 01:08:48,390
if a guy isn't giving me
money or what does it,

1102
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:52,120
is it give hanging up a picture? I'm
not getting something from them. Yeah.

1103
01:08:52,121 --> 01:08:54,610
If he's not giving me money or having sex,

1104
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:57,370
then I don't want them or something
like that needs to get out.

1105
01:08:57,371 --> 01:09:00,460
And I'm really good at, I don't want
a boyfriend. I don't want a husband.

1106
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,830
Death is good guys to almost dying.
I like them.

1107
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:09,640
If they don't have any
relatives having relatives,

1108
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,090
that's great because then I get all
the money. That's my favorite part.

1109
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,060
Ridiculous.
Just ridiculous.

1110
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,240
Um, all right. That's the
podcast for this week. Um,

1111
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:26,170
I dunno. Everybody have a
happy thanksgiving. Thank
you so much everybody. Yeah.

1112
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,200
Thank you so much for everybody who
came out to all my shows and you ever,

1113
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,440
ever get a chance to see the
eagles of death metal lives.

1114
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:37,470
Wow. I'm telling you. Yeah,
cause it was just crazy.

1115
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:41,860
He was like, it was like it was at
Wembley Stadium is energy. Yeah.

1116
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:44,770
I was going to say his energy
was like they were at a stadium

1117
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:49,750
and he came off stage just pouring
sweat. He just gave me, Oh man.

1118
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,030
That guy is,
is like,

1119
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:56,440
there's so many fucking people that get
onstage and call themselves entertained.

1120
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,470
They need to go fucking see that
guy and be like, that's, that's,

1121
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:03,340
that's the way it's done. I was even
sitting there being like, Jesus Christ,

1122
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:07,070
I should have been working hard or
update with my slacks and sport coats.

1123
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,090
You dress like a gentleman.
Hi. How are you? Like in slack?

1124
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,380
Oh my God, I love you
and slacks. I really do.

1125
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:19,270
I feel like men of a certain age
should like try to just their dad. Hi,

1126
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:21,130
I'm bill. Hi, I'm bill.

1127
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:26,220
I saw this gentleman last night and he
had to be in his forties or something.

1128
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:31,860
His genes were so baggy and they were
just pooling around his ankles around his

1129
01:10:32,111 --> 01:10:36,460
like old sneakers.
His blazer was like down like passes,

1130
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:40,210
but it was just like if he was just
like a sloppy mess and I'm like,

1131
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,600
I bet this person is
actually like a nice person,

1132
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:46,300
but it's like you gotta get it together.
I'm not trying to be shallow.

1133
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:49,280
It's not like, look sir everything.
But there are a lot of it. No,

1134
01:10:49,281 --> 01:10:50,220
you know what I said

1135
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:58,870
it's the first thing people, and this
is the thing that questions matter.

1136
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:02,260
I feel just only being a dad
for almost two years now.

1137
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,040
I can look at Dad's at malls and I can
look at their genes and then I know how

1138
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:12,820
old they are.
All this kid is like guys who had

1139
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,900
guys who had kids in like the mid two
thousands have faded true religion,

1140
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:23,720
jeans. It's all, yeah, it's all like sorta
like white in the front on the thigh,

1141
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:27,730
all baggy in the big stupid
ditch shoe in the back. Right.

1142
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:31,170
Because those things were like
fucking loud. Even when they came out,

1143
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,700
I remember Bobby Kelly,
Rich Foss,

1144
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:39,020
I that was just like those things to
wear true religion jeans like everyday.

1145
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,480
And he was so proud of him,
that true religion in fucking
pull the tag. Oh my God.

1146
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,870
And they were boot cut.
Oh my God.

1147
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,750
And then guys who guys
10 years older than them,

1148
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:52,650
they actually had jeans like
when you just bought Levi's.

1149
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,890
So they show up and they have like a,

1150
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:59,340
like Kenny Club Soda Kenny Club Soda.

1151
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:03,210
Kenny shows up with the jeans that I wore
when I used to listen to fucking heavy

1152
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:07,970
metal is genes. Genes are just
genes. Yeah, just jeans. No,

1153
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,520
no passion, no stages.
Just functional denim.

1154
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,560
And then what happened now
is, uh, his pants. I never
thought after they got baggy,

1155
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:20,670
they'd become tight again. But yesterday
we were out there at the fucking mall.

1156
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:23,760
And how tight were that guy?
That guy's fucking put.

1157
01:12:23,761 --> 01:12:28,200
You could almost see his baseball bag
from behind. I was fucking cry and laugh.

1158
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,060
Yeah.
And now you show like your ankles.

1159
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:35,910
Everybody's like walking
around like they're gonna
Start Moonwalk and we need to

1160
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:39,110
see a socks. My goal, Mj
back in the day. All right?

1161
01:12:39,111 --> 01:12:41,580
I can't make this thing too long.
I gotta I gotta get,

1162
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:46,460
I gotta enjoy my last half a
fucking day of a staycation. Um, I,

1163
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:49,740
it's nice to love one another
again, isn't it? All right?

1164
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,560
All right. You guys have a
great Thanksgiving and I'll
talk to you later on. And,

1165
01:12:55,890 --> 01:13:00,060
and even if you're a passive fan of
football, you gotta Watch Michigan, Osu,

1166
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:02,820
it's gonna. I'd scan it, be a
barn burner, I hope, I hope.

1167
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,650
I hope it's not a boring blow
up. All right, I'll see you.
