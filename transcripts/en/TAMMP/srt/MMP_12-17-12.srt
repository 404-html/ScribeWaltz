1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,440
Okay.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,310
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:09,720
December 17th, 2012. Um,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,960
I am emotionally exhausted from watching
that Patriots San Francisco game,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,010
uh, last night. How insane
was that game? Unbelievable.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,830
Um, unfortunately it was exactly what
I thought. Although the comeback,

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,080
I was amazed by that, but I, I've, I've,

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,100
I've gotten so much shit from a couple
of friends of mine who are patriots fans

9
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,950
because they feel like I'm not a patriots
fan anymore because I keep talking

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,840
about how bad our defenses and they
are one of those people who like,

11
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:43,770
you know, they like dress
like drew Bledsoe when they
watched the game. You know,

12
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:48,440
those people with it, this such fucking
fans, the no matter what's going on you,

13
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:53,441
you can never say anything what they
deem is like negative rather than

14
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:57,320
constructive criticism. But
you know, I feel vindicated

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,630
because last week when we beat the text
and say was sitting there going, yes,

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,020
what are you going to say now you're
ready. Yeah, it did take stock,

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,133
right?

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,110
Ima tell him the whole fucking
time, but the afcs week, all right.

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,240
Fucking week.

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,080
The NFC has been far superior
to the AFC for fucking years.

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,840
All right.

22
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:31,800
But the thing is you got Brady and
Bella check and a little bit of luck and

23
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:35,010
that's how we got to the fucking super
bowl last year. We still almost won.

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,790
But that doesn't change
the fact that our defense,

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,160
all right.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,330
Oh we do good against the mediocre teams
and the so called good teams in the AFC.

27
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:50,260
But I'm telling you right now, we'll be
lucky if we get by the Broncos. Okay.

28
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:53,800
You let up fucking 40 something
points to a second year quarterback.

29
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:56,920
I can't help you.
Why is my voice cracking?

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,010
Cause they've been screaming
at the fucking TV for three
hours watching the damn

31
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,844
thing.

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,990
Um,
yeah.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,310
If the 40 niners actually had a
quarterback, they would have scored like,

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,520
you know, a more experienced quarterback.
I'm not shitting on their, uh,

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,350
their guy there with the soul patch,

36
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:15,320
whatever the fuck his name is at a Boise
state who could have played baseball.

37
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:19,070
Ali. Yeah. But he had one fucking
Shiny Tatiana. I mean, fucking times.

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,470
You can tell that story.
Um,

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,920
yeah.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,700
I mean, he missed like two guys who will
have like three steps on our safety.

41
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,530
I Dunno. Just fucking brutal. But
I knew it was going to happen.

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,050
I knew it was going to happen. You know
what I mean? I mean, I hate to say it,

43
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:37,530
but if you know, if the 40
niners had Aaron Rodgers, uh,

44
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:41,940
drew Brees of fucking, you
know, Eli Manning get, Oh, it's,

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,560
we can't compete with,
that kills me. Kills me.

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,550
I don't what the fuck we have to do,
but I, you know, we're all right.

47
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:54,120
We're all right in the box as they say,
but I swear to God,

48
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:57,450
our fucking pass defense stinks.
I don't,

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,970
I don't keep it just, it was, you know,

50
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,720
it was enjoyable watching the 40 niners
celebrating and stopping around and

51
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,960
doing that because
they're doing their job,

52
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:12,460
all that dumb shit that every
fucking athlete does. Now, you know,

53
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,770
you fucking get a layup for
two points and then you go

54
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,890
scare children than the front
row. Like, like he had this like,

55
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:24,040
you're actually in 300,
you know,

56
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,850
why don't you just fucking bend over
and blow yourself at that point.

57
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,440
I really enjoyed watching the 40 niners
do that and then get that deer in the

58
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:36,580
headlights look is Brady
calmly does just dismantled.

59
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:41,581
They're fucking awesome defense and tied
it up and scored like 34 points in like

60
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,480
a basically a quarter. I did enjoy
a 31, whatever the fuck it was.

61
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,350
I did enjoy that.

62
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:51,220
Watching them have to stand
down and actually having
seen that glazed over look.

63
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,820
Oh and now the phone rings.
Now the fucking phone rings.

64
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,040
Could anything else be
going on with this podcast?

65
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,080
Just seeing that glazed over look on
Jim Harbaugh's face w was enjoyable,

66
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,660
but I fucking love that
guy. And I loved the, uh,

67
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,130
the fake punt call and the
first quarter on your own 40.

68
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:12,610
Was that when I was awesome.
I had to respect it.

69
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,700
It's like this guy is
going for the juggler,

70
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,000
but I mean those guys honestly could've
been up like 21 nothing after like six

71
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:23,440
minutes in the game. Um, yeah.

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,830
So they had golf desert,
right.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Nice big bucket of ice water to the
face of delusional patriots fans.

74
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,940
That's, that's what it is. That's
where our defenses against, um,

75
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,610
the elite teams, you know, sucks.

76
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm not happy about it and um,

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,740
okay.

78
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,880
Yeah, I'm not fucking happy about it.
I just wish I, we could, we could. Oh,

79
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,890
for fuck's sakes.
With your fucking,

80
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,340
you know what I hate about this fucking
stupid phone besides everything.

81
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,880
So you have the fucking thing on
mute. It's still makes noise. Like,

82
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,140
like I get important phone calls,
right. Clia. What am I the president?

83
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,370
Does it really need to do that? Even
when you fucking put it on silent mode,

84
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,380
it still vibrates. I guess I could
just shut the thing off. Right.

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,860
I never, I never even thought to do that.
That's great. I worked that out. Oh yeah.

86
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:19,140
Of course. My password doesn't
work on the fucking computer.

87
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,940
This is just going to
be one of these days.

88
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,610
You and I know he's going to be one of
these days is I took my dog out for a

89
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:27,480
walk and um,
she took a shit and I'm like,

90
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:32,130
Rappaport I went to pick the fucking
thing up right now and I had my headphones

91
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,750
on and as I bent over to do it,

92
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,020
my headphones fell down and almost
landed in the pile of dog shit.

93
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,880
And uh,

94
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,280
okay.

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,330
Rather than laughing it off like
somebody with rosy cheeks would, um,

96
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,510
I'm a cynical bastard,

97
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,450
so I took that as an omen on how
this day was going to be and uh,

98
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,450
it's lived up that way.

99
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:51,950
Okay.

100
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,650
I had a bowl of cereal this morning.
I almost fucking died.

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,300
Okay.

102
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,250
You know what's funny?
The lovely

103
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
Nia was literally maybe seven feet away
in the other room and never checked on

104
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,024
me.

105
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,970
Could give a shit, you know,
and you know what that is?

106
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,960
It's like we've been together when you've
been with somebody as long as I have,

107
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,710
they just,
it's not like they want you to die.

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,410
It's a combination of two things.
They, they, they just tune you out.

109
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,470
So I could've been in there
talking to her about how, you know,

110
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,390
my headphones almost fell into
the dog shit this morning.

111
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,180
Or I could have been almost
choking to death. Either way.

112
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:35,080
She doesn't even hear it.

113
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,320
And then like subconsciously it's
not that they want you to die,

114
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,300
but they not fatally.
But if you could die for like three hours,

115
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,670
you know, I, I don't think
that they would be upset.

116
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,990
You just Sorta,
you know,

117
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:53,380
drag you over and put you behind
the couch and just, you know,

118
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:56,460
fantasize about being single again for
like three hours and then you, you,

119
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:58,690
you know,
you wake up like in one of those,

120
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:03,691
those movies with Kiefer Sutherland
was that movie call shockers wasn't

121
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,400
clockers. That was likely. I don't know. I
don't know what the fuck it was. Anyways,

122
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:13,960
this is what happened and
I was eating a corn checks.

123
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,870
I'm a big fan of the checks family.
All right.

124
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,720
This isn't some sort of subtle advertising
I'm trying to put in here. Okay. This,

125
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,210
this, this is coming from my
heart, not my wallet. All right.

126
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,760
I like to check serious.
I'm not into rice checks.

127
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,630
Man has nothing to do with
World War II or Vietnam. Okay.

128
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:30,730
I just don't like the taste of them.
Okay.

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,610
I'm not coming at you with some red
state, Shayla. I ain't, ain't nothing.

130
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:38,611
It got fucking raw Sienna and after what
happened over there and a of the DMZ,

131
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,890
I'm not coming at you like that.
I just don't like the taste of that one.

132
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,720
I either go corn checks or I go week
checks. So here's the deal. Yeah.

133
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:49,530
You know what I noticed the other
day is this, this morning when was,

134
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:51,480
I was almost choking
to death on my cereal.

135
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:55,560
Was all cereals kind of the same color.
You know what I said?

136
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,270
It's all sort of fucking, just
different kind of browns and that weird.

137
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,800
Isn't that weird? That that
would go through my head is
I'm almost Diane choking.

138
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,030
That fucking bad eighties comedian
analogy went through my head that well.

139
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,860
It might've been my last thought.

140
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,413
You know?

141
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,590
Well like it's like a topic
you'd hear on like NPR.

142
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,790
All things considered today we discussed
the different shades of Brown and

143
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:28,440
breakfast cereals. I don't care if
you're eating rice checks, corn checks,

144
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,790
we checks rice krispies or corn flakes.

145
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,030
The all too familiar off color bandaid
brown. I'm an old things considered.

146
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,380
Um, we listen to NPR.
Neil listens to that shit.

147
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:45,930
She's such a fucking nerd and she always
has it on. And um, I and you know,

148
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,813
I don't know,

149
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,650
there's really no good radio stations
out here as far as like playing music out

150
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:54,970
here in la. I don't know why. I don't,

151
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,970
I dunno what goes on out here,
but evidently, uh, these,

152
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:04,020
the two bands that they play, they play in
like, it's still 19, the early nineties.

153
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,500
They play ice cube all the time.

154
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,430
Bad Ass when he come to my town, bad app,
like, like, I don't know why they play it.

155
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,310
Like they play it enough
like you think he did,

156
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:23,080
he died or something,
you know, and then, uh,

157
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:26,490
and then they also play the,
uh, who were those guys?

158
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,460
La La la La, la La. Yeah.

159
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,220
Oh, but that, that held at
bay obey, whatever the fuck.

160
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,890
They are pretty fly for a white guy.
They play them all the fucking time.

161
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,760
Yeah.

162
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,510
You know, like everybody's still
walking around in flannels going, hey,

163
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:45,220
have you heard the new
Pearl Jam man? Um, anyways,

164
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,183
so here's the story.

165
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:49,980
Okay.

166
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,260
I basically,
I go to get my fucking box of corn checks.

167
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,880
I pick up the box and Mila and notice
it's pretty light. You know, pour it in,

168
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,820
get a full bowl,
and there's like an eighth of a box left.

169
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,680
Now I could be a Douche and put the
box back and give Nia false hope. Oh,

170
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,840
I want a box. You know, I want
a bowl of cereal, you know,

171
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:10,620
and then she grabs the box and she feels
the likeness. Then that panic comes in,

172
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:14,430
you start to sweat like all, fuck,
you start pouring it out. Come on man,

173
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,640
keep going. And there's only an
eighth of a bowl left, you know,

174
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,290
the Douche puts that back in the cupboard.
The gentlemen,

175
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,310
the refined individual like
myself, you just say, all right,

176
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:29,460
I'm going to have a little more serial
than I usually have. So that's what I did.

177
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,181
All right?

178
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,910
And I start eating the fucking cereal
and I'm wolfing it down cause I know the

179
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,870
podcast is a little bit late and I'm
going to get a bunch of shit on Twitter,

180
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,220
right?
So I get about halfway done with my bowl.

181
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,060
I take the box of cereal and I pour that
last a thing. And you know the deal,

182
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,810
the last part of the box, that's the
most dangerous part of the box. You know,

183
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,100
you got half of it, half of it's Cyril
and the rest of it's all fucking powdered.

184
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:55,830
So all the power goes on my,
on the top of the cereal,

185
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,380
I started eating the shit and I'm doing
that, you know, eating so fast you're,

186
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:03,090
you're eating an inhaling through
your fucking pie hole. You're

187
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,881
doing that shit.

188
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:09,690
And I had a half a spoon of powder and
the other half was the cereal and I

189
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:13,260
inhaled the shit and I, my,
my throat just closed off.

190
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,323
I thought I was gonna.

191
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,030
I thought at the very least I was
going to pass out to the point I was,

192
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:23,031
I was debating as I'm coughing and hacking
away and Nia is completely ignoring

193
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:25,800
me.
Um,

194
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,220
I'm sitting this Ponant,
I'm thinking,

195
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,790
should I make them loud noise in the
kitchen or should I run to, you know,

196
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,830
five steps to the bedroom.
But then I'm thinking what that,

197
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:37,950
but like take up too much oxygen.
And um,

198
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:42,570
I basically was choking on this shift
for three straight minutes in Nia.

199
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:47,220
Didn't move a fucking muscle,
didn't move a goddamn muscle.

200
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,600
And when I finally,
I finally realized I was gonna live,

201
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,700
I was so pissed at her
that, you know, you know,

202
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:58,360
like after you get done choking like you,
your voice is like,

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,500
it's like turned down to one. So you're
trying to talk just like, you know, open,

204
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,010
you know, that type of shit. I
basically said sarcastically.

205
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,210
Thanks for helping in the,

206
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:13,050
I was just choking for three minutes
voice and all I get for neo is like, oh,

207
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:17,780
I'm sorry. Are you okay? No.

208
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,970
Is there any way to start the fucking day?

209
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,860
I don't think this was that even funny.
Was that even remotely amusing to you?

210
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,310
I don't know.
I almost died this morning.

211
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:32,110
I'm just how I don't care
if I'm funny or not, Cleo.

212
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,580
Um, all right, let's do it.

213
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,250
Let's do a little advertising here and
then I'm gonna talk to you about this 30

214
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:44,080
for 30. I watched called broke.
All right. Um, where are we?

215
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,980
Oh, we got a new, we got new advertising
this week. Everybody cascade studios,

216
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,320
cascade studios on Santa Monica
Boulevard out here in Los Angeles.

217
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:55,740
We got a local ad here.
Um,

218
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,190
this is based a rehearsal studio pull.
If you're in a band basically,

219
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,170
and you need a rehearsal space.

220
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:06,780
Cascade studios is the number one place
here in Los Angeles. This is where,

221
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:10,150
and when I got out and I played drums and
I tried to pull off that bottom stuff,

222
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,060
trying to get my foot is
fastest. His, this is where I go.

223
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:16,420
I go to cascade studio 66,
11 Santa Monica Boulevard.

224
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,760
If you want to go down
there with your whole band,

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,630
they got a five piece drum kit in every
room with high hats, two guitar amps,

226
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:26,860
bass amp, pa system with three mikes.
Symbol rental is only five bucks.

227
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,090
Um,

228
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,450
or if you're just a drummer like myself
and you want to go down there with your

229
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:34,600
iPod and beat the hell out of
a kit and have a great time,

230
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:38,730
he charges you 15 bucks for an
hour. I highly recommend it. Um,

231
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,830
I go down there all the time.
If you go down, asked for Joe,

232
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:45,970

235

242
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,780

package the instant you need it.

246
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,380
Then the mailman comes and picks it up.
It's so easy and convenient.

247
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,990
You don't have to go down to the post
office and deal with everything that I

260
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,750
U. R. R. Alrighty. Back to the
podcast. So I was watching, um,

261
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,170
I was watching one of those
30 for 30 [inaudible]. Um,

262
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,390
and they did this whole thing on, on
athletes going broke. It was really bad.

263
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,980
There's a ton of people who've gone broke.

264
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:36,010
Most of them didn't want to do the
documentary. Like why would you,

265
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,950
you know what I mean?
Hey,

266
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:42,910
you want to talk about how you completely
fucking blew it. Now I don't, I don't,

267
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,400
I resent the fact that the
end of your documentary,

268
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:48,130
you're going to be running a list
with my name on it. You know,

269
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,040
that's what they had at
the end of it. But, um,

270
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,550
I was watching it and
I felt bad for people,

271
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:59,551
but after a while it was just the same
fucking story over and over again.

272
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,790
And it's as much as I want to say that
if I was 21 years old and you gave me $1

273
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,820
million, that I would probably fuck
it up too. I just don't think I would.

274
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,363
You know,

275
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,230
I love these guys. You know, I got a
check for $55,000 and I saw hummer.

276
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,250
I had to get it talk to the guy down to
$49,000 and it's like if you just got a

277
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:31,870
check for 55 fucking grand after
paying all the people in your life,

278
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,970
your agent,
whoever else she got,

279
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,910
where else has taken a
geolocation, whoever else takes
a chunk out of that check,

280
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,530
whatever's left out of that,

281
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:44,890
the government's going to come in and
take a 40 40% where if you get a check for

282
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:45,701
55 grand,

283
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:49,260
I mean you already got left 20 grand and
he just went out and bought a $50,000

284
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:53,490
Hama. I Dunno. But anyways, the point
I wanted to make was at the end of it,

285
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,400
you have to show and all these
people going through this hell,

286
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,440
they have this guy that who's supposed
to be evidently some sort of a financial

287
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:06,210
advisor and in the end they were talking
about Lebron James going to eat is

288
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:07,020
going to be,

289
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,020
he has a potential B other
than tiger woods pre divorce,

290
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,220
um, a billionaire athlete.
And they get like,

291
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:21,660
how exciting is that? And they go,
what, what would your advice be to this,

292
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,790
to Lebron James on how to hang on to
his billion dollars? And the guy goes,

293
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,260
he goes, don't blow it. Keep it simple.

294
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,990
Count your money.
It's what he said.

295
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,943
It's,

296
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,530
it might've been the dumbest thing
I ever heard. And I immediately,

297
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,830
I had no sympathy for anybody
in the fucking documentary.

298
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,220
It's just

299
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,030
like, even like, why is
this guy on this document?

300
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:59,010
Who the fuck is that guy? That's the
guy who manages money that's, hey,

301
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:03,600
I got $1 billion. How do I hold
onto this? Where should I invest it?

302
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,370
What do I do? What advice do you
got from me? Oh, it's simple.

303
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,080
Don't blow it. Keep it simple.
Count your money. All right,

304
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,780
thanks a lot. I'll be, I'm out of here.

305
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,750
Fucking ridiculous.

306
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,130
We,
it was basically,

307
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:24,370
it was an hour and a half of listening
to morons telling you what the fuck they

308
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:29,350
bought with all their money.
And I don't know, I felt bad,

309
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,530
but there was another part.

310
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,210
It was just one guy that I
really felt bad for because

311
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,420
it was the hurt that he had.
You know,

312
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,960
like Andre rising was on the thing
and he's sitting there in his suit,

313
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:48,670
was sunglasses on, mirrored sunglasses
during the interview and just right there,

314
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:51,640
it's like, yeah, dude, you, I'd give
you another million if I had it.

315
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:55,390
If I gave it to you, you'd,
you'd, you'd fucked that up. Why?

316
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:59,050
Because you're sending here in a
shiny suit with fucking sunglasses on.

317
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,510
Look like Michael Jackson at the
award show. Right. So anyways,

318
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:10,350
the one guy who actually really
bothered me was, if you ever watch it,

319
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:12,000
it's 30 for 30 broke.

320
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,360
There's a guy who's sitting there and
he's just ever so slightly lean to one

321
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:22,210
side and the just the,
the pain

322
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,960
in, in his voice. He's just
just sitting there going,

323
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,820
ah,
I made

324
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,800
$75 million in that career,

325
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,080
add meal at Mercedes,

326
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,020
got a homo,
got me a boat.

327
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,790
It's just sitting there looking down on
his knee, like playing with his pant leg,

328
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,600
a jet ski and,

329
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,000
and you just, I had to look
away. It was fucking brutal.

330
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:09,630
But the rest of it was just a
bunch of knuckleheads. You know,

331
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,150
I felt bad for Bernie Kosar
to cause burning coals are,
uh, you know, I don't know.

332
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,020
It seemed like his dad took his money. I
don't know what the fuck it was. It was,

333
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:21,580
it was, it's, it's a really, it's a, it's
a great, all the 30 for 30 is are awesome.

334
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:22,540
This one is awesome,

335
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,890
but they just should have had a couple of,

336
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,091
they did,
you know,

337
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:31,700
something that's not true cause
they had like four or five guys.

338
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,940
There was only two people who
really came off like morons,

339
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,280
but they were just so,

340
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,330
they were such morons that I
felt it tainted the whole thing.

341
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,820
Ah, that is, might have been
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

342
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,670
What is your advice? Don't blow
it. Simple. Count your money.

343
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,980
All right. I'm sorry. Was that
even remotely fucking interesting?

344
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,140
I love watching those 30 for 30 is I
got to watch the Bo Jackson one. Um,

345
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,160
there was just something about that like,
you know, for as much as they showed

346
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,260
the amount of people that went broke,

347
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:13,261
there's been so many more people
in the league that didn't go broke.

348
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,200
So really weren't you just
showing a select group of morons,

349
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,001
you know,

350
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:24,600
who we're going out and buying a corvette
and stick in a fucking hot tub in the

351
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:29,600
back of it, you know, living
week to week on paychecks.

352
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:32,090
I mean, I just don't think that
most people are doing that.

353
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,200
I would really think that if,
if I was barely on the team,

354
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,950
I would be saving every dime.
I know I would.

355
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,220
I've done that in this business. I've
never fucking, you know, it's common.

356
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,010
If you're in any sort of entertainment,

357
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,160
you know it's coming and the day it's
coming is the day you think that you're

358
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:55,850
good and that you made it.

359
00:21:55,851 --> 00:21:59,780
That's when somebody comes in with the
hood on and the sickle and they just

360
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:03,620
fucking Chop Ian half and then that's it.
And then you're that guy on TV.

361
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:06,170
Fucking lean into one. But that's
why that guy was leaning to one side.

362
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:10,670
They had a twist his torso back onto
some fake legs as he sat there going,

363
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,330
I got me a cabin,
bought a mountain.

364
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,260
You know, you think that if you had $75
million that you could never anyone,

365
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:25,970
that shit goes in and when, when, when
it goes, uh, they, there's nobody around.

366
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,870
Um, anyways, I gotta wash it a few
more times. I feel like this comp,

367
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,820
there's some sort of comedy in there. I
just don't know if I got to it today. Uh,

368
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,420
anyways, I've been drinking like a fucking
mad mad lately. I really have to stop.

369
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,640
I just keep going to these, these
frigging Christmas parties, you know,

370
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,480
and they got booze there.
So yeah, we, you know,

371
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,890
something maybe that if I got like
a zillion dollars, maybe that,

372
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:55,090
that that's what I would've would've
done would've gone out and become a

373
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:59,290
complete frigging booze bag. Now what
the fuck did I do with my notes here?

374
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh, for Christ's sake, I swear to
God, this is just, it's not my day.

375
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,290
It's not here. It's not there. It's not
here. It's not there. What the fuck is it?

376
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,370
There it is. You know what?
Let's read a question here.

377
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,970
My brain is suffering from lack of
oxygen here. Let's just read a question.

378
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,860
College do wet. Hey Man, I'll
keep this question short.

379
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
I got my eye on this broad.
She heard me playing music in the dorms,

380
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:33,220
knocked on my door. I invited her in
and we talk for a bit. Jesus Christ.

381
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:37,690
Dude, I don't think you need any advice.
That sounds like you're already there.

382
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,380
She just heard your talent and
came knocking on your door.

383
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:45,040
What more does she have to do?
You know,

384
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,780
pull up her dress and backer weigh in

385
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,720
anyways. Oh, she said she wants
to do duets together. My fault,

386
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,440
I didn't realize she was also
in the business. Uh, Jesus.

387
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,480
Um, anyways, second time
I wasn't playing music,

388
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:07,480
but she knocked on the door and
started talking about duets again.

389
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,810
Not sure if she wanted
to play then or what,

390
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,960
but I was busy studying so I invited
her in again and we talked yet again.

391
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:17,690
Okay.

392
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:17,931
Dude,

393
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:21,050
you're only going to get so many at
bats where it's going to be weird if you

394
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:25,860
finally fucking make a move. All
right. What are you doing? I I,

395
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:30,540
this is, where did that
come from? Um, anyways,

396
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,480
I figure I'll invite her down.

397
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,050
Okay.

398
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,720
Uh,
I have a single dorm with her instrument.

399
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,350
Once the workload,
it didn't really sound good.

400
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,900
What I figured, I'll invite her down. I
have a single dorm with her instrument.

401
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,940
Once the workload,
after holidays,

402
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:51,900
debt dies down and just kiss
her and see what happens.

403
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,930
Oh, this is just a band geek. All
right. What are you doing? Hey,

404
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,720
come on over and, and
bring your, your bassoon.

405
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,000
And then she's going to walk
in and you just gonna kiss her.

406
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,280
Please tell me there's going to be some
sort of preamble of making her laugh or

407
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,430
something. You at least don't try
to light a candle anyways. He says,

408
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:12,840
how does that sound?
Any advice?

409
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,310
I've had almost no interaction with
her before or after this, by the way.

410
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,530
Uh, okay. He goes, love the podcast.
Keep it up. You're a great guy.

411
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,790
Just kidding.
Fuck you.

412
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,400
All right. Um, what, what, what
do you want to do with her?

413
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,300
You just want a banger. If you just want
a Banger, well, you have to do is just,

414
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,360
do you have to stop
acting like a gentleman?

415
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,620
Okay.

416
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,910
And I don't mean that in some
sort of gropey disgusting manner.

417
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,330
What I mean is you have to,
you have to not

418
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,400
just say the shit you thinking.
All right?

419
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,420
Just say the shit you thinking and
say what you want to do. All right.

420
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:03,080
If it's one of those, but if this
girl, but if the girl is like, uh,

421
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,820
I dunno, she's more walled off. I
don't know what the fucking word is.

422
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,470
I think that brain cell died when I
inhaled the power powder this morning. Um,

423
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,140
she's more walled off that.
I don't know if she's like a nerd.

424
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,160
I don't know what to tell you.

425
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,870
I never was able to interact with
female nerds beyond just talking to them

426
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:27,920
because they would just so fucking,
I don't like everything was like awkward.

427
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,080
So after that I was just like,
you know what?

428
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,800
I could literally rub one out
faster than it's going to take.

429
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,200
Yeah.

430
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,570
For me to figure out just
how to get her glasses off.

431
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,750
So yeah, dude, just invited down
fucker instrument, you know,

432
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:50,260
get the music out of it and just
say, hey, you want to come deal?

433
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:55,230
I'm watching a movie tonight. Just get
her over there. All right. I Dunno.

434
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,140
I don't know where you've gone
with the conversation so far.

435
00:26:58,141 --> 00:26:59,340
If it's going to seem weird,

436
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,520
if all of a sudden you sit in
there and you're Hugh Hefner robe,

437
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,920
but that's the vibe I
would have tried to break.

438
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,910
If you just want to bang her thing,
that's what I would do. If you want,

439
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,980
if you want to date this girl,
then I take her out.

440
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,700
But if you just want
to bang her, you, you,

441
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:16,050
you have to start acting like a fucking,
um,

442
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,970
CRAs individuals sooner rather than later.
You know,

443
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,080
you know what's a good way to kind of
bring it into this sex thing is if you're

444
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:29,070
watching TV and just start talking
about some fucking girl on the TV,

445
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:31,230
how hot you think she is
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

446
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:33,060
Hopefully that'll spin her
around and be like, why?

447
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:36,930
What do you find attractive
in a woman? And then you just
fucking blah, blah, blah,

448
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,640
blah. Well, let's take a look at you.

449
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:42,030
You kind of get your fucking Teddy's
air and sitting in my phone, right?

450
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:42,864
And then you're in.

451
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,230
Yeah,

452
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,840
right. Does that work? I
owe but works for you, sir.

453
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,440
Does I think you are a great guy.
You're a great guy. Cause you know,

454
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,430
you're sitting in a dorm and
you're, you're practicing
your fucking Piccolo. Um,

455
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,220
all right, next one. Actually,

456
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:05,000
you know what that reminds me of
a long time ago, long time ago,

457
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,780
I went to this girl's dorm and
she wanted me to, and I wanted to,

458
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:10,730
and I didn't know how to
fucking bridge that gap.

459
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:15,590
And we sat on her fucking single bed
for like till my ass fell asleep and I

460
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:19,000
finally ended up just, I just finally
just said, I have to just get out of here.

461
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,030
I don't know how to, you
know what I mean? I don't,

462
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,870
I don't know how to
fucking crack the safe.

463
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,160
So I should have been a little more
empathetic. God, I was pathetic.

464
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:33,290
I was, I was fucking pathetic.
Not Saying I'm, I'm, I mean,

465
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,990
I think that's been a through line
in my life, just being pathetic.

466
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:40,830
But it's sort of morphed, you know, every
time I feel like, oh, you know, hey,

467
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:44,150
I can kinda get that settled. Then
there's a new thing, you know,

468
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,950
like say podcast.
I

469
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,730
feel like this is a pretty pathetic
attempt this week, don't you?

470
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,020
Well go fuck yourself. Hit
the stop button. I don't
give a shit. I really don't.

471
00:28:56,021 --> 00:28:57,310
This.
One of the great things about this,

472
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,720
this podcasting world is you
really don't have to give a fuck.

The holiday special. Alrighty. Okay,

497
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,660
there you go. The fuck was, that reminded
me of something in the middle there.

498
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,740
The hell was I going to
talk about? Oh, I know.

499
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:43,480
You know what?
I was going to make a,

500
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,430
I was going to try to make
this shepherd's pie this week.

501
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:48,490
Every once in a while I get like really
into cooking and it's usually when I

502
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:52,070
have a doubt downtime in this business
and this time of year I always take a,

503
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,920
I always take some time off, you know,
I don't like working over the holidays.

504
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,380
I did enough of those fucking awful,
uh, New Year's Eve gigs. You know,

505
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,750
you're in some God forsaken fucking
strip mall in the middle of nowhere.

506
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,010
You all by yourself. You go
on stage, you got like a 50,

507
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:15,150
50 chance that they already handed
out the fucking noise makers.

508
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,170
You standing up there eating your balls
and then they make you do the countdown,

509
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,760
stop your act. Did I talk about this
last week? I feel like I already did.

510
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,190
I'll fast forward to this shit.
And then you gotta somehow,

511
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,070
then they want you to continue
your act after the countdown.

512
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,660
It's still worse fucking thing ever.

513
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,600
And everybody's hugging and
kissing and that type of shit.

514
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,590
You're standing up there by yourself,
like the absolute, you know,

515
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,460
cliched entertainer,
you know,

516
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,390
sitting there crying and your
Tuxedo. So anyway, so I usually,

517
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,410
I take this time of year off and I, uh, I
start, I always get, I get into cooking,

518
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,670
Cleo, stop staring at me.
Come here, stop staring at me.

519
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,910
So anyways, um, I'm a big
Mario Batali Fan, right?

520
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,940
So I made these braised short
ribs that were the fucking shit.

521
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,940
I went out and got myself a Dutch oven,
you know,

522
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,550
which because of that joke
is really been ruined.

523
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,450
There's no way to fucking say Dutch oven
and cooking without somebody thinking

524
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,420
about somebody farting under the
blankets in Poland. It over your face.

525
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,230
But I made these braised short ribs
that have been the shit but niggas on a

526
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:27,100
fucking diet. So she's not eating any of
them. So I ate like half a pig myself.

527
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,400
And I don't think my belly is
ever been rounder or wider.

528
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,400
I have like one of those toddler stomachs,

529
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,370
you know those little beer
bellies that they have.

530
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,200
You know what I'm talking
about? Cleo, Cleo,

531
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:41,120
do you want to finish
the rest of this podcast?

532
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,840
Do you hold and get off me?
Fuck,

533
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,580
a dog is so God damn needy. Um, all right,

534
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,980
let's continue on here with
the questions for this week.

535
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,130
If I can find it on my computer,

536
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:57,890
of course I can't cause this is
just how my day's been working.

537
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:00,200
I should have known I, she, you know what?
I should have gone right back to bed.

538
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,240
The fucking,
the second

539
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,590
my headphones almost fallen
dog. Shit, isn't that,

540
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,350
isn't that like a sign that you
should end the fucking podcast?

541
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:14,090
33 minutes and this is brutal.
All right. Douche boss.

542
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,080
Dear Bill. First I want to say,
uh, but, but it, but it, but B,

543
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,011
um,

544
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:23,090
I have all the episodes of uninformed
you did with the teen idols sensation on

545
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:26,630
my phone and listen to them every day.
But on to my dilemma,

546
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,690
I'm 18 and work at the finish line at
the mall and my boss is a complete Dick.

547
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,370
Of course he is because he's managed
managing a finish line at the mall.

548
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,860
You're 18.
You got your whole life ahead of Ya.

549
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,030
He probably fucking married the
wrong person. He starting to go bald.

550
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,970
He's standing there wearing
that referee uniform going, hey,

551
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,030
we're not you about the chuck Taylors.
You know,

552
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,600
I told you I was talking stock them
up in the back or whatever the hell.

553
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:57,080
They say, don't you just want
to choke them with his whistle?

554
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,960
Did they make you aware of whistles there
or is that athlete's foot or is that

555
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:00,794
the foot locker?

556
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,640
Yeah,

557
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,310
I dunno actually,
you know something I have like the,

558
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,400
the worst collection of dirty white boys
sneakers you'll ever going to see in

559
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:15,690
your life. Every time I look at my
sneaker collection, I pictured, you know,

560
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,220
Keith Robinson or Patrice,
he was still alive.

561
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,930
God dammit. I'm just
trashing me. You know,

562
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:29,850
it's funny about how much I Miss Patrice
is the amount of times is when I,

563
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:31,830
I,
I miss that guy.

564
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,580
Okay.

565
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,220
How the fuck do I tell this story
without fucking out in somebody's,

566
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,070
somebody told, gave a fucking
speech, you know, or whatever.

567
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,490
Went on some rant about the
state of comedy and everybody
thought it was fucking

568
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:44,941
amazing.

569
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:48,510
It was just one of those times where I
wished Patrice was in the room when this

570
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:52,080
person was, fuck. It was probably,
you know, was, was talking about it.

571
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:57,720
That's when I missed that dude the fucking
most, I missed him. I missed him when,

572
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,480
um, Penn state, that
Sandusky Guy, when he did,

573
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:06,070
when he gave the fucking interview.

574
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,950
Okay.

575
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,210
You don't have that interview when he,
he,

576
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:12,780
I think he's talking to Bob Costas
and they would go and do you, uh,

577
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,970
do you like little boys? And he
was like, do I like little boys?

578
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:22,560
I mean,
I enjoy their company and somebody says,

579
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:26,730
do you like little boys? This one
fucking answer. No, no, I don't.

580
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,220
Okay. And Fuck you for asking me that.
And this guy sitting there like, you know,

581
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,220
like trying to work out
the math in his head.

582
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,760
And as I as creepy it was to
watch that when I watched it,

583
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,690
I was actually laughing,

584
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,780
thinking of Patrice watching and laughing
hysterically and how he would somehow

585
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:52,840
get 25 minutes of material.

586
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,460
Yeah.

587
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,360
Just out of that guy trying to figure
out how to answer that, that question.

588
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,030
And I swear to God, like, I dunno,

589
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,660
we got this benefit coming up for him
and as just putting the thing together,

590
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:07,150
it's just like going through
him dying all over again.

591
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:11,860
It's been fucking brutal but good in a
good positive things because everybody

592
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,720
bought up the tickets, but it's
just been like this fucking, ah,

593
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,920
the finality of it.

594
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:20,380
It's just something like on that
I even talked to all my buddies,

595
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:23,950
like we bring him up like he's still
around and we'll talk about it. I'm like,

596
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:26,380
he's still around for five minutes before
you just start looking at the ground.

597
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:30,940
It's just fucking awful. I really,
I really do not wish that, you know,

598
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,030
I don't know why you would, but in,
it's not been worth even stating,

599
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:37,080
but I really don't wish this
on fucking anybody cause a,

600
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,740
it's really just something when I'm 80
will, if I'm lucky enough, you know, the,

601
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:46,030
we had been drinking lately. Let's us
be a little more conservative. I'm 68.

602
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,240
It's just something that's still
just going to be, I've just,

603
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,900
I'm coming to an acceptance that it's
going to be as sad when I'm that age as it

604
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,490
is right now and up.

605
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,870
So I figured I talk about that to add to
the already not hilarious podcasts that

606
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:07,490
I'm doing this week. I'd add to the
losing a close friend fucking vibe.

607
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,400
You know,
who's getting hurt?

608
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,110
It really wasn't a funny fucking week out
in the world. Uh, alright. Douche boss.

609
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:20,270
Where are we here? Um, the finish
line, he is one of those guys who,

610
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,560
okay that his boss is a complete
tech or it and he says, uh,

611
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,710
he's one of those guys who got bullied
all through high school and now actually

612
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:32,150
has some control and takes it out
on me and the other employees.

613
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,840
How did you figure that out as that you
just like psychologically breaking the

614
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:37,700
guy down?
Do I have to tell you something?

615
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:42,701
There's nothing worse
than watching somebody uh,

616
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,150
abused their position of power.
Harvard, however small it is.

617
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,590
You don't like this guy right here has
no right getting mad at like an athlete

618
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:53,660
who goes around being a dick
because it's like, dude,

619
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:57,470
you're doing the exact same thing. You
just can't run a four 40, but your,

620
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,450
your head space is the exact
same place as some, you know,

621
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,650
Egomaniac fucking athlete. You
just, you just suck at sports.

622
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,940
So you sell the gear to people,
look to go play sports.

623
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,960
Anyways,

624
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,960
he says he even steels out of the register
at work and holds the special release

625
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:20,990
shoes for him and his friends.
He's 30 years old.

626
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,310
And tries to fuck the 16 and
17 year olds who work there.

627
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,260
Oh my God, this guy is a
character right out of the movies.

628
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,630
You know,
I worked with a guy like this.

629
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,790
I used to work in a restaurant
in a long time ago. Sorry,

630
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,270
I'm trying to get the check
cereal out of my throat. Um,

631
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,670
I used to work with this guy and the,

632
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,270
basically like four or five of
these guys bought in to a restaurant

633
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,370
in the one guy who is going
to be there every day,

634
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,330
who's always the guy who ends up stealing
the silent partners, always get fucked.

635
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,810
His, his, his buy in was, he had
all the equipment for the kitchen.

636
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,390
So he, he, he,

637
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,750
he had some other failed restaurant
and he got all the equipment and uh,

638
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,260
but anyways, this guy was a coke head.
He used to steal out of the register.

639
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,850
He used to fucking, uh, try to
bang the, uh, not the Maitre d,

640
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:14,220
The fucking, uh, maitre ds, whatever,

641
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:18,240
the fucking chick who sits you down the
hot one, you know, who dresses classy,

642
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,720
that skirt fucking going right
over a shapely ass. Yeah.

643
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:24,750
He used to try to fucking bang them all
the God damn time and when they wouldn't

644
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:27,870
give it up, they get fired and
then he'd be bringing a new one.

645
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,330
If that one ended up banging him, then she
stuck around. It was brutal. So anyways,

646
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:34,230
he goes,
uh,

647
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,800
he harasses me and others calling our
phones repeatedly telling us to come in on

648
00:39:39,871 --> 00:39:44,430
our days off and leaves voicemails
saying we are ignoring him.

649
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,720
Jesus Christ is my fucking
day off. Anyways, he goes,

650
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:53,721
recently he got the only cool management
manager fired because he said he was

651
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:59,130
stealing. I don't really need this job,
but we'd like to keep working here,

652
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:01,080
but don't know how much
longer I can take this.

653
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:04,740
Any advice on what I should
do would be appreciated. Uh,

654
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:07,040
sorry for it being so
long. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh,

655
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,700
it wasn't long at all and it just
sounded long the way I read. Um,

656
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,500
well if you don't need the job,
then I would, I would quit.

657
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,900
But what I wouldn't do is I wouldn't leave

658
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,940
on bad terms. I Dunno. Is
it really going to matter?

659
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,450
It's not like when you're 30,
if you're looking for a new job,

660
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:28,740
you're going to put on your resume.

661
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:32,520
I worked at the finish line because at
that point you're going to be into a

662
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:37,000
career. I know you say, I
don't really need this job,

663
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:41,780
but would like to keep working
here, but don't know. Oh,

664
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:44,740
so you said basically you're saying you
like having walk around money. Well,

665
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:48,960
I would just get another job,
just get another job.

666
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,830
Start the process of getting
the fuck out of there.

667
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,460
Like nothing you're gonna say to that
guy is going to change that guy and all

668
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:57,850
that guy can do is kinda make your
life difficult if you're trying to get

669
00:40:57,851 --> 00:41:00,670
another job.
I at this point your life,

670
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,410
just know that like he's at the tip of
the iceberg of the awful life that he's

671
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:07,840
going to be living.
Um,

672
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,550
like just what the,
the way he sat in the table.

673
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,840
You don't need to do anything to him
because he's going to do it to himself.

674
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,760
And it would really be bad if, if this
guy was just such a negative force,

675
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,170
you somehow got sucked into it.

676
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:27,890
I know you probably fantasize about
punching him in the face and tell him the

677
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:29,300
guy to go fuck himself.

678
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,750
And then the girl that you have the
crush on at the finish line walks out arm

679
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:37,130
and arm you guys and you start your own
sneaker store right across and you watch

680
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:38,090
him get fired.

681
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,910
I know you've probably played that
fantasy out of you had a hundred times,

682
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:44,990
but uh, I would just get another job.
It sounded like you don't mind working.

683
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:47,390
You're not afraid of working.
You like having the money,

684
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:50,090
but you just can't deal with this dose.
So this is a great life lesson.

685
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,720
You do not need to be surrounded by doses.
You have the power,

686
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:56,810
it's your fucking life. Just,
he's always going to be a dose,

687
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,850
just walk out of his life.
Just be like, yeah, you know,

688
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,070
I don't need to be around this guy.
You know?

689
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,600
And then one day when you run into
them after you get another job, hey,

690
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:09,110
how come you left it? Just be it,
you know, cause uh, I dunno dude,

691
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:09,710
you would just end,

692
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:14,710
don't curse at them or anything because
then it gives him an excuse to not see

693
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,610
himself and just be like,
well, I dunno man, you the,

694
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,770
you just kind of creep me out the way
you were always hitting on girls who were

695
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:24,740
like 16 and 17 years old.
I mean, if that's what you
want to do, I mean, you know,

696
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:29,060
that's cool. But uh, you know, I'm
just kind of not into that. So, uh,

697
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,340
you have yourself a nice evening
and he'd just walk away from him.

698
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,940
Maybe it'll work out like
that. I have no idea. But, uh,

699
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,290
I try and get yourself another job. All
right. They, that's my advice. All right,

700
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,470
here's another next one. Ah, multiple fuck
buddies gone wrong. You know what too?

701
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,360
Just the fact that you had
multiple fuck buddies, uh, it's,

702
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:54,830
it's still a win. You know what I mean?
It's still a way you made the playoffs.

703
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:59,940
Hey Billy boy. First Time,
long time I got there,

704
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,490
I'm going to go to get right into it.
All right.

705
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:05,000
Last weekend I got a text from a former
fuck buddy who found out that I had

706
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:08,330
slept with their friend before we
started hooking up. Oh, you know what?

707
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:12,440
Go Fuck Yourself. All right. You're
crushing ass all over the place.

708
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:14,840
You don't need my advice.
I probably need advice from you.

709
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,053
Okay.

710
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,590
That's all we,
that's a secret goal of,

711
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,390
of a certain percentage of guys is like,

712
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:26,380
what if I can fuck her and all of her
friends before they all figure it out?

713
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:29,500
You know what I mean? It's sort of
like an action movie with your Dick.

714
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,430
Can I stick in and all of them
before the bomb goes off and uh,

715
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:45,410
and can I get out of town like fucking
Deniro and heat before I see all of them

716
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:48,120
coming up with the,
how dare you?

717
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,150
Have you ever fantasized about doing that?
And you were so good.

718
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,620
That is mad as they were.

719
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:57,920
They all reminisced about how great you
were and then all four of them come over

720
00:43:57,921 --> 00:44:02,060
and be like, ah, well fuck he. At the same
time, if you haven't had that fantasy,

721
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,140
God bless you because you're evidently
a way more decent human being than I am.

722
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,460
So anyways, with that, here we go.

723
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:15,290
Um, he goes, she sends me. Anyway, let
me, let me just refresh your memory here.

724
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:18,140
Last weekend I got a text from a former
fuck buddy who found out that I had

725
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:20,960
slept with her friend before
we started hooking up.

726
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,320
She sends me a pretty heated to page
texts about how much of a dog and Douche

727
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:31,431
bag I am for sleeping with their friend
then fucking her the same weekend.

728
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,960
Yeah, dude, dude, you're a legend. You're
a fucking legend. What is the doing?

729
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:41,340
All you can do is just stand there
with your hands at your sides.

730
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,090
Take the slap to the face
and just know that, yeah,

731
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:47,340
you're a hero dude.

732
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:51,540
You banged her friend and
and her in the same weekend

733
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,910
and you're, you're, you, you don't front
a raw, a successful band. I mean, that's,

734
00:44:56,911 --> 00:45:00,750
that's, you know, my hat's off to you sir.

735
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,740
Hat's off to you. Anyways,
he goes now in reality,

736
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,800
I had slept with the friend in late May
and then starting hook hooking up with

737
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:14,580
the fuck buddy in early
September. Oh, okay. So she
tried to make it more dramatic.

738
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,720
That's still great,
dude.

739
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:22,050
You seamlessly made the shift
over the summer. You still a hero.

740
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,030
Um, anyways, he goes to go into
a little more detailed to fuck.

741
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:31,770
Buddy had gone on several
dates and fucked once three.

742
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,590
Oh. I had gone on several
dates with her and fucked once,

743
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,930
three years prior when
we were both at college,

744
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:42,570
but then shortly after she lost interest
and we remained as friends for the next

745
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:42,571
few years.

746
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:47,220
When I say friends I mean the occasional
texts and seeing each other maybe three

747
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:51,210
or four times. All right, so
what is your fucking problem?

748
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,130
What is the rule?
Shouldn't this,

749
00:45:54,131 --> 00:45:57,340
shouldn't the second one be mad at you
cause you fucked the other one first?

750
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:04,070
I don't know. I'll never
understand. I never understand.

751
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,120
What can any female,
if you're still listening at this point,

752
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,370
if I have any female
listeners at this point,

753
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:12,760
can you explain to me
why that makes you mad?

754
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,180
You know because I don't know.
There was always like,

755
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,810
there was always that girl that like,
you know when I was growing up,

756
00:46:22,811 --> 00:46:26,320
like I can't say me because
I wasn't getting anything.

757
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:31,610
I didn't get anything in high school,
big fucking goose egg. I would make my,

758
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,900
my pussy getting career in high school.

759
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:39,901
I was like the first year the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers came in the league and when

760
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,953
winless

761
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,210
what was the name of their Gary hough.
Was that the name of their quarterback?

762
00:46:49,211 --> 00:46:53,230
I was the Gary Huff of of Pussy in, in,
in high school. Whatever the hell are you,

763
00:46:53,231 --> 00:46:55,870
I can't remember the name.
His last name was huff,

764
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,920
was the name of their quarterback with
creamsicle fucking uniform and well had a

765
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:04,670
suit made out of that when I was
in high school. Um, I, but anyways,

766
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,031
there,
there were,

767
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:11,031
there were those girls that like my
drinking buddy crew like three or four of

768
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:16,251
them out of the five had all
hooked up with her and none of us.

769
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:21,330
For me, none of, nobody was mad.
Everybody high fives fun. Great. That's,

770
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:25,290
you know, we thought it was a great thing.
I don't understand why they get so mad.

771
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,370
You know what it is, is I, I
just think that want to, uh,

772
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,390
it's a big thing with them
then that has to be difficult

773
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,730
and you know,
and if they,

774
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:43,600
I think they just feel like if
you bang them and their friend,

775
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,320
they just somehow feel like
maybe it makes them feel cheaper

776
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,360
that there's just, you're just fucking
hidden. It's like you're a machine gun,

777
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:56,560
you just mowed them down.

778
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,250
I think that they really want to believe
that they're the only one in that area

779
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:05,000
code.
You know that they are like a,

780
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,900
that it's like gold rather
than like pine cones.

781
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,053
Okay.

782
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:18,290
You got to dig for it. It's a
precious metal. They don't, they,

783
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:21,710
that they don't want to feel like
they're just like litter in the gutter.

784
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,760
Maybe that's what I have. No, I have no
idea by I've learned something in this.

785
00:48:25,761 --> 00:48:29,910
Fuck Buddy is two words. This
guy put fuck buddy together. Um,

786
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,850
that's how much he's into sex right now.
He's getting,

787
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:34,320
he's literally like the fuck is his gun.

788
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,910
The buddy part bent over and
it's all one word. They are one.

789
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,400
Um,
so anyways,

790
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:42,670
he said to go into a little more
detail or I already read that part.

791
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,180
He said it so fast forward three years
and the friend of hers, that's the future.

792
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:52,040
Fuck Buddy said that we should
hang out after the sox game.

793
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,190
All right, I'm getting lost in this
with all my rambling. No, what the fuck?

794
00:48:57,191 --> 00:49:01,830
So you hooked up with a former
fuck buddy. And so now, okay,

795
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:04,170
so this is when, when,
when number two comes in,

796
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,620
before you went back to number one.
All right,

797
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:11,680
so fast forward three years later.
Yes. So she didn't give a fuck.

798
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,300
So who she should be mad at is the second
one. No, but it's been three years.

799
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,960
You know, I really don't think anybody
has the right to be mad here. All right,

800
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:24,960
whatever. She said we shouldn't hang
out after a sox game. Of course,

801
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:29,250
I see this as a green light because
whenever a girl that you really don't know

802
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:33,540
says we should hang out is code
for I'm down to fuck. Exactly.

803
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:37,550
Did you hear that?
A guy with the fucking bassoon.

804
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:43,520
You got they speak in code.
We should hang out sometime.

805
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,000
That that's literally, that's
what that means. If they say,

806
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,500
well do you have anything?
You're taking me out.

807
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,200
That means they want a relationship.
We should hang out sometime.

808
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,380
That's what that means. Okay. And I'm
not saying 100% just say it. It's,

809
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,080
it's looking good. You get waved
around by the third base coach.

810
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,480
Um,
anyways,

811
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,220
where the hell am oh for fuck sakes.
I apologize guys.

812
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:14,290
When a girl says eight down, fuck. So
also anyways, so we end up fucking,

813
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,700
and she gets on a plane the next day to
study abroad in Europe for the summer.

814
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,930
Exactly. She wanted some
shoving off Dick. You know,

815
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:29,090
let me get a little last piece of
America before I go over to tremendous.

816
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,910
Anyways, fast forward three
months later and the fuck buddy,

817
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
all one word says that I should come
over some weekend to hang out greenlight.

818
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:38,930
We Bang,
it's great.

819
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:42,440
And we continued to do it until the
end of the month when I fly back to the

820
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:47,270
place that I now live. So a few days ago
I get the heat of tech saying I'm a dog,

821
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:50,270
I'm a Douche bag. And she thought
I was a friend, et cetera.

822
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,930
I say that there's nothing I can
do or say to change what happened.

823
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,580
And the only thing that I could say is,

824
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:59,660
I'm sorry if I hurt her and then I
am an asshole by my question to you.

825
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,820
Uh, Mr no relationship
psychology degree comedian is,

826
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:08,210
am I a dog for what I did?
No,

827
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,920
you're not.

828
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:11,490
Okay.

829
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:15,240
You're not in fuck these women who call
you up. And use you like a fuck stick.

830
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:16,590
All right.

831
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,500
They called you up because they wanted
some Dick and you gave it to them.

832
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:19,861
All right?

833
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:23,400
You gave him what the fuck they asked
for and then she's going to turn around

834
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:28,110
and get mad at you and then you
apologize and say, yeah, I'm an asshole.

835
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,000
You're not an asshole.
But you know something.

836
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,760
I don't think you think you're an asshole
because you're out there crushing it.

837
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:36,000
You're just fucking saying what you
know this girl wants to hear because

838
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:39,420
probably six months from now she's
going to fuck you again. Right.

839
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,920
You're not an asshole. You didn't
hit on the other girl. She said, hey,

840
00:51:44,921 --> 00:51:47,890
we should hang out sometime. Okay.
She's giving you the green light.

841
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:53,140
You know what I mean? You're a guy you
have to take that. You gotta take it.

842
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:56,350
Women don't understand that because they
can get laid every night of the fucking

843
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:58,540
week if they want to.
They don't have to have any game

844
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,100
did they did it for us. It's, it's,
it's work. It's a skill. Okay,

845
00:52:05,101 --> 00:52:07,500
so when somebody wants,
if it's like you're in the wild,

846
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,570
you got a free fucking meal,
you're going to take it.

847
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,430
You know I learned that in Australia
when I was looking at those poisonous

848
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,740
snakes and they're like, why does that
thing have enough venom to kill 200 mice?

849
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,270
Okay.

850
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,180
Why does it need that much venom?
It's cause it's out there in the fucking,

851
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,390
the outback and out in the outback.
Food is scarce.

852
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,640
So if you get a shot at something,

853
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:31,340
you've got to fucking take it down
and that's what the hell you did.

854
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,790
Yeah. Yeah. I'm a fucking dog. You know?
It's like, you know what? Fuck you lady.

855
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:38,950
Okay,

856
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:43,870
I'm a dog then. Then you're a whore.
Fama dog. You're a fucking whore.

857
00:52:43,871 --> 00:52:48,370
Did I call you up? Did I come
around sniffing up your skirt? No,

858
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,240
you called me because you wanted
some dick and I gave it to you.

859
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,100
How about a fucking thank you letter?

860
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,680
Yeah.

861
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,330
Did you really should have
come at her like that?

862
00:52:58,290 --> 00:52:58,670
Okay.

863
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,730
You really should've. And I got to tell
you something. And some fucked up levels.

864
00:53:01,731 --> 00:53:03,670
She would actually respect you
as long as you didn't call.

865
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,970
Don't call her a whore. All
right? But she fucks sheet.

866
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,090
So w what?
What is her relationship with you?

867
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,260
You guys barely talk and like
whenever she's in a dick dry spell,

868
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,530
she fucking goes over to you like
your hertz rent a car and just fuck.

869
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,720
Just ride your Dick.

870
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,770
And then you're supposed to be exclusive
and not bang her friend who's cut from

871
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:29,100
the cloth who wants to get plowed
before she goes over to Europe.

872
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,120
This is your fucking fault.
You're the one that should feel used.

873
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:34,900
Yeah.

874
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,020
You know neither one of them wants
a meaningful relationship with you.

875
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,950
You know what?
This is what I say.

876
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,550
Just don't even ride it back and
you know something. Fuck 'em again.

877
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,640
Just Bang them again. Do you agree? One
gives a fuck. Next time you see her,

878
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:56,320
she wants to give you a dirty look. Just
like I don't even react to it. What? What,

879
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:59,700
what a what a fucking what?
A bunch of bullshit.

880
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,220
And again, I can't believe that. Like
you, we don't have a relationship.

881
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,160
I'm just gonna keep saying the same
thing fucking over and over again.

882
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,293
Why don't I,

883
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:10,760
yeah.

884
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,730
Let me,
I'm stuttering here.

885
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,670
Do you know the other day I was watching
the, uh, when I was watching the Texans,

886
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:22,360
when the Patriots played the Texans
Monday night football, right. And, uh,

887
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:23,800
yeah,

888
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,470
some lady at the, at the, at the,

889
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:31,471
I was watching with us and she
started giving Bob Kraft Shit.

890
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,370
Okay.

891
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,370
For having like a,
a 35 year old girlfriend.

892
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,880
And for those you don't watch football.
Bob Kraft was married forever,

893
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:45,460
had a family and his, uh, wife
unfortunately died of cancer,

894
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,683
you know,

895
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:53,440
so she dies of cancer, you know, he stuck
by his side, did the whole damn thing.

896
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:58,470
And then now he's got a new girlfriend
and she's 35 and women are mad.

897
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,620
They're upset about, they're upset by,
and I, I don't, uh, I don't get it.

898
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,833
You know,

899
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,710
if I die of a disease,

900
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:14,180
I don't want fucking need it to be
sitting here like some spinster,

901
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,350
Guam, go have a good time,
I'm dead. I don't give a fuck,

902
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,133
you know,

903
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:25,830
let's say I'm a ghost and
I'm sitting there watching
it, then I wouldn't like it,

904
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,470
but I would just fly away.
Why would I sit there watching it?

905
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:33,853
No,

906
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,430
start haunting them every time
they were going to have sex.

907
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:40,290
I wouldn't do that to somebody. I
just don't understand why. Like, um,

908
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,460
it's not like you went out and got with
like a 17, 18, 19 2021 year old girl.

909
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:49,360
She's 35,
35 at 35.

910
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,610
If women aren't married,
they're freaking out.

911
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:55,950
Right.
Date Book.

912
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,210
I, I, you know what I love,
I just love that they get
mad at the guy and it's like,

913
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:03,890
what about the girl? Why is she with
them? Okay. If he's some sort of like,

914
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,950
you know, oh, he's just there
because he wants a hot girlfriend.

915
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:09,770
Then what about her? She's just there
for the money so then it works out,

916
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,070
doesn't it?
I Dunno.

917
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,520
They didn't want whenever
like shit like that goes on.

918
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:20,660
That really taps into the cynical
part of me, which, you know,

919
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,090
if you listen to this podcast,
God knows it doesn't take. But um,

920
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,480
yeah,

921
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,350
sometimes I just, I just think that it
almost taps into that fuck buddy thing.

922
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:32,720
Yeah.

923
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,720
They just don't want to know how
easily that they could be replaced yet.

924
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,100
They want you to feel

925
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:41,770
okay.

926
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,290
They don't give a fuck if they,
if they try and make you feel that way.

927
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:49,270
All those stupid songs, Beyonce,
that debt to the left, to the left,

928
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,663
you know,

929
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,750
that whole song is like, yeah, just take
your shit. Get the fuck out of here.

930
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:57,260
I'll have another guy in two seconds.
You're, you're that easily replaced.

931
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,253
You know,

932
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,710
and they, they love those
songs. Those songs are,

933
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,990
they consider them fucking empowering.

934
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,590
But then when they see a
successful guy with a, you know,

935
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,550
a nice closet full of shiny ties,
his own sports team,

936
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,830
when they see that he can still
fucking pull down some 35 year old ass,

937
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,730
they get mad.
They start judging his character

938
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,750
leaving me and my mom, we
had that discussion yet. Why?

939
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:27,760
I just don't think that that stage just,

940
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,820
and I'm sure that there was
somebody in their 50s and he could,

941
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:37,780
who the fuck wants to get with a
50 year old? Even if you're 70,

942
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,433
you know,

943
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,340
oh fuck. You know what I mean? You
know, you're starting over again.

944
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,110
If you got a fucking old
car and you trade it in,

945
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,850
you don't trade it in on a fucking
nother old car. You get a new one.

946
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,433
You know,

947
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:00,770
you fucking ride that thing into the
ground and then you get to know one.

948
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:01,604
I don't know.

949
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,240
I'm just saying I don't have a fucking
problem with what the guy's doing.

950
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,053
All right.

951
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,140
That's it. All right, everybody, if
you like, if you enjoyed this podcast,

952
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,733
mmm.

953
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,280
And you'd like to support the
podcast and in a roundabout way,

954
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:18,500
support the wounded warriors project,

955
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:22,740
go to [inaudible] dot com click on
the podcast page and click on, uh,

956
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,600
the Amazon link.
If you're going to buy anything on Amazon.

957
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:29,360
Not saying you have to, but if you've
got to buy something, just go and buy it.

958
00:58:29,361 --> 00:58:32,210
Doesn't change the price button
because you went through my website.

959
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:35,390
They gave me a little kickback and then
I take a portion of those proceeds and I

960
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,880
give it to the wounded warriors project.
So everybody wins.

961
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:41,150
You're helping out the podcast and more
importantly, you helping out the troops,

962
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,590
then that seems I'm kind of whoring out
their plight to increase money that I'm

963
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:51,440
making. I Dunno. There's something wrong
about that whole thing. I don't know,

964
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,890
do doing a good thing, but that's just
the way that whole thing set up. I,

965
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,780
I'm almost doing like what the NFL
is doing with, with that pink shit,

966
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,453
you know what I mean?

967
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:00,430
Yeah.

968
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,750
Instead of telling people the foods
that they can eat to look to, to,

969
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,460
to knock down the potential
of getting cancer,

970
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:08,280
they just have everybody running around
their dress like a Barbie doll. I don't,

971
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:12,870
I don't get it. And I'm guessing somebody
making some money off of it. All right.

972
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:16,650
That's all I'm saying. Um,
all right. That's the podcast
for this week. Everybody.

973
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:20,460
That's the pod pea w d cast.

974
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,190
That's the for this week. Thank
you guys so much for listening. Um,

975
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:30,170
NHL Hockey, I have given up on you.
They'd had given up on you. I've, I've,

976
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:32,360
I've threatened that I
was going to get the, uh,

977
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:37,100
whatever the fuck the NBA packages and
they had it for free for two, three days,

978
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:40,880
which was a great idea. And I watched
it and I'm enjoying watching the Knicks,

979
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,960
my Celtics, and watching the
Lakers lose. And I'm just, well,

980
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:46,970
I guess I get the Lakers
game out here all the time.

981
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,750
Do you know Bill Russel wrote some book
basically describing how he made the

982
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:54,910
guys around him on his team better.

983
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,790
And I was reading this
Bill Simmons article.

984
00:59:57,791 --> 01:00:01,930
It was making me sick to my
stomach because I couldn't
finish reading it because

985
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,550
I think Colby is reading it,

986
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,980
which would really be devastating because
I don't think Colby has ever progressed

987
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,910
beyond where Michael j,
Michael Jackson,

988
01:00:12,911 --> 01:00:17,911
Michael Jordan was in about 1989
when Michael was trying to do it all

989
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:18,964
themselves.

990
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,513
And

991
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,260
there's nothing better as a Celtics fan.

992
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:23,580
Yeah.

993
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,940
That when Phil Jackson isn't coaching
and Colby is just trying to do it all

994
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:27,570
himself,

995
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:31,870
there's nothing fucking better because
he's going to score 30 and they're going

996
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,520
to lose. And, uh, that's
what I love to see.

997
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,351
Uh,

998
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:45,160
wouldn't that be ironic if
it took a Celtic to teach
a Laker how to fucking win?

999
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:49,330
Wouldn't that be something? All right,
that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves.

1000
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:50,320
I'll talk to you next week.
