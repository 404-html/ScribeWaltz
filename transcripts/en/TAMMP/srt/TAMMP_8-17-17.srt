1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:02,301
Hey,

2
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:06,050
what's going on is bill burn is time for
the Monday morning podcast from Monday.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,820
Sorry for Thursday. No, it isn't.
It's not the money. My head,

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:14,690
it's a Thursday afternoon just before
Friday. Monday morning podcast. Dan.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,050
Yes. Checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.

6
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:25,220
How you doing? What are you, what are you
done today? How did you watch the news?

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,020
Did you fill your head up with all the
fucking craziness on the news isn't a

8
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:34,610
great watch and then dose. Oh yeah.
Hey, I'm waking up. I'm feeling good.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,190
You know what?
Let's turn on the news.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,413
Okay.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,970
Why would you put on the fucking
news? What are you going to see? Oh,

12
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:46,850
you're going to see an accurate
portrayal of what's going on.

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,090
Stick it out the fucking window.
I look at your neighbor. Hey,

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,270
look at him walking out to his car with
his little brown sack with his fucking

15
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:57,110
lunch in it.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:57,860
Okay.

17
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,260
Huh? Is he saluted Hitler? You know,

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,270
it's just a,

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,000
as he got a bomb strapped around his
waist as he got a mosquito on his head

20
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,730
that's biting him, him. So he
has babies with little heads.

21
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:11,520
Okay.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,090
Jesus fucking Christ the
God damn the hysteria.

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:16,830
Okay.

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,790
The hysteria that these news
organizations social. Yeah.

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,700
Media in all of this shit has created,
yeah. Can you just need, I'm just,

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,690
I'm fucking, while I'm walking away,
man, I'm walking away. I'm done.

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,190
I don't need to know what's going on.
I don't need to be informed. Okay.

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,260
Because walking around in a constant
state of fucking hysteria is,

29
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:41,580
I don't think that that
is being informed when,

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,130
okay.

31
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,880
My Real, my reality, my day
to day is I get in a car,

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,350
I drive to a building and I write
dialog for cartoon characters.

33
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,930
Occasionally I get to play drums.
I do stand up.

34
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,290
I hang out with my wife in his APP by,
right.

35
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,790
I hang out with my daughter and that's it,

36
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,080
but I put on the news and I will literally
think that there's a glacier melting

37
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,420
right above me that's going to drown me.

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,620
Polar bears are going to swim in and
eat meat with fucking a bomb strapped

39
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:17,850
around their fucking waste.

40
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,380
Everybody fucking relax,

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,420
fucking relax and all these people fucking
going on there and they just show it,

42
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:33,150
show got on TV and told Trump supporters.
I love these people that like,

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,940
you know, on these fucking news channels,
they go on and they fucking, you know,

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,460
give the other side a piece of their
mind as if the other side even sees it.

45
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,980
They're too busy, like watching their
own shit. And even if they see your shit,

46
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,060
you're not going to sway them.
I'd equate it to the,

47
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,300
all those years I lived in New
York City as a Boston red sox fan.

48
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,120
During that time I didn't have
money for the baseball package,

49
00:02:57,121 --> 00:03:00,790
so I used to watch the yes network.
I always watched Yankee home games,

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,710
always home away,
whatever.

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,810
I rooted against them the
entire time I watched them.

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,840
I watched more Yankee Games from 1999
to 2007 then I watched red sox gangs.

53
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,420
So in theory I should have become
a Yankee fan, but I, I did not.

54
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,330
Yeah.

55
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,120
Because I was a staunch,
uh,

56
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,760
red freckled faced red
sox fan and that's it.

57
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,660
So all these people going on TV
talking about these fucking people.

58
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:33,710
Now these fucking jerk offs are
going to go up to Boston, right?

59
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,050
You know, 18 fucking jerk offs, you know,
I know it's more than that, but everybody,

60
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:42,150
oh my God. And then Nancy's taking
over and then they're going to,

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,400
they're gonna show the fucking footage
of Boston and busing and all of that shit

62
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:50,390
from way back in the fucking day.
Is this a perfect storm?

63
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:51,470
I racism?

64
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,540
Is Hitler really dead when we return it?

65
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,170
His body was never found.

66
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,260
Yeah.

67
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,190
According to reports,

68
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:08,660
there was an angry look and jerk off
riding around in a Mercedes Benz spotted

69
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:09,890
just last year

70
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,850
down in South America. Um,
I'm done with all of them.

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,620
It's absolute fucking history out that
these people are losing their fucking

72
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:30,180
minds, losing their minds,
screaming and yelling at each other.

73
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,890
Nobody's listening to anybody.

74
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,060
Everybody's acting like
the fucking sky is falling.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,920
One fat fuck shoots off a fucking
missile and everybody loses their shit.

76
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,560
One missile, we do that every fucking
day. We're worried about this guy

77
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,120
when fucking fat guy with,

78
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,230
I just don't understand the level of
fucking freak out that's going on,

79
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,123
you know?

80
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,320
Okay.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,880
It's fine. Yankees were playing
the red sox this weekend.

82
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,290
All right. College football's
coming up. Nfl Football,

83
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,790
baseball playoffs are coming.
It's all going to be fine.

84
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,270
All right.
I gotta tell you,

85
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,790
there's always been Nazi supporters and
they've kind of always have rallies,

86
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,270
but at the, it's not like they're
growing, you know what I mean?

87
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,890
Are they, I mean, I, I
gotta be honest with you.

88
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:40,370
You don't get any wider than me
and I've never gotten a flyer.

89
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:44,060
No one's ever asked me to join. I
don't walk down the street. Hey, hey.

90
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,043
Guten tag.

91
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,200
Look, I'm not saying these
aren't important issues,

92
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:58,201
but I'm just saying the level that
people are fucking freaking out.

93
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,470
All right? Just need to fucking
relaxed. Just fuck of a Laxman.

94
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,630
Okay. You can vote against
whoever you want to vote against.

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay?

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,080
Very soon,
right?

97
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,930
Isn't it like midterm elections
and then there's this other shit.

98
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,140
You know what's going to happen. You
know what's going to happen. Okay?

99
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,180
This is fucking country goes way down,
way over here.

100
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,650
So anyways, whatever. How you doing?

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,510
How was your Thursday afternoon?
[inaudible] got good people in your life.

102
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,270
Jabba Sandwich today,
uh, was not delicious.

103
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,330
Was there a terrorist in your sandwich?

104
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,130
Was there a little Nazi flag on the
fucking toothpick that they stuck in your

105
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:43,980
fucking know club sandwich there?

106
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm going to say there wasn't,

107
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,830
I'm going to go out on a limb and
I'm going to say there wasn't,

108
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm actually doing the Trump hand thing
right now where you put your index

109
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:56,320
finger and your thumb, your thumb. I like
it. The other three fingers stickup up.

110
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:57,154
You know what's great about it?

111
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,650
You really feel like you're
fucking drive and your point home.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,590
Let's start doing that with my wife.
Okay.

113
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,330
I tell you right now there's going
to be cold, cold beer in the fridge.

114
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,610
Um,

115
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,450
you know what the biggest crisis in my
life is right now is I cannot fucking,

116
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,910
I cannot sustain

117
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,330
a work out or eating well
for any significant amount
of times to prevent me from

118
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:25,750
staying at the fucking weight or
gaining weight. I just can't do it.

119
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:26,980
This fucking writer's room,

120
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,420
you just sitting in there with all these
people you love watching them slowly

121
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:35,470
die. That's what it is. Because no
matter how few calories you eat,

122
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,980
you're sitting on your fucking ass for
eight to 10 hours a day and you just

123
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:40,180
can't.
You can't fucking do it.

124
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,550
I'm so fucking pissed at myself right now.

125
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:47,140
I'm going to have to
start doing two a days.

126
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:51,010
I'm going to work out in the morning
and I'm just going to have to like,

127
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't know what to do.
I went out last night and I did a,

128
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,640
I did a show down at Largo,

129
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,920
okay.

130
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,390
And I stopped eating it like,
you know,

131
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:02,820
I don't know when the fuck I didn't
want to have like five o'clock.

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,260
I don't even remember what I had for
dinner. Five 30 or something like that.

133
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,010
Oh. Then I got down to the club and I
was hungry and I went to this vegetarian

134
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:16,660
restaurant, those fucking
things. Oh, I didn't eat meat.
Yeah, but what did you eat?

135
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,720
What? What was in that
fucking sauce? You know?

136
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,310
It's gone right to your fucking ass,
right. Your stomach. And then, um,

137
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,220
you know, I had one, one
whiskey, that was it.

138
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,650
And then I came home and
I'm fucking starving.

139
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,850
My wife had a little bit of Thai food
and I had that and I'm just, I'm fucked.

140
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,400
I'm killing my side.
I don't know. I gotta,

141
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:42,370
I gotta I don't know what
happened to by discipline. Um,

142
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,630
I dunno. I'm just under a lot
of fucking stress right now.

143
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:50,010
I guess that's why I'm
having this reaction to the
fucking news and everybody's

144
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:52,800
watching it and then they coming in and
then like, can you fucking believe it?

145
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,430
Can you fucking believe this? It's
just like, all right, Kay. You know,

146
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:57,390
it'd be great in the news that they,

147
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:01,500
if they showed the amount of fucking
people last week who didn't get in a car

148
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,560
and plow down a bunch of fucking people,
like a complete piece of shit,

149
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:08,880
that would be the rest of us.
And then this one fucking asshole does it.

150
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,460
And then everybody starts thinking,
is this what the world's going to be like?

151
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,820
Now? Is this going to happen?
It's this, how fucking,

152
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,180
I don't know how awful a fucking parrot
did that person have Jesus Christ.

153
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:18,361
You know,

154
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,180
I think when your kid starts putting
like the Hitler poster on the wall,

155
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,890
it's time to be a little more involved.

156
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,760
Maybe sign them up for volleyball or
something. Try to get them out there,

157
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,594
you know?

158
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,353
All right.

159
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,790
I Dunno what you do with that.
Is there a hotline for that one?

160
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,320
800.
My son's into Hitler.

161
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,430
A one 800 A. I keep finding two
holes poked in the pillow cases.

162
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,680
Um, you know what I mean?
There's unconditional love
and then there's Hitler,

163
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,470
right? Who's kitten home?
And then it's kind of like,
all right. You know what? Uh,

164
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:57,550
I think it's a time to ship you off to
the loony Bin and let's make a new kid.

165
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,210
It's time to make a new kid shot.
You know what?

166
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,370
You're like an old star. It's time
to golf. Which do you like Brett?

167
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:10,900
Farve when he got shipped to the fucking
jet, it's all over for you. It's over.

168
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,980
Okay. You can't make the pass across
the field anymore. You know what I mean?

169
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:19,700
You've lost your vision, ed, you got post
as a Hitler, it's over with Trey to you,

170
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:24,040
to the New York jets and we're bringing
in a nose. That baby, she had a baby man,

171
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,570
we're having a fucking,
that's what I would do.

172
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,990
Okay.

173
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,480
By the kid became a racist.

174
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:32,560
I would fucking turn my kid in and then I
would just make a new kid. That's it. I,

175
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,980
you know, go back to the
draft. You know what I mean?

176
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,820
I maybe adopt basically sign a free agent.

177
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,663
Okay.

178
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,370
You really have to have a strict no
Hitler fucking policy and your house.

179
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:52,110
You just have to have it. Um, anyways,

180
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,370
I saw this thing where,
uh,

181
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,630
people were going on to an white people
going to an@ancestry.com and we're not

182
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:02,430
pleased with some of the results.
Yeah. I mean, that's going to happen,

183
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,560
right?
It's going to happen.

184
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,260
You're going to find a couple of surprises
in there that's going to fuck up.

185
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:11,100
Fuck with your manifesto. You know,
I would love to, if he could fucking,

186
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,450
what the fuck did they do
with Hitler anyways? What did
he mean? Even if he lived,

187
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:19,050
he's gotta be dead by now. Right. What
was that guy born? 1890 something.

188
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,443
Okay.

189
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,830
He's so evil. Like maybe he's still
alive. Just the hate is keeping him going.

190
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,530
Yeah.

191
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,320
You know,

192
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,320
just picture him with like a fucking ss
walker screaming with every step trying

193
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,780
to get to the fucking toilet,
you know,

194
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,420
to take a master race shit.

195
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,210
Ah,
if

196
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,460
they only just encouraged his painting
is that it only happened then you

197
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:51,260
wouldn't have all this craziness.
Why are you still what?

198
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:55,270
They'd find something else. Anyways,
red socks up, down, up, down, up,

199
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,740
down against this week.
Yankees,

200
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,750
I think they won last night
against the mets. Soda, Red Sox,

201
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,490
Yankees play this weekend.
Right?

202
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,370
Everybody's going to have a
good time and enjoy the game.

203
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:10,960
I take me out to the ballgame.
Take me out to the crowd,

204
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,970
buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks,
you know,

205
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,110
scan your fingerprints at fucking tiger
stadium because you are a fucking dope.

206
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,960
Dope. Um, so anyways, I'm going
to start doing two a day workouts.

207
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,830
That's when I got to do it. And I just
have to, I have to fucking commit. MMM.

208
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,750
I'm trying to figure out this new life
that I have with this fucking writer's

209
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:39,920
room because it takes up so much,
so much of my time that, um,

210
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,000
you know, I have a very finite
amount of time to fucking work out.

211
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,680
It's still actually keep my standup act
going and all of this shit and I think

212
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:52,350
it's causing me stress. And uh,
maybe that's the fucking problem.

213
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,190
Maybe I'm just old. I Dunno.
I got to fight it, dude.

214
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,000
I can't have the fucking dad
bud. You know, we just like,

215
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,250
just thick it big,

216
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:06,720
fucking you stupid skinny arms coming
out the side that Mr. Potato Head,

217
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:11,430
fucking body. You know,
I can't fucking do it.

218
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,580
I guess also because I blew
out my shoulder, which is
finally the thing is, is,

219
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,130
is better now I'm going really slow and
the uh, the rotator cuff shit going on,

220
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:26,900
right? So I'm now, this
morning, I actually, for the
first time in like a year,

221
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:32,360
I had the fucking bar bell and I was
benching and I had five pounds on each

222
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:36,420
side.
That's how long and slow this processes.

223
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,250
And I felt like they'll just a little
something and I was going to do three sets

224
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:44,150
and I said I immediately stopped, which
is what you have to do with an injury.

225
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:48,360
So you'd have to immediately go,
you know what? Fuck this. Okay,

226
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,370
I'm not doing this anymore. So
anyways, let's, let's, you know, let's,

227
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,120
let's Google some news.
Yeah. Google cancels,

228
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,840
cancels domain registration
for daily stormer.

229
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,870
All right,
let's see what we got here.

230
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:05,950
Google has canceled all this is going
to be more hate group Shit. Okay.

231
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,540
Uh, Justin Bieber may been unknown. 17
year old, famous with a single picture.

232
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,440
Uh,

233
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,440
really a reporter calls out Huckabee's
claim that countless FBI employees were,

234
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,160
that's like reporting.
Now you just put in,

235
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:26,080
your headline is really three death foods.
You should avoid

236
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,580
death foods. Okay. All right, let's
just read this one. Let's see.

237
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:38,480
We say we are canceling daily stormers
registration with Google domains for

238
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:43,070
violating our terms of service. The
spokesperson told business insider, well,

239
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:46,220
where the fuck was this a while ago?
Uh,

240
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:49,520
you read Google's registration agreement,
you can read it here. Okay, go.

241
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,070
But one wanted service use to violence.

242
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,350
A source close to Google
told business insider. Um,

243
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,470
I dunno, I hate to do
the Cliche, but when you,

244
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,700
those fucking white supremacists groups,
they're just the dumbest fucking people.

245
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,480
Look at this fucking guy.

246
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,170
It's like if they went and they made
a movie about white supremacists,

247
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:16,480
guy went to the casting.

248
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,683
I Dunno,

249
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,750
I don't get people who go
down and protest the fucking,

250
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,670
these hate groups just let him
go down there and screaming,

251
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,270
yell to nobody.

252
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,970
Okay.

253
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,810
You know what I mean? Why do you go
down there and then what do you do?

254
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,930
You start tearing their signs down
as if they're going to be like, oh,

255
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:44,250
they tore our side down.
Now I see their fucking,

256
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:45,510
now I see their side of it.

257
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,100
All you're doing is reinforced it in
their head that you guys are fucking

258
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:53,220
assholes.
You should go down there.

259
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:56,280
You should bake them a little pumpkin pie,
little apple pie,

260
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,900
and just give him some food and just be
nice to them. That's what we should do.

261
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,520
That fucking guy that fatty
over there in North Korea.

262
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,693
You know,

263
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,420
Bob's trumpet golf there and smoke a cigar
with the talk about grabbing pussies.

264
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:11,830
Whatever the fuck he
wanted. The doe, you know,

265
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,580
steady. You'll book. We do that.
We're going to do this. All right.

266
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,580
Oh God.
I have to get out of this vortex here.

267
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:29,170
I just fucking Google News Boston to
hate groups. You're not welcome here.

268
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,530
Uh,
you're not welcome here.

269
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:36,010
We got plenty of a hate
is already here in Boston.

270
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,100
Know it'd be funny if other racists
and Boston were upset about the racist

271
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:48,990
coming here. They're going to take
our, Hey, go take her jobs, man.

272
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,273
Okay,

273
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,001
Doh,

274
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:55,790
we can't have a bunch of other people
coming up here dropping the fucking end

275
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,970
word or what are we going to do ed?

276
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,900
You're not wanted here. Dope.
We're not higher rent. We
got fucking plenty of them.

277
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,450
Um, anyways. Uh, what else? What else?

278
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:12,590
I got nothing going on,
dude.

279
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:16,130
I'm just sitting in a fucking writers
from eating Salads and somehow putting on

280
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:20,060
weight because at the end of the day, I
fuck it up. But last night I was at Largo.

281
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,450
I got one more show down there tonight.
Um, I worked with Joe Barton again,

282
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,750
Todd rex to absolute fucking bees and,
um,

283
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,350
they killed it last night. We're going
to be down there again tonight for a, a,

284
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,940
a great cause. A friend of mine, uh,

285
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,710
Pete common unfortunately
passed away last year. Uh,

286
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:44,030
one of the great comics that I met
on the way up and just a great guy.

287
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,640
So we're raising money for his kids.

288
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:50,641
So I want to thank everybody that came
down there last night and tonight raising

289
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:55,200
funds, doing something
positive, not being an isis,

290
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,620
not being in a hate group.
Write something positive.

291
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,260
Um,
honey,

292
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,560
when I told you I wanted you to be more
social, I should've been more specific.

293
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,780
That's a mom pulling up to like
a Klan rally yelling at her son

294
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,780
Timmy. I wish you wouldn't do
that. I really wish she wouldn't.

295
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,080
Could you just stop it? I mean, um,

296
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,470
anyways, I just can't get out of
the vortex of that. So anyways,

297
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:36,330
I'm all freckles is trying to,
uh,

298
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,090
invest his fucking money because
the government's taken all of it.

299
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,780
And I'm sitting here trying to buy the
smallest of small little properties here.

300
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,010
So some day when I'm in
my fucking seventies and
eighties and I don't feel like

301
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:51,300
going out on the road unless I want to.
I don't have to, you know what I mean?

302
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,620
I don't want to fuck, you know
what I mean? Cause you know you,

303
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,580
what goes up comes back down again.

304
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:01,581
And if I'd start the gentle slide back
down to doing the fucking comedy vault at

305
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:06,140
Remington's in Boston when
I'm in my eighties, um,

306
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,810
which unfortunately that room finally
passed away like a year or two ago,

307
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,940
about a year and a half
ago. The comedy vault. Okay.

308
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,870
Legendary rump started in 1993.

309
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,630
Dick Doroty how Spike Tobin,
I was on one of the first nights.

310
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:24,380
They're put together my first five
minutes write down there right next to the

311
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:27,950
fucking bag fault.
Why am I thinking of that shit?

312
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:31,460
Because right now I'm trying
to get a loan. All right.

313
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
And I have,
I should have perfect fucking credit,

314
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,690
but I don't because I pay off my
credit cards every fucking month.

315
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:42,720
So and they don't like that
I paid off my loans early.

316
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,860
They don't like that dings your credit.
They look at that like a loss. Like, Hey,

317
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:50,430
we are going to make five grand off
this loan. He paid it off twice as fast.

318
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:54,750
We only made 2,500 bucks.
We lost 2,500 bucks in this guy.

319
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,860
So I've given these guys every fucking
God damn piece of information they need.

320
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,630
I have the credit, I have the
fucking money. It's a fucking joke.

321
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,840
And then today they come at me.
They want two years of my,

322
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,850
my fucking cell phone bill.

323
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,500
Now I got to dig through all of my shit
to try and find that and I just want to

324
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:17,310
say to them, you can you just
tell me why you need all this? Oh,

325
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:22,080
these are the new regulations
of blood. Yes, yes. In why?
Why are these new regular,

326
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,400
why do these New York regulations exist?
Well,

327
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:27,540
I mean that's just something to know

328
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,140
exist because you guys were
irresponsible with your own country,

329
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:40,060
men's money 10 fucking years ago and you
fucking nuclear economy. I didn't do it.

330
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,120
I'm a responsible fucking guy.
I live within my means.

331
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:47,950
My checkbook is balanced and now I have
to jump through all these extra. Why?

332
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,110
Because you guys are greedy,
greedy,

333
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:54,430
fucking pieces of shit that gave
every fucking mouth breathing dope.

334
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,350
500 fucking thousand dollars came walking
through your back doors for good seven,

335
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:00,820
eight years in the last decade.

336
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,063
Okay,

337
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,920
now I gotta sit here digging through
shoe box is a fucking phone bills.

338
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,100
Okay?

339
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,190
You know because you're a double secret
probation cause you're a fuck up.

340
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:12,850
I love how cause they're a fuck up.

341
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,870
All of a sudden it reverts back to me
like now I have to pay for this since

342
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,340
okay,

343
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,330
we'll actually build this.

344
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,010
You the fact that they are holding
their feet to the fire like days,

345
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,580
you know that's a good thing for you and
your money because your money is tied

346
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:29,910
into the system. I realized that.
I just wish that when you say, hey,

347
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:33,750
why do I have to do this?
They don't hide behind a regulations.

348
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,920
They should say, well, because
we got so greedy 10 years ago,

349
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,150
the culmination of our greed
ended up with the, the fucking,

350
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,943
okay.

351
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,420
The cooking of the fucking economy and
old people thought they could retire then

352
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,700
had to continue working right
into their fucking grave.

353
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,460
That's what the fuck we
did with your money. Hence,

354
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,720
we need to see the last fucking two
years of your God damn phone bill. Oh,

355
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:02,050
we're taking college. Um, all right.

356
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:05,820
Let me read a couple of
advertisements here. All right.

357
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,660
All right.
Indochino Indochina,

358
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,870
Indochina,
uh,

359
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,020
talk about how every man looks
better in his suit. Ah, tell you,

360
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:19,300
you know what I mean? When I
look at Paul Versey, I'm like,

361
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:22,870
this guy's a fucking animal, yet you
put him in a suit. I'm like, Holy Shit.

362
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,190
I want to hear what dead man has to say.
He looks a lot better.

363
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:30,850
Look at him in that three piece
suit and those Jordan trees. Dude,

364
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,410
the Jordan's phrase with the
three piece suit, dope. Um,

365
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,550
Indochino is making it easy
to get perfectly tailored,

366
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,160
a perfectly tailored suit
at an incredible price.

367
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,850
You could choose from hundreds of top
quality fabrics and personalize your suit

368
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,940
just the way you want it,
whether it's for work, a wedding,

369
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,160

00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,790
Here's how it works.

373
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,460
You'd drop your fucking drawers and a
little fellow comes in and he measured

374
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:10,750
from your ball bag down
your ankle. No, sorry.

375
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:16,050
Visit a showroom or shop
online@indochino.com pick your fabric.

376
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,750
What do you want next to your balls?

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,900
Choose your customizations from lapels,

378
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:27,490
lapels to pleats to jacket linings
in more. Submit your measurements,

379
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:31,990

but it will do me undies.
Me undies.

393
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:29,050
Your son's into fucking Hitler
due to due to me undies d

394
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,200
but his pants on and
watch him take his shit.

395
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:38,720
[inaudible] he's got a fucking
Adolf stash. What do you need?

396
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,400
Nothing rhymes. I'm fucking sorry.
Fuck. I went with Hitler and mustache

397
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,360
stash.
He's got a Hitler fucking stash.

398
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,050
You're a dope. You fucking white trash.
No one cares. You're not supreme.

399
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,010
You just a bunch of fucking
losers getting sunburns.

400
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,220
Everyone should just ignore them.

401
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,280
I love that whole feeling
that if you ignore them,

402
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:05,880
that that's just what exactly what
they did when they were in fucking jerk

403
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:09,480
enough. This is different.
This is different. Okay.

404
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:14,310
You don't have a you that this is
different, right? Isn't it different?

405
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,330
It's completely different.

406
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,530
It's a different scenario. This
country is on top. Germany wasn't,

407
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,360
you know what I mean? If this country
spiraled down in the rankings,

408
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,033
you know,

409
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,330
like what happened to the
Michigan Wolverines over
the last 20 years where they

410
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:38,230
were, they were this powerhouse fucking
program and then they just dropped out at

411
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:43,180
site, flatlined for 15 years. That's
when, that's when they can take hold.

412
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:45,340
But you know everybody and
everybody's got their fucking,

413
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,990
everybody's walking around with
Crocs, right? They got dead jagged,

414
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,830
jagged ExOne.
Everybody's got a flat screen TV.

415
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,850
Everybody's putting on weight like me.
It's a fucking great country. So they,

416
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,073
nobody hears them.

417
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,633
I don't think

418
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,360
I'm just going to shut up me undies.
Okay.

419
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:06,640
You want to look good and your
underwear and be comfortable. Right.

420
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,530
But that perfect balance is hard to find.
Yeah. If you're fucking mushroomed fat,

421
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:16,090
fuck. Like me. Talk about why me undies
is the best underwear you will ever own.

422
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,010
Feel free to improvise.

423
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,000
Uh,
this I just,

424
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:28,390
if you fucking want your balls
to fill nice and soft, okay.

425
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,460
Do you want to treat your balls right?
Basically the,

426
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,330
the weak point in the death star that is
the male body, which is the balls. Okay?

427
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:40,060
Cause I don't give a shit how
many fucking weights you lift,

428
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,780
how many fucking Kung Fu classes you
take. If you look in the other way, in a,

429
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:46,050
in a fucking,
I don't care.

430
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:49,500
A little bunny rabbit is hopping by and

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,150
I have a will and a trust.
All right. Do not revive me.

488
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,950

me in the ground. No coffin. Right?

491
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,950
There you go. No coffin. Just let
me fucking decompose. Naturally.

492
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,910
Feed the fucking soil.
You know dumb it is that we actually,

493
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:42,490
you put a box in the ground.
It's so fucking stupid.

494
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,970
You're dead sober.

495
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,650

then fill it up with formaldehyde or

500
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,520
whatever the fuck they do.
Or You could just get it over with.

501
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:05,470

If you're married and you have kids,

511
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:38,830
you have to do that. There's so many
guys out there, they're just afraid of,

512
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,910
of thinking about their own mortality.
And I have to tell you, it's, it's a,

513
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,860
it's a weight off for your chest. All
right? Cause when you get to my age,

514
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,260
you're going to see,
unfortunately,

515
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,320
people dying who don't do that stuff.

516
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,220
And how they leave their loved ones is,

517
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,780
is the second tragedy. Um, you know,

518
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,990
so don't fucking do that to
the people you love. All right?

519
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,170
Being dead serious here. Dead
fucking serious. No Pun intended.

520
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:10,000
You've got to fucking do that.
You gotta take care of them.

521
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,050
You're going to die fucking deal with it.
All right.

522
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,920
And God knows if you've
got a woman in your life,

523
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:18,820
you're going to die sooner rather than
fucking later with all of the shit that

524
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:22,660
they do. They just, you know, they can't
help it. That's just what they are. They,

525
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:26,890
they give they love and they take,
that's the balance. You know,

526
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,970
everything that they give your kid a,

527
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,600
they take away from you and
then you just slowly died.

528
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,090
This lonely existence in a
room full of other people.

529
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,330
And that is the podcast for
this afternoon. I'm kidding. Um,

530
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,300
that's everything was fucking around
today on this podcast. But seriously,

531
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:45,530
stick your head out the window. You
know, just fucking everybody relax.

532
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,860
Fucking relax.

533
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,910
Fucking Christ. He could
see these God damn people. I
mean, the two fucking stupid.

534
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:57,250
They're, they're, they're too
fucking stupid to brush their teeth.

535
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,330
They're going to run a country.
Um,

536
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,650
and what does everything always go back
to Germany to this was like jeopardy and

537
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,200
the fucking 1930s. Well,
why isn't it like Russia?

538
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,273
Huh?

539
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:15,610
Why is it our country in the fucking 16,
17 and 18 hundreds?

540
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,550
It wasn't exactly a great place to
live for a lot of fucking people. Um,

541
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,290
oh Jesus. Now I'm doing it.
I'm talking to the fucking,

542
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:29,800
I don't know what I'm doing. Am I, am I
ranting and raving now? I have no idea.

543
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:33,250
All I know is I'm going to be in a good
mood today and I have to do two a days,

544
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,340
two a day. So I don't look
like a freckle doughboy here.

545
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,320
I worked out this morning,
you know,

546
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:41,320
I did my little half hour on the fucking
elliptical and I hate to throw the

547
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:45,970
weights around.
Now the most crucial thing is what I eat.

548
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:49,570
And when I stopped fucking eating.
All right,

549
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,610
so I already got it tonight.

550
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,790
I stopped eating at five o'clock.

551
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:59,590
I'm having a Turkey Patty with the
Tabbouleh Salad and then that's it.

552
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,080
And then I have to drink waters
for the rest of the fucking time.

553
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,120
And then to make up for my,
since last night,

554
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,540
I'm going to skip rope for
fucking three rounds, you know,

555
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:10,390
try to burn off some shit that way.
And uh, maybe that's what I'll do.

556
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:14,410
I'll do fucking two days. So what
I gotta do, I know what I gotta do.

557
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:16,810
I gotta fucking get out of this
writer's room. That's what I have to do.

558
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,540
Maybe instead of taking a lunch,

559
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:23,110
maybe I'll fucking bring an elliptical
into the office and why we pitch jokes.

560
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:24,430
I'll just be on the fucking thing.

561
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,510
And everybody in the writer's
room just takes a turn, you know,

562
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,840
or every time you pitch a joke
and it doesn't get a laugh, Yo,

563
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,440
10 minutes on the fucking elliptical,
you know,

564
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,990
our whole fucking room will
look like a, you know, the,

565
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:45,130
they look at the end of the Tour de
France. We just burned so many calories.

566
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:47,990
Like your body's like eating yourself.
Um,

567
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,760
they'd be going to the table reads by
episodes eight and nine being like,

568
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:53,410
you know, it's a funny
show, but Jesus Christ,

569
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:57,850
if fucking Amaziah what kind
of show we do it here. Um,

570
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,300
they put their heart and soul into this
fucking thing. Um, oh wait a second.

571
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:04,600
All of a sudden and getting loud in my
ears. Oh, I turned it up by accident,

572
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,730
brushed against him with my forearm
there. All right. Um, hey, by the way,

573
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,430
I got a new band that I'd been listening
to and I'm not going to remember the

574
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:14,260
fucking name of them
cause I know my phone.

575
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,780
So really weird name for a band.
Let me see.

576
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,310
I'm opening my fucking iTunes,
go to artists.

577
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,730
I know it begins with an a,
this is getting everybody excited.

578
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,830
Please say my alt J.

579
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,650
I downloaded this album called this
is all yours and I fucking love it.

580
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,390
Great album, great album to
chill out to. I listened,

581
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:41,550
I worked out to it this morning
cause it was early in the morning.

582
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:43,820
It's kind of fucking, you know, you know,

583
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,320
creepy and mellow and all
that type of stuff. You know,

584
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,100
I guess I knew I was going to get
on the fucking s scale, but um,

585
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,380
I had never heard of them. And Josh,
Adam Meyers from the goddamn comedy jam,

586
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,790
he actually, when I was
on the road, he goes, Hey,

587
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:01,470
I'm going to go see this band
tonight. Uh, all Jay. I'm like, what?

588
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,390
I thought it was a Typo.
It's a l t lowercase Dash,

589
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:09,600
capital j. Uh, I really
enjoyed them. And once again,

590
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,800
you math has a new album coming out
next month. All right, that is it.

591
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,920
Please listen to the music.

592
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,450
A little interlude here before we give
you another half hour of greatest hits

593
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:20,790
from a Thursday afternoon
podcast from a Thursday,

594
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:25,290
from a Thursday that went by on a Thursday
that you didn't even pay attention to.

595
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,340
All right, that's it. God bless you.

596
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:33,900
Thank you for not being a
Nazi. Uh, I'll download.

597
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,090
I have a good weekend. You can
sit. I'll talk to you on Monday.

598
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,573
Nice.

599
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,510
No
body.

600
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,650
Hey,
what's going on?

601
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:35,460
It's bill burr and this is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

602
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,340
August 17th,

603
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,050
2007 or 2009. Why can't I
have a decent date, right?

604
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,131
I actually,

605
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:49,131
this is the second time I started the
podcast because I always just start it and

606
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:53,100
then I go to say the date and I
realize I don't know what the date is.

607
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,170
So I'm sick of doing that. Like I just
did that and I fucked up the date.

608
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,000
I was like, I do this every time. People
are going to think it's a gimmick,

609
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,750
like always deliberately fucking
up to date. So I just hit stop.

610
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:08,490
I hit a race and I started over
again and I fucked up the year.

611
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,930
Just something wrong with my brain. You
know what it was? Cause it was the 17th.

612
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,400
Then my brain was thinking seven.
So then when I went to say the year,

613
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:21,810
I say I said 2007 in case you're
wondering case you're wondering.

614
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,780
Um, anyways, I'm actually, uh,

615
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,350
it's Sunday when I'm doing
this podcast because a,

616
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,690
if you listen to this east
coast time in the morning,

617
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:35,290
I'm on an airplane right now. And uh, I
just got a bunch of shit to do tomorrow.

618
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:39,880
So I figured, uh, I'm not doing anything
today. Why not bang out a podcast,

619
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,373
you know,

620
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,810
anybody can go out in Atlanta and hang
out with another human being. You know,

621
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,460
it takes a real secure fucking loser

622
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,820
to, uh, you know, still being his fucking
hotel bed at what the fuck time is it?

623
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,600
1220 in the afternoon. Ah, Jesus Christ.

624
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,940
I'm watching the, um,
whatever the fuck golf major,

625
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:08,920
this is the PGA.

626
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,510
I'm actually betting against tiger
woods kind of have this ongoing a bet.

627
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:19,020
I keep betting against tiger woods with
a another comic friend of mine who is of

628
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:22,870
African persuasion, you know, basically,

629
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:25,650
cause I've kind of not been
watching baseball lately. Uh,

630
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,220
I've been trying to pick up new sports
and the only way for me to get into golf

631
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,380
is to have stupid ass bets.

632
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,070
So I figure I'll bet against not only
while they bet against tiger woods,

633
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,510
I will bet against tiger
woods with another black dude.

634
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,460
And I will, uh, you know, just
to make an interesting, you know,

635
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,240
okay,

636
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,160
say dumb shit, like golf's a white
man's game. I'm betting on Ernie els.

637
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,310
You know what?
I actually won in the fucking masters,

638
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:59,390
I bet on Phil Mickelson and I won
that one cause he'd beat tiger woods.

639
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:02,120
And then I dunno, I got busy and I
could have one another. You know,

640
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:03,710
we bet like 25 bucks a major,

641
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,270
I could have won the US Open and I
also could have won the fucking, uh,

642
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,500
that one over there in
England and I blew those off.

643
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,630
And I think I'm going to lose today.
It's weird. I'm betting against tiger,

644
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:20,690
but you know, my money is, but I'm
actually rooting for him, you know?

645
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,630
Is that exciting now? I don't think
it is either. Anyways, let's, uh,

646
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:30,900
let's plow ahead here. I'm going to
fucking bad mood. I had a really,

647
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,690
I had a really bad show last night.
Now the guy had a bad show.

648
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:40,280
I went up there and I did this whole
bid on Michael Vick coming back and it

649
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:43,780
killed and everybody was having a great
time. And then at the end of my set, this,

650
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:47,660
this woman comes up to me and,
uh,

651
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,990
you know, like when someone's gonna win
salt, you, you know, rather than having a,

652
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:54,800
I'm going to insult you,
look on their face.

653
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:56,450
They come up and they have an ear to ear,

654
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:58,490
like Africa's Strada Grin on their face.

655
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,190
Okay.

656
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,110
You know, that's what she was
doing. And she was just going
to like, hi. Hi. How you,

657
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,080
yeah, yeah. That whole thing of
our Michael Vick. Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:12,430
Did you really believe that? Is that
really how you feel? Yeah, and I,

659
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:15,880
I immediately knew. I'm like, Oh
God, this is a dog lover. Here we go.

660
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,230
So I was just like a, okay, ma'am.
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

661
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:22,570
I didn't like the show. Uh,
you know the just jokes,

662
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:24,820
if you want to take them seriously,
go ahead and take them seriously.

663
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,480
And then she just getting, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Cause you stayed.

664
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:29,950
Me and she statements are really ignorant.
I just say,

665
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:31,900
you should know that she's
like nodding and smiling.

666
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:36,200
He stayed me through really ignorant. It's
like, first of all, why are you smiling?

667
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,380
You know, I, I, that was the most annoying
thing. Not that she came up to me. I mean,

668
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:45,200
he's my own God damn fault.
I fucking,

669
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:47,870
not only do I go on stage and
I say a bunch of stupid shit,

670
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,270
but then I stand there
like an idiot selling DVDs.

671
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,130
I'm opening myself to somebody coming up
to me and telling me to go fuck myself.

672
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,600
I don't have a problem with that.

673
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,960
That comes with being a fucking shithead
who sells DVDs at the end of a show.

674
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,390
All right,
so I totally could have avoided that.

675
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,980
So I'm not complaining about that.

676
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:11,480
What I'm complaining about is people
who are telling you to go fuck yourself,

677
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,990
but there's smiling like, is that
supposed to like mind? Fuck me.

678
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,750
Like I'm gonna like I'm not even going
to notice what you're saying. Yeah.

679
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,390
Like wow. It sounds like she's telling
me to go fuck myself, but she smiling.

680
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,330
Maybe I'm hearing this wrong.
And then she's like,

681
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:29,990
your statements are really ignorant and
she's nodding like, you know what I mean?

682
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:34,190
Like that bugs bunny shit. Like remember
that when he, when he would be like, no,

683
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:36,260
the other guy would be
like, yes, no, yes, no.

684
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,660
And at some point he would switch and go.

685
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,910
He would switch over his fucking argument.

686
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:43,310
Then the other guy would end up
arguing bugs bunny's argument.

687
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,990
That's what the fuck she was trying to do.
To me.

688
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,380
Your statements are really ignorant and
she's like nodding like I'm going to be

689
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:52,710
like, yes, my statements were
ignorant, so I said, lady,

690
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,580
so basically what you're telling me is
because I don't agree with your point of

691
00:42:56,581 --> 00:43:01,290
view, that that makes me ignorant.
And then she pulls this, this thing,

692
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:05,280
she goes, I'm actually a member
of the humane society. All right.

693
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,980
You know,
first of all,

694
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:12,510
who the fuck breaks out credits during
an argument? You know what I mean?

695
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,750
She says it right and I'm a member
of the humane society, right?

696
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:19,170
Like it's supposed to be like this
dunk, dunk dog fucking moment. Oh Shit.

697
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,930
Are you a member of the humane society?
Good Lord.

698
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,980
How many years at college did
it take to get that Holy Shit?

699
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,090
Did you have to go through medical
school to become a member of the fucking

700
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:33,690
humane society? I actually for
half a second was like, wow,

701
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:37,950
I actually thought that she was on the
board of the humane society. First of all,

702
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,870
I don't even know what the
fucking humane society is.

703
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,470
Humane sounds like human to me,
like you're into people,

704
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,440
but evidently it isn't.
You're into fucking animals.

705
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,610
So I'm sitting here later on tonight,
I'll fucking annoyed with this lady.

706
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,000
This lady has, Jerry
Lewis would say, right,

707
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,590
I'm all fucking annoyed with this
lady thinking like a, then I'm like,

708
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,460
wait a minute.
She's a member of the humane society.

709
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:07,980
You know, I was a fucking member
of, uh, the fuck is that, that,

710
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:09,450
that thing now of course I can't remember.

711
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,000
You don't want to take it right
now is how fucked up my brain is.

712
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,710
I'm thinking a apocalypse now.
Amnesty International.

713
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,890
I know it was an a because I,
for some reason I thought there was a pa,

714
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,670
I was a member of Amnesty International
for like, like two, three years,

715
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,350
you know,

716
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:29,040
that was against torture and people
around the world and he and I became a

717
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,960
member.
I gave him 25.

718
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,170
I went on the Internet
and I gave him 25 bucks.

719
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,810
I have no fucking idea what
they did with the money.

720
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,180
I don't know if they stopped
someone from getting tortured.

721
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,880
I don't know if they just took that
money and they both do, you know,

722
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:44,350
a couple of them went out to a movie.

723
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:45,310
Okay,

724
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,700
Eh, 25 bucks, we'll go to the matinee
can, I was probably eight bucks each.

725
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:53,550
It's enough for some popcorn to
two tickets in a popcorn plant. Do,

726
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,670
we're not going to stop torture.
Um, so that's what I did.

727
00:44:57,671 --> 00:45:00,400
So let me go on the fucking Internet.
Let me look up this, this, uh,

728
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,400
this humane society.
And uh,

729
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,270
so I went to a humane
society.org and sure enough,

730
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,400
this is all you have to
do to become a member.

731
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,690
It's $19 a month or
whatever you can afford.

732
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,030
So I could give these fucking people a
dollar a month and then I too could walk

733
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:23,500
around and be a total fucking cunt and
then throw out my credit that I am a

734
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:25,930
member of the humane society.
And you know what?

735
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,080
I'm going to fucking join
the humane society at $1.

736
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,420
So the next time I do
this Michael Vick bit,

737
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,890
when one of these fucking psycho people
comes up to me having memory of the

738
00:45:35,891 --> 00:45:40,450
humane society. Oh Shit. You
know what? So Am I. Holy Shit.

739
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:43,030
I can't believe I didn't see it,
the meeting. Oh, that's right.

740
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,650
Neither one of us go to him.
There is no fucking meetings.

741
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:48,800
Okay.

742
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,440
A member of you made society,
you want to fucking,

743
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:55,100
I can't build sheet through that outlet.
She was on fucking like,

744
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:56,570
she just did the tonight show.

745
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,300
I'm the head of NBC.
You will never get a show on my network.

746
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:07,150
That's the way the fuck she was saying it.
God dammit.

747
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,260
It got worse. It got worse. So you
know me, someone's being a con to me,

748
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:13,990
no one can help cut me.
So you know,

749
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:17,500
I'm actually upset with myself
because I allowed her to make me mad.

750
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,610
As you can tell, considering it's
fucking 12 hours later and I'm still on,

751
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:25,930
I'm talking about it alone in my hotel
room with the drapes, pulled clothes.

752
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,420
This is how I always do it on the road.

753
00:46:28,421 --> 00:46:32,800
Fucking sitting around like
Howard Hughes. Um, yeah.

754
00:46:32,801 --> 00:46:36,160
So then she goes, uh, you know, I remember
the humane, the humane society and blah,

755
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:40,460
blah, blah, blah, blah. And
I said, look, okay. You know,

756
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,300
I don't under why do people
take comedy seriously?

757
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,360
Okay.

758
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,760
There was a standup comedy
show I'm not doing, I'm,

759
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,630
I can't even begin to tell you
guys how many times am I act.

760
00:46:50,631 --> 00:46:54,860
I say that I'm a moron. You guys listen
to my podcast. You know I'm a moron.

761
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,300
Actually.
Some people don't.

762
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:00,380
I had some guys send me this fucking email
this week on bill for the love of God.

763
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:03,890
Stop talking about banks. You
sound like a moron. Read this shit.

764
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,670
What do you mean read this shit that is,
goes against everything that I am.

765
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:13,040
I don't fucking read. And like, I
love how you talked about those banks.

766
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:16,070
You sounded like a moron. And what
when I talked about the other shit,

767
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:17,240
I sounded intelligent.

768
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:19,770
Okay.

769
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:24,520
It's a fucking podcast.
Just stand up back.

770
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,250
I don't, I don't, I'm buff. All right.
You know what? Look at, here I go again.

771
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:31,090
I'm allowing myself to get fucking
worked up this shit. So anyways,

772
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,360
couple more back and forth go.

773
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:37,240
And then she just realizes
that I don't give a fuck.

774
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,900
I said something like, well, you
know what you should do ma'am,

775
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:44,800
is what I always say when somebody just
says that they don't, uh, you know,

776
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:48,610
enjoy me and they just want
to keep telling me how much
they don't enjoy my act.

777
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,030
What I always say to him, I was like,
well, you know what you should do.

778
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:56,170
You should never come to one of
my shows again. That'll show me.

779
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:04,510
So then she finally realizes that I don't
give a shit about our humane society

780
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:08,500
fucking credit that she
basically purchased. You know,

781
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:09,800
it's uh,

782
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,710
being a member of the humane society is
less respectful than when they give some

783
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:18,760
famous person and honorary degree because
at least the celebrity didn't fucking

784
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:19,594
pay for it.

785
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,750
He didn't go and go to Syracuse
university.org and give $19.

786
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:30,220
So he could be like, I am an honorary
degree from fucking Syracuse University,

787
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:34,960
you know? So anyways, so that's why I
say, so let's lady. All right. You know,

788
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:35,681
you know what you should do.

789
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:38,020
You should never come to one of my
shows again and that'll show me.

790
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:38,771
And at this point,

791
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:40,900
this kind of some people around
me that it's starting to laugh.

792
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,210
So then this girl just,
you know,

793
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,980
who's a member of the humane society
because she cares so much than just,

794
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,950
she just starts going for my jugular.
She goes, yeah, well, you know,

795
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:55,540
smiling and nodding, right. This is creepy
fucking smile. And this whole time too,

796
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,300
she's got a clump of
lipstick on her upper lip.

797
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,800
She's one of these girls you could tell
was hot when she was in her twenties and

798
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,800
now she's doing the worst thing that you
can do is you're trying to hang onto it,

799
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,110
you know, so she looks like, you know,

800
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,920
one of the real housewives
of fucking Tupelo,

801
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:15,420
Mississippi or wherever the fuck she's
from. Right. And she's going, ah,

802
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,880
she's gone out. Yeah, yeah. Well you're
doing great, right? You're doing great.

803
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:22,120
You're here at the punchline. Hi, you're
doing great. And I'm like, yeah, you know,

804
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:25,960
show kind of seem to be selling.
Well, she goes now. Yeah,
it's great. You know? Yeah,

805
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:29,650
you are on Hbo. And now
you're here, you know,

806
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,030
and it's like, lady, so are you.

807
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:39,250
You're here too and you fucking
paid to come here to watch me.

808
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,850
What is your fucking point? And
she's like, and I didn't pay,

809
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,960
I didn't pay whatever. And then she'd said
something to the, she started talking,

810
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:50,620
really then she did that, that,
that, that thing, you know what,

811
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:53,350
how women have confrontations.

812
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:56,410
Like that was what they do is they
stop talking to you and then they start

813
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,900
talking to their friend
really loudly about you.

814
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,830
And she starts getting that
guy get back in cases. Shit.

815
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,970
The funny they was,

816
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:09,460
which she couldn't have been
more than five feet away from me.

817
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:13,450
And she's yelling at, Hey guy,
get back in pizza house yet.

818
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,720
And then that's when I told
her, you know, lady, you know,

819
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:18,790
I really didn't want to tell you this,
but you got a big,

820
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,090
he got something on your upper lip
and I didn't want to bring it up,

821
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:26,050
but now you're being a jerk. And she
goes, it's lipstick. And I dunno,

822
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:30,200
I don't even what happened that,
that point I was actually mad.

823
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,020
And,
um,

824
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:33,670
okay.

825
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:37,240
And I dunno, I kind of blamed the
whole evening on not drinking,

826
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,670
if you can fucking believe it.
You know,

827
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,650
cause I usually enjoy doing the road.

828
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:47,420
And now this is my third weekend that
I've done where I have not had a drop of

829
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:48,254
alcohol.

830
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:53,350
And now I finally understand why
comedians want to get off the road.

831
00:50:55,430 --> 00:51:00,430
I never realized how many fucking morons
there are out here because I was drunk

832
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,680
and I was part of the problem.
But now, now I'm sober.

833
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,310
I like, I'm talking about myself like I'm
actually a fucking alcoholic. I'm not.

834
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:12,830
I'm just so fucking lonely loser.
And that's what I do.

835
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:17,240
I have a couple of beers to
talk a little shit. That's it.

836
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:22,010
Bill denial. That's the first
fucking stage of it, VJ saying, oh,

837
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:26,240
what a shot.
Jesus Christ from the French.

838
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,000
Oh,
you know what that was from yesterday.

839
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,000
Don't you fucking hate like when you
do that, when you're watching sports,

840
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:36,210
you haven't done that in a sports bar.
You looked away for a second,

841
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,870
he didn't realize it was a replay from a
month. Again, somebody hits a home run,

842
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,780
you're like, ah, fuck it.

843
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,930
You're like the only guy now do
that was from our last Tuesday.

844
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:49,110
They were playing the rangers and
Ah, I thought, I thought that was,

845
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:53,220
I thought that was from now you
want another case at dia? Um,

846
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:58,110
you know, I like about Vj Singh. All these
fucking douchebags nowadays they are,

847
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,250
they're trying to bring back that
rat pack swagger and you can't,

848
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,490
you can't do it all right.
And the only guy, I dunno why,

849
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:09,240
I dunno why you can't wear shirts
the way they wore shirts back then.

850
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:13,410
You can't wear that fucking little
bing Crosby hat the way they wore it.

851
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,880
I don't know why.

852
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,000
I kept no fucking idea why frank and
why Dean and Sammy and all those guys

853
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:26,250
looked so low, so fucking smooth. I have
no idea why, but I was watching this,

854
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,230
uh, golf the other day. I got
to admit fucking Vj Singh,

855
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:35,520
he's got a little swagger to him,
you know, plus he said that, uh,

856
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,400
that hateful shit against women,
you know,

857
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:42,630
which really lines up with
their generation and run
that back then once they

858
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:46,530
just like beating their women with a
mop handle every time they didn't have

859
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:50,910
their raw roast beef and mashed potatoes
ready or some shit. I Dunno what,

860
00:52:50,911 --> 00:52:52,330
so anyways,
I've had a,

861
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,500
okay,

862
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,870
I'm trying to figure out why that
lady bug me so much. Last night

863
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,390
I, you know, she was just, I dunno, I,

864
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,530
I felt I was pissed at myself that I got
mad and then I was also mad at myself

865
00:53:06,531 --> 00:53:09,260
die stand there like a
fucking idiot selling DVDs.

866
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,263
MMM.

867
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:17,580
You know, I don't know. It really
just made me want to be like,

868
00:53:17,581 --> 00:53:18,001
you know what,

869
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:23,001
why don't I just go to the green room
after shows and I'll do my shows and then,

870
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:28,050
you know, whatever. I'll get
an email and you know, I dunno,

871
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:33,150
you fucking sit there dancing around
like a monkey boy for 50, 50, 55 minutes.

872
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:35,220
I don't even know. He did an hour
of that show. I can't remember.

873
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,130
Then they have somebody
come up to you just tuck it,

874
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:42,900
say that you're a piece of shit because
of a joke and then there are a woman so

875
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:44,460
you can't like,
you know,

876
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,430
you know it was funny
was she was with a guy.

877
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,140
So the whole time she's given me shit,

878
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,750
it's like I don't want to lose
so I'm giving her shit back.

879
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:58,990
But at the same time I got to keep my
eye on the dude and also like not go too

880
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:02,810
far because then I got like a
physical confrontation with the dude,

881
00:54:02,811 --> 00:54:04,670
which I don't want to
have in 41 years old.

882
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,670
Last time I had a fight 35 that was
when my brother and our red roof fan.

883
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:12,050
That's an entirely different story.

884
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:14,870
And that doesn't count either because
your brother's going to stop at some point

885
00:54:14,871 --> 00:54:19,730
cause he has to answer to your dad. You
know, I, I can't even fucking remember.

886
00:54:19,731 --> 00:54:24,710
Right. I ain't no tough guy. I tell
jokes. Right. So I don't want to get it.

887
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:25,840
So this guy, you know, it's funny,

888
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:30,400
the entire time the guy had his back to
me and he was trying to get the woman

889
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,990
out of the club and I'm,

890
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,640
that's the exact kind of guy who goes out
with a woman like that and vice versa.

891
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,530
If it's a loud mouth Douche bag guy,

892
00:54:38,531 --> 00:54:42,580
they always have a little mousy girl
because nobody who actually would speak

893
00:54:42,581 --> 00:54:47,360
their mind would ever tolerate dating
somebody like that man, a woman,

894
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,660
they would be like, are you out of your
mind? Are you out of your mind right now?

895
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,890
You know, it's a joke. It's
guys telling jokes or whatever.

896
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:59,030
You made your point now you just
gonna stand here screaming. I Dunno.

897
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,500
I Dunno. It was a fucked up
night. Then I had the next show.

898
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,900
I'm on stage and I'm doing my act and
I'm having a great time. And you know,

899
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,060
I told the story about the woman I called
direct contact and I felt like I got

900
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:17,800
that out and everything was going great.
Then all of a sudden this, uh, this, this,

901
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,800
uh,
this lady just walks up to the stage.

902
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,380
I'm in the middle of my act.
She's like, hey you, can you,

903
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,610
can you say happy birthday?
And my friend Heather

904
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,840
and I was like,
lady,

905
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:37,460
could you act like maybe I'm fucking in
the middle of doing a show at some point.

906
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:42,410
I know it was just, it was a fuck. It
was a weird, it was just a weird night.

907
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:46,400
And then after that, then I went
over to the club to 90 next door

908
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,180
as I always end up doing.
And this time,

909
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:54,650
this is the first time I went in there
and I wasn't drinking and I realized how

910
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:58,280
fucked up that place was. It was
just, dude came up to me, right?

911
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:02,060
And this whole week I've really been
having a difficult time understanding some

912
00:56:02,061 --> 00:56:05,000
of these, uh, who, people
who live outside of Atlanta,

913
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:07,880
they're fucking accents this,
uh,

914
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,920
I'm standing there talking to a couple
of people from the club and this guy just

915
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:17,590
comes up to me. He's like,
we'll, I'm like, what? He's like,

916
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:21,790
will he stick sticking his hand down?
And, um, I thought he was saying like,

917
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:26,320
will you like, he was to sentence
like, will you stop standing there?

918
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:28,500
Will you buy me a drink? I don't know
what the fuck he was going to say.

919
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,500
Evidently he was saying his name,
he was introducing himself.

920
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:35,950
His name was William,
but he's got will,

921
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,440
will, and I was like, what? I right,

922
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,690
but this is one of those bars.
Everybody's,

923
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:48,520
every other person seemed like they were
on fucking coke. And, uh, I don't know.

924
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,170
This is just petering out. I
don't know. I'm just fucking,

925
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,920
I've had enough and I usually do Thursday
through Saturday and something fucked

926
00:56:56,921 --> 00:57:00,040
up happening this weekend when I'm
doing Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

927
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,100
And somebody asked me this
question last week, like, uh,

928
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,790
asked me if Sunday was a
depressing day on the road. Um,

929
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,000
I don't know if you listened to my
past podcasts. I think I answered that.

930
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:14,920
Yes it is. Sunday is the fucking
worst. You know, two shows,

931
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:16,690
Friday, three shows, Saturday,

932
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:20,630
you know the big peak and you want
to fucking leave and then you,

933
00:57:20,631 --> 00:57:25,120
you got to hang around the entire fucking
day to do one more 50 minutes set.

934
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:29,170
And then you've got to fly in on Monday,
which is the fucking worst. You know,

935
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:33,490
I like flying on Sundays, you
know, flying across the country,

936
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:37,720
everybody's still asleep.
They go into church, you know,

937
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:42,160
they're waking up from a hangover
finishing that last slice at Domino's.

938
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,320
I don't know what they're doing,
but they're not on the road driving.

939
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:48,070
So when I land at the airport,
I just grabbed my shit at,

940
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,150
jump in a cab and I'm fucking
back at my place. You know,

941
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,670
you fly back on a Monday, the ups trucks,
the Fedex guys are out there, right?

942
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,170
Fucking homeless people laying in the
streets. It's just fucking horrific.

943
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:05,770
So anyways,
I had such a great week too.

944
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,080
I had a great week.
You know,

945
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,990
one of the people listening to
my podcast works over at Cap,

946
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:14,620
the capitol records place and they
invited me over there to go on a tour,

947
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:18,760
which I did this past week. And I got to
tell you, it was a, it is the, was the,

948
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:23,350
the greatest tour of anything
I've ever taken ever.

949
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:28,390
Do you remember Geraldo Rivera when
he did al Capone's vault and everybody

950
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:30,820
thought it was going to be the
greatest fucking thing ever.

951
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,130
Remember how great you thought it was.
Gonna be like,

952
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:37,090
what the fuck is going to be in that safe?
And you'll like this no way.

953
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:40,210
This is going to suck.
And it just didn't live up to it.

954
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,280
Whatever your expectations of that,

955
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:46,480
where this was 20 times
that it was unbelievable.

956
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:50,860
The guy basically explained
it. Uh, and I'm saying the guy,

957
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,540
cause I don't use people's names on this,

958
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:56,200
he was basically explaining that the
capital records building is basically a

959
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:57,610
functioning museum,

960
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:03,400
meaning that there's a bunch of shit that
they're still using that really should

961
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:05,860
be in a museum.

962
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,980
I walked into the room where Frank
Sinatra sang all those songs.

963
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,310
Luck be a lady, Dean Martin, all them,

964
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,300
they had nat king Cole's piano and
they had this little metal chair.

965
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:22,040
They're like, yeah, that's Frank
Sinatra's chair. And I'm looking

966
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,671
at it and I'm like,

967
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:25,850
that's not fucking Frank Sinatra's chair
that looks like it should be in an ips

968
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:26,684
class.

969
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,980
That was like one of those science room
classes and later on in the tour he was

970
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:32,480
showing all these black and white photos.

971
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:34,970
Cause I guess back in the day the
Capitol records label had their own

972
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,420
photographer and they took all these
fucking pictures. And by the way,

973
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:41,630
frank and dean never
looked bad at any moment.

974
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:44,660
They want picture of Dean Martin eaten
a bowl of soup and he looked like a

975
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:46,760
fucking million bucks.
But anyways,

976
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,030
then you look at the photos
and there's that fucking chair.

977
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:51,550
Okay.

978
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:55,410
They had a microphone over there
that said Frank. Okay. Oh yeah,

979
00:59:55,411 --> 00:59:56,910
that's Frank Sinatra's microphone.

980
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,570
And then they just use it.

981
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:01,880
Yeah.

982
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,350
You know,
I gotta just fight.

983
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,330
Absolutely fucking blew me
everything in that I can't even like,

984
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,590
they had like the masters of like
a, the band, you know that group.

985
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:15,290
Like they just had them laying,
not like laying in the corner.

986
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,110
They were going to be doing
something with them. And it does,

987
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,790
I fucking actually got to hold it in
my hand. A master. It was, it was,

988
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:21,870
I don't know if you're a music geek,
that is the,

989
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:27,140
that it was the place to go and not
to mention later on that afternoon,

990
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:29,090
one of my favorite drummers of all time,

991
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,710
Steve Jordan was recording with a,

992
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:38,240
some huge artists and they
actually, you know what sucked was,

993
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:41,300
they had already recorded his drum shit.
So he was going to be doing, I get some,

994
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:45,980
some percussion shit and all I
wanted to see was his kit set up in,

995
01:00:45,981 --> 01:00:48,290
in the, uh, in the studio.
That's all I wanted to see.

996
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:51,290
But I fucking missed it by a day.
But other than than that,

997
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:53,720
then I got to go on top of the building,
you know,

998
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:59,180
like I was fucking dice clay and
Ford Fairline unbelievable view.

999
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:03,480
It was, it was the greatest fucking thing
I've ever done. Um, and I know what,

1000
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,790
and if I was more articulate, I could
explain how awesome it was. So, uh,

1001
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:11,390
I want to thank everyone over at capitol
records for being so fucking cool.

1002
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:15,440
That was a greatest tour of
anything I've ever taken. And, uh,

1003
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,650
if you ever want to come to one of
my shows, if you bring 40 friends,

1004
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:23,210
I will still hook you up. That's how
great that tour was. So there we go.

1005
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:25,490
Look at me. I'm bringing it
around to something positive.

1006
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:31,080
Have the fucking Twat from the
humane society. I'll wait a minute.

1007
01:01:31,081 --> 01:01:34,950
I can donate by phone.
You want to hear me do this?

1008
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:40,490
Let's see how easy it is to fucking
join the humane society of America.

1009
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,810
You think they answer on Sunday?
Do they make their people work on Sunday?

1010
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,120
That's not very humane.
Is it? Three, nine,

1011
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:55,950
three, nine. All right,
let's see if we can do this.

1012
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,440
I'll wait. I'm gonna have to
give my credit card number over.

1013
01:01:58,441 --> 01:01:59,520
And you guys can't hear this.

1014
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:09,170
What? Oh wait the same, the number
has been changed or disconnected.

1015
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:16,000
Oh fuck you. Computer woman.
I'm joining the humane society.

1016
01:02:16,001 --> 01:02:19,920
I cannot fucking wait for the next dog
lover to come up to me taking that joke.

1017
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:23,220
Seriously. I'm, I'm a member
of the humane society. So Am I.

1018
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,770
I have your credit too,
ma'am.

1019
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:30,360
And I got it in the time that it
takes to write a check. So stand down.

1020
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:31,950
All right.

1021
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:35,820
And why don't you blot your fucking
lips before you walk out of the fucking

1022
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:39,210
house.
I'm good,

1023
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:41,330
Phil Mickelson that I,
you know,

1024
01:02:41,331 --> 01:02:43,110
I'll give you what else you got
to love about Phil Mickelson.

1025
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:45,780
That guy always goes for the pin.
You have an order set shit.

1026
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:51,800
He just doesn't give a fuck. And
then he for Putts, the guys on into,

1027
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,980
and then he four putts.
So anyways, let me,

1028
01:02:55,981 --> 01:03:00,860
let's get to the podcast questions
this week by phone is vibrating. Um,

1029
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:01,740
you know,
it's weird.

1030
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,160
I have not drank and so long and I still
feel hung over cause I stayed up till

1031
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:08,940
four in the morning last night. I couldn't
go to sleep. I was so fucking pissed.

1032
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:13,440
All right, here we go. Let's get to some
of the stuff. Okay. Uh, youtube videos.

1033
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,550
If you would like a laugh this week for
some reason, I only have one of them.

1034
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:22,050
I don't know why. I know I got
more. I don't know. I get busy.

1035
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:26,790
I fly around sometimes I fuck up. This
is actually a cool video watch. Ah, it's,

1036
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:31,740
it's snuffbox boyfriends scenes, s n, u f,

1037
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,910
F snuffbox boyfriends scenes.
And uh,

1038
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,730
I think you'll enjoy that.
I got a couple other ones,

1039
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:42,210
but people will kind of sending me stuff
that I just feel like that just classic,

1040
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:47,190
um, youtube videos. Like who hasn't
seen that woman who, you know,

1041
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,100
she stomps the grapes,
you know,

1042
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,310
she's having that competition and
then she falls out of the thing.

1043
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:58,000
Ow. Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1044
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:58,781
You know,

1045
01:03:58,781 --> 01:04:01,750
cause you've got the wind knocked out
of her and I know that sounds like I'm,

1046
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,280
I'm doing a fucked up impression,
but that's exactly what she sounds like.

1047
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,850
And if you don't believe me
a, let's, let's fucking bring
up that video right now.

1048
01:04:09,851 --> 01:04:11,440
Shall We?
Let's see.

1049
01:04:11,441 --> 01:04:16,441
A stomp stomping grapes.

1050
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:22,390
Let's see if that'll work. Did that
just fucking work? Of course it didn't.

1051
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:28,320
I really don't like typing with one hand
stomping grapes and I'm telling you,

1052
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:31,474
it's literally,

1053
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,400
Oh,
oh,

1054
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:38,720
here we go. Here we go. This
is how she does it. Yeah.

1055
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:43,560
Oh, right here. This buckets
are filled with grace.

1056
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,820
Just fall off the fucking
thing. Shut up. Shut up.

1057
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,013
All right.
He has a go.

1058
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:55,920
Second time. Here we go.
So what's the dude? Sorry,

1059
01:04:55,921 --> 01:05:00,210
I'm trying to fast forward to this.
Shut up.

1060
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:07,520
Why can't you fast forward these videos?
Better an hour. It won't fucking play.

1061
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:08,420
God dammit.

1062
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,550
You know what am I gonna have to
start this podcast over again?

1063
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:15,800
This is so fucking horrific.
Go play.

1064
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,600
There we go. There we
go out. You know what?

1065
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:26,260
Go Fuck yourself a plate later on when
the damn thing's going to load up.

1066
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,480
All right.
You don't.

1067
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:30,400
I feel like right now I feel
like one of those news guys who,

1068
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:33,580
I just threw it to the field and then
the story's not there and I got to stand

1069
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:36,070
there smiling and I'm like, oh, okay.

1070
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,250
Now there's nothing on the
teleprompter for me to read,

1071
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:43,300
so I feel like a fucking moron. All
right, let's go to Asheville. Hey Bill,

1072
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:45,850
I want to be a standup.
My friends say that I am funny.

1073
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,510
I wrote down about five minutes of Shit
I thought was funny and I did a little

1074
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:52,390
stand up back to my brother.
He laughed and said it was great.

1075
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,750
I have dangerously low self
esteem in myself and the fact,

1076
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:58,450
uh,

1077
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,980
that I don't usually like to laugh at
myself when I'm writing jokes by myself.

1078
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:04,120
I usually laugh at a joke.

1079
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:08,080
I tell when I say it in front of people
and I realized how crazy it sounded.

1080
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:11,230
I live in a small town so there's
not really any standup clubs.

1081
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:15,100
There is a place called the coffee
connection, which has an open mic there.

1082
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:18,490
I am a little nervous to go because I
don't want to bomb and completely destroy

1083
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:20,950
my confidence.
I have to actually become a comedian.

1084
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,170
I'm not afraid to talk in front of people.

1085
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:26,450
I just don't want to fuck up in
front of other people. But, um,

1086
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:30,280
here is where a bigger problem
comes in and my high school,

1087
01:06:30,281 --> 01:06:33,250
they have a talent show around
the end of the school year.

1088
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,270
If I got up there and did shit
and didn't make anybody laugh,

1089
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,560
everyone that didn't know me at the school
would think I'm some dusty cunt that

1090
01:06:41,561 --> 01:06:44,800
just was up there for the
attention. I think. Uh,

1091
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,340
I would just use the classic,
I was just fucking around.

1092
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:51,640
I wasn't even serious line,
but inside I would still feel like shit.

1093
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:54,610
Do you have any advice that
could help me? Yes, I do.

1094
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:55,990
Okay.

1095
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:56,840
All right.
First of all,

1096
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,810
having low self esteem and
couldn't sort of hating yourself.

1097
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:04,670
You have the foundation for
becoming a comedian. Um,

1098
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:09,570
you got to give yourself permission
to suck and you got to give yourself

1099
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,430
permission to grow in the beginning,

1100
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:16,380
which means you have to go out and you
have to perform in front of people that

1101
01:07:16,381 --> 01:07:19,830
you don't know the last fucking
thing that you want to do.

1102
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,000
Okay.

1103
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,620
Not knowing how to do stand up would be
to go on in front of your entire high

1104
01:07:25,621 --> 01:07:28,830
school. I mean that,

1105
01:07:28,831 --> 01:07:31,500
you know what maybe at that takes Dat,
right?

1106
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:34,260
Did the fact that you're
even considering doing that,

1107
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:39,300
you have way more balls than
I ever had at your age. Okay.

1108
01:07:39,301 --> 01:07:40,770
See already fucking ahead of me.

1109
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,860
And not to mention that you're still in
high school and you're already starting

1110
01:07:43,861 --> 01:07:47,160
it. So I didn't start doing
standup till I was 23, almost 24.

1111
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,960
So you're way ahead of the game.

1112
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:54,470
There's no fucking reason to put yourself
into that situation unless you feel

1113
01:07:54,901 --> 01:07:58,500
confident. You know, if you
feel confident, you feel
like you're going to destroy,

1114
01:07:58,501 --> 01:08:02,250
who knows? You might bang one of them
fucking cheerleaders there. But uh,

1115
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,950
but then that would probably boost your
self confidence and it'd be like, well,

1116
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:08,310
maybe I'm not a Douche and then you just
get some regular job and you'd never

1117
01:08:08,311 --> 01:08:12,480
get into show business. Um, but I digress.

1118
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,500
Now you've got to give
you got to you something.

1119
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:19,010
I did stand up and for the first year I
didn't tell and none of my friends even

1120
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:19,910
knew I was doing it.

1121
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:23,750
I think one of them knew and
nobody saw me for the first year,

1122
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,380
I wouldn't let anybody cut my,

1123
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,700
my family knew that I was doing it and
I would not let any of them come out to

1124
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:33,190
see me do it. And um, I didn't let my,

1125
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:34,640
my parents first saw me.

1126
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:39,641
I started in March of 1992 and my parents
first came out to see me in March of

1127
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:44,540
1993 and I've always been
blown away by comedians.

1128
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,213
Um,

1129
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:51,620
they'll go there first time ever on
stage and they invite everyone from their

1130
01:08:51,621 --> 01:08:56,621
office to come down the place where
they work to watch them do stand up.

1131
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:58,730
And I'm just like,
dude,

1132
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,780
do you realize what it's going to be like
if you fucking bomb and you have to go

1133
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:07,700
to work the next day I made, why
would you set yourself up? I mean,

1134
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:12,170
it's just, I dunno. So what I
would do, my advice to you is,

1135
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,221
is first of all,

1136
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:16,880
don't worry about having a low confidence
or low self esteem or whatever the

1137
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:18,560
hell it is. You don't have
to worry about that. You'll,

1138
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:23,300
your confidence will build as you do it,
but what you have to do is just,

1139
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:27,080
you just go out and go do open mikes.
You'll,

1140
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:30,740
you'll get in the click of other open
miker is you'll make some friends and then

1141
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:33,320
you become like this little platoon,
you know,

1142
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:36,620
and it's like you against the world.
Okay.

1143
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,320
And everybody's going to bomb all every,

1144
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:41,840
all year open micro friends are
going to bomb. You're going to bomb.

1145
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:44,150
You're all going to fucking do it.
It sucks.

1146
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,630
But it's the best stories
you'll ever tell in your life.

1147
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:51,410
And later on in your career, you're
going to look back and tell some stories.

1148
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:52,151
I mean, I'll tell you, you know,

1149
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:55,460
it would be a hell of a fucking story is
if you went up in front of your entire

1150
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:58,340
fucking high school and
you ate your balls. I mean,

1151
01:09:58,341 --> 01:10:01,280
that's some shit like later on
in your career, if you, you know,

1152
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:06,281
if he was starring in a movie and you
needed a panel story to tell on Letterman

1153
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:10,160
or fucking Conan, I mean, that
would be a hell of a one to tell.

1154
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:13,550
So that's,

1155
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,810
I mean it's hard for me to tell you what
to do as far as whether you should do

1156
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,410
that high school show and not
all I can go is with with my gut.

1157
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:26,590
The fact I got like scared reading your
email thinking just putting myself in

1158
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:31,871
your position of like just picturing
myself at 1718 if I ever went on in front

1159
01:10:33,651 --> 01:10:38,300
of my high school and tried to tell jokes,
I mean I probably,

1160
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,200
they would have been a bucket of blood
of above me and would have poured down on

1161
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:45,770
me just like that movie Carrie
would have been bad. You know,

1162
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,990
I got to met halfway through that.
I wouldn't, I just thought like,

1163
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:50,120
what if I killed the,
you know,

1164
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,860
say you're like a junkie. He just
keep fucking chasing it. All right,

1165
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:57,890
so don't worry about it man.
Just fucking have fun. Go Out,

1166
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:01,130
sign up for some open mics and just do
it in bars with his show and football

1167
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:05,690
games and no one's looking at you and
you just learn, get tough that way.

1168
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,630
That's what I would do, you know? And
if you want to do the high school show,

1169
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,890
by all means fucking go forward.
Personally, I wouldn't do it but that,

1170
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:16,950
but I'm coming from a place of fear.
So you know, if you got the balls,

1171
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:20,010
go ahead and do it. But if you do
it, I want to hear the results,

1172
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,340
so please email me back. All right.
But other than that, don't worry about,

1173
01:11:23,341 --> 01:11:23,760
you know,

1174
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,150
second guessing your material and all
that stuff and thinking stuff sucks.

1175
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,520
That's just a part of it in the beginning.
Okay.

1176
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:32,190
If you think you're awesome
when you first start out,

1177
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,540
you usually end up being a hack, you
know, and you're out there, you know,

1178
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:40,950
what's the deal with Michael Jackson?
I'm fucking great. All right.

1179
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:45,590
I hope that helped you out. Okay. All
right. Any, uh, next question, Bill. Um,

1180
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:50,630
I want to ask you about how you felt
about parents taking their kids on planes.

1181
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:54,950
Recently I had a flight to Denver back
from Los Angeles. Not a long flight,

1182
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,940
but I was absolutely exhausted and
looking forward to the two hours of not

1183
01:11:58,941 --> 01:12:03,590
talking to people and hoping to maybe
catch a nap. I had no such luck.

1184
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:08,060
A young couple with their two year old
Brat set behind me and proceeded to let

1185
01:12:08,061 --> 01:12:12,140
their kid kicked the back of my seat
and scream repeatedly. It was awful.

1186
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,980
I don't blame the kid. Two year old
kids, they stay, kick and scream.

1187
01:12:15,981 --> 01:12:16,910
That's what they do.

1188
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:21,890
But the kids' parents did nothing to
control the child other than saying you

1189
01:12:21,891 --> 01:12:25,870
shouldn't do that. But it really
pissed me off was that we were at,

1190
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,440
when we were landing, they were asking
their child what he wanted for dinner,

1191
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,590
and this is written in capital letters,
so you fucking kidding me.

1192
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:37,730
Two year olds don't get options.
12 year olds don't get options.

1193
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:41,390
20 year olds don't get fucking options
if they're living in your house and

1194
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:44,810
you're paying for everything.
As we were getting off the plane,

1195
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:48,980
I was hoping these people would have
the decency to apologize for their kid

1196
01:12:48,981 --> 01:12:51,170
kicking the back of my seat,
but of course they didn't.

1197
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:54,460
I thought about telling these people
that they ought to both get a,

1198
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,550
they ought to both get fixed because
they were absolute assholes and all they

1199
01:12:58,551 --> 01:13:02,030
were doing was raising another absolute
asshole and adding one more to the

1200
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:04,400
fucking population.
Um,

1201
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:08,870
but I kept my mouth shut because people
like that see nothing wrong with their

1202
01:13:08,871 --> 01:13:12,710
behaviors. So what's the fucking
point anyway? Have you ever,

1203
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:16,400
have you ever experienced, had an
experienced slice like this? Um,

1204
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:20,870
did you think about saying something? Did
you actually say something? All right.

1205
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,300
Uh, great question. I
gotta be honest with you.

1206
01:13:23,301 --> 01:13:25,630
When I'm on the plane and
the kid starts crying,

1207
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:30,610
I don't know why I can't explain it, but
it makes me laugh and it makes me laugh.

1208
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,200
Watching other people get fucking
annoyed because, uh, I don't know.

1209
01:13:35,201 --> 01:13:38,320
Somewhere along the line I just sort
of let go of that. It's like, look,

1210
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:42,820
these people, they have kids just like
you said, they can't control them. Um,

1211
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:45,490
and that's it.
But I will tell you this,

1212
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,210
if you have a kid and
it's in the fucking thing,

1213
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,630
cause it two year old, it's not a
person yet. It's a fucking thing.

1214
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:56,950
The fucking thing is kicking the back
of the seat of the person in front of me

1215
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:00,100
in front of you. You have to do
something about that. All right?

1216
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:03,190
They got a little short little
fucking legs at that point.

1217
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:06,160
All you gotta do is just scoot him
back and they won't be able to,

1218
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:09,280
they won't be able to, to, to
kick the back of the seat. Now,

1219
01:14:09,281 --> 01:14:12,850
I might be fucking ignorant here because
never had a little two year old thing.

1220
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:17,860
And I might be over simplifying this
because I really have sympathy for,

1221
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:21,150
uh, for, for people in that
situation. I mean, I don't what,

1222
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:23,560
what are you supposed to do?
I mean, in a perfect world,

1223
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,620
you could just knock the kid out, but
you wouldn't want to do that. It's a kid.

1224
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:28,720
You can't punch a kid. I mean, you can,

1225
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,510
but then you'd have to talk to somebody
from the fucking humane society a wow.

1226
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:35,890
And you know what the fuck I'm saying?
You know what I mean? Perfect world.

1227
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:38,200
You could just tie into the seat.
They wouldn't move,

1228
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:41,340
but you'd psychologically damaged with
them. Um, you know, damage the kid,

1229
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:43,900
then you've got to live with them for
at least another 16 years before he

1230
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:48,040
fucking moves on to
community college. So, um,

1231
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,030
have I ever said anything? No, I
have never said anything. I wouldn't,

1232
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:55,720
I would never say something
like, you know, you know to,

1233
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:58,120
do you understand that I also
like when the plane's landing,

1234
01:14:58,121 --> 01:14:59,950
you know like when your ears
a pop and like little kids,

1235
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:02,020
they don't know what to do.
They don't know what to do.

1236
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:07,060
But I've definitely given some people
some not even like what the fuck I give

1237
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:10,390
him that look like really?
You just kind of let the kids sit there.

1238
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,090
And this is another thing too,
if your kid is freaking out,

1239
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,710
if you're just making a fucking effort,

1240
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:19,090
even if you can't stop the
kid from freaking the fuck
out, just make an effort.

1241
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,820
This is weird. I'm gradually agreeing
with this person more and more.

1242
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:24,820
Just make a fucking effort.
That's all.

1243
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:28,150
When people are just sitting there
and letting the kid cry. I mean,

1244
01:15:28,151 --> 01:15:32,440
I don't know if they're
doing an experiment because
I've heard like if you pick

1245
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:34,570
a baby up every time it
cries, then it learns. Okay,

1246
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,690
all I have to do is cry and
then I get this comfort. Um,

1247
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,170
if you're trying to retrain them,
I dunno if you've got to retrain them.

1248
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:42,070
Could you do it at home?

1249
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:48,400
I think they should sit date kids. There
you go. Yeah, I just said that, you know,

1250
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:52,300
just coming in with the fucking had one
of those fucking world war two psycho

1251
01:15:52,301 --> 01:15:55,600
doctors just come in with an old fashioned
needle and you just drug them up.

1252
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,930
Or maybe they could have like
a fucking a glassed in area.

1253
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,900
Do you guys ever have that?
Like the crying Roman church,

1254
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:06,390
you'd put your kid's way in the back
and they just be behind glass, you know,

1255
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,190
so they wouldn't interrupt the pre
scaring the living shit out of you that

1256
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:10,120
you're going to be going to health.

1257
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:14,260
Maybe they should have that
done by the luggage. Um,

1258
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:19,750
anyways, uh, so no, I've
never said anything. Yes, I've
wanted to say some things,

1259
01:16:19,751 --> 01:16:22,930
but um, you know, by the end of it,

1260
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:24,400
you know when you're actually
going to say something,

1261
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:28,750
the flight's over anyways and uh, I
had some part of flying, isn't it?

1262
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,380
Some kids screaming
anyways. All right. Um,

1263
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:37,240
what I'm in moving on to the next
part of the podcast. Oh wait,

1264
01:16:37,241 --> 01:16:41,390
is this video loaded up yet?
Remember my impression? Oh, oh, oh,

1265
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:44,690
okay.

1266
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:46,520
Here we go.
Here we go.

1267
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:56,123
Wow.

1268
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,520
See,
I told you I hosed up.

1269
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:09,861
You know what that was?

1270
01:17:09,861 --> 01:17:12,060
That's the first time she ever
got the wind knocked out of her,

1271
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:14,810
so she didn't know what to do. That's
what I sounded like when I was five.

1272
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,190
The first time that happened to me.

1273
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,180
And the first thing you learn is when you
get the wind knocked out of view is to

1274
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:23,780
shut the fuck up. Because every,
anyone, if you try to talk,

1275
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:26,480
when you get the wind knocked out of you,
that's what the fuck you sound like.

1276
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:31,270
So you learned afterwards, once you
get your breath back, you're like, wow,

1277
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:35,690
it really sounded like a fucking
idiot. It's not, it's good. You know,

1278
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,290
you just fucking,
can anybody explain that phenomenon?

1279
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,830
What is that and why?

1280
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:45,320
No matter how hard you're
trying to breathe in,

1281
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,480
does your breath keep exhaling
or just pushing out? You know,

1282
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:54,290
it's like when you, when you, uh,
he's like, you have an a dry heave,

1283
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,780
but you're not puking, you know,
just for those of you like a hell.

1284
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,570
I dated a girl one time,
she was like 27 years old.

1285
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:02,540
She'd never had the wind knocked
out of her in her life. Um,

1286
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:06,240
which I thought was one of the most
adorable things I'd ever heard. Yeah.

1287
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:10,580
It was like she was living under glass
or something. But anyways, uh, why is,

1288
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,870
you know, how many fucking times
that happened? Me As a kid,

1289
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,240
that was like what we did. Me and
my, I, you know, had four brothers.

1290
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:19,430
That's what we did as a kid.
That's what you did.

1291
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,460
And your brother wasn't paying attention.
You didn't have to do it hard.

1292
01:18:22,461 --> 01:18:22,971
That was just great.

1293
01:18:22,971 --> 01:18:26,140
He just give him a fucking rap
right in the stomach and the kid

1294
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:31,310
fucking this. So, um,

1295
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:34,340
does all the wind literally
go out and why can't you just,

1296
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:36,200
why can't you just breathe in?

1297
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,700
Why am I acting like you
guys are fucking doctors?

1298
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:43,790
Why this isn't just a bunch of truckers.
Just forget it. Don't even, you know what,

1299
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:44,700
I want somebody to attempt,

1300
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,200
you know what half the people who are
going to fucking answer this question are

1301
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:50,870
going to do exactly what I'm going to
do at the end of this fucking podcast,

1302
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:54,290
which is just look it up and then give
me the Wikipedia reason. All right,

1303
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:58,820
here we go. Here's some questions
for the week. Um, Bill, um,

1304
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:02,270
on a different not that's
what someone just wrote.

1305
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:04,550
I think they wanted to
say no on a different not,

1306
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:08,660
I was wondering what did you think
of the song Baba O'reilly by the WHO?

1307
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:11,780
I recently started listening to rock
music and I thought that this song was

1308
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:15,860
incredible. Is it? Or I am or am I
just some dumb fuck no, you're not.

1309
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:20,030
You're a young kid and you're discovering
the WHO and they are the shit. Um,

1310
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:26,060
I would get who's next? I would get a
lie that leads start with that. Just,

1311
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:30,650
just surf the Internet. They got
some great shit. Um, Dear Bill Ha.

1312
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:33,530
How much drinking do you
typically do during the week?

1313
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:38,540
You're out on the road all of the time
working places that serve booze and it

1314
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:41,980
seems like it would be tempting to
drink pretty often out of bored,

1315
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:45,620
boredom and loneliness. I think
I already, to answer this,

1316
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:48,440
at least I could see myself doing
that if I were traveling. Comedian.

1317
01:19:48,441 --> 01:19:52,100
Is it tough to avoid being a
lush? I, yeah, it Kinda is.

1318
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,300
You basically become an alcoholic out of,
uh,

1319
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:02,030
like proximity, you know, it's just there.
It's one of those deals where, you know,

1320
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:04,760
I don't know if you were in a
bar four nights a fucking week,

1321
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:09,600
I would think the odds of you drinking
would, would go up exponentially. Yes.

1322
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:14,150
I just said that. So yeah,
it is, it is hard to not, uh,

1323
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:20,160
to not drink. I already answered
this shit, you know, I dunno,

1324
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,080
but I gotta tell you it's fucking
boring as hell to be out here. It this,

1325
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:27,930
this not drinking is
actually put me on edge.

1326
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:29,200
Okay.

1327
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,890
MMM. I mean, you should,

1328
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,350
the way I've lived this
week out here on the road,

1329
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:37,210
if I live my entire life like this,

1330
01:20:37,211 --> 01:20:39,640
I could run for president
and I wouldn't have to hire.

1331
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,880
I wouldn't need any hush money.
Okay.

1332
01:20:42,881 --> 01:20:46,570
I've worked out the first day I went
to the grocery store, I bought food.

1333
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:49,000
I got a little fridge here.
I've been eating healthy.

1334
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:51,190
I went to the gym every single day.

1335
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:55,850
I even brought my little
practice drum pad thing with me.

1336
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:57,000
Okay.

1337
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,510
Fucking around learning some rudiments.
I wrote jokes.

1338
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:05,070
Okay. I looked at some internet
porn. All right. Right there. That,

1339
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:06,830
that would fucking loser.

1340
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:10,150
Governatorial fucking race gubernatorial
or wherever the fuck they say it.

1341
01:21:10,151 --> 01:21:10,984
But you know.

1342
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:11,990
Yeah.

1343
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:15,590
That's the last thing. If I could just
cut out the fucking internet porn,

1344
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:17,973
mmm.

1345
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:23,520
I would be completely bored.
That's, you know, I got to tell you,

1346
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:26,820
that's what I am right now. I am sober
right now and I am not feeling this,

1347
01:21:26,821 --> 01:21:30,300
this unbelievable fucking high of like,
wow,

1348
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,900
I can't believe all this shit I'm,
I was missing.

1349
01:21:33,901 --> 01:21:36,900
All I'm thinking right now is I can't
believe how fucking long the day is,

1350
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:40,530
you know. Thank God I stayed up
until four in the morning last night,

1351
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:44,250
so I didn't wake up until 11.
You know,

1352
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:46,770
if they end up feeling like a loser
because now it's already fucking one.

1353
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,250
I Dunno. I think I'm done.
Everybody. If I don't drink,

1354
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:52,470
I don't think I can do the road anymore
and I don't think I'm going to be

1355
01:21:52,471 --> 01:21:56,070
fucking selling DVDs after my show. I
just, I'm not fucking doing this anymore.

1356
01:21:56,071 --> 01:22:00,720
I'm not going to be stoned fucking sober
and just seeing a mirror image of what

1357
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:04,500
a fucking Moron I've been all these
years. All right. Overrated. Underrated.

1358
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:08,370
Um, I didn't, I don't know that
I actually got any of this week,

1359
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:12,200
so I actually throw in a couple of
mine. I probably got someone I just, Oh,

1360
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:12,661
it's tough.

1361
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,810
During the weeks I traveled to try to
save all these fucking emails between my

1362
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:19,980
blackberry and this, this uh,
computer here. So a overrated,

1363
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:24,600
I say expensive jeans. I
remember when, you know,

1364
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,020
if you had a pair of Levi's, you were
cool. You were in the club, right?

1365
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:33,160
And what would they, 30 40 bucks and
then people all of a sudden diesel jeans,

1366
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:34,990
there was the first expensive jeans.
I remember in this,

1367
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:39,690
this girl is talking me into buying them
and they were like 180 bucks did it,

1368
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:42,850
60 bucks. This is, you know, this
is like eight years or seven,

1369
01:22:42,851 --> 01:22:46,720
eight years ago I remember like $180 for
a pair of fucking genes is ridiculous.

1370
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:50,050
I could buy four or five pairs
of Levi's and she says like, no,

1371
01:22:50,051 --> 01:22:52,600
but you'll see the quality's better.

1372
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:55,780
They last longer and you
know what they don't,

1373
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:01,090
I think they look a little better.
I think nice jeans look better.

1374
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:04,200
Like at this point then
like, you know, this is not,

1375
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:08,800
I mean I think we can all agree there's
nothing worse than gap jeans, you know,

1376
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:12,700
and they have like that sort of not quite
stonewashed look to them, but you know,

1377
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,860
they just look,
you just look broke.

1378
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,320
I noticed a lot of white dudes and like
they're at their thirties and forties

1379
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:24,970
will be wearing those and they'll
have like a button down sort of like,

1380
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,770
I'm going to go see Jimmy Buffet shirt
on and they'll tuck it into that and then

1381
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:34,771
they'll have a pair of dirty white all
white Seinfeld sneakers on and it is just

1382
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:36,401
like, wow, dude,

1383
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:40,930
you are fucking married
with children because uh,

1384
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,950
that is,
if ever there was the anti pussy,

1385
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:48,040
that is the anti everything that is
just the asexual outfit that you could

1386
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:51,070
possibly be wearing. So I've been one of
these guys who gets sucked into buying,

1387
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:54,670
you know, more of these expensive jeans
and these fucking things they wear out.

1388
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,550
They wear out. Just like,
you know, you don't want to,

1389
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,810
you want to make your jeans last,

1390
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:02,020
you've got to buy like fucking five
pairs and you've got to revolve them.

1391
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,450
That's how you make them last. But
if you're wearing them, you know,

1392
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:09,780
every two to three days, like I do like
a fucking, I'll tell you in Austin,

1393
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:13,090
most filthiest motherfuckers
out there are musicians.

1394
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:16,010
I can't believe I forgot to
tell this story, right? Uh,

1395
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,610
last week when I was flying back
from Providence, Rhode Island,

1396
01:24:18,611 --> 01:24:22,840
I decided to upgrade to first class.
I just said, fuck it. You know,

1397
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:26,800
I'll deal with the,
the fucking credit card bill,

1398
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,700
who's one of those deals where I just
didn't want to fly and I'm so sick of

1399
01:24:30,701 --> 01:24:35,350
fucking flying. And they were like, Hey,
do you want to upgrade to first class?

1400
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:38,460
And I was like, of course
I do. And they go, well,

1401
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:42,910
we're just going to put our virgin
island fucking airline Dick in your ass.

1402
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:46,420
And I was like, you know what? I
don't give a Shit Gad and raped me.

1403
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:50,290
I want to fucking sit in a lazy boy. The
entire fucking ride across the country.

1404
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:51,580
So that's what I do.

1405
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:56,730
So I'm sitting down and on the plane
comes to skinny dude with his big titty

1406
01:24:56,851 --> 01:24:57,940
girlfriend and,
and they're like,

1407
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:00,760
is there any way you could switch seats
with that? So we could sit together?

1408
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:05,180
And I was like, apps a fucking
locally, if I was in coach right now,

1409
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,960
give you a dirty look and give me,
give you some sort of bullshit.

1410
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:11,980
I'm superstitious. I'm not changing my
seat. Fuck you and you'll love affair.

1411
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:16,630
But I was in first class, so now
I'm affable. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1412
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,970
So I walked over and I sat in my seat
and they were fucking sitting there.

1413
01:25:19,971 --> 01:25:24,070
And the first thing is dirty ass musician
does. He's got these flip flops on,

1414
01:25:24,071 --> 01:25:27,160
right? And His fucking toes,
it looks like, you know,

1415
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:31,900
now I know why people wash Jesus's feet.
That's all I can fucking tell you. Okay?

1416
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,320
This fucking guy, he looked like
he looked like a bird of prey.

1417
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:37,990
That's the only way to describe his
fucking toenails and everything.

1418
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:43,170
And he did the most disgusting fucking
thing I've ever seen a human being do.

1419
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,010
Halfway through the flight,

1420
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:50,011
this motherfucker gets up to use the
bathroom on the airplane and I'm going to

1421
01:25:52,661 --> 01:25:56,380
say that airport airplane bathrooms are
some of the dirtiest fucking bathrooms

1422
01:25:56,381 --> 01:25:59,080
ever,
just from turbulence alone.

1423
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:01,690
And the fact that it's so fucking cramp,

1424
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,840
this dirty motherfucker got up in his
bare feet and just walked into the

1425
01:26:08,861 --> 01:26:11,260
bathroom in his fucking bare feet.

1426
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:17,470
I couldn't believe it. I, I, I
was just a, does this, no fuck,

1427
01:26:17,471 --> 01:26:21,010
there's no fucking way.
There is no fucking, and he
just walked right in there.

1428
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,110
I mean, he should've got a
tetanus shot when he came out.

1429
01:26:27,111 --> 01:26:30,410
I couldn't fucking believe it. How filthy
is that? And you know what kills me?

1430
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:33,110
Women love fucking love.

1431
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,930
Musicians absolutely love them.

1432
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:40,931
CanNot get on their knees quick enough
to jump down into their crab infested

1433
01:26:41,391 --> 01:26:45,770
pubes and stick that fucking
read in their mouth. You know,

1434
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,970
could give a fuck, could give a fuck about
comedians. What a, what a women doing.

1435
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,210
FDN The comedy show,
they come up and they'd say,

1436
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:55,730
you're a loser for the place
you're fucking working in.

1437
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:59,600
And then talk about what a piece
of shit you are really loudly,

1438
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:04,370
which brings me to my underrated,
underrated for the week.

1439
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:06,440
Learning how to play an instrument.

1440
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:11,000
Unbelievably underrated, you know,
cause he's really stick with it.

1441
01:27:11,001 --> 01:27:13,250
You can get in a band
and I even if you suck,

1442
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,870
you're going to get some pussy and
a, and if not, it's, it's just,

1443
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:21,770
it's so much better than reading and
it's better than, you know, you read,

1444
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:23,750
what are you doing? You
know, you're getting smarter.

1445
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,560
So what are you making the person's
day next to you better you're not,

1446
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:28,850
but you actually learn how to play guitar.

1447
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:31,970
You can play drums or something like
that. I Dunno. I just think it's,

1448
01:27:31,971 --> 01:27:35,480
I think it's a great fucking
thing. Um, you know what?

1449
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:37,310
I'm actually excited because I actually,
you know,

1450
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:41,390
I told you guys about this Les Paul
Guitar and by the way, God rest his soul.

1451
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:44,120
You know, Les Paul died this
week and I'm really bummed.

1452
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,680
I never got a chance to see that guy.

1453
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:49,790
That guy was still playing shows
every Monday night in New York City.

1454
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,820
And when I was back in New
York for the month of June,

1455
01:27:52,821 --> 01:27:55,490
I actually tried to go see the guy.
And um,

1456
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:00,130
unfortunately the night I was open
where I could go see him, he was a,

1457
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:03,740
he wasn't performing that night, so I
didn't get a chance to see him. And, uh,

1458
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:08,390
I'm really sad about it
because, um, I dunno,

1459
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:12,350
that guy is legendary.

1460
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:16,600
I mean, I'm trying to see who I would
put that guy up with. I mean, he,

1461
01:28:16,601 --> 01:28:20,960
he's right up there with, for
me anyways, all the inventors,

1462
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,010
I'm so stupid. She says Christ, but you're
gonna put them up there with Einstein,

1463
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:27,470
the light bulb, because the guy
fucking did some with a guitar.

1464
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,980
You know what I'm going to, and my world
is important. If you guys, if you're not,

1465
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:34,640
if you're not into a, if you don't play
an instrument or anything like that, just,

1466
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:37,970
just Google images for a,
a Gibson Les Paul,

1467
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,470
and just look at how beautiful that is.
It's literally,

1468
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,220
it's literally a fucking work of art.

1469
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:48,170
And even if I didn't attempt to play
guitar, I think I would still own one.

1470
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,540
Rather than going out
and buying a painting,

1471
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:55,570
I would actually buy a Les Paul because
that's how fucking beautiful they are.

1472
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,780
But anyways,
I'm actually learning how to play guitar.

1473
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:04,840
And a last week I discovered drop d
tuning and it might've been the greatest

1474
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:09,780
sound I think I've ever produced
as a human being on that Les Paul.

1475
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:12,450
It just fucking sounded
unbelievable. And, uh,

1476
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:17,400
I can't wait to get back to my
apartment to take out that guitar,

1477
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,660
to not read, to not watch TV and be
informed on what's going on in the world.

1478
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:25,770
So I can continue to sound like a moron
on this podcast so some people can

1479
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:29,190
continue to take me seriously and
tell me how fucking dumb I am,

1480
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:34,410
even though that is my point of view.
What am I talking about? All right,

1481
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:36,540
let's wrap up with this.
Now. You know, we have to do,

1482
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:41,160
we actually have to hype some of my
shit. Okay. And by we, I mean me,

1483
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,620
I need to get better at this
type of stuff. All right.

1484
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:47,460
And this is what I am going to be hyping
for the rest of the biggest date that I

1485
01:29:47,461 --> 01:29:50,490
have on the horizon for me,
believe it or not,

1486
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:55,620
is my Improv Gig in
Ontario, California. Okay.

1487
01:29:57,030 --> 01:30:02,030
I live in Los Angeles and I'm not able
to perform out in the La area because I

1488
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:06,690
have not shown to the
clubs that I am a draw.

1489
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:10,680
You know, it's, it's a weird one.
I gotta I gotta get on the, the,

1490
01:30:10,681 --> 01:30:15,060
the Latino radio stations out
there so I can get, you know,

1491
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:19,370
a significant portion of the population
to at least kind of know who the hell I

1492
01:30:19,371 --> 01:30:24,090
am. Because, you know, I don't want to
get on a fucking plane every other week.

1493
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:28,220
I just don't want to do it.
Um, I just don't want Ai.

1494
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:30,480
Every once in a while I would
like to fucking, you know,

1495
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:34,500
just be able to get in a car and drive
like I did when I lived on the east coast.

1496
01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:38,130
I drive down to Philly,
I drive up to Boston.

1497
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:43,020
I take the fucking train down
to DC, you know. So anyways,

1498
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,600
I have this Gig at the Improv in Ontario,
California.

1499
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:50,630
It's a from September 17th through the
20th for the love of God can you and 58

1500
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:54,570
of your closest friends buy some
tickets and come out to that show.

1501
01:30:54,571 --> 01:30:57,970
I never begged people to come out
to my shelf. Maybe I do, but I,

1502
01:30:57,971 --> 01:31:01,530
I don't grovel right now.
I'm groveling for the love of God.

1503
01:31:01,531 --> 01:31:06,531
Please show up to that show so I can
somehow just have one weekend during the

1504
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:12,150
year when I don't have to fucking,
you know,

1505
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:18,170
just be sitting there in
row 33 kv changing please.

1506
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:24,030
This is a very full flight olive.
The overhead space is going to be used up.

1507
01:31:24,031 --> 01:31:28,710
So if you have, when you're
smaller, smaller containers,

1508
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:33,450
if you could just put it underneath your
seat and please don't put your jackets

1509
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:37,350
in the overhead compartments. This is
a very full flight and you know what?

1510
01:31:37,351 --> 01:31:41,880
Everybody fucking blows it off and they're
sticking lunchboxes and for length,

1511
01:31:41,881 --> 01:31:46,881
fucking full length fucking
coats as the ladies say in that.

1512
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:53,010
So just once or flying Tang
is four hours in 58 minutes.

1513
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,860
Um, I would just, you know,

1514
01:31:55,861 --> 01:31:59,410
every once in a while we'd like to not
have to fucking listen to that so I could

1515
01:31:59,411 --> 01:32:03,940
just perform in a, in California.
So for the love of God,

1516
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:06,340
could you southern California people,

1517
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:09,610
I know you got a lot of options for the
love of God. Can you come out to my show?

1518
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,370
Thank you. All right, other
dates I have in September,

1519
01:32:12,371 --> 01:32:15,700
I'm going to be in Philadelphia,
the city of brotherly love.

1520
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:20,530
Do you guys beat the Braves last night?
I know that shit was going on. Um,

1521
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:22,570
what do we got here?
A helium comedy club.

1522
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:27,571
I'm going to be there from September 10th
through the 12th and I got a big date

1523
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:30,370
coming up in the Improv, Addison, Texas,

1524
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:35,460
September 24th through the 26th possibly
the 27th because I think I'm hanging

1525
01:32:37,091 --> 01:32:41,080
around on Monday night because the
cowboys got a football game and my life is

1526
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:44,170
awesome and I'm going to go to the fucking
game and I'm going to look at those

1527
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:45,040
fucking blonde,

1528
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:49,780
big titted fucking Dallas whores
with their Mary Kay cosmetics.

1529
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,570
You know who likes those bronze? Is that
guy from the playboy, the playboy. Ya,

1530
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,720
but the fuck's his name
there. Hugh Hefner. You know,

1531
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:03,970
he's really into that Tex Mex snap text
mess. The fucking Texarkana, Oklahoma,

1532
01:33:03,971 --> 01:33:08,050
that big round pie face fucking bleach,

1533
01:33:08,051 --> 01:33:12,820
blonde looking girl. You know, you
know those girls I'm talking about,

1534
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,810
hey you, how are you doing? How
y'all doing? Those fucking girls.

1535
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,960
Do you guys watch that show? That show
when he had those three girlfriends,

1536
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:23,470
I only thought one of them was hot. The
other two were kind of a mess. You know,

1537
01:33:23,471 --> 01:33:26,560
the athletic one, she was fucking
smoke and that girl was hot.

1538
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:30,460
And those other two girls, I had
absolutely no use for him. You know,

1539
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,360
just cause you dye your hair blonde and
you're in shape doesn't mean you're good

1540
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:36,520
looking. Um, all right.

1541
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,980
I know I got a lot of fucking nerve
balding redhead fucking throwing down like

1542
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:42,140
that. All right, let's, let's
fucking get on with it. All right.

1543
01:33:42,141 --> 01:33:46,550
That's the podcast for this week that I
did on a Sunday and I will be uploading

1544
01:33:46,551 --> 01:33:47,740
this thing,
um,

1545
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:53,030
as I always do right around midnight just
to make sure that I never post them on

1546
01:33:53,031 --> 01:33:57,080
a Sunday because if I posted it on a
Sunday then it would be a very special

1547
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:01,100
Monday morning podcast. And this one
isn't special. This was sorta me bitching,

1548
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:04,640
which is sort of the standard. So anyways,
I hope you guys all have a great week.

1549
01:34:04,641 --> 01:34:07,160
Once again, thanks to a everybody
over at capitol records.

1550
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:10,340
Let me take a tour of that
building. I had an I, you know,

1551
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:15,730
one of the greatest things I've ever
gotten to do all seriousness and um,

1552
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,760
please come out to my shows.
Uh,

1553
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:21,350
the next show I have coming
up is in Stockholm, Sweden.

1554
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:26,450
So if anybody overseas is listening
to this, if you live in Copenhagen,

1555
01:34:26,451 --> 01:34:31,210
Denmark, evidently you can get in your
car and drive to fucking Sweden now.

1556
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:34,010
Huh?
Or at least I just discovered you.

1557
01:34:34,011 --> 01:34:37,010
Could you go over that bridge then to
the islands and into the fucking tunnel.

1558
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:39,710
So why don't you come on over
and watch me talk. My Shit.

1559
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:44,600
That is all the data's October, August
29th when I'm doing all right. I'm done.

1560
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:49,000
When you guys have a good week, take
it easy. We have taken to the streets.

1561
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,390
We are dancing. No
black. Walt's bad there.

1562
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:11,703
Picture

1563
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,400
black and white

1564
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:27,710
sticks
stones.

1565
01:35:27,711 --> 01:35:31,680
That made me smaller sports,
that code

1566
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:46,010
because nobody is,

1567
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:03,020
we are waiting on a towel.

1568
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:09,980
Sorry
Paris.

1569
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,930
We have taken to the streets.

1570
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,670
We are advancing a black walls there.
Paris
