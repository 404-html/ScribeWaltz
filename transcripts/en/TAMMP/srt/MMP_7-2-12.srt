1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,660
Okay. Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:06,960
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:11,850
July 2nd,
2012 what's going on?

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,630
It's the first week of July.
Oh my God.

5
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:20,520
This summer is just flying by.
I can't,

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:24,860
can you believe it?
Can you believe that it's gets July?

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,800
Can you believe that we spend all of
June going? Can you believe it's June?

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,130
Hey people say that even though
I make fun of it all the time,

9
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:35,480
which probably annoys the shit out of you,

10
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:40,130
but I hate people who fucking
live in the past, you know?

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,050
Like what did you think that you
were going to achieve in June yet?

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,640
How did you get a sunburn? Good.
Well then it was a good month. Yes.

13
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:53,330
Time is flying by. Yes, you
are going to fucking die.

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,290
So why don't you quit sitting around
talking about how it's going by and why

15
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,410
don't you go do something?
Huh?

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,540
Hypothetical person that I
never even heard say this shit.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,060
Do you know there's allegedly an asteroid?

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,590
Not allegedly and I guess there is
an asteroid. I mean five fucking no,

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,510
there isn't one. Cause now like I have
a telescope, it's Goddamn scientist.

20
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,890
I think they do that just so they
can keep, they can have a job.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,420
They just look through this giant
telescope. Nobody else looks through it.

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,340
What'd you seek? Doug is an
asteroid 10 right? Torches man,

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,870
it's going to kill everybody
unless you give us $4 billion,

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,110
but you're fucking nerds. That's I think
the scientists that that level did that.

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,650
Just like bankers at that level,
just complete corrupt pieces of shit.

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,220
You know, every once in a while
you'll see a good one. Yeah.

27
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,670
You meet an honest one that'll sit
there and be like, you know, ah,

28
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,500
I don't know what to tell you.

29
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,890
We've pretty much mapped out all the
way to the end of the universe. Had A,

30
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:59,210
I still have just as many questions is
when I started, which once again is why,

31
00:01:59,211 --> 00:01:59,781
uh,
that,

32
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:04,190
that poor metea so whatever the fuck
it was called was such a good movie.

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,660
I can't remember the names.
Um, so anyways, it's supposed
to be habit dentally.

34
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:13,610
There's this asteroid heading
right towards us, you know,

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,620
and rather than just letting it happen,
you know,

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,740
and just ending the fucking movie.

37
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,650
W W we're going to send some shit up
there to try to land on it and make fuck

38
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:32,390
with its trajectory. We're going to,
we can shoot some stuff at it and then,

39
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:35,240
and then what?
And then what?

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,680
We're going to keep living until we
destroy the entire fucking atmosphere and

41
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:44,330
just make this whole place unlivable.
All right, we're done. It's over.

42
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,080
Did you ever go to a fucking,
uh,

43
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,190
like Vegas or you go to Atlantic City
and you look up on a billboard and you

44
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:55,090
like, that motherfucker is still doing
shows. What is he doing? It's over.

45
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,700
Nobody fucking cares.
Go fucking out and make your own jam.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,580
You know your own Jelly and
start a start a new business.

47
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:07,050
No one wants to fucking listening to
sing that God damn song that was a hit in

48
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:12,051
1974 the day Libya they die.

49
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,450
Do you imagine that poor
bastard sing and that,

50
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:20,230
so he's even still alive if he's
dead is because of that song.

51
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,060
And I have to sing that
for 40 fucking years.

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,160
And they would say good or Madonna did
a cover that then she did she do a house

53
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,700
version, some gay guys with
some tied off shirts behind her,

54
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,020
making it new yet keeping it old.
Um,

55
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,170
she's uh, you know what's amazing about
her cause she continued to work out,

56
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,690
you know, it's fucking incredible.
Her body is like, you know,

57
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,120
just like a fucking 18 year old with
this from reason. The can't, you can't,

58
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,030
uh, work out on your face.
There's no like face pull ups

59
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,320
and I don't give a fuck if you get that
faceless shit and everything, you know,

60
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,070
you still look old. You just
can't, you can't fucking beat it.

61
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,900
Which is why you don't sit around going,
oh my God, it's fucking July already.

62
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,850
Uh, with your bud light and your cigarette
shut your face, your freckled whore. Um,

63
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,570
I live in the past a lot. I do every
morning when I take my dog for a walk,

64
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:29,950
I listened to fucking music and half the
time I'm fan, I'm always fantasizing.

65
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:34,060
That's me singing it and playing like,
do you guys do that shit? Like you're a,

66
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,350
like the, you know, like a utility
infielder that can like play any position.

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,430
Like I can play every instrument when
I'm listening to the song and whoever is

68
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:46,300
the standout in that moment of the song
by the borough, there'd be the singer,

69
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,280
the or the fucking tambourine player,
whatevers steel. And my focus,

70
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,660
that's who I am.

71
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,530
And half the time I'm doing it 30 years
ago and my high school auditorium and

72
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,420
the whole school is going,
wow, that guy is awesome.

73
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,390
And every once in a while I'll actually
step out of the fantasy and go, Bill,

74
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,440
you know, there's really something fucking
wrong with you. And then I just laugh,

75
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,120
you know, Oh, I throw my head back and I
cackle and then my dog looks at me like,

76
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:19,870
what the fuck is wrong with you? And
then she takes a shit and I pick it up.

77
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,710
That's my morning time.
My morning works,

78
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:27,880
then they come back and I make myself
a little breakfast. Um, underrated.

79
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,580
Fucking,
it's such a Boston's fucking cooking,

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,450
cooking for yourself. And even more
underrated cooking for your friends.

81
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,010
I actually, uh, I worked with
Kevin Shea, fucking hilarious.

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,120
Jason Lawhead Cleveland Zone. And
that's not a lie. That's the truth.

83
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,591
Cleveland zone.

84
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:51,130
Jason Lawhead who just grown by leaps
and bounds keeps getting funnier.

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,350
And uh, I actually, I made those
guys at dinner before we went out,

86
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,550
before we went out to, uh,
Ontario, the inland empire.

87
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,440
I was teasing them all, fuck
a weekend about that name.
The fucking inland empire.

88
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,620
Who Do you guys plan on conquering
next? Just saying shit like that. Um,

89
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,180
it's really is impressive bad ass name

90
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,580
cause I think they actually call
it the I e which is really bad.

91
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,820
You should just call it the inland empire.
You know,

92
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,730
when you just have a regular
name like Pittsburgh,

93
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,310
you got to come up with something to try
to like jazz it up. Like, you know, when,

94
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:34,130
when you come into the Berg, when
he coming to be more, you know,

95
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,440
and it's, yeah. Oh, I always said
that most corniest joke ever.

96
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,620
Can you be more douchey? Ugh, really?
Fuck you. It's Monday morning.

97
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,700
I'm entitled to that. Um,
oh, you live in a place,

98
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,790
it's the inland empire. You
don't, you don't have to fucking,

99
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,060
you don't have to make up a name.
Do you want that fucking reminds me of,

100
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,190
I remember a long time ago at the height,

101
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,720
at the tail end of the height of
that fucking deaf jam style of,

102
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,380
of standup comedy where you could
just talk about white people,

103
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,980
like they were borderline retarded and
white people would just sit there and

104
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:10,640
laugh even though none of it made sense.
And you could even relate to it,

105
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,990
but the political correctness
needle was at its peak. So you,

106
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,420
you just felt like you had to
laugh because if you didn't,

107
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:20,420
then you were maybe
some roundabout racist.

108
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,590
Do you remember that or
is this just my world? Um,

109
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,700
I saw this one man show on Broadway and
this guy was doing this whole bit and he

110
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,400
goes, yeah, me and my, all my
friends, this Latin dude, he goes,

111
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,910
me and my friends would go, we'd go
into Maddie Hattie. And then he goes,

112
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,070
that's Manhattan for all you white people.
And everybody laughed.

113
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,990
It's like I that just right there,
I just zoned out of it.

114
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,220
That whole fucking show. It's
like, fuck you. You can't,

115
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:48,500
you think I can't figure that out.

116
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,380
Like that's some sort of like you like
you're some Apache and I'm the god

117
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,900
Japanese and I can't break the
fucking code. I'm in Manhattan.

118
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,240
You're dumb cunt. It's not like
I'm watching this and Kentucky.

119
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm in fucking Manhattan.
Uh,

120
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,740
Jesus Christ fucking remixed the
name of this God Damn Town Aman.

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,440
And it is a town.
Manhattan is a town.

122
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,090
I know it's a bunch of
people there and everything,

123
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,580
but it's really fucking
small with no traffic.

124
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:17,330
You can drive from one end to the
other and like 10 minutes. I mean,

125
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,060
you're hauling ass, but you can do it on
the, on the, on the highways on the side.

126
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,270
Me Do that with any fucking
town out there. Right.

127
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,030
And he's got everybody jammed
together and fucking, you know,

128
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,110
shooting up into the sky.
That's the thing about New York,

129
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,600
I told you that before is,
is like you got to eat.

130
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
You should live there at
some point in your life.

131
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,480
And do it sooner rather than later.
Do it.

132
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:40,670
And like your 20s and then a little bit
in de [inaudible] and then get the fuck

133
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:43,520
out. That's perfect.
That's fucking perfect.

134
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,090
I was just talking to Neil about that this
morning. We were cracking up about it,

135
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,430
like how we got to, I mean, I
actually stayed there too long,

136
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,260
but God out at the right time, you know
what I mean? You know it is about man,

137
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,640
you just can't get any fucking privacy.

138
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,960
Everybody's just jammed in
with each other. And then like,

139
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,780
you don't give a fuck when you're young,

140
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,020
when you can go out and drink until
fucking three in the morning, wake up,

141
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:10,830
still have abs and go to work at
seven in the morning, you know,

142
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,710
to fuck with some third world countries,
economy or whatever the hell it is.

143
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,230
Those constitute down a Wall
Street. Right. You can do that,

144
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,520
but fucking you start getting
into your thirties and it's,

145
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:23,820
you just can't do it anymore and you just
want to come home and you want fucking

146
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:27,630
space age. You want quiet, you know,

147
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,970
he can't fucking sit there.

148
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,020
And then there's going to be some new 20
something year old moving in next year.

149
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:37,950
He's going to be fucking rage and for
three years and going through breakups and

150
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:40,920
fucking screaming at fucking
girlfriends and all that crap.

151
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,430
And then there's going to be the person
down the hall that's like 10 years older

152
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:48,690
than you all right? And you're starting
to see them slipping into that, you know,

153
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,520
getting a few too many pets and
I'm becoming like a Gora phobic,

154
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,100
you know what I mean? It just gets
depressing after a while. So now it's,

155
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,560
now it's great. I could live out
here and then I'll come back there.

156
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:05,280
I'll do a Gig, I hang for like a week
and then I get the fuck out of there.

157
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:10,080
But I got to admit when I go into the, the
comedy clubs, it's fuck, it's horrific.

158
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,080
I walk in and I'm looking
for familiar faces.

159
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
My eyebrows are up and I'm looking
around and there's nobody there that I

160
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:20,220
remember anymore. And I, I,
it fucking kills me. It's,

161
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,740
it's why I hate going home to my hometown.

162
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,300
I hate it because I moved away
so long ago when I called back,

163
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:31,620
it's like a fucking time warp and I think
I'm going to walk around town seeing

164
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,930
people that I know and,
and I don't see anybody.

165
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,210
And then maybe you run into somebody that
you do know and hopefully they'd been

166
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:41,190
going to the gym because if they haven't,

167
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:43,860
they're going to quickly remind
you how fucking old you are.

168
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,920
And I swear to God at that
point, I want to kill myself. Um,

169
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,200
then what the fuck do I do?
How do I get out of that?

170
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:56,110
Depression has been my whole, I don't,
what the fuck is in my throat here?

171
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,640
Hang on a second. Hang on one
second. I got to fucking hang on.

172
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,070
All right,
I'm back to hit pause there.

173
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,960
One of the rare times they
have to hit the pause button.

174
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:08,460
I just went outside and
just, I just, you know,

175
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:13,140
hawked it up and just spit all over
these plants. And second I did it.

176
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:15,870
I started laughing because I know the
plants were just like, fuck really?

177
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,460
You know, plants, poor bastards.

178
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,840
You know, what sucks about being
a plant is you can't fucking,

179
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,790
you can't move. You
can't like, you know, Oh,

180
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:33,990
here comes some fucking spittle and
just sorta like slip a punch. Yeah.

181
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,600
I think that's what sucks about
being a plant plant is you can't,

182
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,840
you can't slip a punch. There would
be my number one reason, you know,

183
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,840
and then just sitting there and a bunch
of fire ants or whatever the fuck they

184
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:42,931
are.

185
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:47,040
Some sort of insect locusts just start
eating you and you just sitting there,

186
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,700
you know, it's like you got
fucking cement shoes on. You know,

187
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:54,880
I bet after this fucking astroid Ma,
if it mercifully hits this fucking planet,

188
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,460
all right. Ends us and we go
down just like the dinosaurs,

189
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,190
like I think plants are going to take
over next and there's going to be a big

190
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:11,080
moment in their life when one of them
finally has the sense to pull leg part of

191
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:14,350
their roots out of the ground and
just move over a couple inches,

192
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,390
then they'll gradually the
grow feet, right? And then,

193
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,970
uh,
once they do that,

194
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,150
then you'll probably have your
first like hand to hand combat

195
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,170
somebody gonna get raped,
you know,

196
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,410
and then they'll invent some stuff and
then they'll think that they're special

197
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,600
and then they'll invent this
invisible guy in the sky.

198
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,690
And then they'll fight over who has
the right visible guy and then another

199
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,520
asteroid is going to hit.
That's what I think keep happening.

200
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,500
I think God just keeps making shit and
waiting for people to fucking figure it

201
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:52,000
out. And he just keeps going at God.
These ones that dumped too, right?

202
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,490
You have anything like what
he's doing on this planet is,

203
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,620
it's like somebody trying to
build a hot rod, you know,

204
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,030
and we're like the transmission and we
just keep slipping and they just have

205
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,200
fucked us.
You know what?

206
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,280
This doesn't fit this engine and then you
just fucking throws an asteroid at the

207
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:10,760
God damn thing now.
Well I do anyway.

208
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,730
So I was mentioning earlier that I um,

209
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,043
hang on a second,

210
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,430
get in here,
sit down.

211
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,270
It's fucking dog goes out there. I
don't understand it. She goes out,

212
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,140
I left the door open,

213
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,560
she goes out in the backyard and she
lays in the sun until she's panting.

214
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,060
Like she just ran a marathon. Then
she gets up, drinks a bunch of water,

215
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,120
and then lays in the shade and
then does it all over again.

216
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,720
And then at some point she fucking goes
over and just starts eating the grass,

217
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,510
little blades of grass and it gets
stuck in the back of her throat.

218
00:13:55,511 --> 00:14:00,430
And then she goes for the rest of
the fucking day. Why do you do that?

219
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,310
Huh? What are you going to involve? Where
you can fucking speak to me. All right.

220
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:11,200
Get over there and lay down.
Please do it. Do as I say,

221
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,570
Hey, what are you going
clear? I'll get over here.

222
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,750
Fucking walk away from me and
my podcasts. Lay Down, down.

223
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,990
Sit. Stop looking at me
like that. All right.

224
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:26,410
Go outside. Go on. Get out
of here. See that? That's
going to be a horrible parent.

225
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,630
All right. Here's a fucking
ice cream. Um, anyways.

226
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:35,770
Yes. So cooking for somebody
is fucking great. It's, you
know what I love about it?

227
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:40,690
That there's a rush that comes as,
as they're coming over, you know,

228
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,760
you're trying to time it
so it's fucking perfect.

229
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,600
You try and make it look good and then
there's this panic that you're going to

230
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:50,601
fuck it up and that there's going to be
this awkward silence because it's sucks.

231
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,170
Right. And this is thing I'm cooking
for two comedians, so if it's sucks,

232
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,720
they're going to tell me,
especially that cunt, Kevin Shay,

233
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,000
he doesn't give a fuck that guy.
You know, Kevin, by the way, is,

234
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:05,210
is an unbelievable singer,
but he's embarrassed. Um,

235
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,150
I dunno. He has like this
hidden talent. Like he fucking,

236
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,020
I caught him one time when I walked in
the green room. He was sitting by himself.

237
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,260
I thought he had the fucking right
radio one. He's unbelievable.

238
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:19,190
So a ladies get them to sync for you
when you go and see him out on the road.

239
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:23,810
Kevin Shea, s. H. E. A.
Um, so anyways, I fucking,

240
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,820
uh, yeah, there's like this rush. Like,

241
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,250
are they gonna are they gonna like it?
I think, I think it sucks. And, uh,

242
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,020
fortunately I pulled it off
and they loved it and uh,

243
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,680
I didn't get trashed by them the
entire fucking way out there.

244
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:42,780
That would have been a long drive. Who
the fuck told you you could cook? Um,

245
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,080
you listen to the Monday morning podcast,
everybody,

246
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,010
I hope you're having a good
Monday settling into the
July 4th weekend or middle

247
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,930
of the week then don't you hate when
like the Jill July 4th. What's it,

248
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:57,820
what's it a Wednesday second therefore?
Yeah, Wednesday. Ah, they fuck shit.

249
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,500
You know what I mean?
Cause if it's a Tuesday,

250
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,230
if it lands on a Tuesday or a Thursday,

251
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,360
maybe they'll give you that
Monday or that Friday off.

252
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,780
You could somehow get a 40 fucking
weekend out of it. Or even still,

253
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,560
even if they don't give you the
Friday, he just go Monday, Tuesday,

254
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,130
Wednesday you get fucking Thursday
off you dick around on Friday,

255
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,630
you still half cocked from
the fucking barbecue. Right.
And then it's the weekend.

256
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,920
It's a great fucking time.
But when it falls on the Wednesday,

257
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,050
those cons make you come in Monday,
Tuesday you'd take a little bit of break.

258
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:33,110
Then Thursday, Friday ag, you know,
you still getting a day off out of it,

259
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:34,100
but you know,
you know what I mean?

260
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,890
When it lands on that Monday or
Atlanta on that fucking Friday. Okay.

261
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:44,390
My world, that's America.
If I was president July 4th
would always be on a Monday.

262
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,760
Definitely. Definitely would
be on a Monday every fucking
year. And people that,

263
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,190
well, you know, that actually lands
on the seventh and I'd be like, Hey,

264
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,170
who picks up the red phone? Mya? You
all right? Go Fuck yourself then. Okay,

265
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:58,220
it's on the seventh this year.

266
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,520
Do we even know that they
signed it on the fucking forth?

267
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,600
Do we fourscore and seven years ago,
does somebody really say that?

268
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:07,550
Do you have any fucking
idea? Oh, by the way,

269
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:12,551
I actually saw a Abraham Lincoln
vampire hunter this past week and a,

270
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,180
I got to tell you,
um,

271
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,070
I got tickets for free before you think
I'm the dumbest person on the planet.

272
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,180
But I actually had faith in that
movie because I was like, all right,

273
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,540
there has to be a reason they made this
because this just seems like the most

274
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,000
ridiculous idea I've
ever heard in my life.

275
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,270
And I went and I saw it and
there was really no surprise.

276
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,460
It was exactly what I thought
it was going to be. A,

277
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:44,990
it was just a vampire hunter who
happened to be Abraham Lincoln

278
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,920
and they just invented all of this
shit. I'm sure it was a book. Maybe.

279
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,440
I don't think it was. It was like
some nerd shit and I shouldn't have,

280
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,563
I shouldn't have seen it.

281
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,960
Yeah,

282
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,430
I was all right.
I was drinking when I saw it.

283
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:03,530
I was fucking hammered by the end of it.
You know what I mean?

284
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,580
It's like when your team goes down 11
runs fucking two winnings and you're like,

285
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,210
Eh, fuck. It might as well drink. What
are we going to do? Go home to a wife.

286
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,190
Um,
you know,

287
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,180
it was the worst part was it was in three
d and I fucking hate three d movies.

288
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,460
I really hate it.
That's just that right there.

289
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,520
When a movies in three d that is a very
secretive little fucking nod and a wink

290
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:33,590
going, hey, hey, this movie
sucks. This movie sucks so bad.

291
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,480
We had to make shit float around
you to keep it mildly entertaining.

292
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,470
I Hate Three d and You know what
sucks about three d now is they?

293
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:45,740
Fuck they're making shit in three d
that doesn't even need to be in three d,

294
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,140
You know, back in the day. All right,
Friday the 13th part three in three d,

295
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,710
You know we shot that fucking Arrow
when it comes at you. All right, cool.

296
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,430
That was cool. But like nowadays
the guy's like, Abraham,

297
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,390
here's your pen and the
guy just reads hands a pen.

298
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,880
Why is that in three d?
Am I supposed to say? Wow.

299
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:07,400
It was almost like he was
handing that pen to me,

300
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,860
that thing that actually happens to me
in real life that happens to me in real

301
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:13,250
life.

302
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,840
A guy with the hockey mask on shooting
an Arrow at me does not fucking happen

303
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,910
near a lake or not near a lake. It doesn't
fucking happen. Make that in three d.

304
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,660
Don't just have somebody sitting at a
fucking desk in three d so I feel like I'm

305
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:30,410
in the office. Oh, it's so fucking
stupid. You know what I mean?

306
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,920
I don't even, what the fuck I'm saying
anymore? Um, you know what, how about,

307
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:40,190
how about a little bit of advertising,
a little bit of advertising. How cheese.

308
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,900
I have to keep putting the
fucking password in this.

309
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,720
Why do I have to have a password on my
computer as if what I'm doing on this

310
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:48,980
thing is so God damn important.
Top secret. What is the password?

311
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,090
What is the password? We can't have the
world have access to your shit jokes.

312
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,410
All right. Um, no,

313
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,300
I'm in the wrong area here or in
the wrong area. Find it. Find it.

314
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,600
Here it is. Okay. Quick advertising.
Only two, only two this week, right?

315
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,620
amazon.com everybody.
Hey,

316
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:11,210
do you go to amazon.com
and you buy yourself some
Freddie Mercury tank tops and

317
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:15,800
dance around your bathroom. You know,
sweating it up, right? Well. Um,

318
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:19,490
if you'd like to donate to my podcast
and the wounded warrior project,

319
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:22,430
just go to [inaudible] dot
com click on the podcast page.

320
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,640
Take your pretty little eyes,
scan over to the right.

321
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,690
You're going to see the Amazon,
uh, banner. You Click on that,

322
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:34,010
it brings you right to Amazon and then
purchase to your heart is fulfilled.

323
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,280
You don't have to buy anything. I'm not
saying that there's no pressure here.

324
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,650
This is a soft sell.
I'm leaning back right now.

325
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,640
I've got my hands up in the air like,
Hey, you know, I didn't touch him. I said,

326
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,560
this is how the sound doing
this wholesales. Think, okay,

327
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,550
so don't feel like I'm pressuring you.
You can walk right out of the showroom.

328
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,820
I'm all right with it. I made myself
a Turkey sandwich and an apple.

329
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,133
I'll take my lunch.

330
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,560
It doesn't raise the price or anything.

331
00:20:57,561 --> 00:21:00,830
You buy whatever you want on Amazon and
then they kick a percentage back up to

332
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:05,390
me and I take 10% of that. I give it an
an I rounded up to the nearest hundred.

333
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,070
I'm going to actually
kick in some even more,

334
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,790
but I've been doing all right
lately and it's just a great cause.

335
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,220
It makes you feel good. So, um, if
you, if you do it, God bless you.

336
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,820
If you don't, I understand
hands are up. Hey,

337
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,130
that trying to make you do anything
you don't want, sir. Ma'Am, Sonny boy.

338
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:25,491
All right.

339
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:30,380
Advertising number two game
fly.com [inaudible] dot com
are you sick of the real

340
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:34,580
world and want to disappear in 8,000
video games where you're a hero instead of

341
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,670
the person you truly are.
We all do.

342
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:43,010
Listen gamefly fly.com 8,000
videos and it's insane.

343
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,800
They'll mail them to
your home or the bridge,

344
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,710
take them directly to your PC and
when you'd done pit playing them,

345
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:51,140
you can mail them back
in the process continues.

346
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,310
Monthly fees are a fraction of
what a new game costs. Yeah.

347
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:58,250
This is why this totally makes sense
because once you're done with the game,

348
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,250
nine times out of 10, what are
you, what is it? What do you do?

349
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:04,640
It's just more clutter.
It's just another stack of crap.

350
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:08,670
You have to put in a box when you go to
move. All right? This is, that was what,

351
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:12,620
this is what I would do if I was a
Gamer. All right? If I was a Gamer,

352
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,160
I would go do gamefly.com
I play all those games.

353
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,040
I'd send back all the ones that I'm
done with and I don't care about,

354
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,490
and then the special ones,
I just buy those be perfect.

355
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,550
Then I get to sample everything.
You know what I mean?

356
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,830
It's like finding a wife and you've
got 8,000 women coming, right?

357
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,130
You get to hook up with all of them.

358
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,130
This is like what what they promised to
terrorists and you don't even have to

359
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:40,490
blow yourself up, is one of the
greatest things ever. It, uh,

360
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,570
the games fit playstation,
Xbox, we and even your PC, uh,

361
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:48,260
for Monday morning podcast listeners,
uh, you get a free two disk,

362
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,370
15 day trial, that's a $23
value. That's all it costs.

363
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,400
That's almost free,
but 15 days free,

364
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,460
8,000 all the ladies you want.

365
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,450
That's a metaphor for games by going
to www.game fly.com/burr or through the

366
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:10,400
banner ad on Bill [inaudible] dot
com slash podcast page. All righty.

367
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,530
There you go.
And that's the advertising for this week.

368
00:23:12,531 --> 00:23:17,000
Wasn't that painless by the way,
by the way?

369
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:20,630
I think it's time. I think we're about
17 minutes in and think it's about time.

370
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:25,310
I patted myself on the back. How
about that? Download speed last week.

371
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,410
Huh? How about that? I
didn't hear any complaining.

372
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,360
You know, hundreds and hundreds
of people bitch, Moan and,

373
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:38,350
and fuck woo woo woo.
Right?

374
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,550
So I finally fixed the God damn
problem and what have I get?

375
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,350
I get like five tweets going,
hey, I really appreciate it.

376
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,630
You know what happened in the rest of you?

377
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,610
Cause you went on to bitch
about something else.

378
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,630
You don't like the photo on
my fucking page. You know,

379
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,310
you have a stop and thinking about,
you know,

380
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,970
maybe finding out what you're
really upset about Jesus Christ.

381
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:03,260
Could I use that advice?
Huh? Um, all right,

382
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,120
let's talk about something in the news.
Shall We? Um, I actually, like I said,

383
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,770
I didn't even watch any TV this week.

384
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,130
This is just a really weird time of the
year for me with the NHL and the NBA

385
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:17,870
have ended. The NFL hasn't started up
yet. I'll watch a little Wimbledon,

386
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,390
I'll watch it.
A little bit of that World Cup soccer.

387
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,810
I wouldn't fuck you call it the European
Championship. I wrote for Germany.

388
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,050
I'm mostly German,
you know,

389
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,340
I root for those guys who they Lucy,

390
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:34,310
they're lost to Italy and then Spain
kick the shit out of Italy. Um,

391
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,430
it's great. I can watch any sport
when a championship is on the line.

392
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,960
I don't give a shit what it is.
Cause you,

393
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,830
you feel that energy from the
fucking crowd. You know what I mean?

394
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,641
Like I would go,

395
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:51,320
like if I was driving by a little league
field and somebody said that was the

396
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:52,790
championship game of Little League,

397
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,160
I would actually pull over and watch it
from my car. Like a creepy pedophile.

398
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,153
Wow.

399
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,430
No, I would, I would,

400
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,650
I would walk up when I would sit
amongst the parents so they would,

401
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:09,570
they would not feel uncomfortable.
Um, but like I don't,

402
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:13,920
I don't, uh, I stopped watching
the news years ago. It just was,

403
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,220
I couldn't watch it anymore. The same
reason why I stopped going to church.

404
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,120
I was just like, this isn't what's
going on with the telling me isn't,

405
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,950
is a guests. I just don't buy
into it, you know, other than,

406
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:26,970
that's why I like sports.

407
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,190
I like watching ESPN because what
they say is true. For the most part,

408
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,830
the Phillies did win two to one.

409
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,320
There was 30,000 witnesses. They
saw it happen. That other shit,

410
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,250
when you start telling me what's going
on and fuck and Frankford or fucking

411
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,930
Vienna, a God damn fucking Cairo.
I don't, I don't know. Is it,

412
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:51,900
is that what happened?
Is that footage actually from that,

413
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,260
from that fucking place.
Did that happen this week?

414
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,220
Am I still going to keep asking questions?
Will this ever end? I don't know.

415
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,390
I'm sorry. Well, you know, every once in
awhile I get in one of those in my brain.

416
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:04,230
It just,
I can't,

417
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,710
I tried to get out of it and then tonight
just it's like somebody else takes it

418
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,170
over.
Do you know what,

419
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,270
what kind of people that do that shit
when they're explaining something to you

420
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,010
and then they start
asking questions for you.

421
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,730
Like if they would teach you how to cook,
you know,

422
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,620
so you put the water in the
pan. Do I bring it to a boil
almost? Do I throw salt?

423
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,350
Salt in? Not necessarily.
And you're like, dude,

424
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:28,800
who the fuck you talking to at this
point? Oh, he's a nice trick for you,

425
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:31,660
for your pasta that somebody taught me
your poor little olive oil in there.

426
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:35,670
It keeps the uh, the pasta from
sticking together. You don't, evidently,

427
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:38,700
that's what the salt is supposed to do.
I thought it flavored the water.

428
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:44,130
I didn't realize that was supposed to
help it not stick together. Um, oh,

429
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:45,990
I made a great fucking meal.
Not going to lie to you.

430
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Not going to fucking lie to you.
Spaghetti and fork and meatballs.

431
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,640
Delish anyways,
it's like I said,

432
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:56,430
I haven't been watching a lot of shit
on the news. I just don't watch it.

433
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,371
You know what?

434
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:02,150
I think they shouldn't have to fucking
sing the news the way they do in the

435
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:04,580
Catholic church.
You know

436
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:09,670
there was a guy who got attacked
by two monkeys in South Africa.

437
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,030
Okay?

438
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,950
He decided he was going to go down
there and try to rehabilitate some

439
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:22,740
chimpanzees that had been
abused and they turn around,

440
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,150
dragged them for two kilometers
and kicked the shit outta him.

441
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,560
What a dumb fuck.

442
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,050
Why would you fly across the world
to get your fucking ass kicked?

443
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,950
Did you guys hear about this dude,
South Africa,

444
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:41,130
Texas student attacked by chimp improves.

445
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,740
Thank God he improves this poor
fucking bastard. He's a ranger, right?

446
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,550
He loves animals.
This is the thing about animal lovers.

447
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:55,551
You gotta realize that once you go past
a certain level of domestic animal and

448
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:59,430
you start getting into the wild,
no matter how much you love them,

449
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:00,720
they're not going to love you back.

450
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,750
Wild animals. I like that. Dick,
you shouldn't have gone out with,

451
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,240
you know,
that person have cheated on you.

452
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:16,800
That person who just doesn't have your
back. Wild animals do not have your back.

453
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,990
Your dog has your back,

454
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:24,020
you cat borderline cats kind of have
that creepy vibe that if shit went bad,

455
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:27,300
they'd decide what the intruder,
you know what I mean?

456
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,373
Okay.

457
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,160
Fish. They just don't have
any fucking say. They're like
a Stepford wife, you know?

458
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,050
That's why dogs are the best they,
it's they truly fucking love you.

459
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,630
My Dog fucking loves me.

460
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,760
Will be on a walk and all of
a sudden she just look up me.

461
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:48,470
It's almost like she's smiling. You
know how fucking warped, why sound?

462
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,380
She's probably just panting and
it looks like she's smiling.

463
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,070
He's probably going like, why does he
have this fucking rope around my neck?

464
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,680
It doesn't make any sense to me.
If I really wanted to,

465
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:59,090
I could rip his fucking face off,

466
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,200
but in my world I'm so in love with
my dog and look, she's smiling,

467
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,050
but that's not bad when you just have a
dog. I think people who fucking, you know,

468
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,440
okay,

469
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,160
fuck with animals for a wild, wild
animals, they start thinking like, oh,

470
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:19,070
look at the Cheetah. Oh, she's play
a Gig and all of a sudden draw off.

471
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,760
This fucking launches itself that you

472
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,403
all right.

473
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,120
I believe that we came from monkeys.
I believe that we came from the apes.

474
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,990
I believe something else. So there's
three in a row in this sound smooth.

475
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,170
Um, but I by no means think that, uh,

476
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,000
that those fucking things like us,
I don't give a,

477
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,430
if I teach at sign language and the
chimps sitting at going in sign language,

478
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,070
Hey, I think you're a cool
guy there. Freckled face cunt.

479
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,340
You know that there's no fucking way I'm
ever going on the other side of the God

480
00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:56,740
damn cage.
This poor bastard was on the other.

481
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:59,920
He was on the other side of the cage.
He just got too close.

482
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,530
That's how fucking insane a
wild animal is. Chimpanzees,

483
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:10,370
they say have the strength of six,
six men.

484
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,160
This dude got attacked by two chimps
that would be like getting attacked by a

485
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:20,030
flash mob. Okay? Like 12 fucking people.

486
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,800
They just grabbed this mother fucker
by his ankles. They reached underneath.

487
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,180
I mean, I don't what kind of bullshit cage
they had was like a compound, you know.

488
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:30,180
So they put up that,
that,

489
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,680
that cheap wire shit when you don't
want to rabbit to come in and eat your

490
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,010
lettuce, right. And your garden.
Like they put that shit up.

491
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,900
So this fucking guy sitting there,

492
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,110
you know as they go doing
that shit and he's like,

493
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:44,230
what are you guys doing to
tell me we don't tell me right?

494
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,840
And he's trying to sign to them. You
guys want to play Frisbee, right?

495
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,390
And they sitting there talking to
each other going just two more inches,

496
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,840
two more inches. Look at this dumb mother
fucker who wants to play Frisbee, right?

497
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:57,380
And they reach underneath,
grab him by his fucking ankles,

498
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,220
strike the 12 men. They fucking pull
them right underneath that goddamn thing.

499
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,430
Like when you go to Quiznos and they
stick you sub right through that poor

500
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:11,431
excuse for a fucking a brick oven
yanked motherfucker right underneath.

501
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,860
Oh my God. And then they dragged him
full like another fucking two kilometers.

502
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,870
However fucking far that is. I
don't know. In my world that's a,

503
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,870
what's that about a mile and a quarter,
cause I know like 40 kilometers,

504
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:29,650
like 60 kilometers is like 40
miles an hour. Who gives a fuck?

505
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:34,420
They dragged this son of a bitch basically
through the length of every football

506
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:39,220
stadium in the NFL and I can guarantee
you it wasn't the nice turf that those

507
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:42,310
guys play on.
This was the natural habitat.

508
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:45,880
Like I can't imagine
the vice grip strength,

509
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,500
those, those fucking things, man, they'll
rip your foot off the rip your balls off,

510
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:53,230
the rip your face off the rip it off.

511
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,590
Like you open a fucking Goddamn thing,
a yogurt,

512
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,700
God damn ice cream when you just take
the lid off, they do that to your face.

513
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,170
What the fuck are you doing near
these God damn things. You know

514
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,460
Jesus fucking Christ.

515
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:12,090
I would have to tranquilize had guns and
I would be wearing one of those fucking,

516
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,650
you know the suit you wear when you,

517
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:17,430
you think you're going to get bitten
by a shark. That chain link shit,

518
00:32:17,431 --> 00:32:18,450
there's no fucking way.

519
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,400
There's no way fucking catcher's
mass welded to my face.

520
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm not going anywhere in here.
And not only that,

521
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,580
these aren't just regular fucking chimps
that have been swinging around eating

522
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:34,200
bananas, occasionally eating
another monkey alive, right?

523
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,980
This isn't that shit. These are ones
that were abused. They were fucked with.

524
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,923
Okay.

525
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,020
And having adopted a fucking abused
dog and the Goddamn Skitzo Shit that,

526
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,300
that thing does,
I can't fucking imagine.

527
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,180
Okay?

528
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,070
Uh, a goddamn schizophrenia fucking ate
two of them, straight to 12 God damn men.

529
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:59,970
And you're going to walk near
the cage trying to sign, hey,

530
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:03,960
how about the weather frank or whatever
fucking human name you gave him,

531
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,140
your right Yardi a fuck, and God bless
you. Your heart's in the right place.

532
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:10,410
Fortunately, this kid doesn't seem
like he had any damage like that,

533
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:12,540
but like this dude was so in shock,

534
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,380
like they were finally able to just
like stitch them up and stabilize him.

535
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,490
And evidently he's not in critical
condition and it doesn't seem like,

536
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,660
it seems like he still has his balls,
his feet and his face,

537
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,230
which is incredible. But
they say, you know, he,

538
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,240
he has bite marks and
a and fractures plural.

539
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,090
Okay.

540
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,430
Oh my God.
Just treating you like a fucking rag doll.

541
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,840
That is the most horrifying
shit in the world. To me,

542
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,330
nature is the most horrifying shit.

543
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:47,590
I would rather have a lot. Let's see.
You know what, the human equivalent,

544
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:50,230
someone has to come into my
house with a fucking chainsaw.

545
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,250
I can deal with the Goddamn,
I could deal with the machete.

546
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,690
Alright. I could deal with that.
Chainsaws that, that's hardcore.

547
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,780
I could fuck up machete. I could deal
with, I think I could fucking do the,

548
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,210
the sugar ray Leonard,
you know,

549
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:07,630
stick my face out and then pull it back
when you took a swing and then fucking

550
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:08,830
try to take both your legs out.

551
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:19,500
Uh, only hardcore boxing fans
got that one. Um, but the,

552
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:24,280
I mean if you were in a room with the
chimp and that thing goes fucking ape

553
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,480
shit, no pun intended. That thing is
on the floor. It's up on the ceiling.

554
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:30,340
It's across the room.
It's like,

555
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,010
it's like a comment and you're sitting
there dealing with human speed,

556
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,950
dude.
That's why we got the brains that we have.

557
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,410
This why was so much smarter. We have
to be because it was so fucking slow.

558
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,923
You know what I mean?

559
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,560
You ever see a white guy who gets
dunked on and those highlight films,

560
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,710
you know that fucking guy that they bring
off the bench when the teams either up

561
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:02,280
by 30 or down by 30 that guy,
that's what we are in nature.

562
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,240
Even the fucking athletic humans.
Yet your note, we're nowhere near.

563
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Just think like a how fast a fucking
snake is a fucking pit Viper Viper.

564
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:16,620
I just nothing fucking, you don't
eat your bit and that thing has left,

565
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,370
left the fucking building
before you even did,

566
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,520
before that signal from
your fucking leg going, hey,

567
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,270
we just got bit by a Goddamn pit
viper even reaches your brain.

568
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,730
That snake is already leaving
and then you go,

569
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:35,330
and then the real is, and as the
realization did that you got bit hits you,

570
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:39,570
you are, you're already collapsing.
Why the fuck would you go out there?

571
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,170
Okay.

572
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,660
You know, I, I don't know. We
had to be that fucking smart.

573
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,260
Yeah.

574
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,260
I can't imagine that the God damn fear
back in the fucking day you're walking

575
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:54,720
around with a bunch of God
damn neanderthals or whatever
it Niana talls I guess

576
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,610
I supposed to say I sit in the under thall
my entire life, but it's neander tall,

577
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,140
I guess. And what else was it? There
was two tribes. One of them died off.

578
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:06,410
There was an [inaudible] and then
there was the fucking crow magnums.

579
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,490
And I forget what the fuck we are.
One of them, one and the other ones,

580
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,590
the other one of them was a little bit
smarter and the other ones were a little

581
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,710
dumber and dumber ones died off.
All right.

582
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:23,780
And some people have a little bit of
that Crow Magnum or Neanderthal in him,

583
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,690
you know, because you know
that people, they fuck right.

584
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,420
It's going to be the dumbest
education podcasts you've,

585
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:36,590
you'll ever got to fucking hair.
I just totally lost my train of thought.

586
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:39,230
What the fuck was I talking
about? Oh, Niana toss. Right.

587
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,750
So I can't imagine what
can walking around.

588
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,910
Did you ever see that shit
when they did that whole thing?

589
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:50,150
I'm chromatic in the Ndaa. Tall is like,
one of them was like fucking slower,

590
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:50,540
like the,

591
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,320
the fucking white dude in the NBA and
one of them was a little bit quicker,

592
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,340
a little bit smarter.

593
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,330
So they fucking did this shit where like
when they would show him like taking

594
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:04,220
down some prehistoric bison, like the
fucking little smarter ones, you know,

595
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:06,830
they could fucking, you know, that
that Shit, they could slip a punch,

596
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:08,630
they could throw a goddamn spear.
They could do,

597
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:13,400
they could do it from a fucking distance.
Like this fucking jackass. He wasn't,

598
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,590
he was too close to the God damned cage.
The fucking Chromatin is whatever.

599
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,770
The dumber ones they would like
fucking day would just brute strength.

600
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:24,770
They would fucking run and try to tackle
the thing and someone would, you know,

601
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:26,510
separate this shoulder,
a break,

602
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:29,480
an elbow and there's nobody
around is set that shit.

603
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,820
Every step in your fucking non-existence
shoes and your big stupid prehistoric.

604
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,770
It's just shoving that pain shoot
through your body. I edge can't imagine.

605
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,780
I can't imagine sitting there looking
out of a cave in everything is that much

606
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:49,460
faster than me and I don't have a
fucking door. I don't have a gun.

607
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,570
You just must be just sitting here like a,

608
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,510
and he can't really communicate to the
other person because language hasn't been

609
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:59,750
developed yet. So you just having
that. What the fuck? Look on your face.

610
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:04,220
That was probably one of the
first phrases invented like,

611
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:06,650
are you shitting me or the Kelly?
Can you fucking believe this?

612
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,470
I Dunno, but God blessed that
dude, you're an animal lover.

613
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:17,440
I totally know where you're coming from.
But for the love of fucking God,

614
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,390
those things are not your friends.

615
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,743
Okay.

616
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,370
I Dunno. Start p nine dx in and stay away
from that fucking cage. Jesus Christ.

617
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:29,570
Can you imagine that?

618
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,030
Yeah,

619
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:37,030
I'm getting dragged away by
two fucking abused chimps.

620
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,400
Then you know, God damn well he saw
that fucking Oprah want episode.

621
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:45,580
That woman came on with no face. I know.
He was fucking thinking of that shit.

622
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,810
I hate those motherfuckers. You
know what is, I like gorillas.

623
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,480
I hate chimpanzees and I
hate those little monkeys.

624
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,730
The little motherfuckers
that throw this shit at you.

625
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,400
I can't stand those fuckers.
And I hate chimpanzees.

626
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:01,910
I always hated those motherfuckers. I
didn't know why. And now I know why.

627
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,060
That was my inner fucking whatever
the fuck caveman telling me.

628
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,720
Get the fuck out. Go
back to the cave. Stupid.

629
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,240
I don't trust them. I don't. I
don't trust those fucking things.

630
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,890
You have to go to the
zoo and you just fucking,

631
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,840
you just your eyes meet with like a lion.

632
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,970
Just that fucking look on
their face when they, they,

633
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,390
there's just, it's, I've said this before,

634
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:33,870
it's like what the same look like
when a hooker looks at you like it's,

635
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,240
it's the real deal.
You know,

636
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,460
this isn't some fucking bullshit.
Flirting, playing hard to get,

637
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,830
get a couple of drinks out of
you. It's, yeah, you got 20 bucks,

638
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:47,040
I will suck your Dick. What? Ya know,

639
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,600
lions got that same look on their
face. Like, yeah, if you know,

640
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:54,420
if you weren't in that fucking armored
vehicle or on the other side of this,

641
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:58,650
yeah. If I was hungry I would eat you
and uh, no matter how much he screamed,

642
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:02,400
I wouldn't give a shit. It actually excite
me more to rip your fucking head off.

643
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:07,200
There's no way. There's no
way. There's no fucking way.

644
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:08,990
Yeah.

645
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,150
That's why I watch all those
animals thinks about, I'm
fascinated and I, and I, I,

646
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:16,570
I appreciate all those people that put
themselves in harm's way because there's

647
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,660
no other way to really gauge how strong
an animal is until you see it slap

648
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:21,680
around a human being.
Like,

649
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:25,310
I can't watch too fucking grizzly bears
wrestle and slap each other. They're,

650
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,110
they're in the same weight class.
You know what I mean?

651
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:32,140
If I see him bitch slap a human being
and watch the guys head spin around a

652
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:37,460
couple of times, like, wow.
All right, I get that. I can
now gauge that. Let's like,

653
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:41,770
yeah, like, like kilometers
versus miles. All right.

654
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,520
I think we killed that subject.
Um, moving along. Holy Fuck.

655
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,830
40 minutes in and we had a bunch
of good emails this week too,

656
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:52,220
so I got to get to this shit.
All right. Um, by the way,

657
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:55,640
if you'd like to email me and tell me
to shut the fuck up or ask me a question

658
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:56,300
or anything,
uh,

659
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,300
the official podcast email
is bill@thefmpodcast.com.

660
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,940
Bill at the capital m,
capital m,

661
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:09,860
capital p Ahd cast.com.
That's it. All right.

662
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,190
Okay. Here's the first question.
Alcohol. Hey, fuck head.

663
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,790
What's your favorite type of beer?
How often do you drink hard alcohol?

664
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,960
Not sure why I want to know so badly,
but for some reason I do go fuck a pole.

665
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,381
You know,
people,

666
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:28,010
just because I have an over the top
podcast doesn't mean that I don't have

667
00:41:28,011 --> 00:41:31,550
feelings too.
That was a guy,

668
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:34,340
like I've been such a country to everybody
written in to me. Like he's like,

669
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:37,550
all right, I'm going to be a country you
first. So I guess I deserve that. Alright.

670
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,910
What are the questions here? What's your
favorite type of beer? Uh, all depends.

671
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,820
It all depends.
Um,

672
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,530
there's beers that I like cause they
take me back to a fun time in my life.

673
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,520
Michelob light Budweiser every time.
If I haven't had those beers for awhile,

674
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,640
Michelob light is the
first beer I got drunk on.

675
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,740
And Budweiser was the
king of beers and I came,

676
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,480
I was a child of the 80s
where you actually got a
tattoo of the Budweiser label

677
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,070
on your arm.
You know,

678
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,000
I suppose to this fucking shit people
do nowadays with Chinese writing.

679
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,150
And I don't know, that's even old. Um,

680
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,320
so like whenever I drink that shit,
it just takes me back to like a,

681
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,400
when I lived in Massachusetts season
tickets to the patch fucking Bruins,

682
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,750
Boston. Yeah. You know, trying
to fucking get laid, you know,

683
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:35,030
working in a warehouse, no fucking
debt, you know, all that shit. So,

684
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,740
um, I've tried to snobby beers,
you know, it's, it's funny,

685
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:44,720
I don't like Belgium beers. I, I'm mind
blue moon, but I don't let the too sweet.

686
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:47,720
They got that sweet taste in him. I don't
like that. I like beer more with a bite.

687
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:52,040
I like German beers. Um, yeah,

688
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:52,874
it all depends.

689
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:57,320
I had like a fucking major thing with,

690
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,420
with Guinness for the
longest fucking time.

691
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,590
And then I went over to Ireland and
I tried the Guinness over there and I

692
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:04,680
couldn't tell the difference.
I was like,

693
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,170
I thought it's supposed
to taste better over here.

694
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,630
And I drank it all fucking
week cause I loved it.

695
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,490
And then when I came back to the states
then the shit that they had mistakes

696
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,520
tasted like ass and I've never
kind of been able to go back to it.

697
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,440
So I don't even know if
I answered the question.

698
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,240
And how often do I drink hard alcohol?
Uh, not that much, but when I do,

699
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,330
oh Geez. Um, I like
Scotch. I like whiskey.

700
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,140
I do,
you know,

701
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:37,730
I saw somebody recently who's
been just drinking nonstop,

702
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:41,960
like always embraced the lifestyle, you
know, cigar smoking, fucking Whiskey,

703
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:46,220
drinking hardcore and oh my God,
dude,

704
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:49,370
you can do that for a little while,
but you do that shit. Dia Fifties, man.

705
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:50,204
You get like,

706
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,280
you get that your bottom lip always looks
like you just put fucking chap stick

707
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:59,780
on it, you know? And then you get
this big head. You look like this guy.

708
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,120
He looked like a fucking old woman.
I can't even tell you.

709
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:07,830
He still has like a great head of hair
and he had like this bad ass rockstar

710
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:09,450
haircut that was a little short,

711
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,650
but because his head was so fucking big
and its torso was all fucking, you know,

712
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,780
man tit it out.
That's what he looked like.

713
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,010
He looked like an eastern European
60 year old woman. You know,

714
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,050
those women who look like they
could rip a tree out of the ground.

715
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,653
Okay.

716
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,230
I think bill, Maurice said that they asked
him why, uh, he doesn't drink anymore.

717
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:31,970
He goes, yeah, you know, after
awhile you start like Ted Kennedy.

718
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:34,440
He's absolutely right. Um, all right.

719
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,130
Beef Kurt and advice for
those of you in the states,

720
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:41,940
that's a slang for the
Hoo Ha beef curtains.

721
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,440
Do the math. Think about it. All
right, you ready? Okay. Here we go.

722
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,490
Here's the situation. I have a
wonderful girl in my life. Uh, what,

723
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,910
when she does not a fuck.
That's what I'm guessing.

724
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,220
I'm guessing this is where it's going.
I wonderful growing my life.

725
00:44:56,221 --> 00:45:00,870
Great attitude, humor, big tits, nice ass
and a good family. Jesus Christ. Dude,

726
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:04,950
marry this girl. Sure. It seems
good for now. But I have one issue.

727
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,420
She also has some mean beef
curtains and he put in parentheses,

728
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,010
Pussy Lips just in
case. I didn't know. Uh,

729
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:17,030
that kind of bug me bug the ever living
shit out of me whenever we get down to

730
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:19,560
the dirty business.
So much.

731
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,890
So to the point I looked up some cosmetic
surgery that basically gives the beef

732
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:29,610
curtains a trim job and
beauties the vagina.

733
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:35,490
While, dude, why? All right. Now
before I read the rest of this,

734
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,790
if you're going to fucking ask
me how to have this conversation,

735
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:45,250
like listen, love, I love you. I love you,
I love you family. I love you, your heart,

736
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,670
everything. But is there any way
you could trim your beef curtains?

737
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,730
Maybe you can get away with it cause
you've got that cool accent. I Dunno,

738
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,160
but she has it too so she's
not going to give a fuck.

739
00:45:57,161 --> 00:46:02,110
You maybe pull this off with
some foreign chick anyways. Um,

740
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,470
so he looks up cosmetic surgery
to try on a beautiful vagina.

741
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,570
Now I know by now I must sound like a
douchebag focusing on the little things

742
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,840
now because women do that to women.

743
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:18,430
Focus on little things like that.
That's a serious issue, dude.

744
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,770
Sex is a big fucking thing.
But anyways, he says,

745
00:46:21,771 --> 00:46:24,790
but my thinking is I'm truly
going to pull the trigger.

746
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,410
He spelled it that way and keep this
woman all the myself for the rest of my

747
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:34,411
life are and I entitled to have a great
looking vantage to look at it for as

748
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:39,520
long as our bodies don't wrinkle away.
Wow.

749
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,960
I know there's a lot of women are
fucking annoyed by this one. Yeah.

750
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:46,600
What about your fucking
Dick in your wrinkled balls

751
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,380
once you get a face lift
for your sack there, buddy.

752
00:46:50,381 --> 00:46:51,980
I know they're all saying that.
Um,

753
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,610
how can I ever bring this
option up to her without,

754
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,600
I knew he's going to ask me
without completely destroying
her feelings or making

755
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:02,680
her hate me for being so pussy conscious.
Thanks for the read.

756
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:06,520
Now go fuck yourself. All right.
This is a simple one, dude.

757
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,950
There is no fucking way

758
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,920
you can bring that up to her without
absolutely completely destroying her

759
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:19,150
feeling. So you either need to accept this
or you have to, you have to let her go.

760
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,853
That's it.

761
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,353
That's it.

762
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,580
I mean, I would think that if you
actually truly cared about this girl,

763
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,720
now all the chicks are going to be like,
oh,

764
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:34,060
I knew he had a heart underneath
all those c words. Um,

765
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:39,160
if you truly care about this girl, uh,
I would think that that wouldn't matter.

766
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,810
You know, and if she looks
the way she, she's saying,
you're saying that she looks,

767
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,020
I mean, what, what are we
talking here? Like how,

768
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,020
how far down are these things
hanging as it like, you know,

769
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,330
I mean she got 'em both of
them peers. Could you like
do like, uh, could you like,

770
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,960
oh, it's bad to say, could you be
like, do you like that Olympic?

771
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,180
The fuck is that thing here.
You're on the rings.

772
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,820
Could you do that and still swing
your feet up and not hit her pussy?

773
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,020
Are we talking like it's that bad?

774
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,210
You know if you did the iron cross,
would your head be in her pussy?

775
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,520
Like how far these things hanging down?
Hey now

776
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,430
what's the deal with big gardens?

777
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,470
All right dude, there's no way there's,

778
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,630
there's no fucking way and don't,

779
00:48:23,631 --> 00:48:26,420
don't do that to her because she
can't do anything about that.

780
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:30,260
If she had a problem with
her fucking vaginal area,

781
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:33,110
you would have known by now because she
would have been self conscious and she

782
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:34,640
would have brought it up the way.

783
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:38,750
Sometimes girls do about parts of their
bodies and they are super self conscious

784
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:42,830
about their bodies because we're
so fucking visual. All right.

785
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,200
I told you once had, when the
first girls I ever hooked up with,

786
00:48:45,201 --> 00:48:46,720
when I got his shirt off and her bra,

787
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:50,570
she rolled her eyes and I thought she
was thinking that. I was like, oh my God.

788
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,210
Like I'm not doing it for
like she's rolling her eyes.

789
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:57,590
Like this guy's lame and I found out later
she was self conscious about the size

790
00:48:57,591 --> 00:49:01,010
of her breasts. So I totally
took it the wrong fucking way.

791
00:49:01,011 --> 00:49:05,030
I made it all about me cause
I'm self-involved. So A. Dot.
Yeah, don't do that tour.

792
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,980
All right.
Either.

793
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:09,290
You can see that that's when you
just suddenly have in your head.

794
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,180
Either you accept that
shit or you move on,

795
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:15,650
but there's no reason to hurt this person
because you're a shallow cut like me.

796
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,580
All right. All right. Cheers.

797
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,250
[inaudible] sister. What is it? Sister

798
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,800
sister's a, oh Christ. I can't even
fucking read. You know what it is?

799
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:33,040
I put it into a different
document and it doesn't show it.

800
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,240
For some reason capital letters don't show
up and it's this new fucking computer.

801
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,640
I'm just not liking it.

802
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,170
I have to read this because I think
this is a funny title. Hang on, hang on,

803
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:48,960
hang on, hang on. It was funny. It
was it. Hang on, hang on, hang on.

804
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,170
You know what that's from a
long time ago when fucking, uh,

805
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:58,330
when a Eric Clapton did a unplugged

806
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,670
and they play dead stupid,
wooed you.

807
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,600
No money,
like

808
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,550
9 million times that fucking summer
and you want to kill yourself. But he,

809
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:11,200
he's got a moment and during that that
is unplugged where you start to song and

810
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,460
he fucks up and he goes, oh, hang
on, hang on, hang on. Hang on.

811
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,270
Some reason that is stuck in a
loop in my head. Anytime I fuck up,

812
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:20,660
I saw that thing 20 years ago and anytime
I fuck up to this day, I go, hang on,

813
00:50:20,661 --> 00:50:25,580
hang on, hang on. I'm all right.
Sisters a through C IR we go,

814
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,240
uh,
tired of giving

815
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,980
advice to guys with psycho suicidal
girlfriends or people with STDs. Well,

816
00:50:32,981 --> 00:50:34,750
I got something a bit
lighter for few here.

817
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,890
A kind of like the cores light version
of your typical advice. Thank you.

818
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:42,520
And is perfect for the middle of the
summer. We kicked my feedback on this one.

819
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So I know this lady who
I'd been friends with uh,

820
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:53,470
for a while now and banged one time.
She's the oldest of three sisters,

821
00:50:53,471 --> 00:50:55,380
so we all call her sister a.

822
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,710
About two years ago I made
out with sister be in a club,

823
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:04,600
not my initiative, um, and ended up
having sex with there the same night.

824
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,840
Jesus Christ. Dude, I
went out with her. Do,

825
00:51:07,841 --> 00:51:10,930
do they have like that thing on the back
of their SUV where they have the stick

826
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:14,470
figures of the entire family and you
just slowly keep exiting them out

827
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,650
and the family doesn't
understand if somebody's trying
to kill my daughters. No,

828
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,650
I'm just trying to fuck all of them,
sir. Well, that's a relief. All right.

829
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,670
Um, anyways, I went out
with her for a while. Oh,

830
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,720
this is sister B.

831
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,440
And it was surprisingly not awkward
when we were hanging out all together,

832
00:51:35,441 --> 00:51:39,910
even though everyone knew the situation.
Jesus Christ,

833
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:43,390
what's southern state are you in sir?
Um,

834
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,840
I'll go fuck yourself people down south.
That was funny. Um, some months later,

835
00:51:46,841 --> 00:51:48,640
sister bea left me for one of her,

836
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:53,540
one of my friends and got
over it quickly enough. Oh,

837
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:55,030
when you got over it quickly enough.

838
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,880
And nowadays I'm still in contact with
sister a and B since I'm not the kind of

839
00:51:59,881 --> 00:52:04,120
guy that holds a grudge for that kind of
stuff. Oh, there you go. It's very mature,

840
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,160
which means you really didn't give
a fuck about either one of them.

841
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,380
So why are you going to be all upset?
You know,

842
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:11,470
like you own their pussy once you fuck
it. I hate when, I hate when guys do that.

843
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:12,371
Anyways,

844
00:52:12,371 --> 00:52:16,480
recently since sister see started talking
to me more frequently after talking

845
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:17,200
for a bit,

846
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,200
she said she could pose for me since
I'm a painter and she's a model and a 10

847
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,290
all the fucking way I might
add, oh, you fucking creep.

848
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,890
You fucking creep.
You fucking creep.

849
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,790
So she was a 10 the whole time.

850
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:37,810
So basically you're in a holding pattern
banging her oldest sisters waiting

851
00:52:37,811 --> 00:52:41,530
until this girl was of age so he could
fucking painter Jesus Christ. I got to, I,

852
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,510
you know, I might have to
stand up and applaud this one.

853
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:45,520
This guy is taking it to another level.

854
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,160
This is a fucking epic situation here.
So you go see, here's my question.

855
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:57,310
Does that proposition mean anything?
Do you need my advice?

856
00:52:57,311 --> 00:53:01,000
I need advice from you. How do you
fuck every girl in the same family?

857
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:02,643
Okay.

858
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,190
Jesus Christ. This is like, you
know how long that's been a,

859
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,700
it's been since it's been a triple
crown winner in horse racing.

860
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,330
The last time someone
won the Kentucky Derby,

861
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:15,860
the Preakness and the breeders' Cup.

862
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:19,510
Is that what it is or is that a soccer
match? I don't fucking know. I don't know.

863
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:20,344
No fucking horse.

864
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,920
Since the late seventies I would
guarantee that it's been since the late

865
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,300
seventies sent somebody
has booze bank three.

866
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,980
I think a lot can do two in one family,
but to get all fucking three,

867
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:34,463
two,
three,

868
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:39,090
two is a respectable three is no,

869
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,880
it's beyond respectable. Two. Three. Okay.

870
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,220
Everybody who was three years
in the sporting world do that.

871
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,070
That's a fucking dynasty.
Okay.

872
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,950
You just put yourself in there
with fucking Bill Russell.

873
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:54,180
You put yourself in there with,
with, with the fucking, uh,

874
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:00,630
Magic Johnson Lakers. You know,
I wouldn't say the Colby Lakers.

875
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,390
You know, when you go out and you
get Phil Jackson and fucking shack,

876
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:07,730
then that's that new shift that the
kids like. I don't like that shit. Um,

877
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,430
either way, dude, you're talking
fucking dynasty. Oh wait,

878
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,160
magic never won three in a row, but he
had the Celtics to fuck with named when?

879
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:17,550
Three out of four years. Give me a
fucking break. Um, so he's Michael Jordan.

880
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:21,210
There we go. So here's my question.
Does that proposition mean anything?

881
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,480
Is it a trap?
Should I try to bang her?

882
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,940
Should I try and bang her too and get a
third strike or keep my dick in my pants

883
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:33,420
and avoid a potential shit storm?
And if yes,

884
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:38,040
do you have any tips,
special tips on this special situation?

885
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:41,640
All my friends are telling me to do so,
but I thought I'd ask him.

886
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:44,910
We'll refine mine like yourselves
before I did a move. Dude,

887
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:48,480
you are looking at me like, dude,
you're beyond me right now. Okay?

888
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,980
This is like Bull Durham. I'm, I'm fucking
Kevin Costner. Um, I'm, I'm a lifer.

889
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,080
Okay. You're, you're,

890
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:58,240
you're going up to the show hidden brand
new balls every fucking day. I will.

891
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:03,120
I will you tell me. Okay. I never
banked to girls in one fucking family.

892
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:04,440
You know,

893
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,980
I was psyched if I was able to tag a
couple of friends and we were all hanging

894
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:08,820
out at a bar one night.

895
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:12,060
And you get that feeling like I fuck
both of you and you both know it and you

896
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,180
both loved it. I hope. Please,
please tell me you liked it.

897
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:20,080
Did you like it was I okay? Um, dude,

898
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:25,070
I think you got to do it. You
got to do it. You know, you,

899
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:28,860
you've been above board the
whole time, sister. A sister be,

900
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:31,950
they all fucking knew everything right
now I understand this is a little

901
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:36,000
delicate. Okay. He's trying to snip the
last wire here. This is the kid sister.

902
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,840
Is it going to blow up in your
fucking face? Uh, it's worth it.

903
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:46,260
It's worth it. It's worth losing a
couple of limbs and you nose on this one.

904
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:50,480
You got to do it the fuck. You know, Dude.

905
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:55,310
What the fuck she says to you? I,

906
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:55,711
yeah,
you're,

907
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:59,360
you're a painter all let me take my
clothes off and get paid my fucking Twat.

908
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,750
That's not art too. That's
foreplay. Give me a fucking break.

909
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,090
It'd be one thing if you're
in a classroom of people,

910
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,950
it's just you and she's
standing there naked dude.

911
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:12,520
That's like one of the tabs they
have had done that porn senate,

912
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,220
that scenario in a porn at Jesus
Christ, you might have fun. A new angle

913
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:23,020
do. That's phenomenal. That
is fucking phenomenal, dude.

914
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,020
Got To do it.
You got to do it.

915
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:30,610
Did John Elway retire when he only got
one? He came back for another, right?

916
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:32,950
Yeah.

917
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:36,550
You got to do it, dude. Dude, dude,

918
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:38,650
that's like when Bush
fucking the first Bush.

919
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:43,720
He stopped and he didn't get Saddam. You
got to go all the way on this one, man.

920
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,150
All right.

921
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:52,140
You gotta be like Marlon Brando in
fucking apocalypse now. He just, you just,

922
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,260
you just accept the fact you
left the program. All right?

923
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,813
And

924
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:03,030
I don't care how mad these girls get,
dude,

925
00:57:03,031 --> 00:57:08,031
you are at the precipice of
becoming an absolute fucking legend,

926
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,400
okay?

927
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,910
Legend who, who can, who, who's
gonna be able to talk to? Dude,

928
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:17,700
there are celebrities who've had orgies,

929
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:22,440
they've had five on ones and all that
type of Shit, okay? But I guarantee you,

930
00:57:22,441 --> 00:57:27,441
they never fucked three fucking girls
in the same family when they weren't

931
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:32,550
famous, not famous. You're doing
this shit with the gift of Gab.

932
00:57:32,551 --> 00:57:35,340
Whatever the fuck you're doing, dude,
you do this. You got to write a book.

933
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,210
You gotta write a book that's, you
know, that's what you should do.

934
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:43,620
Collection of the most amazing pussy
getting stories ever that you can somehow

935
00:57:43,621 --> 00:57:48,240
confirm, all right? And it has
to be none of that bullshit.

936
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:50,910
The second you get famous, you get
money. That doesn't count, all right?

937
00:57:50,911 --> 00:57:53,220
That's garbage time,
okay?

938
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:56,390
They put the fucking second team in
there and you just fucking Titone layups.

939
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,110
That's bullshit. I'm talking
about just regular dude. You do.

940
00:58:00,111 --> 00:58:02,400
You talk yourself into it through the,
and you're a fucking legend.

941
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,940
You got to do it. All right.
There's my halftime speech.

942
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,500
I'm going to quote Joe Barton.

943
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:13,501
Nick quoting John Madden today is going
to be the greatest day of your life,

944
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,940
but only if you win.

945
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,760
Okay?

946
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,350
All right. You got to do it. You got to
fucking do it. All right. Here we go.

947
00:58:24,351 --> 00:58:28,100
Next one. Bill. Fight over.
Picture with you is billion.

948
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,840
My girl and I drove up from San
Francisco to see you in San Jose.

949
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:37,760
You didn't drive up. You drove down.
If up to you means south. I don't know.

950
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:40,900
What the fuck are you doing? Um,
and it was awesome. Thank you. Uh,

951
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:45,910
we were at the show where that lunatic
in the front row was giving you a pastry

952
00:58:46,191 --> 00:58:50,240
or a pumpkin after every fourth joke.
Nah, they were nice. This fucking lady,

953
00:58:50,241 --> 00:58:52,810
just like lady,
she fucking brought it.

954
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,770
She made an ACDC pumpkin.
She,

955
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,780
she made a bunch of muffins and she
brought cookies. It was like every,

956
00:58:59,781 --> 00:59:03,110
I guess I had three jokes about food and
she just sort of brought them up to the

957
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:06,740
stage. She was nice. I know what you
mean though. It got a little crazy.

958
00:59:06,741 --> 00:59:08,490
But once she had actually,
uh,

959
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:14,500
made the ACDC Pumpkin anyways, I've
seen you three or four times. Uh,

960
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:18,800
but this is the first time since I've
been listening to a first time since I've

961
00:59:18,801 --> 00:59:20,090
been listening to the podcast.

962
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,080
So the show over and my girl starts
going on and on about how I need to get a

963
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:26,510
picture with you. Uh, no one fence bird,

964
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:30,470
but I don't want a picture with you or
with anyone. I don't know personally.

965
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:35,030
Well that's cool. He goes, uh,
well Megan, maybe Megan Fox.

966
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:40,040
That totally makes sense. Um, yeah,
and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not offended.

967
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,190
You think like fucking standing there
at the end of the show with people with

968
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:45,830
the cell phone cameras that they hand
to somebody else and they don't know how

969
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:50,180
to work them and then they fucking, you
know, even when they hit the right button,

970
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,420
you've got to stand there for like
nine seconds before finally clicks.

971
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,430
It's a nightmare. Um, so I'm glad one
less person I had to do that with.

972
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:03,170
So he goes, uh, anyways. And
I just feel like I was some,

973
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,810
if I was some pseudo celebrity,

974
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,390
I wouldn't want to be taking
pictures with any dudes though.

975
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:11,600
Did you have to really bring me down
to fucking earth like that? You can't.

976
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:15,620
This guy's a fucking cunt. I know
what level I'm at your fucking deck.

977
01:00:15,621 --> 01:00:20,420
You don't need to take
my knees out anyways. Uh,

978
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:27,020
what does he say? I don't want to take any
pictures with dudes. Just chicks. Yeah,

979
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,380
that does make sense. Is this guy
son? He likes the others guys like,

980
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:32,300
like trying to be my friend while
he's subtly giving me shit. This is,

981
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:34,850
I call this the Greg Fitzsimmons.
This is what Greg does.

982
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,300
Greg compliments you and Barry's
the insult in the middle.

983
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,340
He's a five minute for all I know.
Fitzsimmons is do this.

984
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:46,100
Fitzsimmons wrote this because I think
he realizes that I figured him out.

985
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,890
So he's like, well, now what's
another way I can get him? I know.

986
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:52,310
I'll send an email and pretend
to be somebody else. Sorry.

987
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,610
That's my conspiracy theory
kicking in. Um, anyways,
that's the whole point, right?

988
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:56,331
So,
uh,

989
01:00:56,331 --> 01:01:00,140
I go to the bathroom and when I get
back in the line to get a pic with you,

990
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,880
it's about 30 deep.

991
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,760
My girl at this point is still nagging
after I already told her I'm not

992
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,360
interested in taking a picture with
bill burr. Uh, now I got to get it.

993
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:12,110
Now I've got to turn into an asshole
because she's still nagging me about this.

994
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:14,540
And I have to certainly say,
I don't want to take a picture.

995
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:20,300
I'm not waiting in that line. I don't
need you thinking for me. Let's go.

996
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,370
Well, that's what you should do,
but you shouldn't do it with anger.

997
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:27,320
So we go outside and she starts going on
and on about me being homosexual. Yeah,

998
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:28,520
that's her logic.

999
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:32,600
I did wait in line to take a picture
with you so that automatically makes me

1000
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,720
quit. Quit. He said in
earned Insert Boston accent.

1001
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,920
I just kept asking her why was she
trying to start a fight with me? Uh,

1002
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:41,510
we had a great time and now this,

1003
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:45,470
I told her my hero growing up was Chris
Cornell and I wouldn't even want a

1004
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:47,030
picture with him or an autograph.

1005
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,270
I don't understand the desire to bug
complete strangers for a picture or an

1006
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:54,200
autograph. Dude, I totally get this. Uh,

1007
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:58,520
he goes Florentine does it all the time
and brags about her on his podcast,

1008
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:00,790
but he thinks,
uh,

1009
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:04,610
black tubes who keep the tags on their
hats or match their shoes with their hats

1010
01:02:04,611 --> 01:02:08,660
is gay. Uh, they're both
gay by the way. Oh, what?

1011
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,640
Getting a picture and that dude,

1012
01:02:09,641 --> 01:02:11,390
you just took a whole fucking
left turn there he goes,

1013
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:16,160
my girl isn't a fan of yours
and thinks you're a sexist pig,

1014
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:21,480
but you turned her with your
performance in San Jose. So what do you,

1015
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,530
what do you make of this billion? Yeah,
that's weird. She didn't even like me.

1016
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:27,990
And then you go there and then she's
demanding that you get a picture.

1017
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,071
Am I queer?

1018
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:32,430
Because I didn't want to get in line
and wait for you to take a picture for a

1019
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,500
half hour with you. Uh, no you're not.

1020
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,800
You're a fucking guy who knows what he
wants. And you wanted, you went there,

1021
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:39,960
you saw the show, you had a good
time. You wanted to fucking leave.

1022
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:40,794
That's what you should have done.

1023
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,020
And what's with chicks trying to make
you do shit you don't want to do? Um,

1024
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,510
I don't know. You got to ask
them. I have no fucking idea.

1025
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:50,130
Okay.

1026
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:53,670
Because you know what it is. They feel
that they know what's good for you.

1027
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,620
They honestly feel that.

1028
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,580
And they'll tell it to you with a straight
face and a then all a front. Yeah,

1029
01:03:00,581 --> 01:03:01,414
we do.

1030
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,290
If you just listen to us [inaudible] like
they think that they have life figured

1031
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:09,570
out and the reality is,
is they have part of life figured out,

1032
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:14,280
you know, and that's why
you need them. You know,

1033
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:18,420
they have that fucking, uh,
let's spruce up the place.

1034
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:22,020
Let's a fucking do some shit that
makes you feel uncomfortable,

1035
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,250
but secretly you really want to
fucking do, you know, they know that.

1036
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,833
So

1037
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,150
what happens is, is I think that they
think that they know that all the time.

1038
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,760
So that was some shit where you
like, dude, I don't want to do this.

1039
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:39,210
And she thinks that no, you're just
being a guy right now and this is like,

1040
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:45,240
this is going to go into your,
this is fucking gay zone.

1041
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:50,820
So they think you just be in a fucking
macho guy when they don't realize that

1042
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:53,520
sometimes it's like, no, seriously,
I really don't want to do this.

1043
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:54,750
I really don't want to go to brunch.

1044
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,890
I really don't want to go
to your girlfriends fucking
birthday party where we

1045
01:03:58,891 --> 01:04:02,580
dress up like it's the 1940s I really,
I honestly, from the bottom of my heart,

1046
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:05,340
I don't want to fucking do this.
I don't secretly long to do this,

1047
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,320
but I'm worried that my friends
are gonna make fun of me.

1048
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:11,130
I seriously don't want to fucking
do this. Okay. But the thing is,

1049
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:13,830
this is guy is you're gonna say it
like that and then they go, you know,

1050
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:17,510
you're angry. Why you
being mean to me? Um,

1051
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:19,583
I dunno.

1052
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:22,260
That's why chicks trying to make you do
shit that they don't want you don't want

1053
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:26,640
to do. And also a lot of them are
selfish cons just like us. Um,

1054
01:04:26,641 --> 01:04:28,530
and if they want to do something
and they think it's awesome,

1055
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,710
they can't figure out why you don't think
that it's awesome. And He, you know,

1056
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:35,280
all right, I think I explained
that 58 fucking times. Um,

1057
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:37,660
and go fuck yourself with a pseudo
celebrity thought that, that,

1058
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,230
that was completely unnecessary.
You know,

1059
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,160
fucking content that actually hurt my
feelings even though I know it's true.

1060
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,230
Yeah.

1061
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,580
All right, well here we go. What
do we got a first date and money?

1062
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,790
I gotta I gotta step it up here, man.
What time is it? Oh, an hour and four.

1063
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:54,624
I got to get out of this.

1064
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,393
Fuck,

1065
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,830
I gotta get Outta here. All right.
First, what does a, first of all,

1066
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,840
I led the podcast, but blah,
blah, blah. I'm 20 years old.

1067
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:06,290
Still in college and newly single.
I decided to try my hand on dating again.

1068
01:05:06,291 --> 01:05:07,460
I met this girl on Facebook.

1069
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,780
We message each other for hours before
I decided to ask her out on a date.

1070
01:05:11,781 --> 01:05:14,960
She accepted Jesus Christ. Dude,
she's probably sitting there like,

1071
01:05:14,961 --> 01:05:18,490
my thumbs are aching. Well, you
fucking ask me out. Uh, she accepted.

1072
01:05:18,491 --> 01:05:20,070
We made plans for me to pick her up.
Uh,

1073
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,560
this would be the first date I've had
in four months I'd build, replaced with,

1074
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:28,240
which was around 20 minutes from
where I live. We went to the mall,

1075
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,900
which is where everyone
basically goes into the weekends.

1076
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:34,630
So I thought that I would, it would be
a good place to go. When we got there,

1077
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:38,440
we would decide. We were deciding on what
to do. That's not a good game plan, dude.

1078
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:41,140
You should know where you're going to go
and what you're going to do just to get

1079
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:43,000
it going. So then she'd do
you feel like, you know,

1080
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:44,650
this guy knows what's what's going on.

1081
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:48,040
All of a sudden you're making decisions
and all of a sudden she's taken her

1082
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:51,130
pants off. That's how it works.
All right? You can't go there.

1083
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,920
You can't treat them like peers.
You've got to put them beneath you.

1084
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:57,410
You've got to have him looking at the
floor that way they don't get to say good

1085
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:01,570
night to nobody. What movie?
Pauper. Greenwich village.

1086
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:04,540
I did a bad version of that.
Um, anyways, when we got there,

1087
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:08,890
we were deciding on what to do. I
suggested a, we watch a movie. Uh,

1088
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,530
but nothing good was playing.
Say You fucked yourself.

1089
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:14,770
So instead we decided to eat dinner.
Applebee's,

1090
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,670
we ate at this restaurant in the mall
and talked about getting to know each

1091
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:19,900
other.
At the end of dinner.

1092
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:23,620
I paid because I was told
the man pays on a first date.

1093
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:27,910
What I wasn't told was whether or
not I should pay for extra stuff.

1094
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:31,450
Oh my God. We started, well, first of all,

1095
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:34,030
you already set a precedence that
you're paying. The second you pay,

1096
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,670
you're paying for the whole
fucking evening. Okay.

1097
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,420
And fuck all the women right now going,
right? Yes. Right. Go Fuck Yourself.

1098
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:42,550
You fucking free. Cons. Uh,

1099
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,900
we started walking around and we go into
a few stores and she starts looking at

1100
01:06:46,901 --> 01:06:50,950
things around the store saying,
I wish I had money to do to buy this.

1101
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,370
I wish I had enough money to buy that.
So what I did,

1102
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:57,230
because I was trying to be the
gentlemen and impressed her,

1103
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,800
was offered to pay for
those things she wanted.

1104
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:01,330
Okay.

1105
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:05,530
Ah, dude. Ah, you just fucked yourself.
She totally doesn't respect you anymore.

1106
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,490
You got used.
I ended up buying or some sunglasses,

1107
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:12,940
a shirt address and some shoes and
a necklace on a first date. Dude,

1108
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,290
on a first date the first night out
with you, just getting to know you,

1109
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:21,220
you buy her dinner and all this shit.
Cedar relies on the second date.

1110
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:25,270
If it's going to go any further, as you
know, relationship has to move forward.

1111
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,930
Let me do you have to buy or even more
shit. All added up to around 120 bucks,

1112
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:30,400
not including the dinner.
After that,

1113
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:33,940
I drove her back to her place
and that was it. Of course it was

1114
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:35,710
okay.

1115
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:39,100
Jesus Christ. You bought her a bunch of
shit like you were already fucking her.

1116
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:40,590
Yeah.

1117
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:45,480
That was like her blowing you and then
asking, can you take me to a movie? Yeah,

1118
01:07:45,481 --> 01:07:48,600
yeah, I'll get right on that.
It's not happening anyways.

1119
01:07:48,601 --> 01:07:50,910
We'd gone out for more times since then.
Of course she is.

1120
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,150
She's trying to get a whole
fucking wardrobe audio and
the only thing I got out

1121
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:57,450
of this girl was a makeout session.
Yeah, that was a sympathy one.

1122
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,710
To be honest. I wasn't really expecting
to get anything from this girl.

1123
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:03,930
So why did you buy all this shit?
Dude,

1124
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,030
you've got to work on your
self esteem here, man.

1125
01:08:08,031 --> 01:08:11,150
You set yourself up to be a SAP and
that's exactly what's happening here.

1126
01:08:11,151 --> 01:08:15,040
This is all on you and you have the
power to change this shit. All right.

1127
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,740
Take this fucking girl out next
time. Not Her. Somebody else.

1128
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:22,550
Cause you've already ruined it with
this one. Okay, fine. Another girl,

1129
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,230
take her out when you take her out.
No,

1130
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:28,400
where the fuck are you going to go and
know what you're going to do. Okay.

1131
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,220
And when she goes, no, I wish I
had that. Well, hey, you know,

1132
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:35,390
maybe you ought to work some overtime
this week. You know, don't say that,

1133
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:38,690
but just think that. Go Fuck
Yourself. And uh, you know,

1134
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:40,610
and just be silent when
they say that shit,

1135
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:44,210
then they'll realize they overstepped
some shit and uh, you know,

1136
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:47,330
they probably feel like they got to make
up for it by a maybe given you a handy.

1137
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,920
Um, anyways, he,

1138
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:53,570
I'm going to plow through this shit
after telling my friends about the first

1139
01:08:53,571 --> 01:08:56,450
date, whoever all my friends
said what I did was wrong.

1140
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,380
I shouldn't have done that.

1141
01:08:57,381 --> 01:09:01,340
All my lady friends said what I did was
sweet and rare for a guy to do. Yeah.

1142
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,650
Because they want us to buy him shit.

1143
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,830
It's got me at the crossroad of who to
listen to more listened to the guys on

1144
01:09:08,831 --> 01:09:09,664
your team.

1145
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:13,330
Stop going on cross enemy lines and
trying to figure out what the fuck you

1146
01:09:13,331 --> 01:09:16,480
supposed to do. All right, fuck all that.

1147
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:19,900
The only time you talked to broads
is if you're trying to, well,

1148
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:23,350
what should I get her for a birthday?
What's some chick shit that you guys like?

1149
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:27,880
That's what you do. Okay. You
don't fucking ask them. You know,

1150
01:09:27,881 --> 01:09:31,210
should I spend all my money?
Yeah, that would be sweet.

1151
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:32,760
Okay.

1152
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,180
Yeah. Don't listen to them. Listen to
your friends to set you straight, dude.

1153
01:09:36,181 --> 01:09:39,540
You dropped 120 fucking bucks
and you didn't even get kissed.

1154
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,480
She got everything she wanted.
You didn't get anything.

1155
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:44,160
Okay.

1156
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:48,750
Yeah. Fuck all that dude. Fuck all
that. All right. Don't ask women

1157
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,700
advice about fucking
women. Like don't, okay.

1158
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,110
Okay.

1159
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:57,660
Immediately you, you're
making it an away game. Okay.

1160
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:02,400
You fucking talk to you guy friends. All
right. And I'm not talking about like,

1161
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:06,960
you know, getting the end
Athol advice cause the guys,

1162
01:10:06,961 --> 01:10:09,990
we'll give you stupid fucking
advice to case in point myself.

1163
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:14,130
But like when it comes to shit
like that where you're basically,

1164
01:10:14,131 --> 01:10:16,140
when you feel like you went too far,

1165
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:20,250
the women are always going to side
with going too far in their direction.

1166
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,133
You know what I mean?

1167
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:27,680
That would be like if a girl came
up to a guy and said, listen,

1168
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:31,880
my boyfriend wants to like,
you know,

1169
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:35,300
possibly bring another girl into the
bedroom. Should I do that? I mean,

1170
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:38,900
what the fuck are you going to say
and what are they going to say?

1171
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:45,400
No, come on. All right, here we go.
Dilemma Bill. Imagine you met a girl.

1172
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:49,150
She's beautiful. Has a great body,
funny and totally into you. I did.

1173
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:54,100
She lives with me. Oh, this
is a mixed of points. Anyways,

1174
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,460
the night's going great and you having
a good time together and she goes home

1175
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:59,770
with you. Uh, so back at your place.

1176
01:10:59,771 --> 01:11:01,900
You're making out and things are
getting pretty hot and heavy.

1177
01:11:01,901 --> 01:11:06,250
She starts to undress and she has great
tits. Oh my God. Then she takes her pants.

1178
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:08,650
Serve eal.
She's wearing an adult diaper.

1179
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:14,070
You have to diaper is unsoiled.
Is it still a deal? Yes, it is.

1180
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:17,490
Absolutely. 100 fucking
percent deal breaker done over.

1181
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,330
That's it.
It's over.

1182
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:25,940
I'm thinking you peeing and shitting
and my Dick has a is slumped over and is

1183
01:11:25,941 --> 01:11:29,270
like, Bill, you enjoy the rest of your
evening cause I'm calling it a day.

1184
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,930
Absolutely a fucking deal breaker.

1185
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:36,280
Apps of Fuckin lutely
cause that's gonna take me,

1186
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:39,820
it takes me immediately back to a
horrifying situation that I had.

1187
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:41,140
I think I told this story before.

1188
01:11:41,141 --> 01:11:44,140
I'll tell it really quick cause
I gotta get Outta here. Uh,

1189
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:45,940
hooked up with this girl fucking hot,

1190
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:51,630
sexy fucking super tall like model type
chick to the point where we'd like doggy

1191
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:56,650
style. She had to like fucking like
her, her, her, she was too high.

1192
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,740
I'm going to plow through this
because this is disgusting.

1193
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:08,830
If you don't like disgusting stories,
plow through the next fucking 30 seconds.

1194
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:13,600
All right, fast forward to her. Alright,
whatever. So we hooked up and everything.

1195
01:12:13,601 --> 01:12:16,960
We started in the living room,
we ended up in the bedroom. Okay.

1196
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:18,670
So you know that shit with his,
like the trail of clothes.

1197
01:12:18,671 --> 01:12:20,920
The next morning she's picking up her
stuff. I'm trying to help her out.

1198
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:26,050
I see your little fucking panties there
in the, uh, and the living room. And, um,

1199
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,990
I went over to them and,
uh, there was a, uh,

1200
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:36,310
oh, this is, this freaks me out. There
was a fucking, I would say at least

1201
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:42,490
three, two and a half to three inches.
Fucking Skidmark in her fucking panties.

1202
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,580
I know. Disgusting. Oh yeah.
So it's a deal breaker.

1203
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:49,000
Listen to the sound of my voice
when I tell that story. It was just,

1204
01:12:49,001 --> 01:12:51,790
it was fucking horrific. Alright.
Overrated. Underrated, underrated.

1205
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:53,910
Moving apartment. Okay. Underrated.

1206
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,690
Moving apartment at six in the
morning and drinking j a j d at noon,

1207
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:03,220
listening to ACDC on your new balcony
in the sun while looking at all the rest

1208
01:13:03,221 --> 01:13:06,610
of the douchebags unpacking their
truck with shit they don't need.

1209
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:10,510
You moved at six in the morning and nobody
complained. What the fuck do you care?

1210
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:14,550
Right. You're moving out.
Um, overrated vacuuming.

1211
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:18,240
Uh, there's no way to do this
without looking at feminine.

1212
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,400
Ah,
it's a fucking

1213
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,100
great bit, man. You could
actually sell it to a comedian.

1214
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:32,300
You could fucking kill with that. He
goes, you got to limp wristed Lee.

1215
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:35,570
Hold that cord out.
Like tinker bell with a wand.

1216
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:39,800
There's just no manly way to
vacuum. Can't be done. It can't.

1217
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:44,420
That is a woman's job.
It's just fucking over theirs.

1218
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,950
It's like wearing an apron.
There's just no way to do it. You,

1219
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,560
the only way to wear an apron is a guy is
that it has to be that solid white one.

1220
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:56,650
You have to have all the other white
matching shit like uh, like your,

1221
01:13:56,651 --> 01:13:57,960
your, your uh, uh, uh,

1222
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:02,840
a fucking gourmet chef and you have to
be a fat gourmet chef. Other than that,

1223
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:07,040
you look like a Douche.
Um, underrating sweeping,

1224
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:10,910
good old sweeping with a broom.
Possibly saw dust from the,

1225
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,820
you just built. You can get out, you can
get your elbows into it. No risk involved.

1226
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:20,770
Yeah. But then you get like that minor
lung cause you kick up all the dust. Um,

1227
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:27,340
I'm actually like a neat freak and messy
and I actually enjoy fucking vacuuming.

1228
01:14:27,341 --> 01:14:31,240
But every once in a while I'll walk by
a mirror and I'll see myself and I will

1229
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:35,230
burst out laughing or I'll immediately
get embarrassed thinking of all my

1230
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:39,670
fucking crazy friends suddenly bursting
and seeing me vacuuming and just

1231
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:44,230
trashing me. Unmercifully for like two
hours. All right. Under the losing weight,

1232
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:48,550
once I turned 30, I decided I needed
to get back into shape. I was 300,

1233
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:53,590
a 300 pound tub of shit and even XXL
shirts were starting to feel snug at 300

1234
01:14:56,891 --> 01:15:00,040
pounds. Fuck yeah. Jesus Christ. Um,

1235
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:03,550
I haven't even really put on a ton
of a ton of effort into it yet,

1236
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,740
but just by lifting
weights every other day,

1237
01:15:05,741 --> 01:15:09,430
riding my bike four or five times a week,
and by eating real food,

1238
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,270
I've been losing about 10 pounds a month
for the last four months. Good for you,

1239
01:15:13,271 --> 01:15:18,070
dude. That's fucking awesome.
I love that shit. Now,

1240
01:15:18,071 --> 01:15:23,071
the best part is that for every 10 pounds
I lose the weight of the girls who are

1241
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:28,080
interested goes down by 30 pounds.
Isn't that sad? Poor women, this,

1242
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,120
they just don't have enough people
to choose from. That's great too.

1243
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:34,510
That's good for you though. And I was
thinking being older helps somehow to,

1244
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:36,370
maybe it's just knowledge and confidence,

1245
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:41,290
but I get hotter chicks now than I
could when I was 21 and in better shape.

1246
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,720
Yeah. Because you know
something that's also this,

1247
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:46,420
this certain women out there that
they find guys that a little fucking

1248
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:50,080
overweight, uh, they find you
less intimidating, you know,

1249
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,100
as opposed to some guy standing
there like a shredded a, it's like,

1250
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:57,010
believe it or not,
they actually get intimidated too.

1251
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,760
You would think because they have
the fucking balls that they wouldn't,

1252
