1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,930
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:08,660
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast at all.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,310
Ah,

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,000
just check it it on you.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,200
I'm just checking in to see how
your week's going. You know,

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,970
you know who I'm talking
about. Oh, you brave warriors,

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,040
you social justice people you know,
misunderstood,

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,810
uh, you suffering white women
and you're fucking SUV. I just,

9
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:38,670
you know what you do day in and day out
is so difficult and I'm just checking in

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,690
to make sure that you're living your
truth and whatever else is written on your

11
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:45,300
fucking yoga pants.
How are you everybody?

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,980
I'm in New York City,
New York City,

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,930
skyscrapers and everything. Um, yeah.

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,350
Been here for a couple days and a,
I'm having a good time doing stand up.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,800
You know,

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,850
even though it's like doing fucking
standup at a woman's college now I can,

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,660
I have never
this trip,

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,130
I swear to fucking Christ.

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,050
I've gotten more grown standing
on stage doing my bullshit act.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,340
Then I got my entire time when I lived
here for New York for like 10 years.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,040
Like it's,
it's fucking crazy.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,170
What has happened to this comedy?
This was one.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,600
This used to be one of the
great comedy cities. Oh my God.

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,030
Okay.

25
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,080
Each stand on stage,

26
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:34,370
you feel like somebody is like fucking
stepping on a puppy behind you.

27
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:38,550
You're like, what did I say?
What? What happened? Ah,

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,460
the old time.
I am really holding on to this,

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,520
this hope that this is just a ridiculous
phase that this country is going

30
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:55,591
through this ridiculous phase where we
have allowed like 8% of the population

31
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,710
and they're unbelievably extreme lunatic
ideas to push us so far to the fucking

32
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:06,220
left that me as a lefty,
like now I feel like,

33
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:10,600
do I need to start watching
fucking Fox News is this way?

34
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:15,160
The middle is now watching those cons
on that fucking channel. I mean, I,

35
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,420
I don't know what to do here.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Yeah,

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,150
I dunno. All I can tell you is when I
did stand up over in Europe, like the,

38
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:24,250
the level that they
were laughing at us for,

39
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:27,040
what the fuck we're doing because
we're all in a bubble over here.

40
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,690
I don't know what the deal is,

41
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,670
but I think it's a sad state that I
went to formerly communist Europe.

42
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,330
Um, and I felt freer to speak
over there then I fucking do here.

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,560
It's unbelievable. Oh. Um,

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,330
but actually not in
defense of New York City.

45
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:49,230
I think I've been going
further in the grown direction.

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,080
Okay.

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,270
Just as a reaction to it.
Like,

48
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:54,760
okay.

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,100
So I,
I could give myself some space.

50
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,530
Yeah.

51
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,370
You know, it's, it's
fucking claustrophobic.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,990
I don't,
I really don't understand.

53
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:06,991
I just don't understand that adults
going to comedy shows and um,

54
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,490
I don't know. You know what?
But you know, it was great.

55
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:12,880
Was the Patrice O'Neal comedy
benefit that was fucking phenomenal.

56
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,300
And um,
actually one of the comics,

57
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,390
Mark Norman had a fucking
great joke on shit like that,

58
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,780
about people getting offended,
which I won't tell cause it's his joke.

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,480
So go out and go see him live.
Um,

60
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,290
thank you to everybody on
that came out this year.

61
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,600
I don't have the names in front of me,
so I know I'm going to forget somebody.

62
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:36,190
Michelle Wolf, Jay Oakerson, rich vos
hosting it for the seventh year in a row.

63
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,610
Mark Norman Joe Lists, uh, Gary Gulman,

64
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:43,240
Chris read a Mama, Mama, Mama. I know.

65
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm forgetting like two or three people.
I don't,

66
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,420
everybody went out and
fucking killed. It was, uh,

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,630
you know, we got great feedback
about it. It was just, it's just,

68
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,650
it's one of my favorite things in
the world to do. And like I said,

69
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:00,260
all the money goes to,
uh, his mom and, um,

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,270
his wife and, uh, you know,
and people have asked, well,

71
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:06,850
why do you do it every single
year? You know, it's like, well,

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,840
we just one theater gig and Patrice
was supporting those people.

73
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:15,160
And I always hated when somebody dies.
You do like one fucking, you do it once.

74
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,480
He like up gay.

75
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,820
There's a sack of money trying to stretch
that out for the next fucking 20, 30,

76
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:26,260
50, 60 years that you'll live in. You
know, um, he was taking care of him.

77
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:28,660
So, uh, he unfortunately passed away.

78
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:32,860
So all the comics make sure that we were
taking care of who Patrice was taken

79
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:36,760
care of. So, um, like I said,

80
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,340
all they should have to deal with
is the grief of him not being here.

81
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,430
Other than that, you know, we should all
be helping them out, which we're doing.

82
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:45,160
So thank you from the bottom of my heart
to everybody who shows up to the thing

83
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:49,990
and everybody comes out and donates
their free time. Oh, Maureen Taren,

84
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:54,820
who puts the whole thing
together. Um, it's, it's, uh,

85
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,150
it's just awesome. So, uh, we're already
thinking about the lineup for next year,

86
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,390
going to see if I can get Paul Versey,
you know,

87
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,660
got to get versus you to come
down. Uh, for some dumb reason,

88
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,120
I haven't asked him to do it yet. There's
always somebody every year. I'm like,

89
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:12,080
why the fuck haven't I asked that person
yet? So, uh, that is the deal. Um,

90
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,570
anyways, let's talk in
the news. Oh my God.

91
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,320
You know, everybody is
talking about this, uh,

92
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:25,210
this Jessie Smith and Lewinsky,
whatever his fucking name is. Juicy,

93
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,180
juicy, small. Let

94
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,760
Jesse Smollett.
Everybody's talking about that.

95
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:34,520
But I don't think that's
the biggest news. And, uh,

96
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,010
the biggest story in the news right now,
I think it's Zion Williamson's Nike.

97
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,800
Okay.
The brand that Paul Versey love,

98
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,420
like it literally exploded on his
foot and caused him to have injury.

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,781
No,

100
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:54,781
I can't imagine how many older white guys
like me with the dad bod that are now

101
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:59,941
going to reconsider buying Nikes because
if it can't withstand the power of Zion

102
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,790
Williamson, how is it with Stan? Me,

103
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,510
I'm trying to think of some dad shit.
I'm unfolding a stroller.

104
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,860
Oh God. Can you imagine what those
evil constant run Nike. Can you Matt?

105
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,520
I bet there.

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,940
I bet they have this serial number on
that sneaker and they are tracking down

107
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,550
that fucking four year old
that glued that thing together.

108
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,790
Oh my God. What are they
going to, Oh, Jesus Christ.

109
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,310
The probably going to hang them upside
down for the next month by his fucking

110
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:31,144
toes.

111
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:32,620
Okay.

112
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,070
Would make him wear Adidas or some shit.
I don't know what,

113
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:39,120
but I can tell you something right now.
They are rejoicing at Adidas, Reebok,

114
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,340
uh, pro keds. Whoever else makes fucking
sneakers. I gotta be honest with you, man.

115
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,940
I that is like, I have not seen a
guy this sound Williamson, this,

116
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,970
if you miss Bo Jackson,
like this is what you're watching.

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,190
Like somebody who just comes along,

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,520
I mean he's literally what
the fuck this guy did.

119
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:05,660
Like I could not do that to a
sneaker if I got hit by a car,

120
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,600
I'd have to get hit by some farm equipment
and lose my leg for my sneaker to

121
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,500
look like that. That was just
the sheer strength of this man.

122
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,050
Okay.

123
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,140
Making a cut or whatever. I
have no idea. But that reminded,

124
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:25,210
the only thing I'd ever seen like that
is you ever watched that shit on Bo

125
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,271
Jackson?
Uh,

126
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:30,271
how he ended up having that career
ending injury is he was running with such

127
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:36,871
speed and had like a 250 lineback pound
linebacker hanging on his leg as he

128
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:42,820
continued to drag the guy
down the field and just,

129
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,980
yeah,

130
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,521
it was weird.

131
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:48,240
It was like his own strength
worked against him because
anybody else would have

132
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:53,241
just fell down like a fucking sack of
potatoes and he continued to run with 250

133
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:58,200
fucking pounds hanging on
them. Um, unbelievable.

134
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,730
So I help that kids. All right.
I heard he is all right. Um,

135
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,330
I'm sure nobody on the tar heels side of
the fucking court was upset that he was

136
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:08,580
out for most of the game. I think he came
back. I don't even know what happened.

137
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,460
I'm missing everything. Like my
Boston Bruins. Hey, we go bro.

138
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:15,360
Weds here we go.
Um,

139
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,340
have one seven in a row and I've missed
every game. I've been following it. Um,

140
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,960
I heard there was a high stick goal that
we got away with against the La Kings

141
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:27,550
or whatever and uh,
so we ended up winning in overtime.

142
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,130
We just one in a shootout
against Vancouver. Um, you know,

143
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,960
big, big, big points,

144
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:38,880
getting 14 points out of 14 points
this time a year going into March,

145
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,910
moving up the playoff thing. I think
we said they move it up to, uh,

146
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,480
the sixth seat or something like that.
Sweet 16.

147
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,880
I don't know what the fuck they said,
but all I know is what playing well.

148
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:52,740
So that makes me happy. And when I get
on the other side of my special here, uh,

149
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,520
I will be looking forward to maybe
take it in a game two. Um, all right,

150
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:59,640
so let's talk about Joe.
Just smaller.

151
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,190
Yeah.

152
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,540
Jesus fucking cry. Like I had been
watching this story just cringing,

153
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,180
you know, in the beginning it was
depressing. Like Jesus Christ.

154
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,220
Like why would somebody do
that to somebody? But then
when it started to unravel,

155
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,580
yeah,

156
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,650
yeah. Just like, oh no, please no.

157
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,920
Okay,

158
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,100
please tell me you didn't do this to your
first fucking guys on like one of the

159
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:28,840
biggest shows on fucking TV.
If this is true.

160
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,260
Okay.

161
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,050
That's why I don't like talking
about it like until it's like proven,

162
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,700
but it's looking fucking bed.

163
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,940
Okay.

164
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,680
What, you know, you know what I mean?
You know what's fucked up is everybody,

165
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:43,310
doesn't everybody have like
a hero fantasy? You know,

166
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:46,520
we stop a bank robbery
of stops of terrorists.

167
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:49,310
He ended up landing the plane or some
shit and next thing you know you're,

168
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,970
you're on Oprah and she's
talking to you just go and like,

169
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,710
how are you so amazing?
And you're like, ah,

170
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:00,650
you know, shucks, I was just
doing my job as a passenger.

171
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,670
I did what anybody else you say of all
your raw shucks slides and then all of a

172
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,720
sudden you're like,

173
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,710
you wake up from the interview when
you realize you just drive it down the

174
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:10,431
street and you'll,

175
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:13,190
or you were talking to yourself
and somebody saw you w you know,

176
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,190
at least performers.
We're all a little bit nuts like that,

177
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,200
but to fucking follow through with it.

178
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:19,930
Okay.

179
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,000
Then this guy,
you ever watched the first 48

180
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,830
some of the ways they catch people now I,

181
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:29,580
it's weird because I should be rooting
for them, but it's just, you just,

182
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,480
I watched some of these forensic
shows. It's like, oh, what the fuck?

183
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,110
You can figure it out from that.

184
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,940
Okay.

185
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,750
I remember one time this guy suffocated
this woman using a fucking garbage bag

186
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:46,650
and they somehow found her,
her fucking face in the bag.

187
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,290
You know,
I gotta hand it to murderous though.

188
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,330
I don't know if that just
caught up in the emotion of it,

189
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:55,330
but like they're fucking belief in
themselves that they're going to get away

190
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:58,940
with this shit. They should really just
watch a couple episodes. I like that.

191
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:02,180
The first 48 or,
or one of these forensics fucking chills.

192
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,680
I don't know how anybody gets
away with anything, but um,

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,430
I got us, be honest with you
now that it's unraveling.

194
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:10,870
Okay.

195
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,040
The bleach, the maggot hat magnet.
What does it make? America great again.

196
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,120
Mag a mag. I had the fucking,
uh, the noose around his neck.

197
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,800
It all kind of reads like, you know, when
you do a first table, read up a script,

198
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,480
you know, you're like, all right,
it's getting there to get he,

199
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:29,410
he should have workshop that a
little more. I would have gone,

200
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:35,360
would not have had the hat, wouldn't have
had the new [inaudible]. Oh, the news.

201
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,970
So whatever. You know what
it's like. It's like, you know,

202
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:39,160
when one of the starlight
goes out and they,

203
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,440
they accessorize too much and
then they go, you know what,

204
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,830
when it right before you go out,
take two things off.

205
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:45,940
Like that's what he should've done.

206
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,080
Should've got rid of the
news and the fucking hat.

207
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,010
Uh,
I don't get it.

208
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,830
The only thing that doesn't
make sense if this was fake,

209
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:01,831
like what kind of a fucking asshole
for 3,500 bucks is going to go to jail

210
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,730
and then have a hate crime on your
fucking record for the rest of your life?

211
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,430
I guess they were assuming that they
were going to get away with it. Um,

212
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,530
I dunno man. It's just the, I is
it weird? I feel bad for the guy.

213
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,330
It just reminds me when I was a kid and
I started lying to my parents and it

214
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:25,990
just fucking got out of
control and then it's so all,

215
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:29,740
you know what it reminds me
of. Okay. This is a true story.

216
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,430
I'm going to show you my,
my Jesse.

217
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:34,810
So we all got a little Jesse
similar smell let in us. Right.

218
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,290
Okay. So one time when I was in my
first year of first grade, right.

219
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,750
I loved it so much. I did it twice. Um,

220
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,330
when it came to school I was like,

221
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,930
that fucking hurdler who just hit the
first fucking hurdle and fell on his

222
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:56,470
goddamn face in the fucking race
was just over, you know, that was,

223
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:00,780
that was my school career. So anyways, um,

224
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,130
that was one of the
first jokes I ever wrote.

225
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,880
Talking about the second year of first
grade, how fucking boring it was.

226
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,820
Cause you learn how to read. You literally
learn how to read the first grade.

227
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:10,840
At least you did back then.

228
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,860
So I remember like the first three months
being bored out of my mind is these

229
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,980
kids with sounding out the words
they was sitting next to me,

230
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:22,981
go and look to Duh in my
joke am my hack was duck.

231
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,260
The word is duck to matter.
The picture didn't give it away.

232
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,330
That was my first really decent laugh.
I got my left and am I act it was,

233
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:35,260
it was clean.

234
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,340
People thought I was on my way to doing
the tonight show with Johnny Carson.

235
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,930
That's how long ago this
was. Um, so anyways,

236
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,840
I was in my first year of first
grade and there was these two twins.

237
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,060
All right. And I had a crush on
one of them. Her name was Gwen

238
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,470
and I can't remember the other
one's name. Right. And, uh,

239
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,430
so anyway, I think I might have told this
story before on the podcast. Right. But,

240
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:04,730
so we're fucking, um, Aman,

241
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,650
she's not in my class.

242
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,760
I'm in the other class with their sister
and her sister had this giant pink pen.

243
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,570
Like, I dunno why it was like, like if

244
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,260
it would be like the size of a number
two pencil for like fucking Andre the

245
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:23,850
giant. I don't know why she had the giant
thing and for whatever reason, you know,

246
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,160
I just looked at, I thought, I
dunno, I just looked different.

247
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:26,994
I thought it was cool.

248
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,180
So she dropped it on the floor and we
had like all four of our desks where were

249
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:31,170
like made into a circle.

250
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,770
She had like groups of four going around
the teacher and it fell on the fucking

251
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:37,230
floor.
And um,

252
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,800
I fucking picked it up. And like an idiot.
This is how dumb I was. I pick it up.

253
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,240
And rather than,
than just stealing it,

254
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,210
I just take it and I
start writing with it.

255
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,970
Like in the same fucking circle is her.
So she looks over at me and she goes, hey,

256
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:57,590
that's my pen. And I go,
no, it isn't a, it's mine.

257
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,660
So this is where my Jessie story
starts. If this guy's guilty, right.

258
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,190
And I stick with this fucking story. She
goes up to the teacher and she goes, hey,

259
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:12,290
you took my pen and I'm going,
no, it's not her pen. It's my pen.

260
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,270
It's a giant pink fucking pen.

261
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,610
And the teacher just looks at me and
she goes, you know, I think it's so,

262
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:22,100
it's so spent. I go,
no it isn't. It's mine.

263
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,760
And then she described this crack that
was in it, like to a t or whatever.

264
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,560
And of course I got busted
and the teacher's just
looking at me like, you know,

265
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,420
look at this little fucking Klepto Ron
Howard looking motherfucker. Right?

266
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,830
So what have, you know, you're a little
kid, you blow it off 10 minutes late,

267
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:42,220
you're probably talking to the person.
You just did that too. But anyways,

268
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,240
so the next day I go to school and
in between, like during the class,

269
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:48,410
I went to go to the bathroom.

270
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,920
It just so happened that go Gwyn that I
had the crush on. She just looks at me,

271
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,230
she goes,
I heard what you did to my sister.

272
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,470
She had his fucking look at her
face and she fucking hated me.

273
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,600
And I just turned around and walked away.
Heartbroken to the, uh, to the bathroom,

274
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,870
knowing that the first girl
I had a crush on now, no.

275
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:08,480
Said I'm a complete piece of shit.
Um,

276
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,660
and that was probably the first stepping
stone onto me becoming a fucking lonely

277
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:12,494
comedian.

278
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,510
I Dunno how that ties into this just
sees small lip at this. Oh my God.

279
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,870
He imagined it and that's a
fucking felony. I didn't know that.

280
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,490
Faking a police report.
The AG Ed. Yeah. He almost,

281
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,630
I'm satisfactory. They don't do that. Um,

282
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,690
I guess it makes sense to,

283
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,470
the cops will be pissed if
you fake something like all
the fucking work they got

284
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:39,240
to do.
You know what I mean?

285
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,300
Putting this whole God damn file together
and like this shit doesn't make sense.

286
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,230
It's like having write somebody
a term paper for you and
it's like, oh yeah, yeah,

287
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,470
yeah. Just fucking with you. I'm
not going to pay for that. And uh,

288
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,480
I'd never really had to do a term paper.

289
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,190
And what the fuck was I doing over here
for the last guy? Damn. Three weeks.

290
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:57,820
Okay.

291
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,740
Um, anyways, I got nothing to talk
about. I am so fucking lonely right now.

292
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,600
It's fucking ridiculous. Um,
but my, my, my wife and kid
are going to be flying out,

293
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,810
meet me soon. I can't wait.
Thank God for facetime.

294
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,830
All I do is sing baby shark.
Get my kid going. You know.

295
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:17,950
And then it's funny too is
I say this thing like she
always goes push the button,

296
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:21,430
push the button cause she wants to
hang up. So I just go, don't do it.

297
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,520
Don't push that button.
Don't push that.

298
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:28,180
But as she gets this big grin on her face,
she loves nothing more.

299
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,950
And right as I see her about radio laugh,

300
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:32,230
her face just disappears
and then I become sad.

301
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:35,921
Anyways,

302
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:40,750
Karl Lagerfeld died according
to the New York Post.

303
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,130
Jesus Christ.
I know that.

304
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:46,870
How sad and pathetic as this podcasts
right now is saying it's his cat might get

305
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:50,940
millions. I gotta be honest with
you. Think I trashed fat people.

306
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:55,020
You should see fucking Karl Lagerfeld,
Lara field, whatever his fucking name is.

307
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,810
Um,
he's just what he was,

308
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:02,500
I guess he was at a fashion giant and
he was very impressed with himself. Um,

309
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,881
all right.

310
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:07,881
Somebody is about to get a golden litter
box among those who could inherit a big

311
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,740
hunk of the designer.
Karl Lagerfeld's,

312
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,690
$125 million fortune is
the love of his law life.

313
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,760
His celebrity cat
is it shall pay.

314
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:24,540
Is that how you say show pet? Is that
an American would say chill pet show,

315
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,450
pay all,
um,

316
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:32,570
Lagerfeld 85 who die Tuesday in Paris
made it clear in the past that his Blue

317
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,250
Wide Berman Kitty meant so much to him.

318
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,320
Yeah.

319
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,170
Uh, that she would find a
place in his will. Yeah.

320
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:42,020
We probably knew like this
dude cats live like 18 years.

321
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,450
You get one when you're 71 or whatever.
No wait,

322
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:46,760
he was 85 probably got this
thing when he was like 80.

323
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,760
He's probably be like, well this thing
just going to get fucking put down.

324
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:54,550
That's not going to happen.
It's guys a good shit. You know?

325
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:58,660
I know he trashed fat people in short
men and all of that type of stuff.

326
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:00,580
I thought he was fucking hilarious.
You know,

327
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:03,310
there's a few people out there that I
think should have been stand up comedians

328
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:05,950
instead of what they did,
even though they were wildly successful.

329
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,880
Like both those brothers
that are in oasis,

330
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,870
I half the shit I read that they say I
like this shit's funnier than anything

331
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:14,770
I've ever fucking said.

332
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,290
These guys really should put down
their fucking Ukuleles and shit.

333
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,050
They should go on a fucking standup tour.

334
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,890
I'm not saying I don't love their music,
I'm just saying,

335
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,060
and this Karl Lagerfeld, some of the
shit that this guy said, it's like,

336
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,910
just look up at this guy's quotes.

337
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,540
Okay.

338
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,740
He was, he, he was like so
fucking mean. It's funny,

339
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,000
you know,

340
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
unless you live here and then you're
triggered and then everything needs to

341
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:45,050
stop.
And we up the fucking

342
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,090
okay.

343
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,360
Do you know I have a friend of mine,
somebody said to words said, uh,

344
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,220
okay.

345
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,980
You know, hey, you know,
I'm really hungry. I'm going
to go get something to eat.

346
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:58,380
And she wrote back, she goes,
me too. And then she wrote,

347
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,000
not me too with like the Hashtag. Hahaha.
And then the friend got all offended.

348
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:07,790
Like, that isn't funny. You
shouldn't joke about that if we joke,

349
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,440
but it's like we're doing in between
each other. You're a fucking idiot.

350
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,540
Nothing's happening here.

351
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,190
And she literally had to talk this
person off of a fucking emotional ad,

352
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,700
like ledge. That's where we're at. Okay.

353
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,350
That's where we're at in
this country right now.

354
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,980
And maybe that's why in
this current comedy climate,

355
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,840
somebody like this fucking poor bastard
decided to fucking fake this goddamn

356
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,470
thing. I guess. You know what?

357
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:34,410
They give you a shit cause they could
actually be out there solving real crimes.

358
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:37,650
They you go build that only took your
fucking 20 minutes to figure out,

359
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,780
okay,

360
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,270
oh I could have been working
on this domestic violence case,

361
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:46,340
but I was this and there are also
probably had like this high level of like

362
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,360
priority
Jesus Christ.

363
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,720
Is this going to make a
great made for TV movie?

364
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,133
You know what?

365
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,960
I think considering magnum Pi
is not a white guy anymore.

366
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,670
I'm throwing my hat in the ring to play
Jessie Smollett in this, uh, you know,

367
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:07,890
just a ballad shit out.
All right.

368
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,820
If a, why didn't they give, why didn't
they give magnum a new fucking Ferrari?

369
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:16,510
Why is he still driving around in that
fucking thing? You know, that's one of,

370
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,710
there was one of the worst
Ferrari's ever made. Why can,

371
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:22,760
why can't she give the guy a
nice ride? You know? Does that,

372
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:27,380
does that make sense to anybody? I was
so far. I mean I liked it. It was a nice,

373
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:30,590
cool, that should be like his fucking
weekend driver. You know what I mean?

374
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,060
Like that was his high school car.
So he kept it or maybe like, I dunno,

375
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,410
maybe Tom Selleck fucking saved him
from drowning when he was a kid.

376
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,490
Right after he banged that
chicken, the bikini, you know,
from the opening credits.

377
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,610
Then he's like, oh look at this. I was
bagging you hear in the sand and there's,

378
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:49,460
there's a little fucking kid out. They're
drowning. When are you saved them?

379
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,490
He takes them in now they'll world
don't move to the beat of just one drum.

380
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,780
We're stuck here on this island,
but we're having fun. Right.

381
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,830
Right in the friary you can
sit on the fucking console.

382
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,270
Cause I got some hot ass sitting
in the passengers to see, um,

383
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,860
then he could have taken
over the business. Right.
You just have Tom sell x, uh,

384
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,230
you know, his character dies. How I
would've done it. His character is dying.

385
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,220
You know, you make it like
somehow like a hot button issue.

386
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,330
Like he dies of like a, I don't,
I don't know what prostate can't,

387
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:32,220
nobody gives a shit about prostate cancer.
He dies of male breast cancer. Okay.

388
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,383
In October.

389
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,780
And the NFL recognizes it by having pink
mustaches put on top of that helmets,

390
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:41,640
like looking like Lyft drivers.
Okay.

391
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,130
In his dying words are tells this kid
to take over the business and he's like,

392
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:51,090
and I want you to take care of my
car. Made sure she's okay. Right.

393
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,060
So on very special assignments.
No,

394
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:59,500
whenever he takes a woman out on the
show, you know, I'm sorry, a warrior,

395
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,450
a brave, courageous, so brave
to get in those tee tops.

396
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,680
Uh, that t top car and then he just takes
them up on it. But the rest of the show,

397
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:11,590
he has a brand new fucking Ferrari,
you know,

398
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,480
they chases people down in the street.

399
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:15,340
And that's how I would
have done it personally.

400
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,093
Okay.

401
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,640
I don't want, I don't want to, you
know, I'm not trashing the show,

402
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,190
I'm just saying, you know, it's a
network show. I know you got the budget.

403
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,680
You could have hooked the
guy up with a new Ferrari.

404
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,220
Okay.

405
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,300
Right. I Dunno. I'd probably taken all
this shit to fucking seriously. Yeah,

406
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,880
I watched that show. I didn't know. I
didn't know what was up. What was down.

407
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,800
Higgins is a woman now. I, I don't
get it. That's like the new thing.

408
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,380
You just do something that's already done,

409
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:49,000
but then you just switch everything
up. Yeah. This used to be a black guy.

410
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,790
Now it's a parrot. This was a white guy.
Now he's Puerto Rican. This was a guy,

411
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,540
now it's a woman and a,
it's the same fucking shell.

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,290
You know what they're doing right now.

413
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,040
They're doing what Hanna Barbera did
with all of their fucking cartoons with

414
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,740
Hanna Barbera. God bless them
because they did Johnny quest,

415
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,570
my favorite fucking cartoon of all time.

416
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,100
But those motherfuckers plagiarize
themselves like 58 fucking times.

417
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,150
They had the Scooby Doo than
they are the Scooby Doo rip off.

418
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,850
They had the Flintstones,
which was a rip off of the honeymooners,

419
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,680
and it was just placed in the stone age.

420
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,330
And then they did the sort of did
the same fucking show and the future.

421
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,320
What the Jetsons,

422
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,540
I forgot I had this all mapped out
how they fucking rip themselves off.

423
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:37,280
And then in the end they combined all of
their characters and had these cartoon

424
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:41,780
Olympics called the laugh Olympics,
but somewhere. But it was all worth it.

425
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,750
It was all worth it because at jinx
the cat and uh, and Johnny quest.

426
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,060
All right. And with that, let me
read a, let me read this here.

427
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,990
A quip,

428
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,000
one of the most important things we do
for our health every day is brushing our

429
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:02,030
teeth.
Yet most of us don't do it properly.

430
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,050
How do you not do it properly? I
mean, it's fucking, it's right there.

431
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,810
Slide your tongue across your teeth. Does
it feel gross? Which one feels gross?

432
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:16,811
Brush that one extra quip is a better
electric toothbrush created by dentists

433
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,070
and designers. Finally, they consulted
the dentist. They got the pros in there.

434
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,700
Quip was designed to make brushing
your teeth more simple, affordable,

435
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:30,530
and even enjoyable.
I love this sensitive sonic vibrations.

436
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,890
Sorry, I have to do the sound effects
here. This is a very low budget.

437
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:36,770
Read gentle enough on your sensitive gums.

438
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,100
Why people brush too hard and some
electric toothbrushes are too abrasive.

439
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,080
They could explain that better.
If you brushed too hard,

440
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:48,230
you're actually going to
slowly wear away your gumline,

441
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,820
which is going to lead to way a,

442
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:55,821
a periodontal issue because what happens
is is that a namel is on the party,

443
00:25:56,871 --> 00:26:01,390
a tooth that that lives above the gum.
All right below your gum,

444
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:05,150
it doesn't have any enamel because
it's supposed to be covered by the gum.

445
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:09,650
It's protected there, so then when
you start brushing too hard, um,

446
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,580
you wear that away and eventually that
part gets exposed and it's way more

447
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:17,540
susceptible to tooth decay.
Then what happens is eventually you're,

448
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,620
you're looking at a crown or a root
canal or God forbid you lose a tooth.

449
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,960
Now when you lose a tooth,
okay,

450
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:27,500
you have to go to the fucking dentist and
you have to get something put in there

451
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,820
because what happens is,

452
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,500
is the teeth next to it move to the side
to try to close up the space and the

453
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:38,501
tooth directly below it will erupt upwards
to fill in that fucking space to help

454
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:41,570
fill it in.
And then when it erupts upwards,

455
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:45,390
you got that party a tooth that doesn't
an AML on it and that's exposed and then

456
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:48,480
you lose that fucking tooth and then
everybody starts fucking moving around.

457
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,300
Yeah,

458
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,000
it's a fucking shit show.
You know what it's like.

459
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:55,790
You ever seen those special forces?
When they did,

460
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,200
they got a hold the fucking log up to
become like an army ranger and if one guy

461
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,650
fucking quits,
then they all the other fucking guys,

462
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:06,590
then they have to hold his weight
up. They don't get to quit. Right?

463
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,820
It's kind of the same thing.
But anyways,

464
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:14,900
it's a builtin two minute timer that
pulses every 30 seconds to remind you when

465
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,160
to switch sides,

466
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,920
helping guide of full and even clean so
you can be an absolute fucking moron and

467
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:26,480
do it properly. Uh, up to 90% of us
don't brush for a full two minutes.

468
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,200
I guess I don't,
I guess I'm a moron or don't clean evenly.

469
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,240
A multiuse cover mounts to your mirror
and announced to slide over your bristle

470
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,650
a four on the go. Brushing.
Say why you love quip.

471
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,630
I love quip cause they're paying me
to say it. That's why I love quip. No,

472
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:46,160
I love anything.
Anybody to be honest with you.

473
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:47,660
Anybody that's helping you
take care of your teeth.

474
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:50,780
It's a number one fucking thing.
So number one, God damn thing,

475
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:51,980
you take care of your teeth.

476
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,060
Like I like what you're going to
do for yourself in life. All right?

477
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,760
You chew your food properly.
You don't have your fucking teeth,

478
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,160
you're not going to do that.
It leads to stomach problems,

479
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:03,740
leaves the gun problems,
then he got problems in your ass.

480
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,520
And next thing you know, people are
coming by on your deathbed. All right.

481
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,930
Or he could just buy this toothbrush.

482
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,160
That's why I love quip and why
they're backed by over 20,000 dental

483

491
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,350
um,
is that it?

492
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,940
Is that all that I had to talk
about tonight? I will be a,

493
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,570
I'll be at the west side comedy club
doing a little bit of time. Nothing crazy,

494
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,230
but I'm just going to be doing my set
until I fly over to jolly old England.

495
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,490
Make sure it's ready to go. And, uh,
I'm starting to get butterflies, man.

496
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:09,230
I'm like go almost a week out.

497
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,710
Monday will be a week out and I'm
getting ready to take this thing and I am

498
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,820
very, uh, anxious to do it
in a good way. I'm nervous,

499
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:25,770
but in a good way. And um, I dunno.
I can't, I can't fucking wait.

500
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,890
I cannot fucking wait and I'm
gonna run the set tonight.

501
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,270
What else did I want to talk
about? Ah, fuck. I just had it.

502
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,690
Yeah.

503
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,150
See that you haven't, and it
just goes away. You know why?

504
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,530
Cause I don't brush properly.

505
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,820
If I did two total when I brushed
my brain wouldn't be fucking Mush,

506
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,260
I guess. I have no fucking idea. Um,
anyways, and it was fucking hilarious.

507
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,311
It's not really hilarious.

508
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,340
I was walking up the street and I was in
a good mood and shit and there was this

509
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:57,670
homeless person and she goes,
can you spare some change or whatever?

510
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,820
And I was like, yeah, I can. So I
still say I might give a chance.

511
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:03,840
I don't have any change. I'll give a
dollar. So as I was reaching in to, uh,

512
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,500
give our dollar, I would, I, you know,

513
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,070
I felt weird because I was just standing
there. So I was just like, hey, you know,

514
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,720
how's it going?
I said,

515
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,250
how's it go into a fucking homeless
person? And she just answered me honestly.

516
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:18,460
She's like, well, I'm living in a shelter.
My Dad died. And I was like, all right.

517
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:23,440
All right. Dumb question. Kind of a
fucking idiot in my, you know, so I,

518
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,510
I enjoy and living on the street that
everything you thought it was going to be,

519
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,830
you know, I don't really think, when I
say before he speak a lot of the times,

520
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:40,180
and then I say it, and as it's coming up,
I'm like, why did I say that? You know?

521
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,060
But the good thing that I
have is I know I'm a moron.

522
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,050
I like to think this is one of my
better qualities is I know I'm a moron.

523
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,650
So as the person is fucking saying,
why did you say that?

524
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:53,230
I'm already agreeing with them. Like
I know, you're right. You're right.

525
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,340
I was stupid. So anyways, um,

526
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,910
I hoped as Jesse Smollett guy
somehow makes it come back.

527
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,520
If this is all true, IOB makes it come
back from this fucking shit. Jesus Christ.

528
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,460
You hate to see. Hate to see
it. Yeah. Hate to see it.

529
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:13,930
I've seen other people do shit like
this. It's just, I just, he fucking knew.

530
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,130
It's so fucking embarrassing.

531
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,530
It's fucking crazy to take
it to that lack of CIF.

532
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:27,890
He just did this amongst your
friends, you know, just tired.

533
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:30,500
One of your friends to punch you in the
lip and then you walk into a party got

534
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:34,130
jumped, but it fought him off. Oh my God.
He's so heroic. And next thing you know,

535
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:36,110
you're getting blown.
You know,

536
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,910
I can see the method to that madness,
but to take it to this fucking level,

537
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,920
you get to these fucking eight Gig,

538
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,970
come over the little fucking little
brush and they start Dustin Shit.

539
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,020
It's all going gonna fall apart.
There's security cameras.

540
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,470
You can't get away with shit.
And now all these fucking people,

541
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,300
they're sending their DNA into these
God damn things. It's, it's, it's,

542
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,820
it's a fucking rap.
It's a fucking rap.

543
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:07,010
Put my man, man voice back
on here. It is a fucking rap.

544
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:10,250
You're not going to be able to do shit.
And I'm at,

545
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:12,760
I'm not defended people doing
really crazy shit, but I mean,

546
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:15,530
you're not gonna be able to do shit.
You know what I mean?

547
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:20,210
Steal a Christmas tree sophomore at shit.
Right.

548
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,490
Go around knocking people's fucking
mailboxes off with a baseball bat.

549
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,220
Stupid Shit. Yeah. None of
that. It's all going to be,

550
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:32,970
there'll be a fucking drone following you
around suddenly had some in the future.

551
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:33,541
I swear to God,

552
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:36,240
these robots are going to show up at this
little dusty fucking things no matter

553
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:39,130
what. No matter what you do. Hmm.

554
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,360
You are at that parking meter
for all for 30 seconds more.

555
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,810
Here is your ticket. But I got out
of there before a cop came. Shut up.

556
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:52,700
We will eliminate you. Speaking of
eliminates from the first mammal.

557
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,680
I don't even know what it was.

558
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:58,520
This little field mouse became
extinct because of global warming.

559
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,360
Human caused global fucking warming.
Ah.

560
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,320
Was the news going to talk about that?
Going to talk about that?

561
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,780
That I talk about it. Nah, talk
you about it in the end. I Dunno.

562
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,370
I Dunno what the fucking solution is,
but I do know this.

563
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,170
When the water rises
up your flat screen TV,

564
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,020
you better get some flotation
devices for it. You know,

565
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,680
you know it going to survive all
the people that live in the middle,

566
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,000
middle of the country, as the water rises
up, they're going to fucking survive.

567
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,290
You know,

568
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,780
and that's going to be hilarious watching
all the liberals who think they're so

569
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:36,950
fucking smart running from for the
fucking oceans rising, you know,

570
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,710
and they're trying to hang out with
all these gator done fucking people.

571
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,600
All right. That's a
reality show that I, I,

572
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,630
that's not going to have to
be scripted. Um, anyways,

573
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:50,410
why do I end up with such dark shit?
I always do this when I'm fucking alone.

574
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,630
I just started thinking about the end
of the world and I guess I just saying I

575
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:58,280
missed my family. All right, I'm going to
stop babbling. Um, God bless all of you.

576
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:02,210
Enjoy your weekend, your
fucking conch. And I will, uh,

577
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:04,490
I will check in on you are our guests.
I Dunno.

578
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,120
I'll do another fucking Monday
morning podcast as I do.

579
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,390
I've got to figure out when to do it.
I don't know where I'll be.

580
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:13,880
I think I'll be in England by then.
Who knows?

581
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:16,050
Maybe I'll put on a phony accent for you,
Huh?

582
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,810
Failure. Deserve it. Kidding.
Of course. All right. That's
it. Please enjoy the music.

583
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,990
And then we have another half hour of a
Thursday afternoon just before Friday.

584
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:28,950
Monday morning podcast, greatest
hit episode. All right, that's it.

585
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,980
[inaudible]

586
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,100
Hey, what's going on? It's pilfer and it
is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

587
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,900
February 21st,
2011 I can't say that.

588
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:26,190
2011,

589
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,400
2011 fucking tongue gets
stuck to the roof of my mouth.

590
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,610
2011 say,
um,

591
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,220
yes. What is up? It's Sunday afternoon.
I am doing this podcast because I,

592
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:41,641
I am.

593
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:45,480
I am committed to finally getting these
things up Monday morning all around the

594
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:48,540
world. Unless you live in
Japan, but if you live in Japan,

595
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,950
you can't understand what the fuck I'm
saying unless you are a US troop and

596
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:52,980
you're stationed over there.

597
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,430
At which point I don't know what
the fuck to tell you. All right,

598
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,260
what am I supposed to do?

599
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:01,380
Nobody in Australia complaints
and there's 17 hours ahead of me.

600
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,130
So standout son.
Um,

601
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,750
I have a big day ahead of me.
The NBA, all star game is, is,

602
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,930
is fucking at the staple center staple
center home of the Los Angeles Lakers and

603
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:21,000
there are 11 championship banners and
then that one banner with all those ones

604
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:22,050
from the BBA.

605
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,600
So anyways, you got to be
saying to yourself, hey bill,
you're a big sports fan.

606
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,270
Are you going to go to the game?
Yes I am.

607
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,910
I am going to go to the game.

608
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:38,760
Can you fucking believe it
kind of came out of nowhere.

609
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:40,110
All of a sudden I had a hookup.

610
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,790
Somebody came through with a ticket
and I said, apps a Fuckin lutely.

611
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:48,180
Somebody I know came through with the
fucking ticket for the entire all star

612
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:52,920
weekend yesterday for the three
point contest and the Dunkin contest.

613
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:57,660
He said, it starts at five 30 I'm like,
fuck, I'm flying back from New Jersey.

614
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,620
I land right about six and the
guy's like, God, just come on over.

615
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:04,140
You'll get to catch the last
half fit. I said, great.

616
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,400
I go to get on my flight chief
and he very full flight people.

617
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:12,450
If you could nudge skin in the aisle,

618
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,680
could you just can't find your seats
so we can expedite the fucking playable

619
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:20,220
blub, the turmeric. And I'm sitting there
going, let's go. People, fuck, come on,

620
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,910
sit down, sit down. Let's go. I finally
got a hookup. Let's do something.

621
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,910
Let's get this bitch off the ground.
And one of the,

622
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,250
what's the first thing that they say?
I'm praying,

623
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,370
praying for a nice 200 mile an hour
tail wind or whatever the fuck I need to

624
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,070
shave off a half hour, this son
of a bitch. And what do they say?

625
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,050
They say we have a very full flight and
a captain got on and he starts talking

626
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:48,051
about how there's some fucking biblical
level headwind that's going to slow down

627
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,500
the plane, but we can try and make
a potassium in a different altitude.

628
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,650
Didn't happen.
They always,

629
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:59,250
they always say that this fucking flight
is going to be about six hours and 15

630
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:01,380
minutes. All right? It doesn't take,

631
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:05,250
that takes about five and a half hours
with the usual goddamn headwind. Okay?

632
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:09,750
But they'd say six hours and 15 minutes
just in case there's a delay, you know,

633
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,250
take off or landing or whatever.

634
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:14,130
They can still say that they're
on time and if there's no delay,

635
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,400
then they can be like, hey, we got
you in here about 20 minutes early.

636
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,610
Like we can't do the fucking math.
Like we don't know what they're doing.

637
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:26,370
So it turns out this is fucking insane
headwind and an ends up taking seven

638
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,080
fucking hours to get to lax.
And by the time I landed,

639
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,020
I didn't even want to go.
I didn't even give a shit.

640
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:37,840
My fucking knees were fucking
behind my shoulders at that point.

641
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:42,520
Just cramped in there, you know an
idea. I said, fuck gives a shit.

642
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,800
You know that Dunkin contest.
I can watch all of that on Youtube,

643
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:52,360
but I'm still going to the
fucking game. Um, and I'm psyched.

644
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,990
I've never been to an all star
game before. Never ever, ever.

645
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,810
And I'm psyched to stand there
and look at all the celebrities.

646
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:02,440
They're going to be there
and all they had bitches. Ha.

647
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,720
I don't want to see the wives.
I want to see that bitches.

648
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:09,400
I want to see they are gold. Dig and
fucking horse. That's what I want to see.

649
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,850
Fuck the NBA players.
I don't give a shit about them.

650
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,500
Bunch of God Damn Weirdos. You're all
six foot 10. You should be able to dunk.

651
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,320
All right?
And you look weird in street clothes.

652
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,760
You ever see an NBA player in a suit?
You know, we, it looks like that.

653
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,180
It looks like they have like giantism
of something. They don't look right.

654
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:32,350
They don't look right unless they're in
a tank top and shorts standing next to

655
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:34,430
another guy who's also
six foot fucking tense.

656
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,480
I don't give a shit about those guys.
They don't give a fuck about me. Right.

657
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,200
I'm there to see the gold digging whores.

658
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,160
I want to see that whole
fucking game going down.

659
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,560
Right? Okay. It's the all star game,
so you know all these celebrities,

660
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:53,650
they got to bring that bottom bitch to
that one. They got to bring their wife.

661
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,600
They got to bring this serious girlfriend.

662
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,330
That's what the fuck they have to bring.
All right.

663
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,720
Yeah.

664
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,470
She's in the pride,
but on the outside,

665
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,560
little fucking hygiene is trying to
steal a little piece of meat. Right.

666
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,200
That's going to be all the horse.
That's the game. I, that's,

667
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,120
that's the fucking game
I'm going to be watching.

668
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,740
I want to see what
ridiculous fucking outfit.

669
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,040
Yeah.

670
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,630
The gold dig and horror is gonna is
gonna fucking be wearing the length that

671
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:24,530
she's going to have to go to,
to get this,

672
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,410
these fucking multimillionaires.

673
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:33,290
To notice him right in front of their
fucking wife. I can't wait. I cannot wait.

674
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:39,030
You know what? I got an idea how bad it
takes. Some pictures. I'll take some, ah,

675
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:39,864
I can't do that.

676
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,590
That goes against everything that
I'm about. I can't fucking do.

677
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:45,920
I can't rat out people. I can't wait.
That's what, that's what I want to see.

678
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:51,550
I want to see that and absolutely no
defense. You know, one 72, one 68 games.

679
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:55,250
It's going to be fucking awesome.
I can't wait and uh, and that's it.

680
00:40:55,251 --> 00:40:59,780
So believe it or not, I'm actually in
a great mood. I had an awesome weekend.

681
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,880
I have no funny stories to tell
everything. Everything worked out.

682
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,770
I did the Tarrytown, a music
hall in Tarrytown, New York.

683
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,420
Beautiful,
beautiful,

684
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,830
full, lovely, safe, creepy, scary,

685
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,190
widest fucking town ever. You guys
ever been to West Chester, New York?

686
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,520
There is a level of wealth,

687
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,790
a level of whiteness and a level of
overall piece yet unbelievable fucking

688
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,630
to that part of the country. I can
see I'm tried. I tried to explain,

689
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,420
I was talking about it on stage and
people will laugh and I couldn't tell if

690
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:44,870
they were just laughing because I was
in that town making fun of it. But like

691
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,130
Terry towns, like ridiculous.
It's like these, these,

692
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,460
I mean you could shoot a period piece
there, some Charles Dickens novel.

693
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:57,200
If you ever wanted to
turn it into a movie,

694
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,210
you could very easily just remove all
the cars and just dress everybody up.

695
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:06,600
Like it was a 17 or 18 hundreds and just
have him going up the street and a God

696
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:08,480
damn horse so it wouldn't be a
fucking prom. Put it this way.

697
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,460
The next town over is sleepy hollow.
All right. Headless Horseman Shit. Okay.

698
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:15,380
And right next to that
as the Hudson River.

699
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,530
Okay.

700
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,860
All right. And which is eerily quiet
at night and a little bit south.

701
00:42:20,861 --> 00:42:24,220
You've got the Tappan Zee bridge, the
whole thing. It looks like you're on.

702
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:27,610
You feel like you're on a movie set.
That's what I was joking about,

703
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:31,480
that everything just felt so wonderful,
peaceful and safe.

704
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:34,420
And you felt every time
you turned a corner,

705
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:38,500
you felt that there was just going to
be like a hundred zombies just standing

706
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:41,080
there and then they'd look at you.
You don't, when they get that,

707
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:44,320
that excitement that they see fresh
meat and I don't know what happened to

708
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:46,150
zombies,
but all of a sudden they can run now,

709
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:49,930
which is pretty fucking awesome unless
you're getting chased by one. Um,

710
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,390
that was the vibe of, of, uh, of
Terry town. But I went in and I did,

711
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,530
did my show. And you've got to understand
like I did that theater like five,

712
00:42:59,531 --> 00:43:04,360
six years ago as part of a tour
for the Montreal comedy festival.

713
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,010
And I was on that tour with like,
like six or seven other comedians.

714
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:10,810
So all I got to do was like 15 minutes.

715
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:13,930
And I remember I was excited then
to be doing it. And you know,

716
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,120
you start thinking like,
man,

717
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:20,920
am I ever going to be able to play this
place on my own? Was fucking awesome.

718
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,720
I showed up and the place was
packed and then the next night was,

719
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,790
uh, the count Basie theater
in Red Bank, New Jersey.

720
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:35,170
And that place was gigantic. And
the second, you know, we booked it.

721
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:37,810
I was paranoid that they're going to have
to cancel it or I don't think it only

722
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:42,490
be like half fucking full. And that one
ended up fucking selling out. And, uh,

723
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,130
so I just want to thank everybody and
creepy ass Tarrytown, sleepy hollow,

724
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:52,860
Westchester County who
showed up to my gig. Um,

725
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,520
and everybody out in New Jersey now,

726
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:56,860
people fucking sleep on
New Jersey by the way.

727
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,030
Okay.

728
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:58,690
You know,

729
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,930
because all they do is they come out of
Manhattan and they jump on the Jersey

730
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:05,960
turnpike and they see all those
chemical fucking plants and uh,

731
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,800
and they just think it's, it's a
shit hole. But I'm telling you,

732
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:12,340
there's some absolutely gorgeous
parts of it. And Red Bank,

733
00:44:12,341 --> 00:44:15,470
New Jersey was one of
them. Like, I saw you.

734
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,450
Have you ever seen what a $20 million
home looks like? You know, live.

735
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,770
I've never seen it. It's, it's,

736
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,880
it's like these fucking people
live in houses as big as schools

737
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,450
and you know, and as much as they were
and as much as I was in awe of them,

738
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,630
I just remember thinking,
how could you possibly do,

739
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,610
have done anything remotely
legal to get that fucking house,

740
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,290
you know, I'm telling you, I swear to God,

741
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,260
I bet 90% of them were
bankers and people in finance.

742
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,450
I'm telling you.
And then the other will be like the,

743
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,460
Oh that guy created a then the mutant
Ninja turtles for something huge.

744
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,570
But other than that,
if you're just a regular fucking person,

745
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,300
the only way to make that
kind of fucking money

746
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,420
is you've got to be in banking.

747
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,450
Okay.

748
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:18,100
Fucking genius. Whoever came up with
the idea of a bank, hey everybody,

749
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:21,730
you guys work all week and then you
give you money to me. All right.

750
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:26,320
Then I'll pull it all together and I'll
loan it back to yet interests and then

751
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:29,770
you give me more money on that while
you continue to give me all your other

752
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:32,770
money every fucking week.
Don't worry, I'll keep it safe.

753
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,940
You piece of Shit,
mother Fucker fucking kidding me.

754
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,080
Well, how do you justify, how do
you earn enough fucking money?

755
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:43,490
Yeah,

756
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,380
I could see if Derek Jeter had one
of those houses. I get it. I get it.

757
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,480
He fucking shows up to a stadium
and 60,000 people show up.

758
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,850
What did they go? What
happened if they said, hey,

759
00:45:55,851 --> 00:45:58,280
a bankers giving a
lecture at Yankee Stadium.

760
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:02,940
How many fucking people you think
would show up fucking asshole?

761
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:07,380
He probably couldn't even fill
up the stress factory. You know?

762
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,590
That's what I swear to God. That's,
that's, that's my feeling when, when I,

763
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,260
the few times that I've gotten
into those types of areas,

764
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:22,261
I drive by them and I am an absolute
fucking awe of the level of wealth.

765
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,560
And then that's immediately what I think.
Like there's no fucking way,

766
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,040
there's no legal fucking way to do this.

767
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:37,050
You know, take it from
me, take it from me.

768
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,650
I'm doing all right now. You know,
selling out theaters. Let me you,

769
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,950
you should see the laws that they have
to make sure that I don't get rich.

770
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:49,140
They are just dead, taken a fucking
machete to my knees right now.

771
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,580
When we do an impression of my,

772
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:57,610
of me talking to my account
and every quarter what Joe,

773
00:46:57,741 --> 00:47:00,680
you gotta be, you know something
to this fucking country. That's,

774
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,080
that's 0.3 seconds.

775
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,260
But I get it. I get it. We're
fighting to fucking wars.

776
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:11,600
Somebody's got to pay for it
and can be those rich country.

777
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,660
Jesus fucking Christ.
Anyways,

778
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,600
fuck was I talking about? Yeah. You
know what it's like, it's like that,

779
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:23,850
that president over there in Egypt,
you know,

780
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:26,800
he was like a bank.

781
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,450
He had all their fucking money and it
was just sitting there. He took it.

782
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:34,660
Of course he took it, you know
something. I'm not even mad at bankers.

783
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:38,740
I'm not even fucking mad at him because
I think, well, I don't know. I can't,

784
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:42,070
I can't say money.
That isn't the thing that gets me going.

785
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,110
Women, I would say that you got to
pick your weakness. Some people,

786
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,410
your weaknesses, money, some
people your weaknesses. Power.

787
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:54,420
Mine is the fucking Bra.

788
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,393
Okay.

789
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,420
I'll tell you right now,

790
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:03,150
if making people laugh ever gets me
to the level of being a dictator,

791
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,470
there is no fucking way I'm going to be
able to remain faithful. I will have,

792
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:12,330
who was, do you understand me? People I
will have fucking who was listening to me.

793
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:17,420
I'm going to the fucking NBA All
star game tonight. All right. And um,

794
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:17,820
it's,

795
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,820
I'm more excited to see the level of gold
dig and fucking whore that's going to

796
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:27,780
show up the temptresses.
I can't wait.

797
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,380
I cannot fucking wait to see how high up
you have to Jackie a fucking ass up to

798
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,870
get noticed at the all star game.
Cause you know,

799
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:39,950
every horror out there is she's
going, what? The fucking four,

800
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,820
five inch Goddamn stilettos.
Ah,

801
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:49,330
walking down those, those, those fucking,
you know, they're all going to be sitting,

802
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:54,560
you know where to gold digging whores.
Sit. The wives sit court side, they sit,

803
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,571
they sit in a group.

804
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,990
You've ever noticed that they all
keep the wives all you know, together.

805
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,790
It's a very smart move by the men,
you know,

806
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:01,990
cause you've got a
bunch of women together.

807
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,510
Eventually they're just going
to be running their mouths.

808
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,070
They're not gonna be
paying attention to shit.

809
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:11,170
I don't think I'll be doing that shit
while the fucking games going on.

810
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:15,280
They don't give a shit, right.
I'd say the gold digging whores,

811
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:21,930
I'm going to say that they're going to
start at about row about 20 maybe 21 it's

812
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:27,970
a more believable number,
right? 20 was to even, you know,

813
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,380
row 23 that's where they're
going to start. All right,

814
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,360
and that's going to be like
the gold digging whores,

815
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,380
gold digging whore. You know what I
mean? Like the quarterbacks, quarterback,

816
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:42,460
the comic's comic,

817
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:48,150
the whores whore is going to be at
the NBA All star game already banging

818
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,843
somebody.

819
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:50,940
Yeah.

820
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,470
Already hooked up.
She's going to be about road 20 right?

821
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,930
She's already going to guilt it.
Somebody down there,

822
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,110
somebody connected that you know,

823
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:04,920
how come your wife is sitting
seven rows in front of me. Hey,

824
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:09,330
I got to do what I got to fucking do
and don't worry. I'll make it up to you.

825
00:50:09,331 --> 00:50:12,750
So she already has something shiny
coming her fucking way. All right.

826
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,700
And then you go back. You get what
you go it while staple San Jose.

827
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,120
Weird where it's kind of the
haves the have nots, you know,

828
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:22,740
see if he get to the upper deck, those
are like the open miker horse. All right?

829
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,010
That's someone who just
fucking blew somebody in a
ticket booth to get up to the

830
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:32,560
300 fucking level. All right? So
what they gonna do is they're basic,

831
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:37,450
you're going to be dressed
hot for ah, you know, I dunno.

832
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:42,050
They're going to be update
with the fucking uh, potato
skin. Eaton Sports Bar Guy,

833
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,880
right?
The season ticket holder assumption.

834
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:46,490
I don't know what the fuck I'm consulting
is kind of unraveling all I know.

835
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,130
It's just going to be a bunch of
fucking horse down there and I can't,

836
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,140
I can't wait to look at them.

837
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:58,500
No, I've, I've come to this level
in life where I really, I'm,

838
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:02,060
I don't judge people. I know I'm saying
horrors and gold digging a I, you know,

839
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,600
I know I'm saying that Shit, but I'm
not in a judgmental way. The same thing.

840
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:09,410
I don't judge that. The, the,
the fucking piece of shit.

841
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,350
I guess that's judgemental. But you
know, whatever. I'm a piece of shit.

842
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:15,410
The piece of shit guy who was a
running shit over there in Egypt,

843
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:21,730
you know I get why he stole
all that fucking money

844
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,070
cause it was right there.
You know

845
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,400
is right fucking there.
I mean,

846
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,090
until you are in that
position where you're,

847
00:51:36,091 --> 00:51:41,091
you're at that level of temptation
till you faced it and passed that test.

848
00:51:41,941 --> 00:51:44,790
You can't judge that guy.
Can you imagine that?

849
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:48,370
Just a mountain of cash just sitting
right to the righty. A lazy boy.

850
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,510
You're like a big bowl of fucking
m and m's and you guys out there.

851
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:54,360
I got your little fucking m and
m's right next to your TV chair.

852
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,450
How many of those deed and night,
you know,

853
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:00,300
you ever tell yourself this
is the last handful get done.

854
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,600
You can go right back for more.
You have a get it so fucking,

855
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:07,400
you know you're doing that thing where
you're making the fist and then you'd get

856
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:11,700
fucking dropping them out of the bottom
of your fist. You know, like some fucking,

857
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:17,220
I dunno what, like some goddamn guppy
feeding at the top of a fish tank.

858
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:24,940
Uh, we're all gluttonous assholes and
I'm, I'm, I'm right up there with them.

859
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:28,200
I read with the fucking point was,
I'm just telling you I'm excited.

860
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:32,100
I'm going to this fucking game.
Uh, that's 17 minutes, 17 minutes.

861
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,830
How many fucks was that sir?
Um,

862
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,760
all right,
let's get on with the podcast here.

863
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:43,050
I want to thank everybody seriously who
came out to the, uh, Terry town. Um,

864
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:47,700
I keep forgetting the music hall and,
uh, the count Basie theater and a,

865
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:51,000
I'm going to keep writing jokes because
that was unbelievably motivating.

866
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,480
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
try to do that every, every year.

867
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:59,550
Absolutely phenomenal
fucking, uh, experience.

868
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,980
I have nothing bad to say about any of
it. And last week people, I told you a,

869
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,240
if you want to become part of this
podcast, if you would like to participate,

870
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,150

fucked up thing that I said,

871
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:13,590
if you'd like to introduce a new topic
or add to the topics that exist or just

872

vent.
We,

873

877
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:35,810
if you could just in the
title, um, in the, uh,

878
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,220
in the subject line, could
you just stick, you know,

879
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,870
under what category is going to fist
fit if you have overrated, underrated,

880
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:47,820
if you want some advice. Um, is
it racist? Your country sucks too.

881
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,370
Um, anything, anything you want to, you
have any youtube videos of the week,

882
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:58,230
anything? Just just right. Obviously
overrated. Youtube is it racist,

883
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:01,110
right in the subject line of really helped
us to kind of streamline them cause I

884
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:04,830
actually have somebody now who's gathering
all of them and just sends them to me

885
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:07,440
one email and then you know,
I just read through all of them.

886
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:10,560

that I respond to. So once again,

887

888
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,380
Uh,
and that is it.

889
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:21,381
And the official podcast of the Monday
morning podcast is www.themlmpodcast.com

890
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,580
we have all the youtube videos.
Anything that I talk about,

891
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,180
pictures of theaters, anything I'm
talking about gold digging, who is,

892
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:34,050
we'll have pictures and that type of
shit so he can follow along at work right

893
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:36,240
before you slump over
and die in your cubicle.

894
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,950
Um,
all right.

895
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,370
I got a little backlash
this past week from um,

896
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,810
from a number of things. One from, is
it racist and another number from, uh,

897
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,040
the two drink minimum. Let's start
with two drink minimum first. Um,

898
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,890
last week someone was talking about the
two drink minimum, uh, why they have that,

899
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:56,611
a comedy clubs.

900
00:54:56,611 --> 00:54:59,760
And I was trying to explain that that's
basically how the comedy club makes

901
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:03,480
money. So this guy says, Bill, as
I listened to the podcast today,

902
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:07,950
I must disagree with your
diatribe on the two drink minimum.

903
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:11,580
You don't you love that rather than
my opinion, it becomes a diatribe.

904
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,920
I knew a diatribe means,

905
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:18,120
but that just sounds like he made it seem
like I was going on and on and on. Um,

906
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,590
I agree.
That comedy club,

907
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:24,390
I agree that comedy clubs need to
make money. Well, thank you sir.

908
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,750
Thank you for extending me
that fucking olive branch.

909
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:31,920
I agree that sometimes they
promise certain payouts.

910
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,700
Okay. I wasn't asking you to
agree with it. That's how it is.

911
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,140
But the two drink minimum is the
equivalent of every other company's hidden

912
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:43,020
charges.
If the club needs to make money,

913
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,810
add $20 to the price of a fucking ticket.

914
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:50,910
People that don't drink have a real
issue being forced to buy drinks because

915
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:54,810
some clown can't manage
his business any tighter.

916
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,200
Whatever happened to truth in advertising,

917
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:02,820
tell me up front what the entertainment
bill is going to cost me regarding,

918
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:07,830
all right, whatever happened to
truth in advertising. Um, sir,

919
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:12,480
if you can tell me an era when there
was ever any truth in advertising.

920
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:15,810
Um,
I will give you a box of free DVDs.

921
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,910
There's never been any
truth in advertising,

922
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:21,060
and that includes you when you went out
to bars and you were trying to get your

923
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:24,610
Dick sucked the way you made your job
sound a lot more important than it was.

924
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,280
All right? So get off your
fucking high horse right there.

925
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:31,930
That's the first high horse you have to
get off. All right? In a nice while you,

926
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:34,150
it's like you're fucking driving.

927
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,200
You ever see the Budweiser Clydesdale
fucking thing? You know that?

928
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:42,340
I don't know what it does. The stage
coach for the guy who owns Budweiser,

929
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:45,790
I never really understood what the fuck
that thing was supposed to be. But uh,

930
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:49,350
you have a team of Clydesdale
high horses here. All right.

931
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,300
The fact that you have to state that up,

932
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:56,310
God damn business needs to make money and
that they actually promised to pay the

933
00:56:56,591 --> 00:57:01,360
ax. I don't understand those
points. Um, and just, okay,

934
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:01,691
first of all,

935
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:05,500
he's saying that a two drink minimum is
the equivalent of every other company's

936
00:57:05,501 --> 00:57:09,100
hidden charges. There's nothing
hidden about the two drink minimum.

937
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,250
It's written on the fucking ticket.

938
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,850
It's on a sign inside the
club as you're walking in,

939
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,960
it's announced before the show.
Everything two drink minimum,

940
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:26,040
they actually have called comedy should
teach shows on TV to trunk two drink

941
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:30,370
minimum. They used to be a show called
two drink minimum. You know what I mean?

942
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,900
It's like you'd saying that there's some
sort of hidden thing that a fire engine

943
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:38,470
is red. You go into a club, there's
a two drink minimum. All right?

944
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:40,560
What I think is really
going on here is you,

945
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:44,320
you don't understand the business
of running a comedy club.

946
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,043
All right?

947
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:47,580
Okay.

948
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,700
The, the, it's what? I don't understand
why you're saying, why don't you,

949
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:54,600
why don't you, uh, people that
don't drink have a real itch.

950
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,570
Everybody drinks, sir. Everybody drinks.

951
00:57:59,460 --> 00:57:59,960
Okay.

952
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,680
All right. You don't drink. You don't
drink at all. You don't drink water.

953
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,990
You don't drink soda,
you don't drink at all.

954
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,890
You don't have to buy a
drink that has alcohol in it,

955
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,890
but you have to buy a drink.
All right?

956
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,560
And you're getting mad at
the wrong fucking people.

957
00:58:15,561 --> 00:58:19,400
You're getting mad at the club because
they're forcing you to buy drinks.

958
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,050
Why do you think that is?

959
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,210
Why do you think he cut
the club owners greedy?

960
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,760
The reason why they force you to buy
drinks is because of the amount of fucking

961
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:35,650
tightwads that show up to clubs and
go, can I have a water? Two straws.

962
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:38,770
Police. That's the problem. All right.

963
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:40,881
See,

964
00:58:40,881 --> 00:58:45,080
back in the day that probably wasn't a
two drink minimum because back in the day

965
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:49,370
the artists used to get unbelievably
fucked by the promoter, believe it or not,

966
00:58:49,371 --> 00:58:53,390
back in the day.
This is like before free agency in sports.

967
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:57,830
Back in the day believer in or
not when a band, a comedian,

968
00:58:57,831 --> 00:59:01,190
any sort of entertainer,
went to a venue to perform.

969
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,910
The promoter got 80% of the door.

970
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,120
Okay.

971
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,740
And the artists got 20%

972
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:08,960
okay.

973
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,793
All right.

974
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:15,470
But because of the brilliance and the
balls of Peter Grant with led Zeppelin,

975
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,560
as far as I know,
I'm giving him credit.

976
00:59:18,561 --> 00:59:22,220
He's the first guy I read that finally
went up to the and said, listen mate,

977
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,310
they come in here to look at the
fucking building. Alright? Yes.

978
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:29,220
Silly cunt that coming here to see fucking
led Zeppelin. I know it's a brutal,

979
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:32,060
brutal British accent, but
he was the guy going, listen,

980
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,370
nobody gives a fuck about your building.

981
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,890
I could stick these guys in
any fucking building out here.

982
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,440
They're going to sell out because
they coming to see the band.

983
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,060
So he was the guy who said,
listen,

984
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:44,690
we get 80% you get fucking 20% all right,

985
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:51,990
so the promoter has to make his fucking
money and he makes money by selling food

986
00:59:52,811 --> 00:59:55,900
and drinks. All right. That's how it is.

987
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,650
But the problem is is people will go in
there and they won't fucking buy drinks

988
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:00,670
or they won't buy food.

989
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,940
They'll go in there and
they will sit there and they
will sip on a fucking water.

990
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,970
That's why there is a two drink minimum,

991
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:11,130
which is advertised on the fucking ticket.
It is advertised.

992
01:00:11,131 --> 01:00:13,870
They have it on a sign before
you even fucking walk in there.

993
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:18,070
The call up the comedy club,
they say there is a two drink minimum.

994
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,480
This show is 21 and older.
What the two drink minimum.

995
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,460
I've heard that maybe 40 million times
in my comedy career there was no sort of

996
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,740
false advertising going on here,
sir.

997
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,400
All right. That is why they
have to make money, dude.

998
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,160
Do you know how much money it
costs to run a fucking club?

999
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,920
Do you know much money? It cost to get
a liquor license. You want to people,

1000
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:43,130
you have to grease the amount of taxes
you have to pay the amount you have to

1001
01:00:43,131 --> 01:00:46,090
pay and fucking rent.
All of that bullshit.

1002
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,870
You know what you don't,

1003
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,410
I know a guy opened up a fucking
theater and there was these union guys.

1004
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:01,320
Alright. And to change the sign,
he had to hire two union guys,

1005
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:02,580
one guy to go up the ladder,

1006
01:01:02,581 --> 01:01:06,150
one guy to hold the fucking ladder
and a cop to stand there and make sure

1007
01:01:06,151 --> 01:01:07,110
everything was fine.

1008
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:12,610
It was costing them like 1500 bucks to
put up and this week come down and check

1009
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:15,720
out Bob Saget or whatever
the fuck was there.

1010
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:22,910
So he had to sit there and lobby with
politicians and lobby with all these

1011
01:01:23,161 --> 01:01:27,330
fucking people and try and go around
unions and all this fucking horseshit just

1012
01:01:27,331 --> 01:01:31,290
so we could get a sign out front that he
could change electronically from inside

1013
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:32,124
the building.

1014
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:32,810
Okay.

1015
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:36,860
Do you want to stay on that fifth 1500
bucks a week times 52 weeks a year?

1016
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,370
That's just, if you just change
it once, forget about this guy.

1017
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:41,390
The way he had it running,

1018
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,080
he had a musical act and a comedy act and
then a musical act every fucking week.

1019
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:48,770
So it's three times a week.
That's what, 3040 500 bucks.

1020
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,720
That's like what, 250 fucking grand a
year to get a guy to change letters.

1021
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:57,710
On a fucking sign. Okay. It costs money
to run. Oh God. Damn business. All right.

1022
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,750
I don't know what else to tell you,

1023
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:05,620
but you're getting mad at clubs for
having two drink minimums. It's,

1024
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:10,690
it's, you know, it's not
the club. It's not the club.

1025
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:13,480
It's all,
it's the tight fuck sitting next to you.

1026
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,130
Who's going to bring cheezits in and a
little butter knife to spread his cheese

1027
01:02:18,131 --> 01:02:20,040
on and that shit, you know, I don't

1028
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,670
fucking stay home. I don't know what to
tell you. I don't know what to tell you.

1029
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:27,630
Uh,
what else?

1030
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,870
What are the backlash like? Oh, I
got backlash this week on the, uh,

1031
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:38,300
the fuck was it? Is it racist? I went
back and forth with this fucking guy,

1032
01:02:38,301 --> 01:02:39,890
which was hilarious.
This guy was,

1033
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,510
he wrote that guy last week who
wrote the thing where he said a bill.

1034
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:48,500
Older Asian is racist as
shit. I'm sorry, but it is.

1035
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,600
So I wrote him back where I was like,
well dude,

1036
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,450
you kind of have to elaborate
on your point. And number two,

1037
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:56,360
why are you apologizing?
That's kind of a pet peeve of mine.

1038
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:00,200
I hate when someone disagree with you
and then they apologize. I'm sorry,

1039
01:03:00,201 --> 01:03:02,180
but you're wrong. It's like, dude,
you're not, you're not sorry.

1040
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,470
Why are you saying you're sorry?
What are you sorry about?

1041
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,620
You're not fucking sorry.
Stop saying you're sorry.

1042
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,560
So this guy goes on and on and on,

1043
01:03:12,561 --> 01:03:17,561
and he proceeds to basically say that
I was playing on Asian stereotypes,

1044
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,890
um,
and that,

1045
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:23,900
and I had preconceived
notions about Asians and all
this type of shit, you know,

1046
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:28,820
and I don't give a fuck if you
are just joking. That is racist.

1047
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,940
I don't give a fuck how you meant it.
It's fucking race.

1048
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,640
All that psycho shit.

1049
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:39,320
And then he proceeds to prove
his point by then hitting me.

1050
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:41,750
I Dunno what he,
the rest of his fucking email,

1051
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:45,170
he was trying to give me examples
that my preconceived notions,

1052
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:49,330
my alleged preconceived notions about
Asians was fucked up as he then dumps up

1053
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:54,360
all his preconceived notions about white
people. He goes really of the ages,

1054
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:55,460
the only bad drivers.

1055
01:03:55,461 --> 01:04:00,440
What about all those rich
white kids denting their
dad's Mercedes on the regular

1056
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,740
fucking Hilarious, you know? All right.

1057
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,840
And then I just asked him to name who
those rich white kids worth because you

1058
01:04:07,841 --> 01:04:10,600
know, I hung out with a letter.
What white kids growing up,

1059
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,500
all white kids and none of their,
our dads had fucking Russ.

1060
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:17,770
Who are these rich white kids, sir?
Where did you meet these rich white kids?

1061
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,210
Where you and your younger brother with
the fucking kidney disease adopted by a

1062
01:04:22,211 --> 01:04:25,000
rich white man? Is that how you
ran into all these rich white kids?

1063
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:29,440
You're fucking generalizing. You're
doing the exact same horse shit. So,

1064
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,980
but it ended up being a great debate. And
this is, this is what, this is what I've,

1065
01:04:32,981 --> 01:04:37,240
I've, I've come to realize about
jokes when it comes to race. I think,

1066
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:41,080
I could be wrong here, but I think
they threw this three categories.

1067
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:44,260
When you do it,
when you joke in a racial way,

1068
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,440
it can either a be straight up,

1069
01:04:47,441 --> 01:04:52,441
funny B be offensive or
c be racist and it all,

1070
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,860
and there's a bunch of variables that
play into it and it plays in to the intent

1071
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:03,790
of the person. If your intent
is not to be fucking racist,

1072
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:06,880
what you said I believe is not racist.

1073
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:11,050
What it is at that point is offensive.
You made a joke,

1074
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:14,980
you thought it was going to be funny,
but people took it a different way.

1075
01:05:14,981 --> 01:05:16,270
They didn't find it funny.

1076
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:17,730
Okay.

1077
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:18,930
They're saying it's racist.

1078
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,090
You acknowledge it's just
fucking around and it's like,

1079
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:24,870
well at that then it
becomes offensive I think.

1080
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,353
All right,

1081
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:32,090
and then it also comes down to your
relationship because if you know you'll

1082
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:38,100
fucking white and somebody else is
black or whatever and your friends,

1083
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:44,210
the level of being offended gets
pushed way down the Goddamn street.

1084
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,530
You know, to the point. Sometimes
if other people are listening,

1085
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:52,170
they can't believe what the fuck the
two of you are saying to each other.

1086
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:58,100
But I still maintain, it comes down
to intent now that older Asian,

1087
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,680
Oh and and the social situation,
all the region of just fucking around.

1088
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:05,970
It's a joke. It's not racist
because I don't have any fucking

1089
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:11,080
bad feelings about agents. It's just
something that's a funny fucking game.

1090
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:16,081
I came up with driving and
traffic after I saw a pattern,

1091
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:22,890
I kept getting cut off and it just seemed
that 80% of the fucking time it was

1092
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:26,290
either some old due to some Asian dude.
So as a joke,

1093
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:29,710
I started playing that game with my
girl. What do you want? Older Asian,

1094
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:33,160
what do you got? Put your money
on the table just fucking around.

1095
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:37,930
Now obviously if I'm doing
that outside of the car,

1096
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:40,120
I'm gonna fucking offense.
I'm going to offend somebody.

1097
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:44,920
But it's still not racist because
I don't mean it that way, you know?

1098
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:47,830
I know a lot of people are going to
fucking disagree with that, but I truly,

1099
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:54,000
you can't tell me what the fuck. I mean,
I know what I'm thinking. You know?

1100
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,420
Does that fucking May, I don't
know. I don't fucking know.

1101
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,990
But in the same thing is
that that older Asian thing,

1102
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:04,990
Barack Obama couldn't be in the middle
of doing the state of the union go,

1103
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,200
we're going to get turned into country
around, we're going to do this.

1104
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:08,460
We'll do that. And you
know what? You know what,

1105
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:11,040
I like to play in the back
whenever my limo gets cut up,

1106
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:14,850
I play this game called older Asian,
you know,

1107
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:18,030
that's even then if he's
just fucking around,

1108
01:07:18,031 --> 01:07:21,810
I don't think that's racist is incredibly
irresponsible and would be taken that

1109
01:07:21,811 --> 01:07:25,830
way. And at the very least it would be
unbelievably fucking offensive. But I,

1110
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:27,660
that's what I think.
You guys tell me what you think.

1111
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:32,460
I think if you just fucking around,
if you don't mean it in a malicious way,

1112
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:35,010
it's, it's not racist.
You can be ignorant.

1113
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,950
You can offend fucking people in
that type of stuff. But you know,

1114
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:43,910
I really don't think that me playing
a game called older Asian is,

1115
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:50,060
is racist.
Like some fucking guy in the clan going,

1116
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:52,160
we need to get these
people out of the country.

1117
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:57,350
They're beasts and that type of shit.
All right. And I know what you can say.

1118
01:07:57,351 --> 01:08:00,770
Well, do the two, the Dutch, so you, what
you're doing is a lighter form now. No,

1119
01:08:00,771 --> 01:08:05,030
I'm not. No, I'm not. You're an
oversensitive fucking cunt. All right?

1120
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,570
And you're so far to the fucking left.
You're actually doing like this.

1121
01:08:08,571 --> 01:08:13,280
Mccarthyism, bleeding heart horse shit,
go fuck yourself. Lighten the fuck up.

1122
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,090
Okay.

1123
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:18,290
Like when when I a black
comic or somebody's giving
me shit that white people

1124
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:22,670
can't dunk a basketball or they,
they can't fucking dance, you know,

1125
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,870
depending on how they say,
if they say it in a mean enough way,

1126
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:30,950
I could get offended. I maybe could
get offended. But first of all,

1127
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:33,860
my honestly going to sit there
and act like generally speaking,

1128
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:35,320
white dudes can fucking dance.
Well,

1129
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:39,620
white people in general or that would
dunk it a basketball how many six foot 11

1130
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,090
fucking guys have I seen

1131
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:47,330
two and a half step and they just
fucking dislocate their shoulder,

1132
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:51,640
hitting the ball in the front of the
fucking rim. You know, I think, you know,

1133
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,190
I think a lot of people they don't have,

1134
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,380
they don't have a fucking sense
of humor either. So, uh, I dunno.

1135
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:01,080
I think that guy last week at the Tony
Gwynn game, that's fucking hilarious.

1136
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:02,490
Yeah.

1137
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:05,250
That game that other guy played
where he sits there saying, you know,

1138
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,880
it turns his back to the news and he
hears the crime when he tries to guess the

1139
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:11,040
race is fucking hilarious.

1140
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,600
This guy had three heads in his
refrigerator, crazy ass white guy,

1141
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:18,270
crazy ass cracker or whatever.
Like that's, it's funny.

1142
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:19,770
Okay.

1143
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,240
Am I saying anything funny this week?

1144
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,970
I feel like it just been ranting for
the past 20 fucking minutes. All right,

1145
01:09:23,971 --> 01:09:28,830
let's, let's plow ahead here. Oh, some
advice. All right. Advice Bill. Uh,

1146
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,340
I've heard you mentioned a few times
that when you dedicated yourself to

1147
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:34,680
following your dream,
you, uh, is a comedian.

1148
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:39,000
You sacrificed everything to throw
yourself completely into comedy.

1149
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:42,360
And then you usually say that on some
level it was easier for you to put

1150
01:09:42,361 --> 01:09:45,900
everything on the line because you were
young and it didn't have a lot to risk.

1151
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,960
I'm 37 years old with a wife and two
young boys who are ages four and six year

1152
01:09:52,651 --> 01:09:54,750
ago I decided that I
wanted to be a comedian.

1153
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:59,130
I've been doing open mikes consistently
for a year and I feel like I have real

1154
01:09:59,131 --> 01:10:01,710
potential.
I know it takes a lot of time to get good.

1155
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:04,290
My problem is I can't
pay this month's rent.

1156
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:09,420
I'm scared to get a book better
fulltime job because it will take,

1157
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:13,320
um,
Mr Away.

1158
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:14,530
Okay.

1159
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,140
It'll take me away from my dream.
Little Typo there.

1160
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,860
When you are older and have
responsibilities like kids and a wife,

1161
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,490
how do you justify taking
risks to go for your dream?

1162
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,680
All right, dude. All right.

1163
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:30,580
This is a rough one for me to give
you advice on because I had never,

1164
01:10:30,581 --> 01:10:32,350
I've never been in that situation.

1165
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:36,460
And also I never want
to talk somebody out of,

1166
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:39,070
of doing what you want to do.

1167
01:10:39,071 --> 01:10:42,160
You should definitely keep doing standup
if that's what your heart's telling you

1168
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:44,020
to do.
But as a man,

1169
01:10:44,021 --> 01:10:48,610
you cannot have a wife and kids and
not be able to pay the rent. All right?

1170
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:49,930
Um,

1171
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:53,950
you need to get a better full time job
and you just need to fucking work harder

1172
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:56,740
and be more efficient when
you go out to the club.

1173
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:02,210
If you've been hanging out a little
bit, don't hang out at all. And um,

1174
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:03,300
okay.

1175
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,133
You know.

1176
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:05,710
Okay.

1177
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:09,560
It's what you're trying to do is not
impossible, but I will tell you this.

1178
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,180
You can't, who's kitten hope? All right?

1179
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:19,860
The number one job of a man is to fucking
provide you have to provide for your

1180
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:24,660
family. If you're not,
you know, I, you know,

1181
01:11:24,661 --> 01:11:28,670
I, I don't want to say
this, but a lot they, you,

1182
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:31,950
the women look at you like
you're fucking useless.

1183
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:33,070
Okay.

1184
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:35,460
All right.
That's like them without a fucking vagina.

1185
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,390
And I hate to reduce them as sex objects,
but that's just how we view you

1186
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:45,810
fucking with you. But seriously, all
right, you have to provide, okay.

1187
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:48,930
This is the thing I think, you
know, if your wife is cool,

1188
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:52,770
she will understand that you
want to make this transition,

1189
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,800
but you have to make it
as smooth as possible.

1190
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,780
You can't be in a situation where you're,
where you can't pay the fucking rent.

1191
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:04,200
All right? So, um,

1192
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,040
I would get a better day job
if you had to at this time

1193
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,990
so you can pay the fucking rent.

1194
01:12:12,991 --> 01:12:17,070
And then you can burn it at both ends and
do your stand up at night or whatever.

1195
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,520
Right? And then eventually when you
start getting paid gigs with that,

1196
01:12:20,521 --> 01:12:24,660
then you can start to phase out the
fucking day job. All right? But uh,

1197
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,440
if I was you, I would sit down and
have a heart to heart with your wife.

1198
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,520
So she gets where your head's at,
you know, and just tell her, look,

1199
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:36,600
I really want to do this, but I understand
my job as a man as I have to provide.

1200
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:38,640
So I, I've, this won't happen again.

1201
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,130
Okay.

1202
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:44,960
Yeah. You know, you gotta have, you got
up, you got to pay the fucking pills,

1203
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,663
you know,
you got it.

1204
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:52,690
Pay The fucking bills. It's
just, it's your job as a guy.

1205
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:53,861
It really is.

1206
01:12:53,861 --> 01:12:58,861
I don't give a fuck about all is equal
rights in fucking independent women puts

1207
01:12:59,411 --> 01:13:01,180
your fucking titties
in the air or whatever.

1208
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:06,100
How are the fuck that Goddamn song
goes? Oh right. Providing is our job.

1209
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:10,690
That's our fucking job. We
have to, you have to do it.

1210
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:15,970
Wait, you have to fucking do it. You know?
What are you fucking Steadman, you know,

1211
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:20,710
I guess that's okay if you, if you,
if your, your your chick is Oprah,

1212
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,010
speaking of which,
you haven't seen some Oprah's houses.

1213
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,670
I became fascinated with that when I did
that red bank and I was just looking at

1214
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:28,900
those fucking houses,

1215
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:33,850
the level of wealth and I just
started typing in Bill Gates' house,

1216
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:36,010
Oprah's house and just like the most,

1217
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:38,950
the richest people I could fucking
think of. Like Jesus Christ,

1218
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:45,630
Jesus Christ, m and m's house
looked up his for some reason.

1219
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:50,130
Um, they're unbelievable. These,

1220
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:54,920
first of all they always like in them
surrounding them was always like a forest.

1221
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:58,670
Like they don't even have this show.
Rich Dad have neighbors. Some of them,

1222
01:13:58,671 --> 01:14:01,160
some of them they've lived, you
know, crowded areas like Miami beach.

1223
01:14:01,161 --> 01:14:02,450
But some of these fucking people,

1224
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:03,720
okay.

1225
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,940
Like m and m's house looked like a,
like a,

1226
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,760
I don't even know how to describe it.

1227
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:16,140
It looked like a house that got,
looks like an optical illusion.

1228
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:19,230
Like it was a house. And then
you give a c, like in a movie,

1229
01:14:19,231 --> 01:14:21,390
like where all of a sudden
a guy just gets a hunchback.

1230
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:24,150
That's what his house looked like.
It was a house. And then boom,

1231
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,660
there's another part of the house. And
then, then another house, he's was like,

1232
01:14:27,661 --> 01:14:32,580
he just took like these 20 fucking
houses and just stuck them all together.

1233
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:38,040
That'd be a great house to have if,
if, if you were wanted by the law,

1234
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:43,310
you know what I mean? You could literally
hide out in your own fucking house,

1235
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:51,230
take by it by at least another two and
a half weeks of freedom by the time they

1236
01:14:51,231 --> 01:14:56,210
fucking found you. You know, I don't know.
I don't know what the Hell I'm saying.

1237
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,200
Um, so anyways, do that. That's, that's a
real tough situation. I hope you work out.

1238
01:15:00,201 --> 01:15:02,870
Don't give up on your
dream, but, uh, you know,

1239
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,360
your wife is going to be way
more supportive if, if, if you,

1240
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:10,100
if you pay in the God damn, you gotta
pay the bills. Got To pay the bills.

1241
01:15:10,101 --> 01:15:12,490
All right, here we go.
Next one. Hey, Bill. Uh,

1242
01:15:12,491 --> 01:15:14,630
asked for advice a couple of
months ago about a friend of mine.

1243
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:15,800
This was another brutal one.

1244
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:17,470
Yeah.

1245
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:21,520
But a friend of mine who's girlfriend
was having a kid and I was suspicious

1246
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:24,520
about whether or not,
um,

1247
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:28,810
it was his because he had gone and gotten
checked twice to see if he could have

1248
01:15:28,811 --> 01:15:33,640
kids. And the doctors said No. Oh, I
remember this guy. Remember that one?

1249
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,620
The doctor said this guy,
he got checked twice.

1250
01:15:37,621 --> 01:15:42,621
He said he couldn't have kids and all
of a sudden his girl was pregnant and

1251
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:45,730
there was questions about her
being faithful. I remember this,

1252
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:48,970
I remember this well this is the
update of this. He said, well,

1253
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:52,150
about five months into the
pregnancy she miscarried.

1254
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:56,830
So the problem kind of solved itself,
but it was a terrible thing to happen.

1255
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:01,720
Now they are living together and I'm
still pretty positive she was cheating on

1256
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:05,620
him and he's hanging onto the relationship
now through some sort of guilt

1257
01:16:05,621 --> 01:16:07,180
because of the lost child.

1258
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:11,350
It just feels like my friend got one
pulled over on him and I really want to

1259
01:16:11,351 --> 01:16:15,910
talk to him about it, but I can't
find a good way to do it. Uh,

1260
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:19,510
you podcasts rules and I hope you come
to Edmonton sometime. It'll comic strip,

1261
01:16:19,511 --> 01:16:23,530
right? The comic strip in Edmonton. I'll
make my way up there at some point. Um,

1262
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:28,420
through that is a brutal,
brutal, brutal, brutal situation.

1263
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:32,440
And uh,
it all depends on how you feel.

1264
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:35,020
Are you going to be able to live with
yourself if you just say, listen,

1265
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:39,280
this kid is just a moron. He's my
friend, but he's a fucking moron.

1266
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:45,540
Cause that is an option. You
know, the Goodfellas moment,
you know, when he, he, uh,

1267
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:49,270
they tell that joke in Italian and de
Niro says, what does it mean in, in pet?

1268
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:53,190
She goes, it means he's, he's
content to be a jerk. You know,

1269
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:54,271
what am I going to say?

1270
01:16:54,271 --> 01:16:58,560
My wife two times meet that joke
basically about a guy who knows his wife's

1271
01:16:58,561 --> 01:17:01,140
fucking around on him and he just doesn't,
he just looks the other way.

1272
01:17:01,141 --> 01:17:04,410
He's content to be a jerk.
So that's what your friend is right now.

1273
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:09,710
I know this emotions involved, so
does there is hope for them, but

1274
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,500
you know,
he's,

1275
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:18,030
he's fucking himself over.
So this deal,

1276
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:21,150
if you can live with yourself and just
say, this guy's contend to be a jerk,

1277
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:24,240
I'm not going to get in the fucking
middle of this because there's so many

1278
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:28,770
obvious red flags here and this kid
is just choosing to ignore them.

1279
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:34,530
Um, you could just say, fuck it.
He's content to be a fucking idiot,

1280
01:17:34,531 --> 01:17:36,600
but if you're not going to be
able to live with yourself,

1281
01:17:36,601 --> 01:17:41,480
then I would just sit down and
talk to him. All right? And,

1282
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:43,700
um,
hopefully listens to you.

1283
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:47,060
And if not any stops being your friend,

1284
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:52,790
um, there's nothing you
can fucking do about that.

1285
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:56,750
And I got a feeling probably
seven or eight years from now,

1286
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,060
you might get a phone call him
saying, you know what, you are right,

1287
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:05,710
but those are impossible situations.

1288
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,470
Jesus Christ.
How the fuck would I handle that?

1289
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:15,140
I would, uh, I would say
something. You know what? I would,

1290
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:18,860
I would definitely say something, but, uh,

1291
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:24,630
I don't know how to do that, to be honest
with you. I the fuck what I was say.

1292
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,520
I say, listen, you know, I'm friends
with you. We've been friends a long time.

1293
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,890
That's when yes, when you buddy
knows something fucked ups coming.

1294
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:37,220
Let's see. We've been friends a long time,
right pat? A lot of good times. Right.

1295
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:38,930
You know,
you know,

1296
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:42,290
you know that I've always been there
for you and I never tried to steer your

1297
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:46,610
wrong. Right? Like I
think your girlfriend,

1298
01:18:46,611 --> 01:18:50,570
is it too time and
yeah.

1299
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:51,620
How do you say that?

1300
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:58,130
I would just rip the bandaid
off. Just say, listen,

1301
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,390
there's something I have to talk to
you about with friends and as a friend.

1302
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:07,870
All right,
I can't stop thinking about this.

1303
01:19:07,871 --> 01:19:10,960
And it would kill me to not bring
this up to you. I have to do this.

1304
01:19:10,961 --> 01:19:15,190
I'm not trying to be malicious.
I'm doing this because you're my friend.

1305
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,660
And then I would just
say, look, ah, Jesus,

1306
01:19:19,661 --> 01:19:22,090
I just had it and I already forgot
how fucking difficult to say is.

1307
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:26,710
I would just be, it's
fucking ridiculous. Look,

1308
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:31,030
you told me you couldn't have kids.
You went to the doctor twice.

1309
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,720
You got tested.
They said you couldn't have kids yet.

1310
01:19:34,721 --> 01:19:38,740
This girl somehow got fucking pregnant.
Don't say fuck there yet.

1311
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:42,670
Your, your, your girl
somehow got pregnant. Okay.

1312
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,730
Then you just sort of stare at them.

1313
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,790
I don't know where to go from there.
All right.

1314
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:57,130
My guts telling me that that
wasn't your fucking kid. See,

1315
01:19:57,131 --> 01:19:58,510
that's a hard one to that one.

1316
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,030
That kid you just fucking cried
over that didn't get born.

1317
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:06,160
I don't think it was yours. Anyways.
Ah, Jesus, dude, this is fucking brutal.

1318
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:07,443
Brutal.

1319
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:11,983
Um,

1320
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:13,460
I would do,
this is what I would do.

1321
01:20:13,461 --> 01:20:17,300
I would do what I'm doing right now into
a mirror and just keep correcting it as

1322
01:20:17,301 --> 01:20:19,270
you go the same way I said,
okay. Don't say fuck there.

1323
01:20:19,271 --> 01:20:23,630
And then you back it up again and
just somehow figured a way out.

1324
01:20:23,631 --> 01:20:27,830
A way to say that I think your
girlfriend is a whore. Uh,

1325
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,680
I don't think that she's being,
I don't think you're,

1326
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:35,720
I don't think the woman that you're
with has been a 100% honest with you.

1327
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,210
Yeah.

1328
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:38,680
And I don't think,

1329
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,350
okay.

1330
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,570
That she has been 100% faithful.

1331
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:48,830
And my gut was telling me that that
wasn't your kid. See, that's brutal.

1332
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:53,570
Taking it to there. All right. I think
you need to get out of this relationship.

1333
01:20:53,571 --> 01:20:56,090
I mean, I don't do it. I don't know how
to do it. I don't know how to fuck. Yeah,

1334
01:20:56,091 --> 01:20:59,690
you stumped me. Stumped the Swami. I know
now like I know everything obviously,

1335
01:20:59,691 --> 01:21:01,610
but uh, I usually can come
up with some sort of angle.

1336
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:02,660
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.

1337
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:04,520
Okay.

1338
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,170
Um, but for whatever you
do, don't write it down.

1339
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:11,670
Don't put it in a letter
cause he'll probably show it
to her and then, then, uh,

1340
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:14,340
then it'll just be brutal. The
fuck that. Don't, don't do that.

1341
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:19,590
Just a huge, that's a, uh, yeah.

1342
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:21,390
I don't want to tell you, dude,
that's a fucking brutal one.

1343
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:27,500
Jesus. Does it work to just
say it? Listen, man, you're
best. We're best friends,

1344
01:21:27,501 --> 01:21:30,650
right? We could say anything to each
other. Yeah. I think your girlfriend, ah,

1345
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:35,740
fuck somebody else without a condom and
got pregnant instead it was yours and

1346
01:21:35,751 --> 01:21:40,610
it's such a fucking psycho cunt that she
was about ready to let you take on the

1347
01:21:40,611 --> 01:21:44,390
responsibility and invest
that sort of time, your life.

1348
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:48,890
She was content to throw away your
fucking life because she can't keep her

1349
01:21:48,891 --> 01:21:52,670
fucking legs on the ground and her
panties up around a fucking waste.

1350
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:54,223
Do you understand me?

1351
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,470
She's a fucking whore.
All right.

1352
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,580
You went to two fucking doctors and
they said you can't get pregnant, dude.

1353
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:05,780
How dumb are you?

1354
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:11,940
Get your fucking head out of her fucking
vagina. Wake up. It's not your kid.

1355
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:16,770
All right. That was God. God gave you
a fucking Mulligan. He gave you a pass.

1356
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:18,930
All right? They had go.
You want to get, oh Jesus.

1357
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:23,310
You want to get fucking religious about
it? Get out of the goddamn relationship.

1358
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:26,160
Stop being such a fucking pussy.

1359
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:27,750
Okay.

1360
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,583
Leave her

1361
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:32,620
cry about it for fucking six weeks.
Whatever you gotta do.

1362
01:22:32,621 --> 01:22:36,400
Go join a fucking gym and get on with
your fucking life and start wearing a

1363
01:22:36,401 --> 01:22:40,270
condom.
All right.

1364
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:44,710
Now I know that team that we saw in the
first half is not the fuck attain that.

1365
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:45,544
I know.

1366
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:46,490
Yeah,

1367
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:50,170
we got another 30 minutes of fucking
football and I want you to get out there.

1368
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:53,290
It proved to me that you could play
and I got the way I know he could play.

1369
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:56,590
That's what you do. You go anywhere we
go. It took me a minute to work it out.

1370
01:22:56,650 --> 01:23:00,940
You go fucking Vince
Lombardi. Grab, grab, grab,

1371
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:01,870
nobody tackling.

1372
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:02,980
Okay.

1373
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:06,070
She's a fucking whore. You got to go
like dad. Got to build up. You got

1374
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,800
to start slow. You got to start slow. Oh,

1375
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,710
my years of looking at relationships.

1376
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:15,730
I don't think I have ever
in my life seen a woman.

1377
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,200
So pull the fucking wool a pubes over
somebody's fucking eyes like I did and

1378
01:23:22,981 --> 01:23:23,950
that first half.

1379
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,220
Okay.

1380
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:30,000
You know what I saw up there? I saw both
jet, just some, I don't know how to do it.

1381
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:33,330
I'm out. I don't know what to tell
you. I don't know what to tell you.

1382
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:38,160
Tell that fucking kid. He needs to make
some halftime adjustments. All right,

1383
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:40,870
pull the rip cord. Get the
fuck out of that jeep. I

1384
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:46,410
see these, these, these are the
things they, they don't, they don't,

1385
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:51,180
they don't talk about these kinds of,
of, of women on, on those real shows.

1386
01:23:51,181 --> 01:23:54,120
They'll show women like that on Jerry
Springer and everyone looks like a retard,

1387
01:23:54,121 --> 01:23:58,440
so nobody gives a fuck. Right? But they
won't show those kinds of women on those,

1388
01:23:58,441 --> 01:24:00,350
those real sort of issue shows when that,

1389
01:24:00,351 --> 01:24:02,670
just always talking about
guys who beat their women,

1390
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:05,730
which they're horrible fucking people
and they should talk about them.

1391
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,420
But why don't they ever talk about horse?
You know,

1392
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:13,260
the only time they talk about whores
is just when they try to figure out why

1393
01:24:13,261 --> 01:24:15,360
there were a whore.
You know,

1394
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:20,220
dad didn't stick around fucking uncle
dental, Domo, you know, whatever.

1395
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:24,030
They always got a fucking reason. I
always got a God damn excuse. You know,

1396
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,850
maybe they're just horse.
Do you ever think of that?

1397
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:27,900
I think there's already women out.

1398
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:30,240
There is a woman out down when
I want to know this. Okay.

1399
01:24:30,241 --> 01:24:34,080
This is totally anonymous and I'm not
judging you because I'm a male whore

1400
01:24:34,081 --> 01:24:38,130
myself. All right, I want to know this.

1401
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:43,770
Is there a woman out there with dad
stuck around? You had a great family.

1402
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:47,490
You weren't touched in any funny way.
You went to school,

1403
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:51,240
you know you are girl scouts,
you did all the right things,

1404
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:55,500
but you just love Dick.
And not only do you love Dick,

1405
01:24:55,501 --> 01:25:00,300
you love a bunch of different decks
and you are in a relationship,

1406
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:03,300
but every once in a while you just
got to go out and go bag somebody else

1407
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,470
because you're fucking bored basically.

1408
01:25:07,471 --> 01:25:11,850
Are you wired like a man?
That's what I want to know.

1409
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:16,860
Okay. And you can be totally
honest. Let's examine,

1410
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:21,870
let's examine that because I don't even
think it's fair to just brand them all

1411
01:25:21,871 --> 01:25:24,560
horse.
I don't,

1412
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,010
I think some of them are raw,

1413
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:32,420
actually really intelligent and they've
actually sat and contemplated it,

1414
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:35,120
you know? Or you know, done.

1415
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:39,300
What I've done is justify
their piece of shit moves.

1416
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:44,093
Okay.

1417
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,400
Oh, you know something. This is the time
when I really should just have a guest.

1418
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,630
I don't have a guest. I got to have more
guests on this fucking podcast. What,

1419
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:53,710
what do what do, what do you, what
do you want from me? All right.

1420
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:55,820
You guys want some youtube
videos for this week? Huh?

1421
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,480
Have you slumped over and
you cubicles lift yet?

1422
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:02,070
Have you done that with five minutes
left and you fucking day. All right.

1423
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,540
You two videos for the, um, the
truth about Facebook privacy.

1424
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:07,340
I actually haven't a
chance to watch this yet.

1425
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:12,410
This was suggested to me by somebody close
to me, so I just put that on there. I,

1426
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:16,550
here's a go. When fireworks fail,
sky's shoots off one. That should,

1427
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:19,070
it should have gone on after
the fucking Boston pops.

1428
01:26:19,071 --> 01:26:22,070
And he basically shoots it off in his
own neighborhood and for some reason it

1429
01:26:22,071 --> 01:26:26,480
goes off about, oh, I don't know
about maybe 30, 35 feet in the air,

1430
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,940
a bunch of houses around.
Um, here's another good one.

1431
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:35,570
Angry skateboarder.
Here's a hockey one.

1432
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:40,571
Blonde Jaeger is in Jaromir Jaeger
and a band called a mute math.

1433
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:46,250
Great musicians, great albums, albums,
and they have a fucking insane drummer.

1434
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:51,640
Oh. Speaking of which people,
speaking of which, um,

1435
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:57,010
I've been taking my drumming to a new
level, to a brand new fucking for me.

1436
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:01,870
For me, I still suck,
but after plateauing, I,

1437
01:27:01,871 --> 01:27:05,920
uh, I just sort of, I
got fucking add, right.

1438
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:09,720
As you can tell from my podcast, I, if
you notice that I start to make a point,

1439
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:12,400
then something else reminds me
of something else. And then yeah,

1440
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:16,660
maybe I'll drive over to the left for
a while. You know, I can't sit still,

1441
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:21,220
I can't focus unless,
uh,

1442
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:26,060
unless something really fucked up
is happening. That's the only thing.

1443
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:31,061
Something really fucked up has to be
happening before you will get 100% of my

1444
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:37,040
attention, you know? I don't know why,

1445
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:41,690
but that's how it is. So,
uh, with my playing drums,

1446
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:44,060
I'm the same way.
I'm always learning,

1447
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:47,460
trying to learn five different
things at the same fucking time.

1448
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,920
Okay.

1449
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,160
You know, I'll do this for like
three minutes, then I'll do this,

1450
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:55,520
but three minutes, I'll do this for two
minutes and then, and then I'll fuck it.

1451
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:55,791
You know?

1452
01:27:55,791 --> 01:28:00,410
And then I have three new things that
I'm trying to learn and rather than just

1453
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:04,190
learning one and getting
it down, I don't. And uh,

1454
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:08,360
it's something I've known for a while.
I watched this guy, Mike Johnston,

1455
01:28:08,361 --> 01:28:11,840
who has these great
lessons. Any, he had this,

1456
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:15,590
he basically mapped out
on how to practice. He,

1457
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:18,950
she'd show you something and it was,
it was pattern.

1458
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,240
You get the pattern down and then you
bring it up to speed and then you'd move

1459
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:27,000
it all around the kit. So it's
just pattern speed, movement, a, B,

1460
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,470
c one, two, three could,
couldn't have got any more basic,

1461
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:35,090
but my fucking add,
I couldn't fucking do it.

1462
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:38,990
So I finally decided I was fucking sick.

1463
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:40,730
Okay.

1464
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:43,910
I was sick of this shit. So I just
decided to focus on a couple of things.

1465
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:48,200
And one of them was that Joe Joe May or
fucking thing with your bass drum foot.

1466
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:51,770
It's something I saw Steve Gadd do a,
this is really for drum heads here.

1467
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,300
Steve Gadd do is up close video a long
time ago and I sat down and I fuck with

1468
01:28:56,301 --> 01:28:59,450
that thing after borderline messing
with it for a year and a half,

1469
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:04,690
I sat down for like three days in a row
and religiously worked on it and was

1470
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:09,540
blown away by how much faster I got my
foot as far as being able to do three

1471
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:13,550
hits in a row because I'm Ah,

1472
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:18,240
who's kidding who and he's Zeppelin
fans out there. There's two licks,

1473
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:22,890
three licks that I've been
trying to get down. Okay.

1474
01:29:22,891 --> 01:29:26,040
I finally be able to get the good
times, bad times, 16th note, triplets.

1475
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,580
I can do those fucking things up to
speed. I can play good times, bad times,

1476
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,680
but when he does to three in a row,
like that lick he does on a,

1477
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:40,790
I can't quit you bay when he does the
three in a row there and out on the tiles

1478
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:45,420
is a lick in there where I think,

1479
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:47,640
I think I'm hearing three
and then the want and song,

1480
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,390
which is a big debate on how
this is so fucking insane.

1481
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,950
I'm really going to lose
a lot of listeners here,

1482
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:58,860
but there's a big debate on how the
fuck he plays that. Does he pay bone,

1483
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:02,040
the debt, that debt or done
that? The debt that the debt,

1484
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:06,950
I think he does three after the
snare [inaudible] on the two. Uh, so,

1485
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,940
so fucking stupid.
Why am I talking about this anyways?

1486
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,190
What that Joe Joe Mayor Shit.
Okay.

1487
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:14,690
They play that at about 101 hundred
two beats per minute. But that Joe,

1488
01:30:14,691 --> 01:30:18,720
Joe Mayor thinks I can play that lick
with the three hits on the bass drum after

1489
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,640
the snare onto, I can play that
at 90 beats per minute. Um,

1490
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:26,730
permit. Yeah, I can play
it at data at this point.

1491
01:30:26,731 --> 01:30:30,390
So I'm within fucking striking
distance of that after, you know,

1492
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:34,170
fucking with this thing for a year
and a half, finally just sitting down.

1493
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:39,270
Um, and if drummers out there
wasn't any sort of advice,

1494
01:30:39,271 --> 01:30:43,740
I can show you what I did because I,
I'm just really nervous that this is just,

1495
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:46,440
I mean, it's, it's already bad enough.
I have people in Europe listens to me,

1496
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,750
go off on American sports
and in Australia and shit.

1497
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:52,560
It's for me to actually sit
here describing drum licks.

1498
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:58,200
It's pretty fucking
pathetic. But, um, anyways,

1499
01:30:58,230 --> 01:30:59,490
I think I'm winding down here.

1500
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:02,940
I got to make sure I edit this thing
and get this thing up on time and I also

1501
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:07,230
have to make sure, oh my God.
Oh fuck. What time is it?

1502
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:12,480
I got to go. It's three 15. I got to be
down at the fucking place to buy four.

1503
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:16,410
Fuck. All right. I gotta go. Thanks.
Listen to the podcast. Uh, God bless all.

1504
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:18,060
You don't take any shit.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1505
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:23,420
[inaudible] [inaudible].
