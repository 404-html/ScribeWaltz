37
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:20,200
to, that I love to death. Who's the
best thing that ever happened to me.

38
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,610
But she's still,
you know,

39
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,690
Piss me off today and I've been doing
such a good job not having arguments with

40
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:25,901
their own.

41
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:30,730
I kind of shook it off and then she said
something else to me in the kitchen and

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,530
uh, I had do you know, you know, there are
moments where you just have to be like,

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,980
hey, you know, you can't talk to me
like that. All right, I'm over here.

44
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,280
I'm paying a swell guy and,
and you know,

45
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:45,640
so you should be being a sweetheart
and I'm just not, I'm not feeling that.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,833
You know,

47
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,050
feeling like if I'm being like a swell
guy and someone else's not being a

48
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:56,710
sweetheart, then, then I become a
jerk off. Oh look who just came in.

49
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:00,880
The person I was talking about,
I'm doing the math here,

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,120
the lovely Nia, everybody, the greatest
thing that ever happened to me though.

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,950
Yeah. Although if you behave the
way you did this morning every time,

52
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:13,750
you'd be one of the worst things
that ever happened to me. Oh,

53
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:18,520
doesn't that sound sincere everybody?
I apologize.

54
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,760
All right. Are you going to sit
down on the couch? So anyways,

55
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,940
um,
I'm sitting there,

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,770

57
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,470

going to be a little therapy session.

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh No, it isn't. It isn't, but
you know, you know what I mean?

60
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,670
I get I lovely daughter up. I
guess you said to me, to my face.

61
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,790
Did you let me know I got
these things a little too loud.

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,930
Can you turn this down here? Um,
you said to my evidence he face,

63
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:07,060
she said that you go, you
know, I come upstairs, right?

64
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,250
I worked out. You had a wonderful,
I work out where GRANDPA, um,

65
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,970
I put all this shit. Hey, quit breathing
into the mic. They have breathing.

66
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,670
Yeah,

67
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,150
I put all somebody's going to fucking put
that clip on a loop and jerk off to it.

68
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,230
That's how creepy the Internet is
and have fun. Have Fun with that.

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,700
Anyways, um, I put all the shit
from the kid Halloween party,

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,510
broke that all down,
put it in the back of my truck.

71
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,200
I noticed that it wasn't huge. Yeah. I
get all of that. I went to the gym. Right.

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,070
Being a, being a hell of
a guy. Go upstairs. Right.

73
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,350
All adorable QT face doesn't
want to get up. Yeah. Yup.

74
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:50,860
She likes to sleep like somebody.
I know. I think that's so adorable.

75
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,040
We got this thing now.
We come in sometimes now when she doesn't,

76
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,460
when you take the blanket off her and
she has this little mischievous grin,

77
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,250
she pulls the blanket back over.
She wasn't ready.

78
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:03,130
She just was staying lying down and she
wanted me to get the blanket on her.

79
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,520
I was like, come on, it's time to get up.
And she was just smiling at me like, no,

80
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,890
not feeling it.
It was cute.

81
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,350
I just want to stay here for another
couple of 20 minutes. So anyways,

82
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:15,430
so you leave blanket full.
It's a little chilly.

83
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,290
I was probably your vibe today. Oh. Um,

84
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,170
so right. I get a ride at bed. You leave.

85
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,850
And evidently at some point you said to
me, hey bill, put her in this outfit.

86
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,060
Hey Bill, put her in this
outfit. As you said to me,

87
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,600
here's her outfit for the day.
How many times did you say it?

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,940
Once you told me in the kitchen, you
said you said it twice. I sent it to,

89
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:42,990
you know, I said to you twice and you said
it to my wife. I said it to your face.

90
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:46,110
To my face. That's the way you
said it. You would like to cop.

91
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,500
You would like to cop reservoir dogs,
buddy.

92
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,420
I am going to shoot you and you don't
put that outfit on our daughter.

93
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,320
So I didn't hear and I saw that Brown
sweatshirt. I put her on that, you know?

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,120
Yeah. Can you make more
noise? I'm sorry. Sorry.

95
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,640
Sorry.
What are you doing?

96
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,280
I was trying to think
the tag off this Blake.

97
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,240
Okay, I'm done. I'm done. I'm here.
I'm present. I'm paying attention.

98
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,610
I don't understand why your
mic is so frigging loud.

99
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,660
It's like literally you just moving your
hand. It's making it do all this stuff.

100
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,620
All right.
Anyways.

101
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,903
MMM

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,270
yeah. So anyways, so then you're sitting
there, right? She had a poopy diaper,

103
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,400
handled all of that crap,
literally. Right. And then you
come in, you're like, wait,

104
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,243
yeah.

105
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,520
I'm just like, oh, I'm sorry. She
goes, yeah, well why would you do that?

106
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,790
But well she can go to wherever the
whatever event, she's going to win this,

107
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,930
right? You're like, yeah,

108
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:52,770
but you know it's not going to be
is breathable is what I put out.

109
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,680
So then you leave. So I was
like, all right. By the way,

110
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:00,681
she's standing there adorable eating the
homemade pumpkin bread than I made last

111
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,673
night.

112
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,250
I'm a sweet guy. I'm a made
guy. Yeah, I'm a swell guy.

113
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,320
Right. So then you leave. And
so what do I own his points,

114
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,050
if you guys can recognize where
that quote is from. Oh, come on.

115
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:18,060
That's an easy one. Yeah. Just pull
it a little away from your mom. Yeah,

116
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,490

difference. Yeah. Little muck closer.

adjusting the level that you're time?

118
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,750
That's fine. Anyways. Oh

I didn't say it like that to your face.

143
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,790
That's how you just said it in the case
to your face. So I don't yell anymore.

144
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,750
That's my thing I kissed. Keeps
saying that Baja ha ha ha. No,

145
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:05,310
until you're a fucking jerk. It's
something, I mean it is, it is.

146
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,270
There's a reason human beings are able
to yell because God knew that some of

147
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:10,650
them that he made were church.

148
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,580
So anyways, then I walk,
I'm the king of Mulder now.

149
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,520
I,
Oh yeah,

150
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,220
I'll put the outfit on and when you get
a bucket danger area and I go downstairs

151
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,870
and I'm making a smoothie.
All right. And the,

152
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,590
and the thing is not
supposed to turn on the,

153
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,580
the food processors not supposed to
turn on unless you have the whole thing

154
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:36,120
closed and it turned out anyways and
stuff is going all over the place and then

155
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:40,440
you come over, you low think it's
weakened. It's like all over my shirt.

156
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,100
So I give you the look you deserved.

157
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,160
I thought it was like leaking from the
top and him think he realized that it was

158
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:51,330
coming. No, not from the top. From
the bottom. So I didn't, I don't know.

159
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,630
I didn't realize that most of
that look was because of your,

160
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:57,900
your thing upstairs in the face.
Right.

161
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,300
So then we're downstairs and
I was just like, hey, you
know, not for nothing. Yeah.

162
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,570
I didn't appreciate you could've
said thank you and you like,

163
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:11,340
why do I have to say thank you bill?
I told you two times to your face.

164
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:15,760
That's what you said. And I was just
like, yeah. And then that's when,

165
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:17,190
that's when I snapped.

166
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:22,180
I still was saying effin in Gd not
using the actual words. Right, right,

167
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,290
right. I was just like, you're not. Yeah.
You're not going to talk to me like that.

168
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,190
I'm not gonna be a sweetheart and then
be talked to like a jerk because then I

169
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,780
become a jerk off.

170
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,310
I become a typical Staten island jerk off.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,670
I can't believe we're still quoting
that show. So many. I loved it.

172
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,050
I loved it for people.

173
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:44,070
Never saw that we watch some reality
show and there was this woman from Staten

174
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,660
Island shoe life. I'm a Staten island
girl. Okay. Like the MTV show. True Life.

175
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:51,510
I'm a blank. This is
true life. I'm a status.

176
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:56,490
She went into New York and the city
into the city. She went to a club,

177
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,180
she was dancing with a guy.
She had a long island ice tea.

178
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,480
It's just dancing with this guy
and as he's dancing with her,

179
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:07,740
he's like sorta grabbing is her
girlfriend too? Yeah. And she's like,

180
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,760
are you like, you like grabbing all my
girlfriend? Like why you dance with me?

181
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,790
And the guy's like,
what were the Dayton?

182
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,130
And then they just cut to her outside
of the club and she do cause that.

183
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,050
Was she a typical Staten Island jerk?
Oh

184
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,600
No. I thought he says, well, we're
not married or something like that.

185
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,940
What do we married? Something like that.
Something to that effect. [inaudible]

186
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,690
anyways, he was going for the
threesome and he had just met her.

187
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,030
Got To respect up. There's no
loyalty in the club. Oh Shit.

188
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,700
I think that's got to be,
I think that's got to be on a tee shirt.

189
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,230
But you got to say, you gotta Say
da in Duck Club. No, can't say the,

190
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,620
if you say the,
then you think maybe it's a white club.

191
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,120
Like what are they talking about? The
White House. I know, but like the Senate,

192
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,060
so over Donald, when people
write de whatever on tee shirts,

193
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:08,180
it's just like Courtney has the
finger on the pulse of social media.

194
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,790
Smith Barney. Oh, it is? What
are the top three emojis?

195
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,420
Uh,
the top of the emojis or the face,

196
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,950
the one where the eyes are closed and
the mouth is kind of like, ah. I'm like,

197
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,260
oh my God, I can't believe this is
happening phase. These are my top three.

198
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,670
I love that one.
I also love the finger on the Chin one

199
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,130
one and then I also liked
the one eyebrow raised.

200
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,820
Those are my faves. You want to
hear mine and the crying laughing.

201
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:43,570
Of course you want to hit my what
are you and what the thumbs up

202
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,660

203
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:54,450
I heard you like point. Yeah,
that sounds good. I feel you.

204
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,040
One of the biggest fucking assholes
I've ever met. She started like,

205
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,870
you know that thumbs up,
speaking of which?

206
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,210
Yes, I got a text message. It's
a way do you forgive me for yeah.

207
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:10,180
And I'll tell you then I'll, and I'll
tell you why you do apologize. It was,

208
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:13,930
it was over the top.
And I'll tell you why because I'm done.

209
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm done being the angry guy. I don't
give a shit anymore. I'm not too much in.

210
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:22,420
My life has gone by. I'm on, I'm
on like fucking the 13th hole here.

211
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,450
What am I doing right? 50 years
old. That's a golf reference,

212
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:29,470
but I don't know what that 13 towards
the end there's only 18 holes. Oh,

213
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,870
so you only have five more
holes lives? Well. I'm 50 okay.

214
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,080
You live to 80 that's a great
run. Although I am drinking. No,

215
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:40,930
we're going to live longer than that.
Remember I, I'm calling it right now.

216
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,160
You are going to be like the Don Rickles
of your generation and we're going to

217
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,630
like live in Las Vegas.

218
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:50,590
You and I were going to live in Las
Vegas for like however long they want to

219
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:54,820
book you for like, Oh we want to give them
a year, a year residency at this place.

220
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:55,810
We're going to live in Vegas.

221
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:59,500
We're going to live in one of those
like obnoxious like Penthouse,

222
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,580
five rooms suites in Vegas. It sounds
horrible. Why is it so horrible?

223
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:06,150
You're going to go downstairs and be like,
hey,

224
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,300
just be pulled out and the jokes old
people tell I'm going to be like shopping

225
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:16,540
at Caesar's and having lunch
at the same place every day.

226
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,340
They're going to know it's
going to be great getting me.

227
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,350
It's going to be so much fun. You're
going to shop at Caesar's? Yup. Yup.

228
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,630
Cause they have all the stores.

229
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,720
You've got to like there's
just one store and Caesar's.

230
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,850
It's like all the stores that you know,
every time we go to Vegas,

231
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,030
we're there for about 36 hours. You're
like, I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

232
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,660
That's true.

233
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,050
But I feel like as you're going to live
on the Strip in Las Vegas and this,

234
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,530
this is how you're going to go out
and your golden years. Wow. I mean,

235
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:46,090
I'm 10 years younger than you, so I'm
not going anywhere for a while, but God,

236
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,380
God willing. I'll come. What? I'm
just saying that would just be fun.

237
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:54,140
Like if you're 80 and I'm 70 yeah.
Why?

238
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,010
Why don't we just like live in Vegas? Why
not? Yeah. I'm not going out like that.

239
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:00,920
New and no one is saying you're going out,
but like the cheese,

240
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,840
there's a very high live in fucking Vegas.
Did he do Vegas?

241
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,810
Yeah, he did Vegas. Then he get the
fuck out of there. He'd get another gig.

242
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,100
You think you're going to be on the
road like that when you're 80 years old?

243
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,440
Yeah. First of all, I ever retire at some
point and just do like a nice local gig.

244
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,150
Yeah. It doesn't have to be in Las
Vegas. I'm a fucking redhead. Me,

245
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:27,110
I'm not going to be with global warming
by the time I'm 80 can be 140 degrees

246
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,650
out in the winter. You'd are you doing
stand up out in the desert like no,

247
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,540
you're inside all those old
people that live in Vegas.

248
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:36,440
They stay inside the whole time and
Erica and one heat wave like five of them

249
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:40,490
die. Yeah. Cause I can't make it over to
their fucking air conditioner. I know.

250
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:43,940
But those are probably the ones who
aren't doing so well financially.

251
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,130
So they can't afford,

252
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,910
they say that they don't
matter and that like, you know,

253
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,560
chances are they're in places that

254
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,960
are caused by wear a silly grin.

255
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,170
The moment you come into view.

256
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,450
There's a lot of older people
who live in Las Vegas, Bill.

257
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:05,420
So I'm just saying you're going
to be in a significant air,

258
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,900
going to be an air conditioning and
you'll be fine. I'm not going to be there.

259
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,270
I have a plan. Okay. And it's
your plan. As you probably know,

260
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:18,250
this plan is, well it doesn't involve
fucking living in a shopping. It's

261
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,560
like God living in Las Vegas and
some of noxious fucking penthouse.

262
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,010
Yeah. Looking at hall.
Look at them all down.

263
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,020
How'd he get away from the
window? Yes. Skin cancer.

264
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,270
Oh your ass.

265
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,060
That point we'll be sleeping in
different suites. Jesus Christ.

266
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,680
What was the tech you were
about to talk about? Oh,

267
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,870
getting back comes up. I favorite
emojis. Oh the thumbs up. All right,

268
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:54,600
so this is thing going on
on the Internet right now.

269
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:58,030
Cause all Yankee fans are
pissed at not only him,

270
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,080
but a lot of Yankee fans
are pissed at Boston,

271
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,890
at the Boston Red Sox fans that
are talking shit. Right. All right.

272
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,890
There's different kinds of sports fans.
This is sports fan that goes, hey man,

273
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,740
great series you sons of bitches,
you beat us,

274
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:12,240
whatever and you'll leave it at that.

275
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,550
Then there's the middle guys who just
won't be friends with anybody who's a fan

276
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:20,130
of another team.
And then there's the worst of the worst,

277
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:25,230
which are just the shit talk and assholes
who talk fucking shit all the time.

278
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,380
And then when their team loses,
if you can find them,

279
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,310
cause they go into hiding to give
him the shit back that they deserve,

280
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,420
they then act as though
they don't understand where
this is coming from and have

281
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:41,190
the audacity to be like, oh,
class act, class, act. Right. So,

282
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,670
um, I don't engage in any of that. Right.

283
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,840
Like there's some hilarious stuff
on the Internet right now with um,

284
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,490
you know, shit talking red sox
fans had shit-talking Yankee fans.

285
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:57,600
One of them is like the one of few Yankee
fans had the audacity to say the Red

286
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,230
Sox bought the, the uh, world
series. Oh, they're mad, Huh?

287
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,190
Well it's just like, well where did
we learn how to do that? You assholes.

288
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,941
They this,

289
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:10,050
this spending 20 million a year for
like 20 years and this is the first like

290
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,150
couple last couple of years
they'd go with their farm system,

291
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:15,060
which is brilliant and they're going to
get another one and they're going to get

292
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,950
another one soon is what I think.

293
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,740
As much as I don't want that
to happen as a red sox fan,

294
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,930
I'm also a fan of baseball.
I love what they're doing.

295
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,090
So it's just like all you guys,

296
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,080
all they're doing is stockpiling their
cash and they're going to go out and

297
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,490
they're going to spend a ton of fucking
money and they're going to come out with

298
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:33,570
it. Whatever the hell you need
to spend now to 228 million.

299
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:38,080
Is that what it is that what we spent?
Um, and then also go on real class.

300
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:42,210
He real class, he talking shit.
Baba Baba buy. If the Yankees won,

301
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:44,130
we wouldn't have said
shit about red sox fans.

302
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:47,190
It's like the fuck you
wouldn't the fuck you wouldn't,

303
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,190
I remember when you want them
and what you said I was there.

304
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,840
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

305
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,350
You guys through bear in the face
of one of our relievers this year.

306
00:18:55,351 --> 00:19:00,120
It's stop acting like you're
not face to face. So anyways,

307
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,370
this was the day after,
I'm not going to say who this person is,

308
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:09,300
but he's a very emotional
person and I love him.

309
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,250
And I've done his podcast and he's done
my podcast and he's one of the funniest

310
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:17,520
people I know. I love this guy,
but he's out of his fucking mind.

311
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,380
He sends me a text at 12:34 PM he writes,

312
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,550
you know Pedro Martinez Sucks.
Big Fat Elephant Cox still,

313
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,690
he's still suck and elephant dicks.
So I write back, thanks so-and-so.

314
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,330
Exclamation point. God bless, exclamation
point, right? And he just keeps going.

315
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:40,320
He goes, he doesn't care. He doesn't
clean them either. He just sucks.

316
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:44,460
Elephant Cock only person
still rocking a Jheri curl.

317
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,500
So then I write back the number 11 and
he's still in the middle of his rent.

318
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,340
He goes, I'm a bad guy now cause
he's, cause he's still sucks cock.

319
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,470
And then he takes the bait and he
goes 11 what? And I go championships,

320
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,150
five super bowls, four world series,
one NBA title one Stanley Cup,

321
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,980
1417 years.

322
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,880
You'll tell your grandchildren about
it and then he just writes back.

323
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,260
You've changed man.

324
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,420
And then he continues. Whatever, man,

325
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,350
you didn't bring back that animal
Schilling and his fake bloody socks.

326
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,800
And I just never responded. So
I don't under, I don't, I'm,

327
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:28,830
I'm done near you. Don't understand
it. Like I'm going to have relapses.

328
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,780
Like when you bait me two times in the
face, right? That might send me back,

329
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:38,010
but I am done with this shit.
You just rolled your eyes.
You know what it is near,

330
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,340
you know, you know, in your heart of
hearts, if I fucking beat this thing,

331
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,450
you got nothing on me.

332
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,740
I work hard and make a great living.
I mean,

333
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,560

336
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,150
I love you to death, but you
know, you, you know something.

337
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,800
Could you quit yawning
into the microphone?

338
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,110
You're fucking dental office waiting room.

339
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,130
All right. I need been on the
podcast and so long. Oh Lord,

uh, I need to read some advertising here.

342
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,200
This first one's called

343
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,210
nobody.
What?

344
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,180
That's the sound of your voice,

345
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,500
right as I'm walking out the
door to go do something fun.

346
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,120
I just hear you from upstairs.

347
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,260
Swing by is always the opposite direction.
20 fucking miles.

348
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,310
I was going to ask you to bring home some
bananas on the away back from the gym,

349
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:59,780
but I thought better of it. Oh, you
did? I still would've done it, you know,

350
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:01,700
but I was like, no,
he's always saying that.

351
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:05,600
I always ask him to give to the other
day, cause I'm, I'm, I've, I was like,

352
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,010
fuck this,
this is going to be equal.

353
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:11,150
I asked you when my buddies were
coming up for the world series, I, oh,

354
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,940
you skipped a few steps there. What did
I skip? You asked me to go get some beer.

355
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah. And you said, okay. Oh Jesus. Yeah.

356
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:23,180
And then a half hour later you're
still laying there and I'm like, yeah,

357
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:25,490
you gotta go get that beer. And
you're like, oh, you were serious.

358
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,470
It's like, yeah, we're seriously my
row when you told me. So I was like,

359
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,820
you know you had a half hour to get
out of the road. Not to mention, yeah,

360
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,670
it was one in the afternoon. Fucking
laying around. Like who? Ella Deville.

361
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,260
All right, let me, it was this
Sunday. No it wasn't. Yeah,

Saturday. Can you please put the weekends?

363
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,350
We put that back. Why?
Why can't I look at it?

364
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,990
Put that down because I can look
at stuff that's in here now.

369
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,400

524
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,540
be there for Madison Square Garden.

525
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:09,680
I know it's going to be amazing because
the form was literally the best show

526
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:14,360
I've ever seen. You do. And I've known
you for years isn't I'd like to count.

best show I've ever seen.

You do and I've seen you
do like amazing shows.

529
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:25,910
But that forum one was like,
even when I talk to people about it now,

530
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,900
they'll just say it just from the
moment we walked in the door like that,

531
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:34,110
it's just the whole energy was electric
and I think the crowd was really excited.

532
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,630
You had a great crowd that night.
Like it was just, yeah, the crowd was,

533
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,260
it was really, really, yeah.
It was just great energy.

534
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:43,730
And like Joe and dean were bulges
on their a game. Like it was just

535
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,140
it, well Joe and dean walked out there
like they were doing a spot at the store,

536
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,260
which is like how you have
to be, right? Yeah, no,

537
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,800
they just went out there and they were
just like, Hey, what's up? And just, yeah,

538
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,010
when I was like, all right, well let
or intimidated by the venue, I guess.

539
00:33:57,011 --> 00:34:01,390
If they're not nervous, why should
I be? No, I'm very, uh, yeah, no,

540
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:04,030
it's a humbling experience in go out day,
just like,

541
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:06,760
I don't know if I ever get to
do this again. So I'm playing.

542
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,410
Yes. That's a, that's like your new
thing now is that you play the drums and,

543
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,070
and do then jam and then either they like,

544
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,440
I feel like you shake all the
nerves out of you by doing it.

545
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,460
Yeah. You just go, why don't you
just make a ton of noise? Yeah.

546
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,330
I did that at the garden and Boston.

547
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:28,830
I'm going to do what an MSG again
and a that the form too. Yup.

548
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,420
Oh, I played for like almost three
hours. My shoulder was killing me.

549
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,820
That's so great that they
let you do that though. Yeah.

550
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,220
Well at first I thought that
they would think that, yeah. Why?

551
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:39,330
What does this asshole doing that,

552
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:42,710
but then it's like this bands in
there all the time. 200 and up. Yeah.

553
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,200
And I think that they get a
kick out of the fact that, uh,

554
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,080
that we're acting like we won a
radio contest rather than coming in.

555
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,840
They're like, oh, another arena.
Right? Yeah. We come and they're like,

556
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,460
[inaudible] can't believe I'm here.

557
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,010
I mean, that's all we do. I saw Queens
of the stone age here that just,

558
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,520
I just freak out the whole time.
I'm there.

559
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,740
Wait, are we not going to talk
about the party yesterday?

560
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,410
Oh, how much you crushed that
frigging party? We had a,

561
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:17,480
the second annual kid, Halloween
baby Halloween, maybe Halloween,

562
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,770
maybe Halloween party.
You know how nightclubs are 21 and over.

563
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,700
This is, this was two years
and under and under that one.

564
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,610
It was adorable. First of all, but
now it was, it was really good.

565
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,580
The one little kid dressed
like a hedgehog. Oh my God.

566
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:36,910
The two little kids dress like hedgehogs.
There was two hedgehogs at the party.

567
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,930
I know. I thought that it was
gonna be friction. Um, snoopy, the,

568
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,080
the one family, one family came
dressed as Charlie Brown and Lucy.

569
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:50,720
That was the parents. And then snoopy was
the baby. Oh my God. It's so cute. There.

570
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,920
We had the tires,
the tires.

571
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,120
I love the tires that parents
showed up and just their,

572
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:00,150
their bathrobes and pajamas and they
kid. Oh, someone who's pajamas. Uh,

573
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,380
it was a very clever idea. It was you
went out and got us all skeleton costume.

574
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,960
Oh my God, wait, can we talk
about your skeleton cuts?

575
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,770
My skeleton slash gimp outfit that
you got me. It was a giant one.

576
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:16,380
Z with feet and hands. I didn't realize
that there was like gloves and feeding.

577
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,620
It wasn't clubs. It was all sewed
into it. There was no option,

578
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,901
there was no option.

579
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:25,940
Then we found out later on that night
that there was actually like the ski mass

580
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,310
thing that you were supposed to put
over your head. Like are you serious?

581
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,450
It was. It was definitely freaky. Yes.

582
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,420
And then you had the
most craziest joke ever.

583
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,040
Yeah. Last night I go,
Jesus Christ, they go,

584
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,690
there was a fucking ski mask thing
with that and then you laugh,

585
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,520
you said put that on and fuck me.

586
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,160
And I was even a even that
made me uncomfortable.

587
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,030
And I know you were fucking
joking obviously, but I
was like Jesus Christ Nia.

588
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,460
Cause it literally looked like it again.

589
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,260
Put it over your head. And it was, I guess

590
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,860
skeleton. The only thing that was
missing was the zipper mouth. So offline.

591
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,620
So scary. Yeah. That was a
one and done or put that on.

592
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,280
Fuck me.
Unbelievable.

593
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,540
Oh my God.

594
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,230
Horrible. But no, that was
um, that was a fun time.

595
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,760
Thank you so much for your help with
that. All right, great. Okay. Okay.

596
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,730
I am, I'm going to take you
to a Mike class at some point.

597
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:35,820
You literally have it laying
horizontal across your chest. I know.

598
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,270
Could I be like any laser

599
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,340
zero right now with my energy.

600
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,740
I'm comfortable now. I'm finally in a
comfortable spot. I got the blanket.

601
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,173
I felt good.

602
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,130
Yeah,
you were supposed to be working right now.

603
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:52,310
He's supposed to be this training people
and you're sitting there looking more

604
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,870
like a,
they took vacations together.

605
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,410
MMM.

606
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,060
All right. No, but the uh,
the caterers were amazing.

607
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,190
All the food was amazing and thank
you Twitter for your ear playlist

608
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:09,810
suggestions. I think people on Twitter,
but I want to thank you guys again.

609
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,620
You crushed it.
So a lot of good ideas.

610
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,620
You had all this great music and then all
of a sudden it would just go into like

611
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:18,220
thriller Michael Jackson and
everybody get all psyched at that.

612
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,210
And then it'd be something
that would be like baby Shaq,

613
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:23,990
Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee baby should,
I was trying to do that.

614
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,960
Does that song go once that's
in your head, you're done.

615
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:31,050
It's done. It's done. And I
had three different versions
of, are you seeing areas?

616
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,180
Yeah, I don't remember. Baby Shark.

617
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:37,890
Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee baby
check Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee

618
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:43,360
baby check mommy. Shucked it
duty. It doesn't go to do, to do,

619
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:47,350
to do to, no, it doesn't. How does it go?
It doesn't do that. You didn't even hit,

620
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:50,050
you didn't even know what the
song was until I played it.

621
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:52,860
So how do you know how it goes?
How's it go then? I don't remember,

622
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,170
but it doesn't go like that. Yeah. Well
there's, there's a few different versions.

623
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,170
There's a slower one that goes baby

624
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,240
shock Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo do
doo baby sharp dude, dude, dude,

625
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,690
that's the one baby shower.
Maybe Shark Dude. Dude, dude,

626
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,300
bitch, the fuck is up. There
is a many different versions.

627
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,670
Face Dude, dude, dude, dude,
dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

628
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,090
The judge your face

629
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,290
fast one though.
That was the first one I heard.

630
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:29,200
Maybe that was the first one I heard.
Oh wait, maybe it works with that voice.

631
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:34,201
And then I heard BB and then there's an
RMB version one that I play at the party

632
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:39,560
as well I think is firing on all cylinder.
Oh they're a spicy Margarita.

633
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,220
Has two of those bad boys.

634
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,650
All kinds of delicious food. We had like
the toys and the games out for the kids.

635
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,380
Yeah, it was a good time. It was a
good time. Yeah. And now it's over. No,

636
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,270
it's so far right now I have to go
return all those tables and chairs.

637
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:57,580
How cute with the little kid chairs.
Oh,

638
00:39:57,581 --> 00:40:01,780
and they actually sat in them and they
were coloring and putting stickers on

639
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:03,580
construction paper.
It was so cute.

640
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,210
I like the little kids at that age.

641
00:40:05,211 --> 00:40:07,910
Like they just like there'll be two
little kids just looking at each other and

642
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:09,950
another kid just runs up super fast.

643
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:13,130
And then just stops and then he'd just
stare at each other and then they all

644
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:15,530
just run to go to something.

645
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,110
You know, our, um,

646
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,430
our neighbor texted me and she
was asking how the party was,

647
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,350
she has older kids and she was like,

648
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:28,970
you probably had a much more controlled
situation cause her kids are older and

649
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:31,790
she's like, when they get older, once
it's like foreign ops, she's like,

650
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:34,560
every party is completely
insane because it's,

651
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:36,290
their energy is all over the place anyway.

652
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,750
And then they have candy and she was like,

653
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:43,751
please enjoy like the kind of controlled
atmosphere that you have with this age

654
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,560
group. But I was like, no, I know.

655
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,570
That's why I wanted to keep it to one
under cause they're just insane. Right?

656
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:51,410
Like don't you think?

657
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,590
Uh, no, I wasn't aware of any
of this storm front. Yeah.

658
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,010
Well apparently, well, whatever
I'm going to comment on.

659
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,020
Oh Wow. What are you going to do?
Yeah, I mean whatever happens,

660
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:05,940
I know that me and my siblings did
tenfold to my mother, so I have a common,

661
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,810
um, all right, that's the
podcast. Um, now I go,

662
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,880
now we're going to be listening to a clip
of a uninformed. I'm the first one in,

663
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:18,690
I don't know how many years. 10 years.
That's got to be on the Patrion page.

664
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,310
That is going to be debuting November 5th,
November 5th.

665
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,740
Excuse me,
I just burped November 5th.

666
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,820
You're going to talk to me
about microphone etiquette.

667
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,920
You know what? You're right. See
that guys, that's how it works.

668
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:35,950
You want to get along with your wife.
Just learn that phrase. You know what?

669
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,610
You're right. All right. That's it.
Have a wonderful weekend. Your consent.

670
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,483
Dionne.

671
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,420
I never one of those ones do it.
If I could go back in time.

672
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,130
I've worked in so many kitchens.
I've never seen so many jail bird.

673
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,970
I've never seen him get over and
fucking wash some. I've never,

674
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,860
we're going to get you. I've never seen
so many fat men do so much cooking.

675
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,910
It's like, Dude, oh, this doesn't make any
fucking say no. I've told you this story.

676
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,910
I got a classic one, our manager, right?

677
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,210
The manager where I
worked. Uh, I was a busboy,

678
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:55,510
so I used to have to mop up around the
oyster bar and they had like the black

679
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:57,490
and white towels like the old
improv's used to have. Right.

680
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,160
So I'm mopping that up and I'll
always be a fucking mess. Yeah.

681
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,310
And then I would have to mop up and
clean the men's room and the women's room

682
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:05,250
and a women's room always look like,
you know,

683
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,330
like the Yankees just
won the world series.

684
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:11,020
It was just like toilet paper and ticker
tape all over the whatever. It was just,

685
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,900
it was a fucking mess in that guys who
was just a pissed all over the place.

686
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,530
So I go in there to clean the
bathroom and my manager is in there.

687
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:22,080
He's got the water on full blast and
he's brushing his teeth while puking.

688
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,020
Swear to God he's prejudice,
maybe go like,

689
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,690
oh wow.

690
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,160
And he had the water and keep going and
then he just kept brushing his teeth and

691
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:32,380
I was sitting there,
I didn't know what to do.

692
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,210
Aw.
They just

693
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,500
kept brushing his fucking teeth and then
he just saw it and then he played it

694
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:41,380
off going like, ah, you know,

695
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:46,300
it goes brushing the teeth sometimes
it makes me gag and I'm thinking about

696
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:49,540
though, fucking jam the toothbrush
down your throat, your fucking whore.

697
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,570
And it wasn't till I was only 19 right.

698
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,610
So what does it until years later that I
was like, oh, he was fucking hung over.

699
00:43:57,611 --> 00:43:59,860
He just was fucking puke it up alcohol

700
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,760
and he was probably standing there puking.

701
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:06,520
Then I came in and then he was just trying
to act like he was brushing his teeth.

702
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,590
Like I wasn't going to notice
that he was fucking puking,

703
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:13,300
but I was standing there and go over
the brush. Gee, that guy was stuck.

704
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:15,550
I was so funny. I remember he'd
go for it, believe it or not,

705
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:18,930
he ends up getting fired.
Right? He gives to, yeah,

706
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,690
he gets fired and then he
gets a job managing another
restaurant as they all do.

707
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,650
Yeah. You walked out onto the floor and
an eight ball fell out of your pocket,

708
00:44:26,651 --> 00:44:29,470
you're fired. And then like
they won't even go across town.

709
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,130
They'd be across the fucking,
like the, the, the Strip mall.

710
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,800
So this guy ends up getting another job,

711
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:36,480
making way more money and I swear to God,

712
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:39,480
he showed up like a week
later with his new job,

713
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:42,750
he had bought a brand new car
and he came over to peacock,

714
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,120
like we gave a fuck and he pulled up
with some white Subaru sports cars.

715
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,620
I can't even know what the fuck he had.
And he just kicked can,

716
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,860
he just was sitting there at
the fucking bar with this cat,

717
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:56,490
ate the canary smile on his face. I said,
hey man, how you doing? I said, hey,

718
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:58,860
is that your karate? He's
like, yeah, I want to drive it.

719
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:02,460
And he slid the keys across the barge.
Jesus Christ. Yeah. I swear to God.

720
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:06,720
It was like I was in road house. The Dude
restaurant workers are like dirty cops.

721
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:11,160
They just get shuffled off. Oh, you
dirty fucking precinct. Oh yeah. No,

722
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,900
you're there once you're in your
end, dude. It doesn't matter.

723
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,120
No Monday,

724
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:15,860
Eh,

725
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,530
yes,

726
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,503
it's back.

727
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,990
So oops.

728
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,900
Can't, you can't, you
can't. You can't. You cards.

729
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,940
What's going on? It's Bill Burger.
It's the Monday morning podcast.

730
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:39,040
That was the worst fucking mix ever done.
I don't give a fuck. I'm in my pajamas.

731
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:43,000
What do you want for me?
The Monday morning podcast for Monday,

732
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,440
November 1st. Oh my God.
It's almost thanks Kevin.

733
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,920
This motherfucker is back on iTunes,

734
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,840
so everybody relax you
a fucking smart phones.

735
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,980
Okay, relax. You can
download it. It is back.

736
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,710
I don't know why it's back.
I don't know why it went away.

737
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,740
It went away like somebody
drunk mother a couple of months,

738
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:14,010
you know, couple of months back. She
started drinking. This Shiv is Rico.

739
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,060
Yeah.
Got a little tipsy.

740
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:19,930
She went out to the bar and she never
came back and then all of a sudden she

741
00:47:19,931 --> 00:47:24,460
just comes walking back into our
lives. No apology. No nothing.

742
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,800
Ma. Where the fuck you Ben.
Okay. Jerry. Just it alone.

743
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,870
All right. She's sober.
Um, yeah, I dunno what,

744
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,760
I don't know what happened with fucking
iTunes. I don't know what I said.

745
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:39,430
I don't know what I did.
There was no explanation.

746
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:44,770
Actually there wasn't an explanation, but
it's too fucking boring to get into. Um,

747
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,020
I use the wrong punctuation.

748
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:51,460
Some sort of quotes when I put the
money more. No, I used an Asterick,

749
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,890
you know, little Barry bonds, little
Sammy Sosa, little Mark McGuire,

750
00:47:56,891 --> 00:48:01,810
little Roger Maris action when I went
to go post it and then they just,

751
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:05,950
they just took me off, you know, and
like some mean little seventh grade girl,

752
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:07,420
they just refuse to talk to me.

753
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,740
We were BFFs and it was fucking
over and there was no reason,

754
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,350
complete overreaction.

755
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,050
So for the last fucking 35
days is so we were like, dude,

756
00:48:19,051 --> 00:48:23,200
what the fuck are, you know, I thought
we were friends. So anyways, we're back.

757
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,150
We're back on iTunes and if you guys have,
you know,

758
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:28,270
your smartphones or whatever the
hell it is, you can download it.

759
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:32,020
You can download it to your iPod, you
can go right back to fucking off at work.

760
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:35,920
Isn't that great? Isn't that phenomenal?
Doesn't that make you feel good?

761
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,620
Uh, as you could see, uh, I kind of
sound excited. This is like one of these,

762
00:48:41,621 --> 00:48:44,580
these episodes where I'm going to be
a little manic because not only am I

763
00:48:44,581 --> 00:48:47,710
excited that the eye, uh, the
podcast is back on iTunes.

764
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,280
I'm also a freaking out cause I have
a ton of shit that I have to do today.

765
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,370
So to be honest with you guys,
after this wonderful Intro,

766
00:48:57,371 --> 00:49:00,220
I'm just here to tell you I really don't
have time for you fuckers this week.

767
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:03,730
What are you think about that?
Um,

768
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,000
all right, what are we going to
talk about this week? Let's, let's,

769
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:08,440
let's open the page.

770
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:12,340
Is Open the page Nia closing the
door cause I'm being too loud.

771
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,680
It what's it matter Nia?
He afraid of the funny,

772
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,590
she's in a mood, but
aren't they always? Oh,

773
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:24,580
I got a smile and it really
annoyed me this weekend. Uh, I was,

774
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,570
I was in Saint Louis, Mi
me in Saint Louis, Louis,

775
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,020
me,
me at the fair though.

776
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:36,880
Tell me the lights are shining
and he plays spot there.

777
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:41,290
We will dance though. Who Cheat?
Coochie. You will be something else.

778
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:45,540
That is a sexual innuendo bond.
It's the 19 fucking forties.

779
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:50,170
So we can't talk about banging.
I'm sorry,

780
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,780
Mitch Miller Baby.
What was my first album?

781
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,470
Sing along with Mitch and the gang and
I just found out that motherfucker just

782
00:49:56,471 --> 00:50:01,030
died. That son of a bitch was
like 90 something years old.

783
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:05,800
Still Putting Grecian formula and
his beard. God bless them. Um,

784
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:09,400
not Jesus.
Why did I sing that stupid fucking song?

785
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:11,710
I forgot what the hell was going
to talk about. Let's go back.

786
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:13,300
Let's try to go back into the memory bank.

787
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:17,050
I was in Saint Louis this week and uh,

788
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:22,030
I did a benefit for the children,
John Carney carnies kids.

789
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:24,460
I did that a Friday night,
Saturday night.

790
00:50:24,461 --> 00:50:26,590
I did the funny bone two
shows that the funny bone.

791
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:30,590
I want to thank everybody who showed
up at a wonderful time out there.

792
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,840
And um, if you guys want to go back in
time and reach back into a little bit of

793
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:40,841
Americana that you feel was lost during
the last 20 years of horrific moves,

794
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,110
you know, I got an idea.
Let's come up with Nafta.

795
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,990
Let's stand all the manufacturing
out of this fucking country.

796
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,100
And then someday when we want a fact
we got to compete with sweatshop labor.

797
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,770
Does that sound like good idea?
I think that's a good fucking idea.

798
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,040
I have an idea. Let's have a war. Fuck.

799
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:04,460
Let's have two wars at
the same fucking tab.

800
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,740
How are we going to pay for it? Borrow
money from China. That sounds good to Mei.

801
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,700
Why am I blaming it on southerners?
I Dunno why.

802
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,681
I Dunno.
Why?

803
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:20,030
Because the last two guys were from
Arkansas and then the other guy was from

804
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:23,630
Texas.
You know La.

805
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,190
You realize before Obama,

806
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:28,190
the last two presidents should have
been on the food network or one of those

807
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:31,190
barbecue offs.
You know I'm trying to compete.

808
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:35,750
Who has the best fucking sauce?
Mine's vinegar based and his,

809
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,700
his is more molasses. Okay.
That's that sweet stuff.

810
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,330
You put that sweet stuff phone cause
you don't know how to cook a good piece

811
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,290
mate. You're not a good, you
know how to cook. Good Pace. Me.

812
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,110
You don't need go desk fleets up
equally. Little bit of vinegar. Ireland.

813
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:52,220
I come from the foot hills North
Carolina we use, we use vinegar. Sorry.

814
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:57,260
He started using that, then that sweet
stuff he talks about Kansas City. Um,

815
00:51:59,090 --> 00:51:59,960
anyway,
so if you want to,

816
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:03,450
if you want to reach back into America
a little bit and just a, if you want to,

817
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:08,150
if you have children and you want them
to see what this country used to be like

818
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:12,770
back in the day when you
could eat cheeseburgers and
French fries and a fucking

819
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,240
drink it God damn chocolate
malt and somehow not end
up being a fat fuck because

820
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:24,200
there wasn't all these God damn
preservatives in it. Right?

821
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,520
Isn't that what it makes you fat?

822
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,700
How can I make people used to eat like
no one knew shit about nutrition in the

823
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:32,090
1950s yet everybody kind of
seemed like they weren't in shape.

824
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:37,370
You know, granted they were
fucking openly racist and uh,

825
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,250
grabbing their secretaries
ass every five seconds,

826
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:43,490
but they were in much better shape.
If you want to go back into time,

827
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:48,491
go to Saint Louis because St Louis is
one of the few places I have been to and

828
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:53,360
the last eight years that you can still
smoke in comedy clubs and you could

829
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:57,440
smoke in bars and people just light
up. And I, and I was amazed by it,

830
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:58,911
you know,

831
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:03,680
even though I kind of remembered that
you hadn't been there in five years, but,

832
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:08,000
uh, there's just certain states they just,
they just, um, they don't give a shit.

833
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,940
Like when they see the surgeon
general come on TV, they just like,

834
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:15,590
I don't recognize that uniform. He
ain't no fucking Americans. So, uh,

835
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:20,000
they completely ignored. So if you want
to go back in time with your child,

836
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:20,511
you know,

837
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:25,511
if you're tired of reminiscing with your
adolescent son or daughter about how I

838
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,830
used to be able to go in a bar
and have a drink and a smoke,

839
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,370
why not live it?
Why not go to Saint Louis?

840
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,240
I think that they should add that to
their tourist attractions right up there

841
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:40,650
with the, uh, with the arch,
the gateway to the west,

842
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,900
so to speak. I actually hung around for
an extra day yesterday and I went to the,

843
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:50,760
uh, the Saint Louis Rams
game first. The, uh, the,

844
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:55,440
uh, the Carolina Panthers and is
boring as part of the game was,

845
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,600
it was kind of exciting to watch a team
that you could tell was going to be

846
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:03,630
fucking good. And about
a year or two, the ramps,

847
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,240
remember you heard it
first, November 1st, 2010,

848
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,220
right here at Sam Bradford I think
is the real fucking deal. Guys.

849
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:17,400
Cool as a cucumber.
He's driving the damn team down the field,

850
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,180
even though his top three receivers
are all out for the season.

851
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,960
He was throwing it to
white guys all day long.

852
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:27,930
That's how many injuries
they have on that team.

853
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,440
They're all the way down to
the white receivers people.

854
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,340
And I know what you're going to
say. What about Wes? Welcome.

855
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,590
All right, Wes Welker, that white dude
who played for Denver, there's not a lot,

856
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:44,910
you know, but slowly but surely, I don't
know if you've noticed the white guy is,

857
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:49,560
is, is making a little bit of
inroads back into, into some, uh,

858
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:54,690
what do they call those
positions? Performance or a
speed positions. You know,

859
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,430
there's a couple of white running backs.

860
00:54:56,431 --> 00:55:00,450
Did you ever think you're going to see
that again? I mean, I couldn't believe it.

861
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:01,530
I'm in Saint Louis.

862
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,420
People are smoking within structures and
there's a white quarterback thrown to a

863
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:10,290
white wide receiver. It
was unbelievable. It was,

864
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:13,530
I was waiting for Larry Zonker to come
walking out on the field with that little

865
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:18,510
fucking, you know, the two
bars across his face. And then
that one, the, the, the, the,

866
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,280
the horseshoe he had on top.

867
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,680
That's why I don't fucking
respect the God damn. 72 dolphins.

868
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:29,740
They had two white running
backs. Okay. And you go, oh,
we went undefeated. Did Ya?

869
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,690
Who'd you play in the third week? Some
group of people from the fucking why MCA?

870
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,920
You fucking pricks. What'd
you have? 14 you've 40.

871
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,810
I need to do is win 14 fucking games.
14 game season.

872
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,620
You cheap bastards.
Oh God.

873
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:48,690
That fucking loss to
the giant still hurts.

874
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:53,691
But you know what feels good watching
the Goddamn jets lose nine to nothing.

875
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:56,700
I love it.
I love it.

876
00:55:56,701 --> 00:55:59,850
And here are the Patriots are
right in a rebuilding fucking year.

877
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:04,320
We've got a bunch of God damn kids
play in defense. We Trade Randy Moss,

878
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:08,610
all these asshole Jeff fans a fucking go.
Oh with the Patriots.

879
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:13,230
Fucking quit with a nervous. They could
be the judge. The today picked up Dave.

880
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:17,310
That's what a great coach bill Belicheck
is. All right, you fucking assholes.

881
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:18,481
How do you like that?

882
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:22,890
Six and one with a bunch of
children playing defense.

883
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,000
Six and one best record in the NFL.
I don't know how the fuck we did it.

884
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:32,740
I got it.
I got to admit I'm not gonna.

885
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,130
I'm not going to believe that we're
actually going to do something.

886
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:40,690
And unless we, we beat
the Steelers and, uh,

887
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,080
we play the Steelers in the jets and a,
even if we go one on one,

888
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:48,490
if we're competitive, then I'm, I'm
going to get excited. But, uh, you know,

889
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:53,410
I dunno with our defense at this point
is halfway to be in good, I feel,

890
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:57,760
but I'm, I'm telling you don't
sleep on the fucking rams.

891
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:02,740
I should have bet those sons of bitches
I show I had no idea what was going on

892
00:57:02,741 --> 00:57:06,520
down there in Saint Louis.
And they got that maniac. Uh,

893
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,930
the fuck is his name, number
55. That kid from Ohio State,

894
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,390
God damn it, what the hell
was his name? Something itis.

895
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,300
Dad's like a professional wrestler.

896
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,780
He went in and he got a sack and he
did the fucking Hulk Hogan, you know,

897
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,620
putting his cup in his ear and then
he did the flex and then I was great.

898
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,150
It was fucking great.
I Dunno what the jets lost.

899
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:34,120
I'm so fucking excited. Cause all those
assholes and you know, it's funny,

900
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,240
I didn't get one goddamn fucking email
from any of those goddamn jet fans who've

901
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:44,650
been giving me shit all these
weeks. You know, fucking idiots.

902
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,710
They're not idiots. You know what they
are? They're hopeful. Sons of bitches,

903
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:49,030
they have a one in 40 years.

904
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:54,180
They get excited about little things
like drafting fucking Mark Sanchez,

905
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,300
Sanchez.

906
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,430
You know what's going to be the end
of the jet season if one of your

907
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:05,431
unbelievably awesome offensive lineman
goes down with an injury that fucking

908
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:10,420
goddamn mediocre overrated
jackass. Overrated. This week,

909
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:12,190
mark fucking Sanchez,

910
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,700
that gay managing jackass.

911
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:21,010
Good Lord fucking sit behind
the Goddamn Berlin Wall.

912
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,780
You could have fucking rex Grossman in
there and he could throw for 180 yards.

913
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:30,610
No picks. You're not impressing
me. Speaking to that man,

914
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,040
I had the fucking reds.
I got my ass handed to me yesterday.

915
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,930
Thank God I picked the dolphins,

916
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:39,780
the dolphins getting one
and Cincinnati and a,

917
00:58:39,781 --> 00:58:41,500
I love the dolphins.
I loved them.

918
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:45,130
They got that fucking defense and the
Bengals have been sputtering all fucking

919
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:47,770
year. So I said, fuck it. I'll
take death. So I won that one.

920
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:53,230
Then I had the Redskins, Donovan McNabb
going into play the lines, but typical me,

921
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:54,460
I don't read up on sports.

922
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:56,890
I didn't know that their quarterback
was coming back for the lines.

923
00:58:56,891 --> 00:59:01,480
I don't even know what his fucking
name is. Stafford, something like that.

924
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:05,440
I had no fucking idea. And then when,
when the whole game's on the line,

925
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,910
including my fucking money,

926
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:10,660
you take Donovan McNabb out
and you put in Rex Grossman,

927
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,391
the guide,

928
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:16,900
the cult secretly fucking paid
off the bears to be quarterback.

929
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:21,040
So Peyton manning could finally get his
fucking ring after they went into the

930
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:25,160
Goddamn rule book and change the rules
so Peyton could fucking actually beat the

931
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,930
patriots in the fucking playoffs,

932
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,850
playoffs and whatever.
And I'm just talking shit.

933
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,580
I actually took the colts tonight.
As much as I hate it,

934
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:37,580
I'm going to have to fucking root for
the colts because I could go up to games

935
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:42,290
on Paul Versey who almost went all in
for last week. Missed. I know sports.

936
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:46,940
Paul Versey, are you listening? He
went one in three yesterday and I uh,

937
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,300
I've got one or two, but I have, I
have the colts tonight. Loving them,

938
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,430
loving them to avenge their
loss to the Houston Texans.

939
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,820
I don't even know what the fucking
spread is cause I don't give a shit.

940
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,840
I really don't give a shit. I just
like pissing people off. Let's get,

941
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:07,070
let's get home with the podcast.
Um, it is November 1st everybody.

942
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,630
And um, did you guys all have a nice
Halloween? Did you have a nice Halloween?

943
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,160
Do, did Brett Farve die yesterday? Did
you guys see that shit? Jesus Christ,

944
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:21,590
he looked like somebody kicked
him in the balls from behind.

945
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:29,480
The way he was laying there with
his fucking knees up to his dealer.

946
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:33,230
He was going to get an enema. It's
like, what are you doing to do dude?

947
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:37,070
You own every fucking record out there.
Good and bad.

948
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:41,660
What are you going for? The mediocre
ones now I don't understand this guy.

949
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:44,090
It's just, just, just walk away.

950
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:49,340
I don't like how he's patting himself on
the back too. You know, I got hit in a,

951
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:52,100
that's a hit that, you know, I don't think
a lot of people would've got up from,

952
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:57,050
but you know, I had on some
wrangler underwear and I just said,

953
01:00:57,051 --> 01:01:01,400
fuck it. He is a tough son
of a bitch. But you know,

954
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:06,170
I don't know what he's trying this, his
wife hate him at this point. Um, yeah,

955
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,130
keep playing. I don't give a shit show
and you dick to everybody. Fuck you.

956
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,290
Um, oh, here's something that I actually,

957
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:19,550
I never even addressed.
All right. Brett said that,

958
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:23,240
that annoyed me and Colby Bryan a couple
months ago when Lebron was doing his

959
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:26,990
big decision thing,
when he finally decided to go to Miami,

960
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:29,420
Coby made this statement,
I forget if I brought this up.

961
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:33,380
They ask Coby if he would have done the
same thing and he goes, no, I wouldn't.

962
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:38,510
I would've stayed. And a, I thought
that was kind of Kentucky. It's like,

963
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,650
well that's easy for you to say when
you fucking play for the Lakers and they

964
01:01:42,651 --> 01:01:46,190
bring all the free agents to you.
You know,

965
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,030
there's been no reason
for you to fucking leave

966
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,010
your whole fucking career.
They've been bringing you guys,

967
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,790
you were playing in Cleveland.
You would have left Colby.

968
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:03,380
You almost left because you didn't like
Shaq either. He goes through, I go,

969
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:07,030
I'm sick of when it championships.
Um,

970
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,570
it's all fucking career. They
brought you Shaq, Dennis Rodman,

971
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:16,580
Phil Jackson, Karl Malone,
Gary Payton, Robert Henri,

972
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,200
[inaudible], Saul, fucking that dude
who choked the people that I had off.

973
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:25,200
I don't watch fucking basketball.
Who's that guy there?

974
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:29,070
A Jesus Christ. So he, he's still
a bit of bottom. I say his name.

975
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:33,960
Every God damn night teams. Jermaine
O'Neal slid across the floor,

976
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:37,710
punch that guy in the face. Ah,
whatever the fuck his name is.

977
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:42,990
Latrelle fucking third cousin.
They've brought you a list.

978
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,960
Fucking free agencies.
Your entire Goddamn Korea.

979
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:47,890
I thought that was a real
country move for someone who,

980
01:02:47,891 --> 01:02:52,650
who is allegedly Lebron's friend.
But how funny is it watching, uh,

981
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:58,050
Lebron's people sitting there trying to
do damage control with these stupid ass

982
01:02:58,051 --> 01:03:01,170
fucking commercials?
Trying to get people to a,

983
01:03:01,171 --> 01:03:03,270
I don't know what changed their
opinion about him. I mean,

984
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:06,660
I could really give a shit. It's just
like, just fucking go play basketball.

985
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:11,660
I don't give a fuck. What
would I do that? Well,

986
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:13,020
what would I, what would I do? I would,

987
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,950
I would not even be able to make it on
my eighth grade basketball team if I

988
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:20,130
remember correctly. So I, I don't
know what I would do. Lebron.

989
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,570
I haven't had to make decisions
like anywhere near that level.

990
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:28,170
I don't care. I don't
care about you. And yet,

991
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,560
talcum powder and your little
fucking ritual. I could give a shit.

992
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:33,480
Just fucking go out and entertain me.

993
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,640
I don't need you to try to Redo your
fucking image, you know? I don't know.

994
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:41,640
So what,
you can make $100 billion.

995
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,930
Don't you have enough? Isn't it
enough? You get free sneakers?

996
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,720
I don't even know what
I'm talking about people.

997
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:52,140
I'm just fucking thinking about all the
shit I have to do for the rest of the

998
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,850
day. That's what I'm doing
in this podcast right now.

999
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:57,720
I'm cleaning the dirt out
of my keyboard and, uh,

1000
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,960
speaking in what, you
know, what I'm dying to do,

1001
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:05,990
I'm dying to fucking replace
some of the tile in my bathroom.

1002
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,080
You know, this is the latest
thing I'm obsessed with.

1003
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:14,720
I'm obsessed with learning how to fix
shit around the house because I'm going to

1004
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:19,721
buy a house and I'll be fucked if I'm
going to pay some fucking mouth breathe in

1005
01:04:20,471 --> 01:04:24,390
jackass with Dickies hanging off
his goddamn ass to come in there and

1006
01:04:24,391 --> 01:04:27,720
overcharged me for parts cause he wants
to have a fucking kegger that weekend,

1007
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,870
you know? So if you want to learn
how to do shit right, I eat this.

1008
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,500
You do it. You do it in the
apartment that you're living in.

1009
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,670
See, like my dog clawed
up some of the, uh,

1010
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,510
some of the trim around
the door and a man,

1011
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:49,350
it's a fucking joke. I'm looking
at it going, this is this,

1012
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,220
this can't be this fucking difficult.
I'd go down to home depot,

1013
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,200
they got precut shit down there,

1014
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:59,520
so all I gotta do is get the shit
that's the same fucking size.

1015
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:03,120
I trim it off the bottom,
make sure it fits.

1016
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,030
Slap it on there. Right.
Who cares if I fuck up?

1017
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:14,520
It's not my place. It's all a little bit
of pain over. Nobody's going to notice.

1018
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,750
My landlord doesn't listen
to this podcast, does he?
No. Seriously. I want to.

1019
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:21,730
I want to learn how to fucking do that.

1020
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:24,970
Some of that shit already
know how to take a toilet out.

1021
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:26,590
Can take the whole fucking thing apart.

1022
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:31,780
I know how to take a fucking sink out now.
I don't know how to do that shit.

1023
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:34,570
I just watched a couple youtube videos,
but it gave me confidence.

1024
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:38,230
I'm confident with the sink that you,
you fucking set down into the counter.

1025
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,180
That one that you got
to go underneath with.

1026
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,760
I don't know how that's when
you're dealing with gravity.

1027
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,500
I like the one that sits down in it.

1028
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:48,160
You can just unhook everything and then
figure out how to hook it back up later.

1029
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:51,460
You know you go to turn on the hot
water and all of a sudden the garbage

1030
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:55,420
disposal goes on in the fucking kitchen.
I want to learn how to do that shit,

1031
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:00,670
but, uh, I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. All
right, let's, let's, let's,

1032
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:04,360
let's get to some youtube videos
of the week people, shall we, um,

1033
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,920
first one and these are all going to
be, uh, on the, uh, the man podcast.com,

1034
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:14,130
the official website of the Monday morning
podcast that is back on iTunes as you

1035
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:20,740
heard earlier with my horrible
singing. Um, all right. Here,

1036
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:22,930
they all are in, these aren't,
these aren't even youtube videos.

1037
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:25,930
These are videos that I got everywhere,
but youtube because a,

1038
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:26,950
everybody's on Youtube,

1039
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:29,470
so I'm trying to go a little bit outside
the box with some of the shit that

1040
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:34,000
people send me. Um, this is one.

1041
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:38,170
Um, ah, shit, I didn't know
what the fuck to call it.

1042
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:42,130
Just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com
and check this one out. Um,

1043
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,320
a buddy of mine stand up, comedian,
uh, Rob Cantrell, fucking hilarious.

1044
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,430
Really original guy. Um,
comedian and I think, um,

1045
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,120
I think it was the first season
of last comic standing he was on,

1046
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:56,650
that's the first time I saw him.
And I was like,

1047
01:06:56,651 --> 01:07:01,630
I like this dude because he doesn't seem
like he's trying to win the competition

1048
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:04,570
as much as he's trying to give
these people some quality stand up.

1049
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:09,180
And then you had the other guy fucking
going around with the Goddamn Ginsu Sorge

1050
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,510
fucking spinning it around. So of
course America votes for him. Right?

1051
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:18,520
That's how they do it. Gimme some
shiny shit. That's what I'm voting for.

1052
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:23,110
Um, he did a thing about why pot
should be legalized in this country.

1053
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:25,690
He made a great fucking
video that's supposed to, uh,

1054
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,100
it's supposed to be like the
beginning of that movie patent. Um,

1055
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:33,010
check that one out. Uh, there's
another one, a dude with Nub,

1056
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,050
k Kaos another guy.

1057
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,920
It's a guy with a,
yeah,

1058
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:43,240
he has only one arm and then he has
part of another arm and he fucking,

1059
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:43,901
he's in a,

1060
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:48,190
I don't know what to do and Muay Thai
and he movie knocks the other guy's

1061
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:52,090
fucking ass down out of the camp canvas.

1062
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:53,350
Um,

1063
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:58,350
next one is a touch my body karaoke fail,

1064
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:03,550
uh, with some English subtitles, even
though the guy's singing in English.

1065
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,120
And the last one actually comes from
the dude who runs the EMM podcast,

1066
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:10,810
who if you want to really,
if you want some advice on gambling,

1067
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:12,760
this is the guy he's on
a fucking hot streak,

1068
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:16,670
a crazy racist in coffee shop.

1069
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:20,540
Starts yelling at Mexican dude.
So there you go.

1070
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:25,100
There's your videos that you can watch
while you're at work or working out or

1071
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,200
whatever. Um, I got a lot of

1072
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:33,080
emails last week from me imitating
those dudes on the corner,

1073
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,920
so called white man. That shit.
Remember that last week? Um,

1074
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:41,990
somebody said a then pression
of the street preacher
with the bad pa was spot on

1075
01:08:41,991 --> 01:08:43,010
and fucking hilarious.

1076
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:48,011
There's a guy shouting in Spanish into
a blown out PA on the weekends in my

1077
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:51,060
neighborhood, there's two churches. Uh,

1078
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:56,930
there's two churches on every block.
And even the immigrants, immigrants,

1079
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,790
resonance, even the immigrant residents,
these, this all misspelled here.

1080
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:06,680
Immigrant residents grimace and give
him dirty looks. How do you say,

1081
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,980
quit shouting and fix
your levels in Spanish?

1082
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:17,170
That is a reoccurring thing that I
have found straight across the board.

1083
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:20,780
When people go out, I don't give a
fuck black, white, Latino, Asian.

1084
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:25,490
I don't give a shit. They never
have the levels correct in their PA.

1085
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:30,740
I think there's so passionate about their
politics that they never really, uh,

1086
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,910
I don't know.
And it's such a grass roots

1087
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,670
actually,
when you think about it,

1088
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:41,510
do you really think Obama knows
how to use a mixer? How old is he?

1089
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,990
Yeah, he probably doesn't.
He's like fucking,

1090
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:49,340
I don't even know how old the guys I
have not paid attention to politics in.

1091
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,250
I don't even know when. I have no
fucking idea when I just, I want,

1092
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:57,290
whenever I stopped talking
about conspiracy theory
theory cause I just got so

1093
01:09:57,291 --> 01:10:01,970
depressed about all of
the shit, um, you know,

1094
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:05,780
started reading up on banking.
Like here's a,

1095
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,180
here's something interesting here.
I,

1096
01:10:08,181 --> 01:10:11,450
this is one way I kind of see both sides
of this. This guy sent me this letter.

1097
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:12,860
He said about bill,
listen to this shit.

1098
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,030
So my wife and I are looking at
buying a house. Uh, like you,

1099
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:18,580
I am not the biggest fan of banks.

1100
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:21,020
So instead of putting all my
money in a savings account,

1101
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,430
I had been saving some cash on the
side and keeping it in my dresser.

1102
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:31,010
And there's a smart place to put it.
Why don't you stick it in the mattress?

1103
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:34,910
There's another, a
place you know, through,

1104
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,540
if you ever had that money stolen by
somebody breaking into your house,

1105
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:42,080
that burglars should have been dressed
up in the black and white stripe shirt

1106
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:44,720
with the, uh, uh, lone ranger.

1107
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:49,700
I'm a fucking a bank
robber. A mask. Maybe.

1108
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:51,480
Maybe you just saying you
put it in your dresser,

1109
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,670
your actually put it somewhere
else. You know, you gotta Cook.

1110
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:56,960
You gotta be a little more creative
than that. Uh, anyways, he says, well,

1111
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:01,190
when my wife talked to the bank about
getting alone, they asked us our incomes,

1112
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:05,000
how much money we saved and how we
would be paying our down payment.

1113
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:09,110
My wife sold in about our
savings and everything was fine.

1114
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,050
She then told them that I had
cash saved up on the side.

1115
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,230
They immediately stopped her and said
that the cash could not be used unless

1116
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:20,850
there was an explanation for how I got
it and a paper trail to back it up.

1117
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:25,230
The banks look at your financial history
bank statements and your spending

1118
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:30,030
habits to determine if you really could
save however much cash you actually

1119
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:33,030
have. A, since some of my money is cash,

1120
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,620
I've won from poker games and old stuff.
I sold on craigslist,

1121
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:39,690
craigslist.
I have no paper trail for it.

1122
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:44,550
The only way that I can now use it for
our house is to get my parents to lie and

1123
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:48,060
write a note explaining to the bank that
they gave me the money as a gift and

1124
01:11:48,061 --> 01:11:50,610
I'm not sure if that will work because
I don't know if they will check my

1125
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:54,180
parents bank risk records to confirm
that the whole policy is bullshit.

1126
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,340
I understand that the bank's fucked up
and had to foreclose on a lot of people

1127
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,130
and they want to make sure that I'm
not paying for a house with drug money,

1128
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:02,880
but come on.

1129
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,510
This essentially means that if I'm walking
down the street and find $20,000 in

1130
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:09,900
cash in an alley, take it and
try to use it as a down payment.

1131
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,230
The banks won't let me because
there's no record of how I got it.

1132
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,430
This whole ordeal really pisses me off
and I'm pretty sure it goes back to what

1133
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:20,610
you're trying to say about
how the government is trying
to phase out cash money.

1134
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,030
Uh, no, that doesn't, that's,

1135
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,370
that's one of those double standard
things that they do where you have to

1136
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:34,230
produce all this paper trail stuff to
show that you're not a piece of shit.

1137
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,000
But they, on the other hand, the
Federal Reserve I'm talking about, um,

1138
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:44,510
they've never been audited and we gave
them $1 trillion bail out money and it

1139
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:46,830
just disappeared in the thin air.

1140
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:50,610
They can't say who got it or where it
went and they're not being audited.

1141
01:12:50,611 --> 01:12:52,680
But you, on the other hand, you know,

1142
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:56,670
you sell an old skateboard and
your original fucking playstation,

1143
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,630
you win some money down the street and
a poker, you know, a poker tournament,

1144
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,560
none of that Shit. You know, you're
supposed to pay taxes on all of that shit.

1145
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:08,550
And if you found 20 grand coming down
the street, what you're supposed to do,

1146
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:12,570
you're supposed to report it, bring
it down to the police station. Okay.

1147
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:14,760
And hope that those fucking
guys don't dip into it.

1148
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,170
And I guess after a certain amount of
days, uh, it legally becomes yours,

1149
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:23,160
but then you have to pay taxes on
it and all that bit, all that shit.

1150
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:26,760
And all after the fees you probably left
with anywhere from eight to 10 grand.

1151
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:29,760
That's how your legally supposed to do it.

1152
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,820
And what's annoying to me
is that you and I are up.

1153
01:13:35,131 --> 01:13:40,110
We're, we're held to those legal
fucking standards, but banks are not.

1154
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:45,930
Banks are supposed to be watching
our money, keeping it safe. And they,

1155
01:13:45,931 --> 01:13:46,651
for basically,

1156
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:49,980
I don't know how many goddamn years
we're loaning it out to fucking homeless

1157
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:53,790
people given six figure loans to them.
And Lo and behold,

1158
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:57,900
when these fucking people defaulted on
their God damn loans and the whole thing

1159
01:13:57,901 --> 01:14:02,400
went into the shitter, the government
fucking bails them out. They're like,

1160
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:04,860
we're too big to fail.
They fucking bail him out.

1161
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,730
They keep the bail out money and now
they added all these countries surcharges

1162
01:14:08,731 --> 01:14:10,980
to your,
your account in my account.

1163
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:17,280
So yeah, that's, I dunno, this is what
you, this is what you do with your case.

1164
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,640
If you have cash on the side,
uh,

1165
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:22,810
use it for shit that you can
actually pay for in cash,

1166
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:27,610
I guess army or save it in
case your bank ever goes, uh,

1167
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,610
goes belly up and there's
a run on your bank.

1168
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:33,310
You won't be sitting there with your
pockets turned inside out going,

1169
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:38,050
can I at least have some yogurt?
But yeah, it is practically,

1170
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,260
um, the more you read
about banking, you'll,

1171
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:46,261
you'll start to understand
why corporations and and in,

1172
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:49,330
in or super rich, like you
know, the entrepreneurs,

1173
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:52,090
why these guys have offshore
accounts and all that type of shit.

1174
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:57,160
Because these guys basically, I think
read up on banking, which you would have,

1175
01:14:57,161 --> 01:15:01,390
do you read up on the tax laws and
you see how the whole game is played.

1176
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:06,160
You see who gets pink penalized and who
doesn't and you start thinking Jesus is

1177
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:08,680
fucking ridiculous.
So let me get this straight.

1178
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:12,530
When I get to this level of
wealth, all of a sudden, um,

1179
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:16,780
rules don't apply to me.
Okay,

1180
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:19,660
well let me work my ass off
to get to that level. Oh wait,

1181
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:23,950
I can't cause they keep taxing the shit
out of me. Oh, I get it. I got to do some,

1182
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:25,390
there will be bloodshed.
I mean,

1183
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:28,960
I'm really overly simple
simplifying the whole fucking thing,

1184
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:31,660
but that's basically how it goes down.
I mean,

1185
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:35,830
that bank is not going to take
that risk on you. You know,

1186
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,590
I got some cash on the side
that's actually good banking.

1187
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:41,770
You can't have somebody just come
in and be like a, hey listen,

1188
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:44,140
I got to be really stereotypical.
Now I'm going to be Italian.

1189
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:48,670
I already shit on fucking southerners.
Why not do a, an Italian stereotype? A,

1190
01:15:48,671 --> 01:15:51,280
I got, I got, I got good credit and I got,

1191
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:55,480
did I get this 50 grand in this side?
Where did I get it?

1192
01:15:55,481 --> 01:16:00,360
A why don't you let me worry about
that. All right. You know, I,

1193
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:05,230
I, you know, somebody else
actually sent me something,

1194
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:10,180
uh, about banks here. Hang on one second.

1195
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:15,181
Let me read this and annoying more
people actually majored in economics or

1196
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:20,170
economics. However the fuck
you say it. Uh, here we go.

1197
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,150
Here we go.
Let me read up on this shit here.

1198
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,540
You guys getting bored with this shit?
Well, I don't give a fuck. All right.

1199
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:29,200
I do give a fuck, but I didn't
care. I wouldn't be asking,

1200
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,940
but I'm going to continue. Hey, bill,

1201
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:35,020
I've been thinking some about something
you said about taxes on your podcast.

1202
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,000
It was about you trying to build,

1203
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:41,020
build up a pile of cash and how the
government governments hitting you up for

1204
01:16:41,021 --> 01:16:43,240
tax money at every opportunity.
Yeah, that's my thing.

1205
01:16:43,241 --> 01:16:45,970
I'm trying not to put
money in the stock market.

1206
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,860
I'm just trying to stick
it in the bank or whatever,

1207
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:52,660
and they just tax the living shit out of
me. But if I stick it on the crap table,

1208
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:58,270
right, which the fucking stock
market is, if I throw it in there,

1209
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:02,620
then they have no problem with it, then
all of a sudden they give me a tax break.

1210
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:06,370
Hey, get over here and
play the fucking game. Oh.

1211
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:11,600
Um, so anyways, uh, that's
anyway, let me get back to this.

1212
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:16,880
Uh, they hit you up for tax
money for every opportunity,

1213
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:20,780
but that there are rich fucks out
there who've already got there.

1214
01:17:20,781 --> 01:17:24,980
So they don't want to get, they don't
want anyone to get rich after them.

1215
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,220
There really is something to that.
Yeah, they got it. They got it.

1216
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,290
They have to keep you did,

1217
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:34,310
they can't have people making fucking
money and actually being able to keep it

1218
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:38,000
because if, if they do,
then nobody would work.

1219
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:42,530
We would just fucking kick back and relax
and maybe you have a chance to enjoy

1220
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:43,364
ourselves.

1221
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:47,840
Maybe sit by his stream in the Lotus
position or whatever the fuck it is you

1222
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:52,670
want to do. They want you to run on the
wheel until you're fucking drooling.

1223
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:57,140
And then they want whoever you created
to then take care of you in a nursing

1224
01:17:57,141 --> 01:18:01,890
home. And then if you can't,
they just want you to die. Um, I,

1225
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:06,710
uh, somebody, okay, I tweet, I
twigged I didn't know what that means.

1226
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:10,070
I twigged onto this about a year ago
when I was having a discussion with a

1227
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:12,500
friend about progressive income tax,

1228
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:16,850
he seemed to think that it takes
from the rich to give to the poor.

1229
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:20,270
And the progressive income tax is
anticapitalists. It's not though,

1230
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,060
because I don't know what the
fuck any of this means here.

1231
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:28,240
Because earned income tax are always
higher than rates on dividends and capital

1232
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:30,410
gains income. Let me, I get there,

1233
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:34,580
I can read that much slower because
earned income tax rates are higher than

1234
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:37,640
rates on dividends and
capital gains income. Okay?

1235
01:18:37,641 --> 01:18:41,390
So basically money that you
already have that's being invested,

1236
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,380
the tax rate is lower than someone who
is out there earning the nonworking heir

1237
01:18:45,381 --> 01:18:49,790
or heiress who survives on dividends
and capital gains from a family fortune

1238
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,950
like a Paris Hilton.
Uh,

1239
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:56,720
their income tax is on a much lower
percentage than a working person with an

1240
01:18:56,721 --> 01:19:00,470
equivalent income. So basically if
you're sitting around in your ass,

1241
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:04,790
you're some fucking luck. Lucky
rich kid. The money that you're,

1242
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:09,290
that you basically inherited,
that you are earning off of the sh the,

1243
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,620
there will be blood great
grandfather that you had.

1244
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:17,710
The tax rate will be lesser for the Paris
Hilton Kid than someone like me if I

1245
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:23,120
could earn, if I was earning that same
amount of money. Does that make sense?

1246
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:27,350
Make sense to me? Um, I hope I explained
that in a way you understand it.

1247
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:30,890
All right. The system punishes,
uh, work and reward rewards,

1248
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:35,060
ownership with tax rates that provide
incentives for one kind of economic

1249
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:36,590
activity over another.

1250
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,760
I base this on my
experience with my Canadian.

1251
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:44,840
This guy broke up with my book,
Canadian system and before I emailed you,

1252
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:46,880
I had to use Wikipedia,

1253
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:50,990
confirm to confirm that the u s
system works pretty much the same way.

1254
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:55,910
And right there this entire email gets
thrown out the window. Wikipedia, sir,

1255
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:01,160
what are you fucking me?
Maybe it does make sense on the podcast.

1256
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:03,230
Let's go with this Wikipedia information.

1257
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:09,630
The worst part of it is
that by implication work is
less valuable than capital.

1258
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:14,010
The woman making $8 an hour at Walmart
is paying the same percentage of income

1259
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:17,490
tax as the Walmart airs pay
on their divid dividends.

1260
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,530
A medical doctor however,

1261
01:20:19,531 --> 01:20:24,450
pays more than twice as much
and the doctor is patching
up the sick and wounded.

1262
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:27,120
The incentives in the
systems are all wrong.

1263
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:30,210
So you're basically saying the borderline,
uh,

1264
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,690
poverty person and the rich people are
paying the same amount of taxes in the

1265
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:37,770
guys in the middle may or getting
the shit tax out of them. Yes,

1266
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:42,270
exactly.
Exactly.

1267
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,460
That is my fucking life. God Damn. And
I have to hit pause here, people. I,

1268
01:20:48,461 --> 01:20:51,390
I gotta I gotta blow my nose.
Hang on a second.

1269
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,820
All right, I'm back. Sorry about
that. You don't what happened to me?

1270
01:20:56,821 --> 01:21:01,821
I was eating a bowl of wheat
checks too fast and uh,

1271
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,380
I didn't chew up the wheat checks enough,
so they went down,

1272
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:10,070
it was like swallowing,
chewing tobacco and it got soda.

1273
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,710
Like there was just like a bunch of like,
you know,

1274
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:17,460
it was in the back of my throat. So
I was like, I did that. And it's,

1275
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:20,420
some of it went up into my nose,
so it was actually rechecks

1276
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:26,730
one, I'm having a rough Monday.
Univer starting your weed off.

1277
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,910
You weed out your week off with
some week checks in your nose.

1278
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,740
We checks a healthy part of the
checks family. I would tell you guys,

1279
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:39,300
I'm a big fan of the uh, check cereals.
I like, we checks, I like corn checks.

1280
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:43,080
I don't like rice checks.
You know what I mean?

1281
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:48,570
It's like a fucking bad movie.
It's just weak. They're just,

1282
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:52,620
it's just a week cereal, you know? I
don't like those cereals that are like,

1283
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:57,270
oh my God, milk. That's what, that's what
rice checks does. It just fucking shit.

1284
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:00,600
It's a quitting cereal.
You know,

1285
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:06,090
corn checks has some fight in them.
Quick checks. I like the jets.

1286
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:09,390
We checks. I like the Patriots. We
checks our course the strongest.

1287
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:14,220
Eh, you green motherfuckers,
you lost this week.

1288
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,580
How do you like dead nine to nothing.

1289
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,620
I love the overpaid for your fucking
tickets and you're brand new.

1290
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:23,280
Fucking sublet an apartment
with the that the giants own.

1291
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:27,300
You know what?
They roll out a little bit of jet signage.

1292
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:29,880
Do you really think that
you won't 50% of that?

1293
01:22:29,881 --> 01:22:31,710
Do you really think that
you sons of bitches,

1294
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:37,070
what was it like to go to that boring
ass fucking game kick three nothing.

1295
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:40,860
J e t s what the fuck?

1296
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:46,470
Now the couple of fucking hours of
boring football kick six nothing.

1297
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,560
J e t is what the fuck?

1298
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:54,930
I might kick nine nothing.
Go home.

1299
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:00,090
Did the fireman cry this
week? Oh, I love it.

1300
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:05,390
Overrated talking shit before the season
even starts like you just won three

1301
01:23:06,341 --> 01:23:07,750
super bowls in a row.

1302
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:11,980
Underrated having your stomach stapled.

1303
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,010
Rex Ryan is getting better
looking every fucking week.

1304
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,620
Son of a bitch kind of has a
jaw line now, doesn't he? Um,

1305
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:25,870
all right. Just to be fair, um, I've
got to make fun of Celtics fans. Uh,

1306
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,900
overrated.
Channing overrated.

1307
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:32,800
When you're up by 11 with eight
minutes left against the Miami Heat.

1308
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,000
Did you guys watch that game?

1309
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,970
Then all of a sudden they all stay started
roaring back and all the felt Celtics

1310
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:44,470
fans just shut the fuck up.
And then once the game was,

1311
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:48,340
was decided with 12 seconds left,
they started chanting overrated again.

1312
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:52,960
That was a real fucking bitchy mood.
That was real bitchy. I didn't,

1313
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:56,320
I did. I was embarrassed to be associated
with that franchise. All right,

1314
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:01,510
who's the moron? Who's two?
Started that chant. Um,

1315
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:06,670
all right. That was, if that was, it was
just a quick little riff of underrated,

1316
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:10,990
overrated,
underrated.

1317
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:14,830
Having your own fucking jet
airplane with a big bed in the back,

1318
01:24:14,831 --> 01:24:17,380
in a giant seatbelt.
You know,

1319
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,680
beautiful woman to sit on your Dick
in a fucking ivy to put you to sleep.

1320
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:28,240
You just wake up in New York. That's
all I want. That's all I want. You know,

1321
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:30,760
that's all I want out of this business.
I don't need, I don't need much.

1322
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,960
I got to fly to New York people.
I'm going to New York on a Tuesday night,

1323
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:38,080
take the red eye back to that motherfucker
and I'm doing a benefit for the

1324
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:42,790
troops playing the beacon theater with a,

1325
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:43,870
believe it or not,
this is,

1326
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:48,130
this is the lineup on this show and
it's going to be been to three different

1327
01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:51,430
bases in Iraq in three
different bases in Afghanistan.

1328
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:53,560
Jon Stewart is hosting.

1329
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:59,350
Tony Bennett is a,
I'm assuming he's singing.

1330
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,580
I don't think he's doing
stand up. Uh, Jerry Seinfeld,

1331
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,370
Bruce Springsteen, Joe, Mikael,

1332
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:15,310
myself,
and I think a couple of other people.

1333
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:19,000
All I'm doing is eight minutes,
but uh,

1334
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:22,050
I can't wait man. It's going
to be a, well, I don't want,

1335
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,130
I don't want to do the flight,
but it's going to be fucking awesome.

1336
01:25:24,131 --> 01:25:25,390
That's Wednesday.
I'm flying out.

1337
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:29,170
That's why I'm telling you I got all this
shit to do today because I got to, uh,

1338
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:34,570
you know, I just landed here last
night. I got to do the fucking podcast.

1339
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,720
I have an audition today.
I'm pitching a fucking show today.

1340
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,720
I got to pay my fucking bills.

1341
01:25:40,721 --> 01:25:44,290
It's the first of the month I got to do
all that fucking horse shit and then I

1342
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:47,200
got to jump right back on
a plane tomorrow. You know,

1343
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:50,410
it's one of those fucking
weeks speaking to that dude,

1344
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:53,680
I flew out to Saint Louis last week and
there was some woman who was clearing

1345
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:54,514
her throat

1346
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,840
like twice a minute from like I would
guess about Utah to Jess into Kansas.

1347
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:04,493
Eh?

1348
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:11,880
Hmm. Hmm. Okay.

1349
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:15,750
She had this exact same way of doing it.
I swear to God.

1350
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:20,310
I have never prayed for my
own plane to crash before,

1351
01:26:20,311 --> 01:26:23,510
but that was one of those moments I
didn't want it to crash. You know what?

1352
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:27,940
I was just fantasizing that like
there was a crack in the fuselage

1353
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,560
[inaudible] that woman
just got sucked out.

1354
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:36,120
So as I was fantasizing about,
this is how fucking crazy I took it.

1355
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:41,121
I actually reached down and I tightened
my seat belt and I mentally went over

1356
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:46,910
how to put that fucking mask on my face
before I help the infant or child next

1357
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:52,990
to me. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay. I saw it, you know,

1358
01:26:52,991 --> 01:26:56,640
it was really disgusting. No
Way. She was clearing his throat.

1359
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:59,970
She was talking really
loud on her cell phone.

1360
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:04,480
Just everything about her was annoying.
And whenever I see a person like that,

1361
01:27:04,481 --> 01:27:07,890
the first thing I do is I look
for a wedding ring, you know?

1362
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:13,620
And when I don't see one, I th I
think, thank God when I do see,

1363
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:17,750
see when I actually feel bad for the
man or woman that is married to that,

1364
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:21,090
you know? Yeah. How could it just like,

1365
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:25,570
and actually I came up with
like a philosophical question.

1366
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,830
You know that those
dolts Sechi commercials,

1367
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:31,290
the most interesting man in the world.
What do you think would happen? His,

1368
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:34,240
he has his one for the, uh, the
pot smokers out there. All right.

1369
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:39,050
What do you think would happen if the
most interesting man in the world met the

1370
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:43,530
most annoying woman on the planet?
Yeah. All right. I want you to know,

1371
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:47,280
I want you to tell me what you think
would happen because I couldn't come up

1372
01:27:47,281 --> 01:27:49,770
with an answer to that question.
You know,

1373
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:53,170
he is the most interesting
man in the world. Well,

1374
01:27:53,171 --> 01:27:57,100
I would like you to meet this cunt. Who
was sitting diagonally fucking behind me.

1375
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:58,681
Oh,

1376
01:27:58,681 --> 01:28:03,681
speaking of that underrated fucking
movie macgruber Jenny Buddy rented that.

1377
01:28:04,391 --> 01:28:06,850
I don't know if you'd be happy if
you paid to go see it at a theater,

1378
01:28:06,851 --> 01:28:11,370
but fucking, you know, unless you
have a silly sense of humor like me,

1379
01:28:11,371 --> 01:28:13,380
cause I would enjoy that
if I saw it in the theater.

1380
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:15,930
Look at me even when I try to compliment
something I say in a dick way.

1381
01:28:15,931 --> 01:28:19,490
I think this is a funny fucking movie,
uh,

1382
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:22,100
with a couple of really
insane monologues in it.

1383
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:27,990
And uh, not to ruin anything.
Spoiler alert, spoiler alert.

1384
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,130
I had to bring this up.

1385
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:34,160
The last name of the bad
guy in the movie is cunt.

1386
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,110
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1387
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,360
And I'm assuming it's spelt with a K K u
n t, Z or something. But it's, you know,

1388
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:49,130
we got them, we have to get cunt. I Dunno,
it's sophomore. It's fucking hilarious.

1389
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:51,680
It's one of those movies you want to
watch with the female in the room cause

1390
01:28:51,681 --> 01:28:55,280
she's just be killing. This is stupid.
You know, you think this is funny.

1391
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,430
Oh right God, that's grouse. Which
will just make it so much more funnier.

1392
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:04,530
Macgruber two thumbs up from me baby.
All right.

1393
01:29:04,531 --> 01:29:07,610
This podcast is all over the place.
Let's move on to the next one. Uh,

1394
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:12,300
the advice section. Why you would ask
me for advice. I don't know. Okay,

1395
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:12,841
here we go.

1396
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:17,400
I started listening to your podcasts about
three months ago and I really like it.

1397
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:21,060
Thank you. I was inspired by a couple
of your albums on iTunes. Thank you.

1398
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:25,230
Now if you ever hear me bitching
about people fucking download shit,

1399
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:28,020
I'm not talking about you or
being cheap cuts. It's not you.

1400
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:31,080
A bump up the bulb.

1401
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:35,190
I love your comedy my whole life.

1402
01:29:35,191 --> 01:29:39,960
And recently I sacked up and one on
stage for a five minute spot for an open

1403
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,890
night open mic night at a local comedy
club here in Portland, Portland.

1404
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:47,220
I was really impressed by
the people that showed up.

1405
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:50,070
Many of them were talentless Dick Holes,

1406
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:54,480
but at least they have the guts to get
on stage and for that they deserve some

1407
01:29:54,481 --> 01:29:56,340
credit.
Well thank you sir.

1408
01:29:57,030 --> 01:30:01,410
Thank you for fucking extending
that olive branch to them.

1409
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,550
Um, so I got up there in front
of a whopping 15 people, uh,

1410
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:08,910
one of which who was my girlfriend
and talk some shit. It was,

1411
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:12,750
I was pretty nervous, but my voice
was steady and I was energetic,

1412
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,780
but most importantly I got
people laughing. There you go.

1413
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:18,780
It's all you've got to do. It
might not seem like much, but I,

1414
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,960
I had a high like no other.
I might stick with it.

1415
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:27,240
Basically I write down a few prompts.
Now this isn't me people.

1416
01:30:27,241 --> 01:30:28,950
I swear to God,
I know I suck at reading,

1417
01:30:28,951 --> 01:30:31,890
but just the way that some of this shit
is written, I'm going to read this.

1418
01:30:31,891 --> 01:30:35,520
Basically the way this guy wrote it are
actually exactly the way he wrote it.

1419
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:36,510
I might stick with it.

1420
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:41,511
Basically I write down a few prompts out
for stories and quips and go to town.

1421
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:45,630
I feel like open mic nights might
be the only way to get some chops.

1422
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:50,870
Doing my bits for friends or two into a
mirror doesn't have the same effect as a

1423
01:30:53,311 --> 01:30:56,700
bunch of strangers. I'm gearing up
to put some hard work into my act.

1424
01:30:56,970 --> 01:31:00,450
I would like any tips on how you get
you got your chops and how you practice

1425
01:31:00,451 --> 01:31:03,270
your racked. All right.
Couple things. Yeah. Yeah.

1426
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,890
You can't run it by your friends
and do it in the mirror. Um,

1427
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:08,640
he could maybe say it
a few times in a way,

1428
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:11,970
the club just so you can kind of
get the flow of it. Uh, but yeah,

1429
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:16,650
the only way to do it is to do
open mikes. So, uh, you know,

1430
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:19,200
I would do that,
just do that.

1431
01:31:19,201 --> 01:31:22,440
And I would also drop the attitude
that people who are starting out are

1432
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:26,400
talentless Dickholtz than not.
They're fucking, you know,

1433
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:28,140
if you saw me when I started out,

1434
01:31:28,141 --> 01:31:32,580
you would have thought that this guy
sucks because I did suck because I was

1435
01:31:32,581 --> 01:31:36,300
brand new at it. So you don't want to
do that. And for all, you know, the,

1436
01:31:36,301 --> 01:31:40,380
those air quote talentless Dick Holes
will someday be in a position in this

1437
01:31:40,381 --> 01:31:43,470
fucking business where they could
actually hook you up with something.

1438
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:48,620
So I can not stress how important it is
to have good relationships with fellow

1439
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:54,330
comedians and everybody in this
fucking business that you can.

1440
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,960
I'm not saying that you take
it to the point that you will.

1441
01:31:56,961 --> 01:32:00,580
Acts actually allows somebody to walk
all over you and treat you like shit.

1442
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:05,300
I'm not saying that, but don't
walk around judging people bad.

1443
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:08,380
A fucking thing cut out on me again.
God Damn it. I'm sorry. I've been,

1444
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:11,680
I'm putting together a new hour of comedy
and I have a bunch of standup sets on

1445
01:32:11,681 --> 01:32:15,400
my fucking recorder that I
never ended up listening to.

1446
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,220
Something else,
sir,

1447
01:32:17,221 --> 01:32:20,200
that you might want to do if you're
doing standup is to record yourself and

1448
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,630
listen to yourself so you can
become better as a community.

1449
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,810
But the key is you got to listen to them.

1450
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:31,090
Anybody can record them and then just
leave them on their fucking tape player or

1451
01:32:31,091 --> 01:32:34,360
they're fucking digital recorder, whatever
the hell you call this God damn thing.

1452
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:39,160
Um, yeah, that's what I would
tell you that man, seriously,

1453
01:32:39,161 --> 01:32:42,010
like you will be absolutely
fucking amazed with,

1454
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,460
with the people that you think are
going to do something and don't,

1455
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:48,480
and the people who you like
and that person that and I
don't think they're going

1456
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:51,520
to do shit and all of a sudden
they're directing a movie.

1457
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:56,650
They're the head writer on
something. They create a show, uh,

1458
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:01,450
who knows what, you don't know
what anybody's going to do. So,

1459
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:05,500
uh, yeah. You know, so I
wouldn't walk around. I mean,

1460
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:07,750
I'm sure you're just writing that
maybe to make me laugh or something,

1461
01:33:07,751 --> 01:33:10,960
but I'm just putting that out there.
All right.

1462
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:16,110
Because I've seen people act like con
and then get treated accordingly by these

1463
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:22,400
people that they thought were a
beneath them or whatever. It's,

1464
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:25,210
it's just the worst fucking
thing that you can do in any,

1465
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:30,850
any in life in general. Treating someone
else like a like shit or whatever.

1466
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,310
I don't know.
I don't understand why people,

1467
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:37,150
it really makes your life a
lot more difficult. And, uh,

1468
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:40,810
some day when you die,
you know,

1469
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:45,070
like there's going to be the only people,

1470
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:49,000
only people at your funeral is
going to be a, you know, the,

1471
01:33:49,001 --> 01:33:52,420
the fucking to the guy who drives the
truck and the guy who digs the hole

1472
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:58,690
or the hearse I should say.
Um, yeah. So that's, that's
the advice I would give you.

1473
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:02,140
Keep doing the open mikes.
Um, it keep writing stuff,

1474
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:06,220
tape record yourself and
uh, you know, and then,

1475
01:34:06,221 --> 01:34:09,010
and then be a good guy, be a
good guy, but then, you know,

1476
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:13,660
be a good guy within reason. I
mean, like I said, don't, don't hit,

1477
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:15,370
don't take shit from people.

1478
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:19,300
And then also try to try to be hanging
with the people who seem the most

1479
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:20,800
motivated,
most positive,

1480
01:34:20,801 --> 01:34:25,090
that type of shit because you'll get
caught up in it and a Yada, Yada,

1481
01:34:25,091 --> 01:34:26,740
fucking Yada.
That's basically it.

1482
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:30,340
So we're coming to the close here or
the podcast and other kind of short one

1483
01:34:30,341 --> 01:34:35,270
this week just because, uh, I do
have so much shit to do here. Um,

1484
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:40,290
congratulations to the rangers in the
giants for your first world series.

1485
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:42,640
A giants are up three games to one.

1486
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:46,900
And I was getting nervous for
giant fans. I actually, uh,

1487
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:49,720
I don't mind ranger or the giants.
I have no problem with either one of them,

1488
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:53,470
but I was getting nervous for the giant
fans when they were up two games to none.

1489
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:57,200
And then the rangers came back and won
one game and I was like, yeah, God.

1490
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:01,610
And a lot of ways the giants are
kind of like how the red sox were,

1491
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,790
except they're in the national league.

1492
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:06,310
You know how the Red Sox were
back in the day where it was,

1493
01:35:06,311 --> 01:35:10,120
not only do they not win, they have
to rip your fucking hard out too.

1494
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:12,030
And uh,

1495
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,090
I don't know at the risk
of pissing off ranger fans,

1496
01:35:16,091 --> 01:35:19,030
I think the giant fans there,
I think they've had,

1497
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:20,830
I think they've had about enough,

1498
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:24,160
I think it's time for the sports
gods to let 'em up off the mat,

1499
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:29,240
give him a God damn world series
and range of fans. Who you kidding?

1500
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:34,860
Who are you honestly fucking kitten.
You know, you're all cowboy fans.

1501
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:35,671
You know,

1502
01:35:35,671 --> 01:35:40,590
if the cowboys record was flipped right
now and Tony Romo was living up to the

1503
01:35:40,591 --> 01:35:43,300
potential, you know, you know,

1504
01:35:43,301 --> 01:35:47,620
you wouldn't be selling out those world
series games. Okay. Now I'm a fuck.

1505
01:35:47,621 --> 01:35:51,730
You know, I like to range your
sense fucking uh, who was that?

1506
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,480
Who was that fucking okay.

1507
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:58,380
Who is that guy buddy something
or buddy bell that come here?

1508
01:35:58,381 --> 01:36:03,170
Jackass who played third
base. Um, he's not a jackass.

1509
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:04,280
It just sounds funny.

1510
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:09,200
I'm trying to think of guys who played
for the Rangers when I was growing up.

1511
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,390
The fuck was it?

1512
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:18,080
Somebody wrote something funny on the
Internet about how 10 years ago when the

1513
01:36:18,081 --> 01:36:22,170
Rangers signed a rod do
a $200 million contract,

1514
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:27,980
he vowed to one day lead them to the world
series and when he struck out looking

1515
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:33,650
on the New York Yankees, he finally
delivered on that promise. Oh,

1516
01:36:33,651 --> 01:36:37,600
Bill, he is such a cunt. I
know. I am. Yeah, I am a client.

1517
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:42,720
Um, I actually watched the Patriots
game and this, uh, this sports bar

1518
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:49,240
in Saint Louis and there was his fucking
old guy in there who was basically,

1519
01:36:49,591 --> 01:36:52,970
he had like,
like nine sports buttons on his shirt.

1520
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:58,070
He had this little glow stick with
them and he's one of those guys when he

1521
01:36:58,071 --> 01:37:00,050
yelled,
but it still wasn't loud.

1522
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:04,770
It just kept going. Whoa. The
Patriot. So when the Cheetahs,

1523
01:37:04,771 --> 01:37:07,230
but we always went whoa.

1524
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:11,800
And everybody was ignoring them.
Anything the Patriots did was awesome.

1525
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,810
Like this guy's fucking
shanks, this punt, right,

1526
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:17,310
right off the side of his
foot for the patriot. The,

1527
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:20,320
as the ball is dropping to his foot,
the guys go on.

1528
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:22,370
Oh,
what a kick.

1529
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:26,990
Well, he's, he's pissing off
everybody in the sports bar,

1530
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:29,450
but he's too fucking old
to punch in the face.

1531
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:34,920
But this is what killed me about
this guy was the people around me go,

1532
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:38,490
he fucking comes here every week.
He's unbelievably annoying.

1533
01:37:38,491 --> 01:37:42,750
And the worst thing is, is he has, he's
fans of like six different football teams.

1534
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,770
Like, he's a fan of the Patriots,
the bills and the dolphins.

1535
01:37:46,771 --> 01:37:51,130
They're all in the same fucking division.
And he's a fan of the Kansas City, uh,

1536
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:55,560
chiefs. So the bills played
the chiefs, so no matter what,

1537
01:37:55,561 --> 01:37:59,670
he cannot lose any. Just sits
there the whole game. Whoa.

1538
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:02,580
What a throw. Oh, what an interception.

1539
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:06,120
Like he just wants to win the entire
fucking time. Long story short,

1540
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:10,170
I had to take a picture with the
guy because he started off cute.

1541
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:14,520
You know what a cute old man. And
then at one point, um, if I was,

1542
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:15,721
if I was drinking,

1543
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:19,500
I would have engaged with this dude it
during the second quarter and been like,

1544
01:38:19,501 --> 01:38:23,160
hey, how the fuck can you be fans
of every fucking team? You old cunt.

1545
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:25,170
I would've done that.
But fortunately I'm not drinking.

1546
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:29,250
So it took me until the fourth quarter
where I started to give him shit.

1547
01:38:29,251 --> 01:38:30,900
But then in the back of my
head I was like, really, Bill,

1548
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,230
are you really going to get
into it with this old guy? Um,

1549
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:37,200
but by the end of it,
he was just kind of hilarious.

1550
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:40,020
So I actually took a picture with the
guy and I'm going to have that uploaded

1551
01:38:40,021 --> 01:38:43,770
onto the podcast.com. And,
uh, what else do I got?

1552
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,930
I got a hyper few gigs here before I,

1553
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,900
before I sign off on this part of this
podcast was an absolute clusterfuck.

1554
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:53,760
I apologize. I had high hopes
for it, but uh, you know,

1555
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:57,500
like a lot of things in life,
it just doesn't work out. Um,

1556
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:01,540
all right, what do we got here? All right.

1557
01:39:01,541 --> 01:39:03,240
I'm going to be at the
funny bone in Columbus.

1558
01:39:03,241 --> 01:39:07,170
This is really one of these podcasts
that I would've stopped and restarted 10

1559
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:10,320
minutes into it, but I just don't
have the fucking time are right, Bill.

1560
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:14,340
We've heard your excuses. You have to mop
your kitchen floor. Nobody gives a fuck.

1561
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:18,960
All right. I want to be at the, uh, the
funny bone in Columbus, Ohio. Friday,

1562
01:39:18,961 --> 01:39:22,170
Saturday, Sunday, November
12th, 13th and 14th.

1563
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:25,970
And I'm going to try to go to that Ohio
state, Penn state game. That's my big, uh,

1564
01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:29,310
I don't want to be bored shitless
at the mall in Columbus move.

1565
01:39:29,311 --> 01:39:30,980
Then I'm going to be making,
uh,

1566
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:35,990
the following week I will be in Washington
DC at the listener auditorium and

1567
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:40,110
that's on a Friday, November
19th. On November 20th,

1568
01:39:40,111 --> 01:39:42,780
I'll be at comics at
Foxwoods in Connecticut.

1569
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:46,550
I get a lot of emails from people
from Connecticut being like, Dude,

1570
01:39:46,551 --> 01:39:48,750
when he come to fucking Connecticut,
I'm going to be there.

1571
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:52,530
It's a beautiful new room. Uh,
everybody's been raving about it.

1572
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:54,750
All the comedians who have
performed there. So come on down,

1573
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:57,390
check out my new hour.
And then finally,

1574
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:03,530
this is the one I need your help on.
Look into your hearts.

1575
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:07,770
I am playing the Moore Theater in Seattle,
Washington.

1576
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:11,490
All right, for those of you
unfamiliar with the Moore Theater,

1577
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:16,500
it is a legendary theater
in, uh, Seattle, Washington.

1578
01:40:16,501 --> 01:40:20,700
Um, I guess what a rock fans, grunge fans.

1579
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:24,270
Remember that Pearl Jam Video?
I think it was even flow.

1580
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:28,180
We've earned PLO when a Eddie vetter is,

1581
01:40:28,181 --> 01:40:33,181
is climbing out into the crowd and fucking
jumping off the balcony and stepping

1582
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:36,180
on people's heads and shit at,
that's where they filmed that.

1583
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:40,860
And I have to sell a lot of fucking
tickets. I'm a third of the way there.

1584
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:42,001
So if you,

1585
01:40:42,001 --> 01:40:44,970
and some of you are drunk buddies
want to come down for the love of God,

1586
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:48,690
please come down to the show because a,

1587
01:40:48,691 --> 01:40:52,200
I've got a ton of tickets
to sell and clear channel.

1588
01:40:52,201 --> 01:40:56,650
I don't know what they've done to radio
but they've, they've taken off, you know,

1589
01:40:56,651 --> 01:40:58,390
my guy up there was Marty Riemer,

1590
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:01,570
which I heard he has a podcast
now if you live in Seattle,

1591
01:41:01,571 --> 01:41:03,700
fuck those radio stations
that took them off.

1592
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:06,850
Listen to his podcast because hopefully
I'm going to be doing that to hype my

1593
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:08,230
show.
Uh,

1594
01:41:08,231 --> 01:41:11,200
I'm kind of running out of ways to hype
shows now with what they're doing to

1595
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,810
radio.
For those of you out of the loop,

1596
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:19,200
I think clear channel basically wants to
have for Djs for the entire country and

1597
01:41:20,531 --> 01:41:23,890
uh, you walk into these radio stations
now, they don't even have a receptionist.

1598
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:28,890
They have an automated system
for you to figure out how to uh,

1599
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:32,080
get to where you're going out on.
It's yet another thing,

1600
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,130
and I'm sure you people who are all for
these kinds of technologies like I love

1601
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:38,740
when people like try to support
those automated checkout lines.

1602
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:40,510
Like they always say the same thing,
you know,

1603
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:44,430
and you're standing there looking at this
poor bastard behind the fucking Reggie.

1604
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:46,180
You mean that person with the fucking job?

1605
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:49,600
You really want to see him be a poor
bastard. What would you rather be?

1606
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:54,370
A poor bastard behind a fucking a cash
register or a poor bastard you fucking

1607
01:41:54,371 --> 01:41:56,110
homeless and don't have a God damn job.

1608
01:41:56,890 --> 01:42:00,400
I hate when people do like dumb shit
like that just to try to enhance their

1609
01:42:00,401 --> 01:42:04,210
fucking point.
If you fucking believe in that technology,

1610
01:42:04,211 --> 01:42:06,310
support the technology,
don't start,

1611
01:42:06,311 --> 01:42:09,310
start saying what the person behind
the fucking registers thinking.

1612
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:11,770
Even though I'm doing
the same goddamn thing.

1613
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:16,000
But I think I can go out on a limb and
say that most people would rather have a

1614
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:19,540
fucking job than be homeless.
All right?

1615
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:24,220
Lots of yelling this week, Bill, as
opposed to what? Every other quiet week.

1616
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:25,931
Um,

1617
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:30,280
and then the final two gigs of this year
before I take my month off and I begin

1618
01:42:30,281 --> 01:42:33,700
my martial arts classes, joking. Um,

1619
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:38,350
I'm going to be at COBB's comedy club in
San Francisco. Uh, December 2nd, third,

1620
01:42:38,351 --> 01:42:39,520
fourth,
and fifth,

1621
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:45,340
and I'm going to be at the Improv
in Bray, California, the 16th,

1622
01:42:45,341 --> 01:42:49,800
17th, 18th, and 19th of
December. Uh, come on down.

1623
01:42:49,801 --> 01:42:54,700
This new hour is starting to take shape.
Actually had some guy come up to me, uh,

1624
01:42:54,701 --> 01:42:57,790
this weekend in St Louis and was like,
that was absolutely hilarious.

1625
01:42:57,791 --> 01:43:02,050
I didn't think it was as funny
as let it go, but I liked it.

1626
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:06,210
It's like, thank you sir. Well,
it's not done yet, you know.

1627
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:09,730
Thank you for starting to compliment
me and then giving me a little dig.

1628
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:15,790
Hey, you look great. You're not
as fat as you used to be. Um,

1629
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:20,320
all right. And this guy, hey, he
really had a pudgy face. He really did.

1630
01:43:20,321 --> 01:43:22,750
He had one of those. He was a
white dude, but he was like so fat.

1631
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:25,390
He was starting to look Asian. You
know what I mean? When he gets so fat,

1632
01:43:25,391 --> 01:43:28,780
your ice like that, uh, that
precious girl, you know,

1633
01:43:28,781 --> 01:43:31,960
you know when the fat just starts building
up on your cheeks, all of a sudden,

1634
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:35,860
you know,
that's how you start to look,

1635
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:40,510
whether that be in an incredible way
to sell some fat burning products.

1636
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:44,530
Are you so fat that you're starting
to look Asian in your eyes,

1637
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,200
even though you're not? Well, listen,

1638
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:54,690
that is offensive. Well, line up
behind the Italians in the southern us,

1639
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:57,080
that's what this podcast was this week.

1640
01:43:57,410 --> 01:44:00,260
I'm trying to get fired from
my own podcast. I'm trying to,

1641
01:44:00,261 --> 01:44:05,230
I want a lot of complaints and have
people say that I need to apologize, um,

1642
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:09,080
to different groups of people so that I
could be fired from my podcast because I

1643
01:44:09,081 --> 01:44:13,270
think I need a fucking vacation
from the shit. I really do. No,

1644
01:44:13,271 --> 01:44:16,240
I don't actually love doing this shit.
I just got too much shit to do this week.

1645
01:44:16,270 --> 01:44:19,690
So that's it. That's the end of this
fucking podcast. I'm uploading it.

1646
01:44:19,691 --> 01:44:23,710
I apologize for my singing.
I apologize for the scatter brained,

1647
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:28,410
uh, podcast that this
was, but I think, I think,

1648
01:44:28,411 --> 01:44:32,210
I like to think that there was
some moments. It was a good rental.

1649
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:37,970
Anyways, that's it. Uh, and
thanks to everybody who's
been a buying the, uh, the,

1650
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:41,120

and download the ogs has

1653
01:44:51,271 --> 01:44:53,940
ringtone. I'm actually getting
a new cell phone this week.

1654
01:44:53,941 --> 01:44:56,640
I was going to try to hold out
for the new iPhone when it's, uh,

1655
01:44:56,970 --> 01:44:59,430
not the new iPhone, the iPhone
when it switches over to Verizon.

1656
01:44:59,431 --> 01:45:01,590
But my blackberry is shitting the bed.

1657
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:04,570
I can't get emails on it and uh,

1658
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:08,650
the letter and doesn't work anymore
unless I fucking sprained my thumb pushing

1659
01:45:08,651 --> 01:45:11,360
it down. And, uh,

1660
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,650
I think I'm going to get that droid phone.
What do you guys think about that one?

1661
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:18,120
Is that a good one? I want
Verizon. I want to stay with,

1662
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:22,040
with Verizon because as far as where
I travel, I'm going to get the droid.

1663
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:25,780
I should've just gone out and gotten
the fucking thing right and just had you

1664
01:45:25,781 --> 01:45:29,770
guys shit all over me that it's a bad
goddamn phone as opposed to now where I'm
