1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,670
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn
his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,940
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Dan.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,110
Ah,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,220
just checking in on you. Ah, March 29th.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,780
Oh my God, this Bob this almost. Oh

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,423
Ma.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,900
Did you have a good month?
Well that's good. Um,

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,340
I just have so much stuff to talk about.
I don't even know where to begin.

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,091
First of all,

10
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:35,800
last night I watched the
first hour and a half of that,

11
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,540
the zen of Garry Shandling,

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,880
the Judd Apatow documentary on
the great genius Gary Shandling.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,140
And I'm, I got to tell you a jug. Did
that Guy Proud? It's unbelievable.

14
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:51,040
You have to see it. A comedian buddy
of mine told me, he goes through it.

15
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,540
Have you seen this thing yet?
You got to see it.

16
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,830
Thank God he told me about it and I
went and I recorded this God damn thing,

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,550
you know, and I'm telling you right
now, you got to see him. All right.

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,700
I told you last week
you have to watch Barry.

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,810
If you sat down and you watch
berry storing Bill Hader, uh,

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,310
Henry Winkler and all those
guys, uh, you know, I was right.

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,450
Okay.
When are you going to learn to trust?

22
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,060
When I tell you something on HBO
is going to be good. Um, anyways,

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,020
I was watching that documentary
and [inaudible] I guess
Gary Shandling just kept

24
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,090
diaries his whole life.

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,600
It was basically his entire life and
he was writing all this stuff and

26
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:37,540
overcoming fear and trying to
get better as a comedian and a,

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,170
it was like Erie watching,

28
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:44,400
like how much I related to it because
I never kept a diary. I tried one time,

29
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:48,240
I was just too walled off emotionally.
I remember I wrote like one line,

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,730
my name's bill,
I'm 28.

31
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm a standup comedian and
that's as far as I can.

32
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,523
Got It.

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,240
And then I think I threw that book out
so it's biodegrading somewhere because

34
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:06,800
it's made out of paper. Um, but anyways,

35
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:10,100
I used to always,
why would write down on cocktail napkins.

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,540
Okay,

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,620
dad. Right. Commit to everything.
Be Positive. I actually
used that thing, you know,

38
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:19,460
in the Catholic Church, I can't remember
the part of the mass, what you do,

39
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:22,670
the sign of the cross on your forehead,
your mouth and then over your heart,

40
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,050
which means you know God in your mind
and your mouth and in your heart or

41
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:31,850
something. So, but I used it as like
a positive side rather than, you know,

42
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:36,050
God's only son died on this thing that
I'm now fucking drawing on my face.

43
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,490
I actually, I use it as like a positive
side, like no negative thoughts.

44
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,870
Um, I don't know why I thought I'd
put a positive side of what my mouth,

45
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:48,770
so much of the Shit I say is
fucking curmudgeony at best.

46
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:51,770
But it was just more just
committing to everything. And um,

47
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,010
cause when we first moved down to
New York, it was intimidating thing.

48
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,180
And uh, I get on my heels and
then I wouldn't have a set,

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,800
then I'd have to wait like another five,
six days before I get stage time again.

50
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:07,801
Just fucking hating myself for going
up there and acted like a little.

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,400
Um, although you're not supposed to say
that now, right. That's not progressive,

52
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,550
you know, why are you saying that you're
acting like a little girl. Okay. Okay.

53
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,150
I was acting like a,
somebody who's gender neutral.

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Why can't you just say that she was
scared without insulting the opposite sex?

55
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,940
Well, I don't know. I guess, you know,

56
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,190
I guess I think I said something I
need to work on there. Are you happy?

57
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,500
Yeah. Okay. Kay, can you shave your legs?

58
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,293
Um,

59
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,410
AH, fuck. I had fun last night on
stage, man. I went up when I was just,

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,890
I'm sick a bunch of shit in
my act and I was just like,

61
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,830
I'm not talking about any of that shit.
And I just meandered,

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,900
meandered is the key word there. But I
had a good time. I apologize to the crowd,

63
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:05,740
but I, you know what units? It was
a fucking Wednesday. All right.

64
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,660
Is a workday. Um, but anyways,

65
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,340
it's a wonderful week.
It's a wonderful week in Los Angeles.

66
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,460
Nothing's on fire. No
one got me too, dude.

67
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,140
Evidently they got all the crepes.
Um,

68
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,330
all right. Oh, I got to promote
here. Par still rough and rowdy.

69
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,000
If you've missed the last few podcasts,
first of all,

70
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,910
it's one of the great paper
views you're ever going to watch.

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,850
It's just regular people
that enjoy fighting.

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,440
They want to get on TV and they are
willing to fight each other. Okay.

73
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,090
It's like, I don't know, I don't
even know how to describe it. It's a,

74
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:50,680
it's a juggernaut and it's like 15,
16 bucks and a,

75
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:55,681
I'm going to be at the next one and I
will be ringside announcing even though I,

76
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:01,010
I bet I know what jab is.
I know to hook his overhand right.

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,660
I know what a straight right is to
cause I watched the documentary, uh,

78
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,840
leap Ba Yay. I watched that a long
time ago. But other than than that,

79
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,470
I'm just going to be making fun of Shit
like I always do and hopefully one of

80
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:15,340
those regular people won't try to beat
the crap out of me afterwards. Um,

81
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,570
I dunno. I'm so fucking
excited for it. And uh,

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,340
that's going to be on
April 13th. Okay. You guys,

83
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:27,310
I'm telling you, I'm,
I'm, I'm, I'm telling you.

84
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:30,460
Got To fucking see you gotta see the Sh,
you know, you don't have to, you know,

85
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:33,040
if you want to miss out and then not
know what anybody's talking about.

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,860
Come Monday when you standing
around the fucking water cooler.

87
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,370
Um, and uh, this is the last
promo thing I have to do.

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,460
Um,
we've added some shows.

89
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,380
If you want an updated list of the
shows to see possibly come and see my

90
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:53,920
ignorance live, uh, go
to [inaudible] dot com.

91
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,430
Dot Events for an updated list of shows.

92
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,930
I hate to end promos in the beginning
of the podcast because it just kills my

93
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,310
fucking flow, you know, now I
just feel like, and m, you know,

94
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,370
like I'm sitting in a fucking waiting
room. I don't feel funny anymore.

95
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,110
I don't know who I am. Um,
oh, here's one for you.

96
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,380
The theme of this podcast,

97
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,480
this half hour is late to the party.
All right?

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,410
And, um, which is really
a theme to my life.

99
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,300
Okay. I was late for everything. You know,

100
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,910
I stayed back in first
grade. Boom. Right there.

101
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,440
I was just a year behind my
whole fucking life. All right.

102
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,500
I wasn't late getting my driver's license.
I got that thing immediately.

103
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,630
The day I was eligible.
I did the old right there.

104
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:47,720
Fred took it on a stick shift too.
It's one of the main,

105
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,970
that's probably the only manly
thing I've ever done in my life.

106
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,650
I had no choice. That's all
we had in our, in our family.

107
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,540
We always had stick shifts. Um,
cause they were fucking cheap.

108
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,790
Um,
so it was more fun.

109
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,670
You felt you would drive in the fucking
car instead of just getting it some go

110
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,400
cart down though. I hate
automatic transmission. You know,

111
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:14,690
there's only a few left out there.
I think the, uh, the Volkswagen Gti,

112
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,670
there's one or two BMWs is probably a
Porsche. That's something interesting.

113
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,910
There is something that I could look up.
How many standards?

114
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,200
Standard dreads,

115
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,010
mission cars left in pro duction.

116
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,840
All right.
The disappearing stick shift.

117
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,841
Less than 3% of cars sold in the
u s still have a stick shift.

118
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:44,541
All right.

119
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:49,280
2017 cars that still offer
a manual transmission.

120
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,620
Let's see what we got here.
Well, we have is slow Internet

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,180
by the way. My buddy called me
up and you know, I have a deli,

122
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,650
miss this amazing Celtics road trip
where they went for now coming in there,

123
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,150
the walking wounded, everybody's out
in, all the young kids is stepping up.

124
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,170
And last night they played
the Utah Jazz and I guess, uh,

125
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,000
was it Jaylen Brown?

126
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,060
I'm a said Jalen rose hit a three pointed
a when I heard Jason Tatum stepped up,

127
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,210
uh, I'm just, I'm missing it. I'm missing,
but I have to miss it. I got the kid,

128
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,340
I got the kids. So I, uh,

129
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,670
if you guys want to know what's going on
with the new episodes of muppet babies,

130
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,340
I'm on. I'm on that. All right.

131
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,850
Gonzo Baby Gonzo had some little chicks
and in the beginning of the episode,

132
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,530
Foz Little Fozzie bear is,
is doing is bad jokes.

133
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,160
And he went to open his mouth
and it sounded like a fart noise.

134
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,000
And somebody goes, hey, you should say,
excuse me. And I was like, Holy Shit.

135
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:54,230
Is this going to be about passing gas
and how you handle that in a public forum

136
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,890
like this really progressive compared to
the shit that I saw as a kid. You know,

137
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,100
it was just the alphabet.
They didn't deal with bodily functions,

138
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:05,160
but that wasn't the point.
Fonzie goes,

139
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,680
I didn't make that noise and they looked
up when they saw that there was all

140
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:12,360
these geese were flying south for the
fucking winner. So then God's, Oh,

141
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:16,920
got all fucking afraid. There's
chickens. We're going to fly south in.

142
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:20,610
Selfishly, even though chickens
don't fly south south for the winter,

143
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:25,110
they're doing it for survival.
But selfishly Gonzo is so fucking needy.

144
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,050
He tries to, you know, keep hiding the
chicken so that the mother, it's weird.

145
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:34,230
It's like they're all little
fucking puppet animals and
then there's like a real

146
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:37,590
person that kind of takes care of
them and bring some lunch and shit.

147
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,900
It's like this sort of like,
I don't know what's going on there.

148
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:44,220
Some sort of muppet beastiality
that this woman had.

149
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,800
All of these kids, I have
no idea of, you know,

150
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:50,220
when evidently fucked a frog and a bear
and all kinds of ship it, I don't know.

151
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,480
One of them is hers a pig.
So anyways,

152
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:58,020
I'll fucking episode this. God
Damn, I don't know what he is.

153
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:00,540
He's like a a vulture.

154
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,130
Maybe I'm a two can,
I don't know what he is.

155
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,510
He's trying to hide these fucking
chickens. And then the end, uh, the mom,

156
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,860
you know, the, uh, the
puppet groupie there,

157
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,750
she comes out and she says like,
listen,

158
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,150
you'd get dumb little fuck chickens
do not fly south for the winter.

159
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,400
They're going to be in the coop.
They going to be fine.

160
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,320
And then Gonzo is all happy.

161
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:29,700
And what upset me was that the
chickens didn't get mad at him.

162
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,060
In the end, they should have
been like, wait a minute.

163
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,440
So like for your own selfish needs,

164
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,000
we would have fucking starved to
death just because you're, you're,

165
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,570
you're so fucking codependent.

166
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,540
And then of course he would try to
talk his way out of it being like,

167
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,790
well I mean it doesn't really make a
difference cause you don't fly south

168
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,820
anyways. If he says, yeah, yeah, but
you didn't know that digit Gonzo,

169
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,310
you didn't know that
and you will fucking content.

170
00:10:56,311 --> 00:11:00,420
What the fuck are we going to stay
outside in the fucking snow? You can't,

171
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,060
you crooked beaked comment and then
God's Ob like I always knew you thought I

172
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,440
was less than other people.
Right.

173
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:10,290
And then he would make it about his
fucking nose. See that's why he can't,

174
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:14,220
you got to stay on topic because I just
fucked up the argument for the chickens.

175
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,230
Don't make fun of his beak. You keep
it on, on, on topic. I should say.

176
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,460
He keeps it on fucking topic about the
fact that you're a codependent cycle and

177
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:30,840
you had information that you knew that
as far as you knew it was pertinent to my

178
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,290
own fucking survival.
And you kept that to yourself.

179
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,730
Didn't you get a little cunt sell?
That's the shit that I've been watching.

180
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,130
Um, I know the [inaudible] they were
doing well and what are, let's see,

181
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,730
what have they been doing? They lost
in a shootout to Columbus five, four.

182
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,900
They lost it over time to one to St
Louis to there's two points. We go,

183
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:56,570
we beat Dallas is four points for
that week. Four of a possible six.

184
00:11:56,571 --> 00:12:00,050
I'd say that's a good week.
And then this week we beat Minnesota.

185
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:01,850
And over time that's two points.

186
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,350
Now we lost in a shootout to win a pig.
Uh,

187
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,190
so we've got three out of
four points cruising along.

188
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,100
Okay.

189
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,150
Now we've got a couple of home games
against the Florida teach the Tampa Bay

190
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,300
lightning and the new
fucking, uh, broad street,

191
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:23,301
the Southbridge speech bullies and the
Florida panthers with the most fighting

192
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:28,800
fucking major in the league.
I mean,

193
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:32,280
I think they, I think they're almost
going to have 30 fights this year. I mean,

194
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:33,870
those people are out of control.

195
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,690
Okay.

196
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,250
That was fucking assholes. They all wrote
it. They all ruined the Goddamn game.

197
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,610
Those fucking constant watch.
Olympic hockey, not even them.

198
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,450
I can't even blame them.

199
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:46,270
It's just people that aren't
content with being millionaires.

200
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,820
They want to be billionaires
and now they have to fucking,

201
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,690
let's just level it out.
Let's mainstream it up.

202
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,200
Let's alienate our core fucking fan base

203
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,940
and try to get all these fucking
douchebags that watched the Kardashians to

204
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:05,330
fucking watch rivalry, rivalry
Wednesdays, which they're not going to do.

205
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,300
All right. And the theme,
this is good. Everyone.

206
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,650
Did you guys write in and tell
me how, uh, you know, let me,

207
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,460
you're late to the party stories. I
got married late. I had a kid late.

208
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,540
I started standup late. I stayed
back in school. I got laid lake.

209
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,120
Yeah, I fucking, I'd go to
summer school. I was just always,

210
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,490
everybody everyday everybody was
always like turning the corner.

211
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:29,324
I was always like,

212
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,310
where'd for B?

213
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,163
MMM.

214
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,560
I become progressive late.

215
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:37,870
Okay.

216
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,550
My ideas of, of, of, of of everything
else is like from fucking 20 years ago.

217
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,350
So here's another thing that I am,

218
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,370
I am 30 fucking years late.

219
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:54,090
I am so late to the party on this
band that they're actually doing their

220
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:58,870
farewell tour and half the people
aren't even in the band anymore.

221
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,700
Two out of the fears, two
original members. So yeah.

222
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,463
MMM.

223
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,830
Doing the goddamn comedy jam and all of
that and like trying to do, you know,

224
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:12,130
pat terror and learn these,
these double bass drum songs.

225
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,650
Uh, now I, and then, uh, my Trump teacher,

226
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:19,690
Dave took me to go see miss sugar.

227
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,260
All of a sudden that whole
world opened up to me.

228
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,290
So now I'm backtracking to all of this
shit that I vaguely remember my younger

229
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,180
brothers, they were into it go
and you got to hear this shit.

230
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:35,350
And I was listening to
a ribose has it stone

231
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,770
just like a,

232
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,900
Oh,

233
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,253
okay.

234
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,540
Just a cow.
Oh,

235
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,670
you know, you're singing along. Six is
say, say that's a good fucking song.

236
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,990
I was listening to that shit.
And uh,

237
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,060
when Metallica and all these other bands
came out, it was so fucking fast. I,

238
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:02,900
I just, my ear couldn't
catch up with it. And uh,

239
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,690
now I'm going back 30 years fucking late.
I,

240
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:08,330
so guess what album I
fight downloaded yesterday?

241
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,760
Slayer south of heaven.
I was watching,

242
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,120
I don't know how, I just was watching
blink trying to learn, you know,

243
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,750
all this double bass shit and I
was just on this youtube thing.

244
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,970
And then eventually if you're going to
do that shit eventually you're gonna to

245
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:27,900
run into Dave Lombardo and slayer. So
it was like, I got to fucking see that.

246
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:30,710
I got why I watched this mini documentary.

247
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,510
I guess it's a new
documentary coming out on 'em.

248
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:36,410
So I watched this older
one from like 2004 and um,

249
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,360
I've always tried to get into the band
and it was just always, it was just,

250
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,910
was beyond what my year is.
Understood.

251
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,340
So I heard that song south,
they haven't, and that's it.

252
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,370
I'm done.
So I love that album.

253
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,980
And I guess that was an album they play,

254
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:58,610
made a conscious effort to play little
slower than they did on the previous

255
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:01,640
album. That's the one that
has like angel of death.

256
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,290
And I listened to that one a little bit
and I was like, the south, they haven't,

257
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,330
I'm going to fucking, I got to,
I can't go from like, you know,

258
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,410
listening to poison and Bon Jovi and
all the shit that I listened to two

259
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:17,240
immediately going to that level
of speed, you know, that's like,

260
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,280
that's like when his sober person after
20 years decides to start partying again

261
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,750
and they pick up where they left off,

262
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,160
you're going to have a
fucking heart attack.

263
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,700
So I have to kind of ease my way
into it and this fucking album,

264
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,480
which I guess you know
more on fans of musical,

265
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,810
not fresh, it's not fast enough. Like
saying like that doesn't even make sense.

266
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,250
It's like,
is it a good fucking song?

267
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,650
So I have just been listening to south
of Heaven and whatever the song is after

268
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:49,860
it because they do that thing where
it just sort of blends into it and a,

269
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,990
it's fucking hilarious.

270
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,590
I'm going to be 50 in June and I'm
finally listening to slayer and up driving

271
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,210
down the street,
pulling up to red lights.

272
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,390
I got it. I fucking love it. So, uh,

273
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,080
late to the party on that went 30 years
late and I know I'm going to listen to

274
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:13,550
this fucking album a million times and
then I'm going to get a angel of death.

275
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:17,280
And I remember a long time ago
I had that, uh, I had the, the,

276
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:21,260
the Iowa album. Uh, what's
the name of the band there?

277
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,390
Jesus Christ with Joey Jordan said,
and all those guys. A seven Jake Day.

278
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,160
Thanks five ball.
The fuck is in now.

279
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:34,820
Jesus Christ. Don't say that. I almost
said no. They way they way the mass.

280
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:39,410
They were the eyes. Watch.
Ah, fuck it. What am asshole.
You know what I mean? Listen,

281
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:43,760
I know who the big four hours anthrax,
anthrax, slayer, Megadeath. Metallica.

282
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,020
I at least know that. Okay.
I'm an I'm new to this. Please.

283
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,250
Please be gentle when you trash me
on social media for not knowing,

284
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,970
uh, shit. Thrash.

285
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,690
I wear masks.

286
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,180
Let's see what this comes up with.

287
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,720
Why can't I know the name of the
drummer but not the name of the band?

288
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:10,250
What the fuck does that say about me?
Huh? Oh, speaking of which, I did the,

289
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,030
I did the goddamn comedy jam.
Um,

290
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,390
okay. So now they're showing me slipknot.

291
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,360
Fuck. That's right. That's right. Okay.
It's funny, the first thing he came up,

292
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:29,950
why these 11 bands wear masks?
I Dunno. Cause this smart,

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,900
they want to have a life
after the show's over.

294
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,850
Well that's the best thing ever.
Like that bucket had it's fucking genius.

295
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:44,480
He gets to fucking go around the world
and guns and roses and all these awesome

296
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:47,930
beds. And then the second he doesn't
feel like being that guy anymore.

297
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:52,430
He just takes the bucket off his head
and the mass goes away. You know,

298
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,240
probably puts it up in
a man bun or something.

299
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:59,330
Looks is [inaudible] God is possible.

300
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,370
It just fucking walks away.

301
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,800
Like what's his face at the end
of the usual suspects, you know,

302
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,180
straightens out his foot and just
walks right through the crowd.

303
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,890
No one has any fucking idea. Um, anyway,

304
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:17,150
so I did the goddamn comedy jam.
Uh,

305
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,070
thanks to everybody. You know,
I played the, uh, I played, uh,

306
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,940
was it Pantera cowboys from Hell
and uh,

307
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,250
I thought I had it down. I thought I
knew what I was doing. I got out there,

308
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,930
my Vinnie Paul Costume,
I actually,

309
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,220
I almost said Postmates did it.
I fucking, uh, Instagram did,

310
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:45,700
I grabbed it, Yolo, my young again,

311
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,830
um,
the costume that I wore and uh,

312
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,540
that was probably the best part of
the performance was the costumes.

313
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,080
Look an asshole, you know Vince,
you know he's a Husky fellow, right?

314
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:03,820
So I had like a pillow or a throw pillow
underneath this does fucking shirt and

315
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,520
like a fucking asshole.
When I sat down behind the drums,

316
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,310
like I didn't take it off.
I sat there,

317
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:13,060
so it was like a had a kid or something
sitting on my lap and this snare was a

318
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:16,390
little lower than I was used to.
So I fucking got through the song.

319
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I think I fucked up every single Phil
and I got that in my already suck at

320
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:23,170
drums.

321
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,120
Why would you add to difficulty with a
pillow and your fucking chest and this

322
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:30,760
thing up? You know why?
Because it's the comedy camp,

323
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,290
there has to be some sort of comedy.
So I just love my double bass playing.

324
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:40,390
It's the whole fucking thing
sucks. So then the closer was, um,

325
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,650
was a def Leppard pour some sugar on me,

326
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,930
which was a song that
I absolutely fucking,

327
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,310
and not necessarily because it was a bad,
it's a pop song for what it is.

328
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:52,390
It's a great fucking song.

329
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:57,391
But he is a reason why I hated it was
because in 1988 my buddy got that fucking

330
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:00,460
tape.
Okay.

331
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,780
And all he did was listen to that
fucking song. Like why don't,

332
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:08,290
can we listen to animal? Can listen to
hysteria at no, no. He just kept fucking,

333
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,750
I remember a time he didn't
really know the lyrics,

334
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,560
but anytime I would get to pour some sugar
on me, he'd be like pumping his fist.

335
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,130
So was doing the song right

336
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,090
and thank Christ we got out of the middle
part where there's all that busy bass

337
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:29,140
drum shit then, ah ha
or that, oh shit. Right.

338
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,560
We got to all of that,
that whole breakdown thing.

339
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:33,760
And then we're right in the end.

340
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:37,990
And I go to hit the bass drum and
no sound comes out of the bass drum.

341
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:38,890
And I'm like,
what the fuck?

342
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:43,891
And I looked down and my bass drum Beta
had fallen off right in the middle of

343
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:48,880
the folk and song. So fortunately
had the double pedal. So I just,

344
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,410
I just played the, the left one for the
rest of the song. Nobody really noticed,

345
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,370
um, until they got to the end of the
song. And I had to do all my, my songs,

346
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:02,200
fillers and I had nothing. Oh, it's
Paul Forsee. Ladies and gentlemen,

347
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,690
welcome to the podcast.
Mr. Paul Versey.

348
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,260
Paul, can you hear me? Hey Dude,
I'm doing, I'm doing my podcasts.

349
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:15,220
Let me call you back. I'll
be done in about 15. I see.

350
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,020
Um, you know, so that, that
all of that shit happened.

351
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:25,990
So I had such fucking high
hopes. I'm like, I'm going
to fucking murder this song.

352
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,290
And I did in a, in a bad
way. I butchered it. Um,

353
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,510
but my standup set,

354
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:34,420
the thing that actually do for a living
was actually really fun and it was fun

355
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:37,300
to go out there. I wasn't really
being Vinnie Paul, I was just acting,

356
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,360
I was just speaking in a southern accent
and I was talking positively about Ar

357
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:43,564
fifteens

358
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,770
which is such a fun thing to do,
um,

359
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,570
in Hollywood is to dress like a cowboy
and then say why you love Ar 15.

360
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:02,200
So I mean, why, why wouldn't a, why
wouldn't you do that? All right.

361
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,670
So anyways, late to the
party, got into parent terror,

362
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,180
could have seen them live. My younger
brothers were going to go see them.

363
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:15,130
I was like, yeah, you know, and yeah,
I think I'm okay. I think Mr Right.

364
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:20,080
And I, I didn't go see them. Uh, you know,

365
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,220
just, I don't know when the, when
the fuck did the 1990 they came out,

366
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,340
we're talking, okay, I'm literally
30. I'm 30 years behind. The fucking

367
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,150
30 is late.
Wherever the party was.

368
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:32,900
Like the fucking building
doesn't even exist anymore.

369
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:34,510
That's how fucking late am all right.

370
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,310
Continuing continuing with the late to
the party fucking theme here. All right.

371
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,760
I finally watched the first
moto GP race and Qatar.

372
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:48,330
Is that how you say it? And I
got to tell you something. Okay?

373
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:51,540
For those of you not into with
debt is a professional, uh,

374
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,550
motorcycle racing at its highest level.

375
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:56,280
It's the formula one of motorcycle racing.

376
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,590
And I have to tell you
something right now.

377
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,110
I don't know why I have to tell you that.
I'm going to tell you something.

378
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:04,470
I should just fucking, you
know, cause I watched friends,
Mcdermott. Dharmic, right?

379
00:24:04,471 --> 00:24:06,160
I'm going to say something,
right?

380
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,660
I'm going to say something
that fucking sport.

381
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,300
Okay.

382
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,920
Completely fucking sold on it.

383
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,890
I am a big fan of Andre de Vizios.

384
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:23,230
So who drives to Ducati and
Italian? Right? I just fucking,

385
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,820
I like loved the way rides.

386
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,660
I know Mark Marquez is like the
fucking Derek Jeter or this sports.

387
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:32,020
So whenever I get into a new sport,
you know, it's like Lewis Hamilton.

388
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,510
I'm not going to come.
And do you know, Oh,

389
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,390
this is my first year of watching
Formula One, my favorite drivers,

390
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:40,930
Lewis Hamilton. The guy will
fuck it always wins. Um,

391
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,850
so I can't be a mark. I like Mark
Marcus. I'm going to say I'm not a fan,

392
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,090
but it's just,
I can't be like some bandwagon guys.

393
00:24:48,091 --> 00:24:51,880
So de Vizios so it was a guy watched last
year. I was just like, I like this guy.

394
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:54,670
He's always, you know, he's
always up there and you know,

395
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:56,720
on the podium or whatever,
he's calming.

396
00:24:56,721 --> 00:25:01,720
I liked him and I liked a Yo hand Zarko
I just liked his bike and he was always

397
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:04,670
up there and he seemed like he didn't
have as good a bike is other people and he

398
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,350
was somehow fucking with those guys.
So I watched the first.

399
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,680
MMM.

400
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,280
I watched the first race and uh,

401
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:19,281
I had missed all the qualifying and I
see yo head Zarko has pole position.

402
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,560
I was like, Holy Shit. Last
year his whole story was like,

403
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:28,510
this guy is like right there,
but shit just kept happening. Um,

404
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,630
and he didn't quite get over the hump
and here is the first race of the year.

405
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,450
That guy's got the pole position. So
I watched the race. And by the way,

406
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:38,350
if you think this is a big time
commitment, it's like 22, 23 fucking lap.

407
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:42,550
She can watch the whole race
in 40 minutes. There's no
pit stops. And by the way,

408
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:45,970
it's people racing on motorcycles
going over 200 miles an hour.

409
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,880
Now they're going to say kilometers.
So it's simple math.

410
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,390
Every 80 kilometers is 50 miles an hour.
Okay?

411
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,770
So a lot of times they go and
like, you know, 240 kilometers,

412
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:58,870
that means they're going
to about 150 miles an hour.

413
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,610
And then on the straightaways, when they
go by, all the fans to start finish line,

414
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,510
they will get up over 300 320
when they get the 320 they go,

415
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:10,200
they're going 200 fucking miles an hour

416
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,760
on a motorcycle and there's someone
right on their ass and they have a big

417
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:18,490
fucking turn that they
have to slow down for.

418
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,580
And the big fucking movies who has the
balls to break last usually comes out of

419
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:27,580
the turn the fastest. However, if you
go wait, if you brake too fucking late,

420
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,650
you might go to widen,

421
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,880
the guy will cut under neath IA or you
could go flying off your bike and die.

422
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,440
All right. Now, if that's not enough
excitement for you, that I don't know.

423
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,790
I don't know what to tell you.
So anyway,

424
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:44,791
so I'm watching this race and your Zarko
in the lead for the whole fucking race

425
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,030
and, and they keep talking about his
front tire because he's averaging like,

426
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,630
I don't, I don't know what they're, his
average was like one 50, 150 kilometers,

427
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,170
uh, which would be what? Oh, Jesus. Bill,

428
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,310
that's like a little over a hundred
miles an hour is what he was average.

429
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:05,280
And that's, you know, with all the turns
slowing down and all of that Shit, right?

430
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,860
Um, I'm sitting there watching this
fucking guy and I'm like, Holy Shit.

431
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:13,020
Is this guy going to go wire to wire?
And when, and they keep talking.

432
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:16,440
This was something I need people
who are into this, this, uh,

433
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,300
into racing to explain to me,

434
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:23,100
they just kept talking about your
hands Arccos front tire and saying it's

435
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,640
eventually it's going to wear down and
he's going to have a fucking problem.

436
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:30,030
And before it happened to him and
happened to Valentino Rossi and all of a

437
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:34,560
sudden, like he was in second place and
all of a sudden on one lap he got, um,

438
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,760
he got passed by like two people. But
then it's like he made this adjustment,

439
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,240
which is why he's evidently the
one of the greats of all time.

440
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:45,930
And he was able to come back and still
make the podium and come in third place.

441
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,120
But when it happened at Zarko,
he just,

442
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,460
he got passed by two people
at the same fucking time.

443
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,480
You went from first place the whole race
down to not even being on the fucking

444
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:57,240
podium.
And then he ended up finishing eighth.

445
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,650
And why doesn't he have the same
fucking tires as the other guys?

446
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,130
How come?
How come his tires are wearing down

447
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,220
faster than other people?

448
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,310
What the fuck does this Zarko guy
have to do to get the best shit?

449
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,110
Yeah,

450
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,130
I know. I'm probably fucking this up.
So anyways, a Da Vinci also, right?

451
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,890
He was like in ninth
place starting the race.

452
00:28:20,891 --> 00:28:24,670
So I was kind of keeping an eye on him,
you know,

453
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,760
like what's his face when I was
watching the Formula One when uh,

454
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,130
Valtteri Botox started way in the back
because of the gear shift penalty, uh,

455
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,500
changing out the gearbox fucking
a penalty gear shift penalty,

456
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,250
the gearbox penalty and um,

457
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,320
I just watched him slowly moving his way
up through the field and then the last

458
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:46,510
two laps of the race.
Okay. He's in first place.

459
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:49,570
Mark Mark has is in second
place and last year.

460
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:53,170
This is like the Brady
fucking Peyton manning.

461
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,570
This is star back for stabler Elway
verse Montana. This is just like,

462
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:58,901
okay,

463
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:03,760
this is Jordan verse Dominic
Week Wilkins Dunkin Content,

464
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:07,240
one of the great chaebol in First Russell,
whatever the fuck you want to call it.

465
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,450
And these guys were fucking riding
like maniacs for the last two laps.

466
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,920
Marquez is right on Davinci.
Oh,

467
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,450
so his ass and he just knew it
wasn't easy going to pass him.

468
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,160
It's when is he going to pass him?

469
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,430
Because he did this all fucking
last year and it drove me nuts,

470
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:28,540
which is why I became a de bitsy also fan.
You gotta gotta root for the underdog,

471
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:33,250
right? So there's like fucking two or
three corners left and they're like,

472
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:34,870
I don't think mark has his close enough.

473
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:38,130
And all of a sudden he
braked later than Divisio so,

474
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,140
and he was right on his ass and the
next fucking corner he fucking goes

475
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:47,460
underneath divisio. So in past them, and
I didn't even realize I was that into it,

476
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,080
I was in the living room and
I would just went like, Nah,

477
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,200
my wife comes running it.
What's the matter?

478
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,350
She thought there was something
wrong with that kid. So he does,

479
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
he goes dives underneath the vizios.
So at this point,

480
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:10,250
you know they're going like 90 fucking
miles an hour in a turn with their knee,

481
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,170
like a, like an eighth of an
inch off the fucking ground.

482
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,830
And he ducks underneath them.
But he was going so fast,

483
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:21,660
he went a little wide and then divisio
so went underneath him and then it was

484
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:25,860
just a fucking flat out race on
a straightaway. Just pinning it

485
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,330
all the way to the fucking finish line
into vizios. So wins it. It was just an,

486
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,290
it's everything that's missing in Formula
One as far as like, I love Formula One,

487
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,790
I'm going to continue to watch it,
but I just fucking hate water. It's,

488
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,580
it's just a race to the first corner and
whoever's in the first corner is going

489
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:47,850
to be driving and clean air
and everything. Everybody
is so equally matched.

490
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:50,610
No one's going to be able to pass him and
then you just have to wait for someone

491
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:54,450
to fuck up in the pits.
Like that's the exciting passing.

492
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:55,350
It's just like in this guy,

493
00:30:55,351 --> 00:30:59,460
get out of the pits before that
second place guy comes around again.

494
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,270
Um, I dunno, but if you're,

495
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:07,960
if you're missing passing and Formula One,
uh,

496
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:12,640
I would suggest jumping sports. You
can watch him both. I mean it's, they,

497
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,320
it's not that much that you're committing
to 40 races a year. On a 365 days.

498
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:21,490
I mean, he can take them, you can watch
them whenever you want to. So, uh,

499
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,520
I am 100% sold on this fucking sport
and I've actually going to be taking a

500
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:32,791
vacation coming up when I'm celebrating
my 50th birthday and I just realized I'm

501
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:38,731
going to be in the vicinity of that
race and Spain and I'm trying to talk my

502
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:42,790
wife into going with me. That's my, uh,

503
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,450
and I'll just be like,
come on honey.

504
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:49,260
It's my 50th birthday and she's such a
sweetheart. I think she's going to do it.

505
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,940
By the way, a honorary mentioned
to a cow crutch low, uh,

506
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:59,150
coming in fourth place and riding a
great race and having one of the great

507
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:03,990
fucking names of all time, cal crutch
Lowe is such a fucking cool name.

508
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:07,710
It doesn't even sound like, it sounds
like an alias. Like if I was a cop,

509
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,890
I wouldn't believe him if I
cut some underage drinking.
All right, give me an age.

510
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:16,710
Which name? Uh, count crutch low.
All right. Get up against the wall.

511
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,500
He'd go downtown. I swear to God
it's my real name. Um, anyways,

512
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:24,630
all I got to go a little read here.
I got to do little re,

513
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,400
I get the little read here.
Uh,

514
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,700
and then get off my fucking
day cause I got another show.

515
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,340
I'm coming up where I'm
going to be playing drums.

516
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:36,090
I've got to make sure I tighten down the
fucking bass drum beater before I play.

517
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:40,920
I'm doin a Dean del Rey's.
It's is uh,

518
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,640
what was it, 52nd birthday. And uh,

519
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,920
I played drums on his
50th birthday is great.

520
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:51,870
He has a whole standup show and then
after that he came out for his 50th

521
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:53,430
birthday with a live band.

522
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,060
He sang the entire AC DC
highway to hell album.

523
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,500
So for his 52nd, he's going
to be singing the, uh,

524
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,010
the entire, uh, power age album.

525
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,860
So I'm playing a couple
of songs off of that,

526
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,600
so I got to make sure
I have that shit down.

527
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,780
And I'm also gonna make sure that the
bass drum beater is fucking tightened out.

528
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,680
Um, but whatever. And once again,

529
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,730
trying to learn those songs that I've
been learning I and really be able to play

530
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:25,110
him a whole new, already had a love, uh,

531
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,740
Phil Rudd. But Jesus Christ,
I mean, he's just, he just,

532
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,080
it's perfect what that
guy's plays is perfect. Uh,

533
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,060
but this can be a bunch of,
you know,

534
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:40,470
big musicians there cause dean came up
in the, in that world and music world,

535
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:43,300
so he knows all of these guys.
Um,

536
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,100
I think there's a flyer somewhere
out there I missed. I think that I,

537
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:51,600
but actually I believe it's already
fucking sold out. But, um, that's my day.

538
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,940
I'm going to go fucking play drums.
Huh?

539
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,850
I don't know why all you
guys don't become comedians.

540
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,040
You get to be a fucking kid
for the rest of your life. Um,

541
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,490
actually it's not that easy.

542
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,440
After 20 years of
sitting there going like,

543
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:10,830
did I make the biggest mistake of my life?
Then all of a sudden the clouds part,

544
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,660
you know,
unless you have a look,

545
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,550
unless you have a look and then he gets
scooped up early and they chew you up,

546
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,670
spit you out. All right. Oh look
who's here though. Tell me undies.

547
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,720

548
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,460
He's, I got nothing to fucking say,
dude. Dude. Dude, do me undies.

549
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,210

They'll feel real good.

551
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:35,180
You won't give a fuck.

552
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Cause me undies has the best under wear
and they'll feel nice up against you.

553

A pubic hair. Oh yeah. All
right. Mandy's everybody.

554
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:49,460
You've heard me talk about
me undies and you know what?

555
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:53,060

556
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,880
they're the perfect
balance of comfortable fit.

557
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,930
Every month they have new and exciting
prints and they arrive at your door in a

558

fun bag. Talk about why me
undies, other best underwear.

559
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,880
Uh, I liked that my balls don't
fall out of them. You know,

560
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:10,400
if that's been a problem with like
tidy whities, you know what I mean?

561
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,940
They got the little pee hole there and a,
just the way it's situated, if you know,

562
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:18,260

dunno. Just sorta really relaxed that day.

563
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:22,680
All of a sudden. Yeah, got an
issue, you know what I mean? Oh,

564
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:26,340
does that work me undies core
copy running wired bill. Why they,

565
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:31,341
why do they have the title me undies
uses Lynn Zig Lenzing Lenzing.

566
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,140
It sounds like a metal band that never
made it. Did you remember that band?

567
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,110
The lending.
They had a couple of good songs.

568
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,420
Lenzing my girl modal, modal and their
underwear. It's sustainably sourced.

569
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,710
Naturally soft fire,

570
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:51,730
but that starts with beechwood trees
and ends with the most amazing fabric

571
00:35:51,731 --> 00:35:52,690
you've ever experienced.

572
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:57,130
I have to find a making
of Lenzing micro modal,

573
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,900
modal. How do you start with trees and
then end up with something that can be up

574
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:05,790
against your body.
You know,

575
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,580
even if they polished it down like I
don't think I would want to have like

576
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,540
guitar grade wood up against my nuts,
but for several,

577
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:16,650
I don't know how they do it anyways. The
results have been downright dreamy man.

S me on dies.com/bar.

589
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:05,040
I slowed that down cause I realized,
you know people have brains like mine.

590
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,680
That would have been too fast.
How do you spell it?

591
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,430
Helix. Everybody. How? Uh,

592
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,660
there's nobody on the planet
like you know, you're special.

593
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,690
So why would you buy a mattress
built for everyone else? Well,

594
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,140
what about your doppelganger?

595
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:28,350

over at his house working with the

world's leading sleep experts.

Those sleep experts. Can you get
laid tonight? What do you do?

598
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,950
Big Boy. Uh, I'm asleep. Expert.
Oh, I love sleeping. Well,

599
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,570
why don't you come over here and sleep
on this Dick. Sorry. He looks sleepy.

what's Today's sensitive people is he,

601
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,860
it seemed once he just
advocating drugging people.

602
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,013
MMM.

603
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,350
Helix sweep developed a mattress that

The all new pillows are fully

613

so you can achieve perfect comfort.
How are they adjustable?

614
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,040
Is really a little motor in there.
Would that be up against your head?

615
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,060
How would that be comfortable regardless
of sleep position of body type.

616
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,860
Helic sleep has thousands
of five star reviews. Well,

617
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,210
how many one star reviews do you have?

618
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,680
You're just going to talk

623
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,410
E. L. I. X. Was there a band called that

624
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:22,130
Alex Band? Was it helix? Maybe.
That's why I always fucked that up.

625
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,380
Were they the guys who were like,

626
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:30,381
give me an r o c k and what?

627
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:34,860
She got rock and what are we going to do?
Rock you.

628
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,910
It was like if cheerleaders
made a heavy metal song,

629
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,670
that's the spirit rebel
against your parents. Sorry,

630
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:51,470
my Internet's not working. All right,
that is the podcast. Have a great weekend.

631
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:54,560
You fucking cunts.
I'm going to be at the Brady.

632
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:59,561
The top gray dod said best the Brady
Theater and Tulsa Oklahoma with led Debbie

633
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:03,380
talks,
Dean del Rey,

634
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,100
and then we're going down to San Antonio
for two shows and I for the life of me,

635
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:12,101
couldn't figure out why it was like 500
fucking bucks at night for a hotel in

636
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:13,640
San Antonio.
I'm like,

637
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:16,910
what do they have some new hipster area
or something and they making cupcakes

638
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:20,930
and riding bicycles. Why is
everything so expensive? Well,

639
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:23,840
it turns out that the night I'm there,

640
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:27,290
so it's the final weekend,

641
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,020
so I bet a lot of you are thinking like,
oh,

642
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:33,260
bill came in town to go to those games
and I had no idea that games were there

643
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:38,261
and I'm just paying five times what
I normally would have paid for 'em.

644
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:39,940
Yeah,

645
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,430
for a hotel room. You don't, I just
realize whatever happened to five,

646
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:44,830
four club Faffel Club,
motherfucker

647
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,220
did. They dumped me. You know what?

648
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,960
I am so sick of being,

649
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:57,000
I feel like I'm that podcast that like
advertisers go to right before they meet

650
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:58,860
their soul mate podcast.
You know what I mean?

651
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,100
You know that chick who's always the
fucking bridesmaid, never a bride.

652
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,390
That's what I'm starting to feel.

653
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,600
I just don't feel that people
understand what the fuck it is.

654
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,980
A just cause I joked doesn't mean people
take it seriously in the God damn copy.

655
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:13,500
It makes them listen to it
rather than fast forward to it.

656
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:17,820
It's so fucking simple. Why can't you
Madison Avenue conch figured that out.

657
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,680
Maybe they're going to be
advertising my podcast next week.

658
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:27,430
I probably should check with my
producer before I say that.

659
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,880
But you know what even did
all right. That's it. Okay.

660
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,150
Here's a little bit of music and then um,
I don't know.

661
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,870
I guess the fucking we'll play in some
half hour greatest hits. You know what?

662
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,770
I'm actually, I'm going to tell my
guy to fucking put a slayer south.

663
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:43,604
They haven't.

664
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,570
Alright,
go fuck yourselves

665
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,893
Monday.

666
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,590
Have you guys seen this youtube video?
My name is John Dacre.

667
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,610
You got to watch this thing.

668
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,690
I apologize cause it's going to be in
your fucking head for the rest of the time

669
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,530
he's singing. He's singing a
moray and he can't remember how to

670
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,393
more

671
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,173
rare.

672
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,590
They can't stop watching this
guy, this guy, I swear to God,

673
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,210
I think it's his first TV Gig.
Somebody was sick,

674
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:23,510
I think they said at the beginning. So
this guy fills in and if you look at him,

675
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:25,970
he's literally having an
out of body experience.

676
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,660
So it's so funny to me because I can
relate to this person because the first

677
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:32,690
time I did stand up I felt
like I was watching myself.

678
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,550
I've fucked everything up and this guy,
just the way he says his name,

679
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,420
it's almost the just,
he says like,

680
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,080
my name is John [inaudible].

681
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,803
Okay.

682
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,783
Yeah.

683
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,820
It's like,
it's like he was outside,

684
00:43:50,821 --> 00:43:54,640
so I think that might be my favorite
part of the video is the one this fucking

685
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:59,130
guy. Just the way he says his own name. He
didn't say, my name is John [inaudible].

686
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,330
He goes,
my name is John Dacre.

687
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,860
I did it right the first time
I, and I just fucked it up. Hey,

688
00:44:05,861 --> 00:44:07,600
you got to hear this.
You got this fucking guy.

689
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,090
He says he's singing all these
Jesus songs. Hang on. Hang on.

690
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,820
My name is John Dick,
or

691
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,530
my name's John Take.
It's like he's watching life,

692
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,030
like he already died

693
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,870
and then he came back and he just got to,

694
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:38,750
okay.

695
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,750
Like he, first time we ever realize
my name. My name is John Taker.

696
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,330
That's my fucking name.

697
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:47,300
And this is my life and I'm on TV
and I'm going to sing this song.

698
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:48,960
Yeah.

699
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,500
This is what I did with my life. And as
you look at the guy fucking poor bastard,

700
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,840
oh my God, listen to
them sing. Hallelujah.

701
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,940
Oh Damn.
But for the grace of God,

702
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:25,090
this fucking guy would be the most
interesting interview ever. Just like,

703
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:26,270
yeah,

704
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,790
he's one of the most fascinating
people I've ever seen. Like what the,

705
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:32,780
what is going on in between those fucking
ears right now? I think if they could,

706
00:45:32,781 --> 00:45:35,930
if you could make a show
about his fucking thoughts,

707
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,890
you know all these fucking movies. Oh,
it's, yeah. You know, they show the movie,

708
00:45:39,891 --> 00:45:43,670
but it's done in reverse. And then they
tried to fucking flip you out. Nothing.

709
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,140
Not that pink Floyd could ever fucking
right can match what's going on in this

710
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:50,030
guy's head. Highly
recommended. All right. Yeah.

711
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:30,483
Okay.

712
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:37,450
What's going on? It's built and is this
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

713
00:46:37,451 --> 00:46:41,800
March 29th,
2010 72 degrees out.

714
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,060
Her little sort of jealous.

715
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,150
How the hell are you?
How's it going?

716
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,480
I know I've been getting a ton of emails
do it. It's still not up on iTunes.

717
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,120
I don't know what's going on.
All right.

718
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,850
All I know is I just keep
recording these fucking things.

719
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:57,240
Having faith that we'll finally
get these fucking things up there.

720
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,420
I know we're going to,

721
00:46:58,421 --> 00:47:02,040
and I'm going to go out on a limb
and say this is definitely the week

722
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,880
everything's going to be up there,

723
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,260
but until then I'm going to whore
myself out and tell you that the Monday

724
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:09,450
morning podcast starring me,

725
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:14,451
myself and I is only a exclusively on
billboard.com that's the only place she

726
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:18,690
can get it. See what I did.
I'm like a drug dealer.

727
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,030
I gave you a couple of free samples.
Actually I didn't.

728
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:25,110
I gave it two and a half fucking years
of free samples and then I fucking pulled

729
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:26,440
it.
Oh,

730
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:30,280
you guys are all feed in for it and I'm
going to get you to my fucking website,

731
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:33,370
right.
I'll get a bunch of hits on my website,

732
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,300
then I'll start selling advertising for
like tampons or something and I'll make

733
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:41,680
a fortune. Get a midget in a hawker. Hang
on. I have to sneeze. Where's The sun?

734
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,600
Where's this something? Come
on, give me some sun. There
it is. There it is. Nothing.

735
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:50,010
I hate that. When you feel it, it's
like fucking blue balls for, you know,

736
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:53,620
so I thought it was gonna fucking
sneezer nothing. All right.

737
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,860
Anyways, it's Monday, March 29th.

738
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,370
I have not watched one 2nd of
March madness and is always,

739
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:03,100
it's the best fucking sporting event of
the year. And I don't know what happened.

740
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:08,680
I was over in a fro and uh,
I was over in Europe, so, uh,

741
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,130
you know, I wasn't there at the
beginning, so I missed the whole thing.

742
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:15,880
I watched Kentucky lose yesterday and
I can admit I can't really look at John

743
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,030
Calipari the way I used to have to, what's
his face verbally bitch slapped him.

744
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,593
Um,

745
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,850
that angry white haired guy from Indiana
who then went to Texas and now he just

746
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:27,340
talks about games.
The fuck's his name.

747
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:30,250
I actually went to a game when I was
out there when he was still locked down.

748
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:33,640
What the fuck is his name?
I keep thinking white to his hair.

749
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,790
Jesus Christ. He's one of the great
coaches of all time. Come on bill.

750
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,530
You've been going to lumosity.com.

751
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,080
Okay.

752
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,920
Focus. Let it go. Just don't care about
it. I don't give a fuck now I care.

753
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:50,420
My brain can tell. I care. So it's just
hiding it. Just mocking me. Come on work.

754
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:57,420
Bobby Knight. There we go. I to think
of him throwing the chair. Uh, yeah,

755
00:48:57,421 --> 00:49:00,960
he called you give key, actually called
John Calipari out on some kind of decent,

756
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:04,560
he said, you know, every fucking program
that this guy has been a part of,

757
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:09,420
has had some sort of problem with the
NCAA and then he jets out of town,

758
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:14,340
you know, continuing to build his
resume. And he really trashed him.

759
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,080
Now I'm not saying what he said was right,

760
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:20,310
but Calipari all he came back
with was a respect glovie night.

761
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:23,850
I think he's a great coach. And he
didn't that you didn't address anything.

762
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,290
You know, somebody told me
I killed a hooker and they
were a friend of mine and I

763
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:32,580
respected them. I would address the
killing of the hooker at some point. Uh,

764
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,510
in my innocence of it before
I, you know, after, you know,

765
00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:42,560
after I said how much I respected
the guy. Right. You know,

766
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:45,710
I went to a game one time out there in
Indiana with Bobby Knight was still there

767
00:49:45,711 --> 00:49:48,310
and he was, you know, Indiana
started to lose. It was a year.

768
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,720
Michigan State won the championship.

769
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,600
I think it was the year
2000 already 10 years ago.

770
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,610
And I went to this fucking
game and I remember I bought
a student ticket and, uh,

771
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,390
you know, showed up at that point
I was well into my thirties.

772
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,380
And the guy's looking at
me like, really? You know,

773
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,560
what do you want the fucking 12 year plan?

774
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,940
That's when he got to come with the
fucking Luther vibe from a 48 hour.

775
00:50:13,941 --> 00:50:16,220
I've been busy,
none of that shit.

776
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,610
When he pulls up to the toll
booth of the parking garage thing,

777
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:24,050
and the guy's like this tickets like
four years old. Yeah, I big busy.

778
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,980
That was the vibe. Me, I just gave the guy
that's like, come on man. Come on. Really?

779
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:34,020
It's me. So he let me in and I
went in there and I remember, uh,

780
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,980
watching Bobby Knight and it was a
fucking great arena. And there he was,

781
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:41,640
the legend, right? I was up
in the nosebleeds, but, uh,

782
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,860
Indiana started losing and he started,

783
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,220
he walked out on the court and was
yelling at the, the point guard,

784
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:52,180
bringing it up to court. Like his, his
whole fucking head was just, you know,

785
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:56,520
with just with every fucking
mother fucking like is like a,

786
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:00,600
like a rooster with Tourette's. Right.
Just, just fucking unbelievable.

787
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,130
And I remember I got so Goddamn
mad watching him do that.

788
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,190
I was just,
I was,

789
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,490
I wanted that kid just to take the ball
and just fire it right into his fucking

790
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,280
screaming face.
Five,

791
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:20,290
I have a son and he allows himself
to get fucking yelled at like that.

792
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,880
You know what I mean?
You fucking retard control.

793
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:28,780
You've got damn emotions. All right. You
want to fucking blow up a little bit.

794
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:32,170
Blow up.
But this guy had completely lost his shit.

795
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,080
Yeah. Do you ever see Marvin
Hagler when he fought Tommy Hearns,

796
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:40,710
remember when he was punching him in the
head and Tommy's fucking head would go

797
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:45,550
back and his Jheri curl all the
shit from it would fly out. Instead,

798
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,340
he was doing that with his head to
himself, except instead of going back,

799
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:53,400
he was going forward every time
he was making a point to this kid.

800
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,270
It was like Ben Kingsley and sexy
beast make me look like a right cunt.

801
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,600
You're fucker Darren to fucking,
ah,

802
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,390
he's leading with this head fucking
right cross white to is fucking,

803
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:06,780
I fucking hate people like that.

804
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,310
Remind me of one of my relatives.
Um,

805
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,990
well I just really revisited that
anger, didn't I? Um, so anyways,

806
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,860
I was actually going to do this
podcast last night at, uh, at,

807
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:24,030
at 12 midnight now that I've been over
to Europe and I found out how many people

808
00:52:24,031 --> 00:52:26,820
listen to my podcast over there. And you
know what? I'm starting to have a little,

809
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:30,660
uh, you know, responsibility for
those people. Like, you know,

810
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,320
I now know that England and Ireland
are seven hours ahead of me.

811
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:37,380
So if I did it at midnight Monday
nights, if I posted it then, I mean,

812
00:52:37,381 --> 00:52:42,240
Sunday nights, you know, they're rolling
into work a couple hours later, you know,

813
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,430
and I know what you're thinking down
there in Australia. Ooh, what about us?

814
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:51,570
We're fucking 14 hours ahead.
Go fuck yourselves. All right,

815
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,070
the fuck. Do you want me to do it
on Thursdays every week? You know,

816
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,480
why don't you be happy?

817
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,890
Why don't you guys just focus on the
fact that you guys don't get respect for

818
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:05,490
living on the largest
island in the fucking world.

819
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,700
You know, Disney's should've made a
cartoon about you guys, Not Madagascar,

820
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,260
Huh?
What was that about?

821
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,550
So sick of those fucking cartoons about
animals that know about global warming

822
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:20,820
and then they teach human beings a lesson.
You know,

823
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:25,800
do you realize that like 98% and I just
grabbed that stat right out of my reach

824
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:30,290
right in and pulled it out. 98% of fucking
animals, including the goddamn insects.

825
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,030
There's an insect, an animal.
I know what ain't human. Um,

826
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,770
98% of those mother fuckers are murderers

827
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:42,010
every day,
every fucking day.

828
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,390
When they want to go out and get something
to eat, they have to commit a murder.

829
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,990
You know, they got to set
a trap. They got to ambush.

830
00:53:50,991 --> 00:53:55,910
They never do with fucking face to face.
You ever seen a fucking animal, you know,

831
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,870
be a gentlemen,

832
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:02,720
come up and slap another fucking beast
with his glove and say, I challenge you.

833
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,930
I challenge you. To a
meal off. I want to eat,

834
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,710
you know, these pieces. Shit.
Fucking animals. What about
me? I don't kill anybody.

835
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:17,780
I go and eat an animal that's already
been murdered. I am accomplice to murder.

836
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:22,010
That's what the fuck I am. Um,
I did I get on that subject.

837
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,120
What was I talking about? It's
talking about Bobby Knight. Oh,

838
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:29,160
some of those stupid fucking animal
movies at Disney's always making,

839
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,250
trying to make me cry.
You know,

840
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:34,250
as they have some polar bears slide
known as belly into a coke can,

841
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:39,280
the same fucking thing that would
just be eating me alive. Um,

842
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,380
if you had to get mauled by an animal,
if you had to get eaten by an animal,

843
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:46,520
which one would you pick?
I picked the biggest fucker ever.

844
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,320
I want that shit to be over.

845
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:53,650
Cause I remember when that gay dude with
the Evil Knievel onesy the Joan Jett

846
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:59,150
fucking leotard. Remember those two
guys out there? Six Free Android.

847
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,490
Roid,
Siegfried and Roy.

848
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:09,640
Siegfried and Roy.
Remember those two twinkle toes out there,

849
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,970
dance around with all those fucking,
you know, whatever they had. They,

850
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,140
they're cats. They were doing cats
the musical for real. What if we,

851
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:22,340
you thrill cats?
I think he's spectacular.

852
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,280
We just skip around and
I'll bleach my hair.

853
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:30,250
And then you put shoe fallacy in
yours. Yeah. Will Rub it's pools.

854
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:34,420
Um, actually that's bullshit because the
musical cats came out after fucking, uh,

855
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,080
the, the, the fucking,
those two guys. Gay,

856
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:42,950
evil Knievel and uh, and gay. Uh,

857
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,860
what was the other one?
What did he look like? A,

858
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,450
who's the other guy at night at the
Roxbury? Not will Pharrel. Oh, Jesus.

859
00:55:50,451 --> 00:55:54,650
My memory is just shot Catan.
That's what it looks like.

860
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:01,670
If they ever,
if they ever make the movie of that,

861
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:06,671
I would cast a Catan Kriska Tan as the
one who gets his neck chopped and then I

862
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:14,450
would have to go with the guy who
played Bo Duke and the rob. Uh,

863
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,480
Nah, he's too fucking all at this
point. Who's got hair like that?

864
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,040
God knows I don't, even if you're fucking
bleached it, I don't get enough left.

865
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,070
Hang on a second.
Who the fuck would I pick?

866
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,610
Okay,

867
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:29,400
well, whatever there, there's your
project for the week. But anyways,

868
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:34,050
my point is when he grabbed the,
the, the gay Chris Catan, dude,

869
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:39,600
it was just over. It wasn't like, Oh
my God, I'm getting new. Buy An island,

870
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,530
an island, a fucking lion.
Jesus. It wasn't that.

871
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:48,240
It was just crapped his fucking throat.
And that was,

872
00:56:48,241 --> 00:56:52,830
if he went to chomp and that was
it. That was it. It was fucking off.

873
00:56:52,831 --> 00:56:56,490
I know, Bill, we saw it. We
saw it on fucking Hollywood.

874
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,940
Aina aided a bitch or whatever
the fuck that, that's stupid.

875
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:03,930
He Hollywood bowl shows he Hollywood
fucking stories about celebrities and

876
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,490
addition all this dirt about them.

877
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,250
Did you ever notice that none of
their close friends are on it?

878
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:12,360
It's because it's all bullshit.
You know,

879
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:18,430
they do like the willy aims story
and they have like his fucking made

880
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:23,990
talking all sorts of shit about him.
There's grant. Good Eve say anything? No.

881
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,910
Does the kid who played Nicholas
Bradford, does he say some shit? No.

882
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,720
None of them say anything. It's always
like, you know, some fucking PA.

883
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking.
I was talking about animals.

884
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,130
Let's rewind this for a second.
Yeah, those stupid fucking, Oh,

885
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:42,520
if you've got to get killed by an
animal. That's what I'm saying. I want,

886
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:47,230
I want to get fucking killed by
something like that. A big cat or a bear.

887
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:50,950
You know there's something about an
alligator though. I just, I don't like it.

888
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,910
I don't like that they have fucking
them. They're mean about it. You know,

889
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,220
they just did, they grab your leg and
then they do that fucking barrel roll.

890
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,020
You know, it's like, can't you just
fucking shot my leg off? Can't you just,

891
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,770
just nice clean Ginsu it and you
know, it was a major writer. We there,

892
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:11,020
I'll fucking bleed out
in like five seconds.

893
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,500
Do you really got out Joe
Theismann me to the 10th power.

894
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,140
You guys ever seen that clip?
Non Sports fans.

895
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,910
If you want to see something that'll
just make you lose your lunch for all you

896
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:23,650
broads out there trying
to lose some weight.

897
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:25,300
If you just had a piece of cake right now,

898
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,280
go on youtube and look up Joe
Theismann breaks leg or Joe Theismann,

899
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:38,020
uh, who landed on him. Lawrence
Taylor. Remember that Shit. It's,

900
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:39,760
it's a,
it's a two for one break.

901
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:45,210
Compound fracture I believe is what is
what is called the Tibia and the fibula.

902
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,940
Uh, yeah, I think that's what it is.

903
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:52,110
Look at me full of fucking pulling
another thing. I'd have my age.

904
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:58,270
Um, all right, so this is the deal. It's
Monday morning out here in Los Angeles.

905
00:58:58,271 --> 00:59:00,070
She probably wondering, hey bill,
you know what, what does that,

906
00:59:00,071 --> 00:59:02,080
what does a struggling actor,

907
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,920
moderately successful comedian
do on a Monday morning? Well,

908
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:09,080
I'll tell you right now.
I had a fucking audition and I,

909
00:59:09,081 --> 00:59:13,690
I prepared my little actor
hard out for it and uh,

910
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:17,580
it was one of the roles I've always
wanted to play. All right. Um,

911
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,050
there's a few scenes that I want
that I want to do as an actor.

912
00:59:20,051 --> 00:59:23,680
A lot of actors want to win an Oscar.
Of course I do. But who's kidding? No.

913
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:28,520
You know, one of my Jane Staple
Horn said somebody's name.

914
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,960
I don't know. Fuck, that is a triple horn.

915
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,020
I don't know what the fuck I'm trying
to say here. Look who's getting to,

916
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:37,700
it would be 42 years old in June.
Okay.

917
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:41,150
If I can just stand near somebody who won
a fucking Oscar, I'm going to be happy.

918
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:45,290
All right? So anyways, um, um,
and you know what I'm doing? I'm,

919
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:48,650
I'm adjusting my dream.
Okay?

920
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,220
Rather than going on Oprah now and
having her ask me how I became so fucking

921
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:55,520
brilliant. Now all I want to
do, I want to have that scene.

922
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,400
I want to play a snitch.
That's what I want to do.

923
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,030
And I want to have somebody
chase me down a fucking alley.

924
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:06,710
I don't give a fuck if it's the cops
are the guys I snitched on and I want to

925
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:10,520
come to the end of the alley. I want that
chain link fence. You know, you grab it,

926
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,850
you're trying to climb up it and you think
you're gonna to make it and then they

927
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:16,190
grab you by your cheap leather coat.

928
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:20,690
They pull you off it and kicked
the shit out of you. I want that.

929
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,680
I want to do the interrogation scene.
You know, when I'm sitting there,

930
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:27,530
then they're doing the good cop,
bad cop. I've already been the cop.

931
01:00:27,531 --> 01:00:30,440
I did that on Chappelle show.
I want to be the guy getting interrogated.

932
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,210
And then the last thing is I want to get
my fucking head blown off in a movie.

933
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,500
So today and I have the perfect head,

934
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:44,450
my big fucking kitchen TV set head,
my Sean Penn forehead. I mean this,

935
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:49,400
it's just begging to be fucking blown
off in a movie. I'm dying for that scene,

936
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:53,120
right? And I had an audition today to, uh,

937
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:57,170
to play a guy who gets fucking shot in
the head. In the end. I was psyched.

938
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,560
I was feeling good. I worked a
whole fucking thing out, right?

939
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:04,130
So I go down to the
audition and I show up,

940
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:07,820
I'm at the address and I'm looking at
somebody's house. I'm like, what the fuck?

941
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:11,030
This is somebody God damn house.
This doesn't seem right.

942
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,560
So I rechecked the address and then I
saw a couple of people walking in holding

943
01:01:14,561 --> 01:01:18,860
this sides. Um, so I was like,
all right, fuck it. Not Sides.

944
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,970
For those of you not in the business,

945
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:22,220
they didn't walk in with like
mashed potatoes and stuffing.

946
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:25,100
It's fucking sides of basically
the part of the script.

947
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,160
The couple of scenes that they give you.
Um,

948
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:32,900
so I go walking in there and I walk in
and all I see is two Asian guys in suits.

949
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,910
And I'm like, all right, this is weird
because basically what happens when you,

950
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:40,820
when you audition for a role,
they kind of know what they want.

951
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:44,150
Every once in a while they
do that all ethnicities.

952
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:48,410
But basically I walk in there and there's
a bunch of howdy duty looking guys.

953
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,880
You know, Donny, most is in there.
Fucking resent me, you know,

954
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,370
cause my red hair hasn't
turned yellow yet.

955
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,950
Now it's not all
redheads, which, you know,

956
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:05,590
it's a bunch of fucking white dudes
about my age, you know. And um,

957
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,320
this time I'll walk in,
it's two Asian dudes,

958
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:13,040
one with the shaved head and one
with fucking Chow, young fat hair.

959
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,900
And they're both sitting
there. I'm like, what the fuck?

960
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:17,930
I must be coming in at the tail end of,
we're trying to find the Asian dude.

961
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:23,070
And I walk in and I sign in and as
right as I sign in to say I'm there,

962
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,790
the casting person came.
I was like, Oh my God,

963
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:31,200
I tried to call and I was like,
oh fuck.

964
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,660
I tried to cut shiny email.
Basically they, they,

965
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:41,040
I dunno, I dunno if they'd cast it.
They gave it to somebody famous or what?

966
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:44,850
But they basically tried to call me to say
that, uh, they were rewriting the role.

967
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:50,350
I love when somebody says that I
tried to call really what happened. I,

968
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,900
I dunno, I, I dialed it, but I
couldn't pick up the, I tried,

969
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:58,350
I couldn't
just be honest.

970
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,340
It was a late night fucking
decision, you know, and I had,

971
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,580
I was one of the first guys coming out
of the shoots. No big deal. Whatever.

972
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,170
I'm already showered,
looking good today.

973
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,760
It was still would been sleeping
like a bump. So, uh, yeah,

974
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:15,520
my day started a little fucked up. When
are you going to do whatever, whatever.

975
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,440
I'm 16, 17 minutes into this podcast,
I got a little bowl of grapes here.

976
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:24,150
Um, and people, let me tell
you something. I am severely,

977
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,390
severely off the wagon.
All right.

978
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,620
I stumbled in last night and,
uh,

979
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,830
all I had was two beers.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

980
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:37,560
I was like stumbling and I,
you know, got out of my car,

981
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:41,940
which I probably shouldn't
have been driving. I two
beers in an hour and a half.

982
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:44,430
So I mean I think I'm not drunk.
Right?

983
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:48,840
Your body gets rid of a one drink an hour.
Isn't that what it is?

984
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:53,820
All I know is I have this fucking little
zip up, right? My little fucking, uh,

985
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,350
you know, I don't know what
it is. It's like a fun,

986
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,840
I think it has the English flag
on it and it's white. It's weird.

987
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:03,090
It looks like really American
because it's red, white and blue.

988
01:04:03,091 --> 01:04:04,620
It's a fucking cool look and zip up.

989
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:08,130
It makes me look maybe two and a half
years younger than I am and I'm vain.

990
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:08,964
So I wear it.

991
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,930
So I stumble out of my car and I brush
up against the hinge of the garage and I

992
01:04:13,931 --> 01:04:17,730
have, and then I was like, fuck. And
I looked down and I have this Greece,

993
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,300
at least it was brand new, so it was
kind of green looking and I ruined it.

994
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,290
And I just sat there and I remembered
what this recovered alcoholic told me when

995
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:28,020
I wasn't drinking. I was like,
Yeah Dude, I'm done with drinking.

996
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:30,690
And he looked at me and he said, yeah
man. He goes, nothing good comes from it.

997
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:34,530
And I was like, once again, this
guy's right when you're younger,

998
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:38,370
good stuff comes from it. You get laid,
you get charged with date rape later,

999
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:41,700
but you know in the moment it's
good. Um, no. You know what I mean?

1000
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:46,170
Loosens people up.
You don't know how to talk to a luck.

1001
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,370
Be a lady two nights.

1002
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:53,520
Let me get you drunk and less uptight.

1003
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,230
Gonna stick my finger in your
fucking who? Hoss, Sweetie.

1004
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:02,460
What are you want it or
not? Not doing it. I don't,

1005
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:05,850
I'm not advocating rape here. I just felt
like singing. So let me have a grape.

1006
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:09,180
Maybe that'll take me down here.
Oh God, isn't that delicious?

1007
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:14,340
It was the last time you
bought some grapes and actually
finished them. You know,

1008
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,030
I'm actually trying to, cause
I, when I came back from Europe,

1009
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:21,820
I throw out a hellacious amount of food.
How much do you think?

1010
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:23,080
A starving kid ways,

1011
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:31,000
because when I walked out, I felt like I
had like six of them in my garbage bag.

1012
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:35,710
That's how much food I threw out.
Some of them would jars,

1013
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:39,580
you know, wasn't all food. Some of
it was the containers. But you know,

1014
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:42,880
a lot of it's made out of cardboard at
this point. I throw out a lot of food.

1015
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:44,910
That's what I'm trying to tell
you. So I'm really, I'm try,

1016
01:05:44,911 --> 01:05:47,920
I bought some food this week and
I'm trying to eat all of it up.

1017
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,880
I'm trying to be a less wasteful American.

1018
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,540
I was speaking to that Shit fucked.
And I look up,

1019
01:05:55,541 --> 01:06:00,541
I was on youtube the other day and they
had these German motherfuckers and they

1020
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:06,250
would, they would, they were trying
out the new um, um, dodge challenger,

1021
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,590
the fucking XJS that's a Jaguar,
whatever the fuck you call it. The,

1022
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,350
the Hemi one versus the
Shelby Mustang versus

1023
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:17,500
Dodge Viper.

1024
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,260
And their whole thing was they just kept
relating the cars to eating fast food

1025
01:06:23,261 --> 01:06:26,860
in a big cheeseburger. They will
basically saying, these are American cars,

1026
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:31,750
Americans are fat fucks.
And, uh, I got to admit,

1027
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:34,930
man, we earned it. We did earn
it. But you know, we don't do,

1028
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,700
we don't test out a Porsche and Audi
and a BMW with some sort of Nazi theme

1029
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:44,230
underneath it. You know, I'm fucking
really getting tired of this man.

1030
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:48,130
Everybody's taken shots at the good
old USA. So you know, you got to do,

1031
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,720
I've got a new segment called
let's get smart America.

1032
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:58,090
I wish it had some sort of production on
this where I could just have a fucking

1033
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,920
silly ass song.

1034
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,760
What are you going to do this week as
it a fucking American to make yourself a

1035
01:07:06,011 --> 01:07:08,890
little less fat,
a little less dumb,

1036
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,460
a little less something else.
Cause the magic number is three.

1037
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,040
Say I'm too fucking stupid to
come up with three examples.

1038
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:19,180
What are you going to do? I got to tell
you, these motherfuckers over in England,

1039
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:19,480
man,

1040
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,290
are not in good shape and they
weren't in good shape and fucking in,

1041
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:28,780
uh, Scotland either. Ireland,
they were all right. You know,

1042
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,840
it's like they're not fat,
but they just like,

1043
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,200
they look like out of shape.
Seventh graders,

1044
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,100
like there's not a lot of weightlifting
over there. Like I just saw arms.

1045
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:43,060
You don't like straight arms like Dilbert.
I'm not saying they're all like that.

1046
01:07:43,061 --> 01:07:46,120
So fucking old gets your blood up over
there. Right. You know what I'm saying?

1047
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:52,240
Put it this way. My girlfriend
saw somebody over and um, in,

1048
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:52,720
uh,

1049
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,610
we were the fuck where I think we were
in Scotland and she saw somebody and this

1050
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:01,330
kid looked like he was in his early
twenties, his face. But his body was just,

1051
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:06,130
she just looked at me and she just goes,
his body is unacceptable.

1052
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:12,310
And it wasn't even that he was
fucking ridiculously honest shape.

1053
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:16,150
It's just that not only those
fucking guys over mushy,

1054
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:20,290
they were the tightest fucking shirts
ever. I'm not saying I'm in shape.

1055
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:23,680
I got a nice little fucking pooch going
right now that I need to try to work

1056
01:08:23,681 --> 01:08:26,230
down.
But I have the decency,

1057
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:31,690
the common fucking decency for my
fellow man to wear a button down.

1058
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:34,510
You know,
give yourself a little space,

1059
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:39,130
let it hang off your man tits a little
bit so we don't have to see, you know,

1060
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,660
these fucking guys over in Europe,

1061
01:08:40,661 --> 01:08:44,410
it's like they want you to know exactly
how many pounds overweight they were.

1062
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,830
It was disgusting. You
know, and appreciate it.

1063
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,210
A little courtesy out of my fellow
man. That's all I'm saying. Okay,

1064
01:08:49,211 --> 01:08:51,790
you got you gotta be honest with yourself.
All right.

1065
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:57,820
What kind of shape? My mind wife
beater shape am I and t shirt shape?

1066
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,440
Am I in fucking buttoned down shape?
Do I need to put on a Hoodie?

1067
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:07,480
You know, sport coach
shape. Remember that Shit.

1068
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:11,260
I used to have a regular job. Why am
I walking around? I think I'm excited.

1069
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,990
This is one of the exciting
moments of the podcast for me.

1070
01:09:13,991 --> 01:09:18,160
Look at me pacing back and forth as if
I'm fucking coming up with some brilliant

1071
01:09:18,161 --> 01:09:20,800
shit here.
I remember when I had a regular job,

1072
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:24,040
he used to work in a warehouse
unloading trucks. You know,

1073
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:29,320
it's not curing cancer,
but it served a purpose and a,

1074
01:09:29,321 --> 01:09:30,820
I remember once a year they would have,

1075
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:34,480
they'd have the company cookout and all
these fucking suits that you thought

1076
01:09:34,481 --> 01:09:39,010
were in shape, dude, they would show up
with their fucking tee shirts on. Wow.

1077
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,160
Wow.
You know,

1078
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:46,870
I'm talking like a fucking big slice of
cake just hanging off each side of him.

1079
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,110
I remember it made me feel good too
because they will make him more money than

1080
01:09:50,111 --> 01:09:50,944
me.

1081
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:52,703
You know?

1082
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:57,270
And when you do that, you just fucking
good your wedding in that category.

1083
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,110
So I'm glad that you're losing in
this one. Did that go anywhere?

1084
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,610
However another grape. God Damn
it. These things are tart. So

1085
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,320
here we go. I'm trying to become
a better speller, everybody,

1086
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:16,080
and I'm sick of being a
fucking moron in that category.

1087
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,520
So I figured I'd give you a
spelling tests this week. All right?

1088
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,770
You don't have to play along. You
know, what am I going to tell him?

1089
01:10:22,771 --> 01:10:26,010
He can keep fucking rambling for another
40 minutes. You can tell at this point,

1090
01:10:26,011 --> 01:10:29,970
I don't have shit to talk about this week.
I just emptied my brain on Thursday.

1091
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,400
It takes a week for it to fill up.

1092
01:10:32,401 --> 01:10:34,620
It's like a just jerked off
and you want another load.

1093
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:38,610
I don't have one inmate got a
fucking empty chamber this week.

1094
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:43,730
All right, you guys sitting at your
desk, this would be even better. This,

1095
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:47,450
you know what's great about this, if I
actually add this to the podcast, right?

1096
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:51,210
Teach it fucking 10 words every week,
okay?

1097
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:54,270
We all learn together.
This is the great thing,

1098
01:10:54,271 --> 01:10:56,790
cause if you're listening to it at work,
you shouldn't be doing that.

1099
01:10:56,791 --> 01:11:00,600
You know it and I know it looked down
at in shame right now at your desk.

1100
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,820
Now don't fuck that.
He shouldn't have any shame.

1101
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,360
Did you dream about your job then?
There's no fucking shamed fucking off. Um,

1102
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,550
the great part about this part of the
podcast is you're actually going to start

1103
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:14,270
writing and people going to
be thinking, Oh wow, okay.

1104
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:18,290
Sandy's over there taking notes
on something important. You know,

1105
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:22,610
who fucks off and writes at the same
time. Um, all right, so here we go.

1106
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,420
Here's 10 words that I think,
uh,

1107
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:28,490
I don't think anything about them.

1108
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:32,030
These are just words I fucking found
that I could, I couldn't spell.

1109
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,600
Catalysts is the first word.
What it is.

1110
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,970
Yelled at into the Mike Catalyst
is your first word. All right,

1111
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:40,370
let's see how fucking dumb you are.
We need,

1112
01:11:40,371 --> 01:11:43,190
we need to gauge how
fucking stupid you are

1113
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:50,480
to have a jumping off point. All
right. Catalyst is your first word.

1114
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:56,660
Can you use it in a sentence?
Uh, I don't think I can. Um,

1115
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:02,290
this spelling test was the catalyst
to expose how fucking stupid I am.

1116
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:08,060
Catalyst
is a fucked up one.

1117
01:12:08,061 --> 01:12:12,170
We all eat them. Cantaloupe. A,

1118
01:12:12,171 --> 01:12:16,430
what'd you look at that fucking
cantaloupe? I, you know,

1119
01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:21,290
I just realized I could never do this.
I could never be a teacher. Chloroform,

1120
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:23,580
okay.

1121
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,470
Hey, you know what? If you
don't shut the fuck up,

1122
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:29,790
I'm going to take a chloroform reg and uh,
put it over your face there.

1123
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,430
Chloroform.
God,

1124
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:36,210
this is like designed to make you smarter
and it's really exposing how dumb I am

1125
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,760
is a tough one.
A penitentiary.

1126
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:45,110
Don't go to the penitentiary. You might
get fucked in the ass penitentiary.

1127
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:47,750
Uh,

1128
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:52,790
you know I love about this podcast is,

1129
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:55,930
even though I have no idea
whether this is the, you know, I,

1130
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,890
there's no way to hear
feedback or anything.

1131
01:12:57,891 --> 01:13:01,400
I know this is bombing and I don't give
a shit. I don't know. You know what?

1132
01:13:01,401 --> 01:13:04,820
I don't even know how many I've done.
I'm going to fucking do all ten one, two,

1133
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:10,730
three. I did three, three c words
and I'm not, I would say cunt,

1134
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,740
but it's too easy. Uh, let's go
with another one was another one.

1135
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:20,180
Aesthetics. There's a great one.
Here's a great one. Aesthetics.

1136
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:25,280
Using a sentence. Bill, come
on. You dummy. Jesus Christ.
Look at these aesthetics.

1137
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,710
And you know, it's funny, I know how
to spell all these words now, but I,

1138
01:13:32,711 --> 01:13:36,740
I can't use them in a sentence. It's
just really a fucking moron. All right,

1139
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,930
let's go.
Infrastructure.

1140
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:40,940
Okay.

1141
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:45,080
You know, I'm sick of this
infrastructure. It's really, uh,

1142
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:49,760
it's really unnecessary infrastructure.

1143
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,740
Now I can use that in a sentence.

1144
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:57,800
The infrastructure of the
company was a exquisite, Oh,

1145
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:03,210
Jesus Christ. Geez. Oh
Gee, what else we got?

1146
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:06,060
How many, how many words is that?
One, two, three. That's four.

1147
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:07,770
Okay.

1148
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:10,950
There is a tough one.
Succinct. Think I did that last

1149
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:17,430
succinct.
What?

1150
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:21,300
Somebody who stutters brushes
his teeth in a succinct,

1151
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,280
can I just do five?
Can I bail on this?

1152
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,100
Are you guys enjoying
how fucking horrific,

1153
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:32,000
this is a pertinent,

1154
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:39,530
what does that six, I want to
say that six part in it. Um,

1155
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:42,860
you know what,
if this is pertinent information,

1156
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,920
that's the only time anybody ever uses
that word is when they're describing

1157
01:14:45,921 --> 01:14:46,754
information.

1158
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:48,110
Okay?

1159
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:52,490
If I had access to the pertinent,
pertinent information,

1160
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,290
I wouldn't have to deal with this
infrastructure at this cantaloupe colored

1161
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,753
company.

1162
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:01,693
Okay?

1163
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,770
Pardon it. Fuck you. You don't even know
how to spell it. You can't smell it.

1164
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:10,060
Spell it. You can't fucking
be laughing at me right now.

1165
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:11,680
Okay.

1166
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,940
All right. Here's a fun. The, Oh,

1167
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,750
these ones are all the ones that have
psycho at the beginning of him. Uh,

1168
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,910
here's one. Uh, negotiate.

1169
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,850
You know,
you guys want more money in your cubicles.

1170
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:27,220
You're going to have to negotiate.
Oh,

1171
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,250
negotiate was that age.

1172
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:37,870
I'm even getting bored with this. Uh, this
is a hell of a dilemma. Huh? Go ahead.

1173
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,730
Spell that one dilemma.

1174
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,220
Okay.

1175
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:45,360
I didn't realize this was going to bomb
bomb and now I'm in a fucking dilemma.

1176
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:46,530
Okay.

1177
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:51,510
Dilemma. And what's the
last one here? A silhouette.

1178
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:53,950
Yeah.

1179
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,740
Hey, when I see you silhouette
up against the mood,

1180
01:15:56,741 --> 01:16:00,700
it makes me want to
fucking baggy silhouette.

1181
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,480
Ah, all right. There you go. Let's
just spelling tests for the week.

1182
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:09,130
Do you have any desire to get better
at to shit. Am I super imposing?

1183
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:13,390
That's what I do. I can spell all those
fucking words. Huh? Are you impressed?

1184
01:16:13,391 --> 01:16:16,120
You shouldn't be. Um, here's
another new segment bills,

1185
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:19,000
embarrassing moments from
the previous week's podcast.

1186
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:23,290
This is actually from two weeks ago. I
actually re listened to these when I, uh,

1187
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,280
when I upload them,

1188
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,060
it takes a moment for me to upload all
of these fucking things that no one can

1189
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:31,290
hear unless you go to bill bird.com.
Um,

1190
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:35,330
[inaudible] um,
and I listened to them and I listen,

1191
01:16:35,331 --> 01:16:38,630
I hear all the dumb shit that
I say and the stuff that I,

1192
01:16:38,631 --> 01:16:43,631
I mispronounce like I was trying to say
exclamation point a couple of weeks ago,

1193
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:48,400
exclamation point as an exclaim.

1194
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,910
And I actually said explanation point.

1195
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:56,290
Like it was explaining it
to me in a very excited way.

1196
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:01,810
Jesus Christ, this is fucking
awful. You know what this is?

1197
01:17:01,811 --> 01:17:04,540
You know what this is like, this is
like your second day back at the gym.

1198
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,930
That's what this podcast feels like. You
know, the first day he like, fuck this.

1199
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:08,831
You know,

1200
01:17:08,831 --> 01:17:12,500
when you go nuts and then the next day
you wake up and you're all sore and then

1201
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:14,070
he just fucking dragon asked.

1202
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:19,080
That's what this podcast is just
dragon fucking dragging my freckle das.

1203
01:17:19,371 --> 01:17:20,720
I don't have a freckle das,
by the way.

1204
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:24,680
That would mean that I stunned
bades in the nude. Um, all right,

1205
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:27,740
last week I was talking
about how our Avocados,

1206
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,120
that whole bullshit where
they're, uh, they're too, oh wait,

1207
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:35,810
that's for the wrong part of the podcast
with a fuck. Is that information?

1208
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:42,950
Jesus Christ. Bill. You know what,
why, why do you even try? Oh,

1209
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:45,530
I fucked up. I will be, I can
just tell you the gist of it.

1210
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:49,770
The reason why Avocados costs more
when you go to get a Burrito was a,

1211
01:17:49,771 --> 01:17:53,900
evidently there was some damage done to
the crop a couple of years ago or some

1212
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:56,540
bullshit.
So there was a shortage of them.

1213
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:01,220
Thus they were more expensive.
And as always,

1214
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:06,050
the corporate cons pass the
expense on to the regular people.

1215
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:10,880
And this is what happens.
Then they had more fucking avocado,

1216
01:18:10,881 --> 01:18:14,900
so it wasn't a fucking problem anymore.
But they will like, well, wait a minute,

1217
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:19,430
people are already paying more for
Avocados. Ain't never fucking complained.

1218
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:23,990
So they just kept them at the same price.
So now you pay extra,

1219
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:29,060
which means means when
it's time to change,

1220
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:30,800
what it means is that
they're going to fucking,

1221
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,900
they're going to do that
with every kind of food now,

1222
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,360
cause we're not bitching
about, uh, our bacon.

1223
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,390
I've got a breakfast sandwich and they
said Bacon was extra. So you know what,

1224
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:41,750
that's my little rebellion.
Fuck you all right.

1225
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,920
I'm not paying extra for my
Avocados from my guacamole.

1226
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,570
You fucking cunt. You fucking corporate
cons. How big is your God damn.

1227
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:53,090
Y'All gotta be all right. Let me, let me,
I'm, you know, I'm going to wrap this up.

1228
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,010
You guys are getting a
mini podcast this week.

1229
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,680
I'm not going to sit here and be
treated this way on my podcast.

1230
01:18:57,681 --> 01:19:02,660
When I sit here fucking bomb and
like this, I got a reputation. Um,

1231
01:19:02,661 --> 01:19:05,840
last week I have saying I
didn't understand the difference
between Great Britain.

1232
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:10,580
The United Kingdom is England,
the country is England and Scotland.

1233
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:14,540
Two separate countries are, they're the
same fucking thing. It was all confusing.

1234
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:18,920
So a, this guy says, hey bill, I'm from
England. So answer your question might uh,

1235
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:23,630
England is a country. Cause you said on
your podcast, England wasn't a country,

1236
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,580
but is it you meant to write,
but it is. What do you,

1237
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:31,100
if you're questioning yourself, sir,
what the fuck am I supposed to do?

1238
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:35,390
Scotland is a country, Wales is
a country. I didn't know that.

1239
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:40,040
I thought maybe Scotland was a country,
but I didn't think Wales was a country.

1240
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:45,070
Ireland is a bit different because it's
split into two countries to spelled t oh

1241
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:48,140
there's one of your smart
fucking Europeans there.

1242
01:19:48,141 --> 01:19:52,040
Everybody see that if we
learn how to spell America,

1243
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,190
we can start making fun of them again.

1244
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:00,530
We at least we can have a a
basis to make fun of them. Um,

1245
01:20:00,531 --> 01:20:01,970
anyways,
uh,

1246
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,680
continuing Ireland is a bit different
because it's split into two countries.

1247
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:07,860
Northern Ireland,

1248
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:12,540
the Capitol is Belfast and the
Republic of Ireland capital is Dublin.

1249
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:15,240
Both completely separate countries.

1250
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,260
Countries spelled country apostrophe s

1251
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:20,720
okay.

1252
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,550
Yeah.
See this let's all they do over there.

1253
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:25,400
They watch fucking soccer
and eat fish and chips.

1254
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:27,140
They don't want to fucking spell either.

1255
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:31,160
United Kingdom and this is what the United
Kingdom is. It's a England, Scotland,

1256
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:35,900
Wales and Northern Ireland. Great
Britain. Great Britain is England,

1257
01:20:35,901 --> 01:20:37,430
Scotland and Wales.

1258
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:41,400
Reason being is Ireland is an island.

1259
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:46,200
Hence why Northern Ireland
and the Republican Ireland
are just known as Ireland.

1260
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:50,560
That doesn't make any sense.
England is in Ireland or whatever.

1261
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:53,800
Fucking do the United Kingdom is an
island island. I don't understand that.

1262
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,240
How come fucking,
uh,

1263
01:20:55,420 --> 01:21:00,420
Australia is not an eye is not considered
an island surrounded on all sides by

1264
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:01,444
water.

1265
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:03,150
Okay?

1266
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,410
You know what the fuck.

1267
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,260
South America is an island at this
point with the Panama Canal, isn't it?

1268
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,610
And why does it, it
floated away. Um, anyways.

1269
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:19,010
Anyways, this podcast sucks.
I'm sorry. What did, what
the fuck do you want from me?

1270
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:22,430
All right. I'm fucking Neil O'Donnell
this week. I've got nothing for you.

1271
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,030
I started doing this spelling tests and
all these fucking nerds came out of the

1272
01:21:26,031 --> 01:21:28,970
goddamn woodwork. This guy goes, Bill,

1273
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,040
here's an interesting piece of trivia.

1274
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:36,410
Facetious is the only word in the English
language that has every vowel in order.

1275
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:43,140
A E. I. O. U. Isn't that interesting? Is
that what I did with the spelling tests?

1276
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:45,240
Maybe this is why I never
learned out of fucking spell,

1277
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:47,400
because that's the kind of
people that you attract.

1278
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,520
Here's an interesting
tidbit of information.

1279
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,340
Okay?

1280
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:53,870
Do you know that on the the fucking,

1281
01:21:53,871 --> 01:21:56,570
they started talking about
some moon off of Saturn

1282
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:02,360
that instead of fucking air, it's
the, their atmosphere as methane gas.

1283
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,560
And I got to sit and I sit there and
nod like, wow, you know, and I'm like,

1284
01:22:06,561 --> 01:22:07,460
and he's sitting there thinking,

1285
01:22:07,461 --> 01:22:11,540
I'm nodding because I'm so fucking
interested and I'm really trying to do the

1286
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:12,410
math in my head.

1287
01:22:12,411 --> 01:22:15,050
Trying to figure out when was the
last fucking time this guy got laid?

1288
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:19,820
There's another great stereotype.
If you're some fucking smart nerd,

1289
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:22,910
that means you don't get late in life.
That's bullshit.

1290
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:28,390
It's only in fucking high
school, you know? I Dunno,

1291
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,060
is it, I don't even know if it's
fucking true. I just figure, you know,

1292
01:22:31,061 --> 01:22:31,841
when you get smart,

1293
01:22:31,841 --> 01:22:35,110
if you're really smart and you're good
at business and that type of shit,

1294
01:22:35,111 --> 01:22:38,770
you go out and make money and the second
you make money, what's going to happen?

1295
01:22:38,771 --> 01:22:41,260
A bunch of fucking cancer going
to come out of the woodwork.

1296
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:45,010
Who wouldn't have fucked you back in a
day because she couldn't throw a ball

1297
01:22:45,011 --> 01:22:47,230
through a fucking hoop.
You know?

1298
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:51,220
That's what that twats wanted to vacuum
up when they were in high school.

1299
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:52,500
Okay,

1300
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,820
the,
now all of a sudden look at you,

1301
01:22:53,821 --> 01:22:55,590
you invented a fucking
Hula hoop or whatever.

1302
01:22:55,591 --> 01:22:58,320
The hell you did and now
they want to bang. Yeah.

1303
01:22:59,500 --> 01:22:59,940
Okay.

1304
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,900
Right. Isn't that how it
works? Anything? I am flailing.

1305
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:05,280
Okay.

1306
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,450
I'm walking around.

1307
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:09,390
Why do I feel like I have
to make it 50 minutes bill,

1308
01:23:09,391 --> 01:23:13,650
if you don't have anything to say,
fucking bail. Ah, let me hike this. Um,

1309
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:19,230
the m m p m m podcast.com is the fan page,

1310
01:23:19,231 --> 01:23:23,700
the official fan page, the
only one that I sponsor, www,

1311
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:28,140
the [inaudible] podcast.com. So the
only one that I, that I did well,

1312
01:23:28,141 --> 01:23:29,970
who's kidding who?
It's the only fucking one there is,

1313
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:33,030
but it's the only one that I sponsor.
I'm trying to make it sound more official.

1314
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:36,810
Um, but anyway, so I think there's
at the podcast for this week,

1315
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:40,380
I'm literally laying on my back right
now just staring at the ceiling wondering

1316
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,150
where it all went wrong. Do I have
anything left to talk about? Oh,

1317
01:23:45,151 --> 01:23:48,720
I got something to foist.
Somebody sent me an email. Let me,

1318
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,510
let me just reach for this fucking Straw.
At this point,

1319
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:56,820
somebody sent me an email and it
said overrated in the subject line.

1320
01:23:56,850 --> 01:24:01,850
And then I opened it and it said the
Beatles and then underneath that he wrote,

1321
01:24:03,841 --> 01:24:08,500
yeah, I said it. Let me tell
you something right now. What?

1322
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:12,600
Like how much I fucking
hate people who go, yeah,

1323
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:16,230
I said it.
You know like this shocking you.

1324
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:20,040
Like they're going after some
sort of fucking, you know, taboo.

1325
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:25,500
If you're ever in a comedy club. All
right. And there's a comedian on,

1326
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:30,690
on stage and they, they're
allowed one. Yeah, I said it.

1327
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,820
If they do any more than that.
Yeah.

1328
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:37,140
You have my blessing to start
throwing shit at them. I hate that.

1329
01:24:37,141 --> 01:24:38,490
That fucking false

1330
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,350
dangerous fucking horse shit.

1331
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:48,180
Fucking bitches d to get a job.
What am I said Shit.

1332
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,350
You guys can't handle the truth.

1333
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:52,733
Yeah,

1334
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:57,210
we keep fucking going. Yeah, I said it.
What? I said it, but it's like, dude,

1335
01:24:57,570 --> 01:25:02,130
nobody in the crowd is going. Who
said that? Did you say that? Yeah,

1336
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:05,590
I said it. You know what I mean? Like,

1337
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:08,820
like they're being led out and
fucking let out and fucking handcuffs.

1338
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:14,630
What will people realize that
nothing is shocking. You know?

1339
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,930
Look at the fucking Catholic Church.
Look what the fuck they're doing.

1340
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:22,940
You know what is more shocking than the
fact that they fucking look the other

1341
01:25:22,941 --> 01:25:25,400
way? Cause I understand why they look
the other way. Cause it's so much fun.

1342
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,680
Good money involved.
And you know,

1343
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:32,800
to get to the top of any sort of pyramid,
you have to be an ass kissing cunt.

1344
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:35,710
That's basically what it is.
Unless you created it,

1345
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,800
unless you created
whatever pyramid there is.

1346
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,910
And at that point you want
your ass kissed. So whenever
there's money involved,

1347
01:25:44,030 --> 01:25:45,500
they don't give a shit.
I you,

1348
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,530
what is the most shocking thing about
all of that is that people continue to go

1349
01:25:48,531 --> 01:25:49,540
to the the Catholic church.

1350
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:56,110
Get anybody out there explained
to me how they separate that.

1351
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:57,100
How do you separate that?

1352
01:25:57,101 --> 01:26:02,101
How do you still go to the Catholic
Church knowing that they had 16,000 cases?

1353
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,300
Those are just the ones that came forward.
16 fucking thousand.

1354
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,430
That's the population of a small town.

1355
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,760
16,000 fucking rape of children.

1356
01:26:11,761 --> 01:26:14,610
And you still go and you
give them fucking money.

1357
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,070
What do you think they're
going to use that money for?

1358
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,950
Lawyers to get these fucking guys off.
You know,

1359
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:26,810
I dunno. Why don't Ya Jesus
Christ. Why, why, why,

1360
01:26:26,811 --> 01:26:30,110
why do you go down that fucking
road? All right. You know what?

1361
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:33,800
I'm really off my fucking game. Okay.
Peyton manning threw an interception,

1362
01:26:33,801 --> 01:26:36,110
the final fucking drive of the Superbowl.
This is my,

1363
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,700
this is my fucking Peyton manning
Superbowl game right here. Cause this,

1364
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:44,150
this podcast was it
disjointed cluster fuck.

1365
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:48,380
And I really have nothing that I really
think I was going to come here and I was,

1366
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:52,460
I had a little information
about Avocados and uh,

1367
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,200
what is the United Kingdom?

1368
01:26:54,201 --> 01:26:57,260
And I was somehow going to be able
to fucking talk for 50 minutes.

1369
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:02,500
Do you realize like when you guys,
you,

1370
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,420
all you have to understand is the
level of fucking ego that it takes.

1371
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:08,480
That I can look at three different things
and think that I could run my fucking

1372
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:11,150
mouth for 50 minutes. It's not,
this is even the podcast anymore.

1373
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,360
This is my confession scene that I didn't
get to do because they're retooling

1374
01:27:16,551 --> 01:27:20,510
it. All right? You broke me down.
It's fucking over. You got me.

1375
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:22,610
I have nothing left.

1376
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:26,360
I bought the box set of the wire
just looking at mom around my room,

1377
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:32,000
trying to come up with something.
My voice gets weaker

1378
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:37,160
and I watched the first fucking season
and that's a fucking great TV show,

1379
01:27:37,161 --> 01:27:38,750
but I'm not going to be
one of those guys who goes,

1380
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:42,650
this is the greatest TV show ever.
It's fucking good.

1381
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:46,250
It's a really good show. I
like it. I like it a lot.

1382
01:27:46,251 --> 01:27:50,120
Did I gave a spelling test that I really
do that I give a spelling test on the

1383
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:54,970
fucking podcast. All right.
You know what? I'm going to,

1384
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:59,740
I'm going to bow out gracefully
right now. Okay. If you want, I add,

1385
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,070
I added a date. Here we go. Let me,
let me actually use this podcast.

1386
01:28:03,071 --> 01:28:07,300
What I really want to use it for,
my ulterior motive here is the height.

1387
01:28:07,301 --> 01:28:10,540
My God damn dates. I got some
new dates out there. Everybody.

1388
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:13,960
Let's go to the official
website of Bill Burr.

1389
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,180
He's doing officially one of
the worst podcasts ever. Um,

1390
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:20,650
this week in Los Angeles,

1391
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:25,870
April 3rd at the Gibson MP
theater. Um, I'm doing the,

1392
01:28:25,871 --> 01:28:26,350
uh,

1393
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:31,060
Kevin and being a cancer
show show for cancer.

1394
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:34,150
Hey, let's get rid of the
cancer. Everybody. I believe
that's the name of it.

1395
01:28:34,151 --> 01:28:37,430
It's a fucking benefit for cancer.
Uh,

1396
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:42,130
I'm going to get the punchline in
Atlanta, April 8th, ninth and 10th,

1397
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:45,610
and I'm hanging around the 11th.
I have tickets for the finals,

1398
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:49,870
not the finals to final day of the
masters. Me and another buddy of mine.

1399
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:52,750
I'm going down there cause we knew tiger
woods would cause what's going to play?

1400
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:56,230
We fucking knew it. Okay.
Who's kidding? Who? You know,

1401
01:28:56,231 --> 01:28:59,230
he's sick of bang in that broad.
That's why he fucked around on her.

1402
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:03,810
It was her fault. She stopped him. You
know, she wasn't washing the dishes.

1403
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:05,910
She didn't make sandwiches
for him anymore.

1404
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:10,740
She started taking tiger for granted and
tiger was sitting there and his billion

1405
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:15,000
dollar lazy boy. And he's like,
is this bitch taken tiger woods?

1406
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:17,520
The greatest fucking Golfer of all time?

1407
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:19,150
Okay,

1408
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:21,520
actually, is it Jack
Nicklaus? Jack Nicklaus is,

1409
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:26,020
but she's taken me for granted. Fuck
this. I'm going to go fuck a whore.

1410
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:31,050
That's the one thing that I hated about
that story is how they just never blamed

1411
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:36,241
her for his fucking around
because it was clearly her fault.

1412
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:38,590
Okay.

1413
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:41,770
And if you're wondering why
I'm coming up with that,

1414
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,860
I'm just using the, you
know, it's speak eight.

1415
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:49,510
I'm saying it because of my
respect for females, you know,

1416
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:55,870
because I respect you guys so much
that I'm actually using your train of

1417
01:29:56,721 --> 01:29:58,280
thought.
When you look at,

1418
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:01,010
when you see a woman get caught
cheating and you always view,

1419
01:30:01,011 --> 01:30:01,940
always blame the guy.

1420
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:05,580
What is funny because he
wasn't paying attention to her.

1421
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:10,000
It's probably because he was doing this
is probably because he was doing that

1422
01:30:10,001 --> 01:30:11,090
whether shoe's on the other one,

1423
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:15,360
but you know, they never say it's cause
she wanted to go out and get some Dick.

1424
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:19,120
No, never. Because of that's cause
it's something the guy was doing.

1425
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:23,040
He left his shoes in the fucking kitchen
after she'd fucking mop the floor.

1426
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:27,630
So therefore she had to go to the fucking
Luxor and collapse on somebody else's

1427
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:31,500
cock. Right. It's her fault.

1428
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,140
Okay.

1429
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:37,470
You know where the fuck does she get
off getting mad at fucking tiger woods.

1430
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:41,260
Do you even have a fucking job woman?

1431
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:46,890
What is your job to go around
gold dog fucking Tannin.

1432
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,320
What do you got to dope?

1433
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:54,590
I love these fucking twats who are
married to some unbelievably rich person.

1434
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,591
Okay?

1435
01:30:55,591 --> 01:30:59,970
They have kids with them and they don't
have a fucking job and they still get

1436
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:03,750
help. Still got to have some
fucking, you know nanny.

1437
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:08,750
It's like, do you want to fucking
do anything? I Tony, that's,

1438
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:09,870
that's the guy's fault.

1439
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:14,010
If you marry a fucking woman who
you're making so much goddamn money,

1440
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:18,240
all right that they don't even have a
fucking job and they still need help.

1441
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,460
You need help with doing nothing.

1442
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:21,500
Okay,

1443
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,450
I'm raising kids.

1444
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:25,820
What the fuck my mother
did that and had a job.

1445
01:31:25,821 --> 01:31:28,280
You Lazy Twat get off the Goddamn Sofa.

1446
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:31,230
That's what I would do.

1447
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:35,830
I take a right across my knee and pull
off her fucking Gucci flip flop and I

1448
01:31:35,831 --> 01:31:40,410
fucking paddle or right butt cheek until
she admitted how fucking wrong she was.

1449
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:44,250
What do think about that? Maybe that's
why I'm not a billionaire, you know,

1450
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:49,860
cause that's how I do it. John. I'm
Razzi would take a picture of it.

1451
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:53,490
I do that at paddle. A little fucking
right. Fannie is, I had grapes

1452
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,900
or, and then when they question
me, I just, we fucked you.

1453
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,610
The God Damn Golfer in the world.

1454
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:02,840
Okay,

1455
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,150
thanks to me. Yes. Sunday's aren't boring.

1456
01:32:08,370 --> 01:32:11,820
Come here. Come over here. I'll fucking
sign you camera for you. All right.

1457
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:15,300
Take the film out. Yeah. There's no film
anymore. It's fucking digital. Right?

1458
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,380
Okay.

1459
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:19,560
I Dunno. I want somebody who embrace
being a piece of shit. That's what I want.

1460
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:24,450
That's what I got to say there.
Tiger Woods wife is a lazy fucking Twat.

1461
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:26,670
All right.
And that's why he cheated on her.

1462
01:32:26,671 --> 01:32:28,140
And I'm going to tell you this right now.

1463
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,550
The reason why he's playing the
masters is because they need the money.

1464
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:33,760
Yeah.

1465
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,860
All right. This guy is at work since
November and I know what you're thinking.

1466
01:32:36,861 --> 01:32:38,960
Oh God. Well he's a
fucking billionaire. Yeah.

1467
01:32:38,961 --> 01:32:41,780
And he's living the lifestyle of a
billionaire. Do you think he wants to?

1468
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,050
Of course he does. And he's got
to keep that fucking whore happy,

1469
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:47,213
you know?

1470
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,290
Do you think she cool? Do you think
paid for all the fucking window?

1471
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:53,790
She smashed with that golf club,
right?

1472
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:58,290
I like how he denied that shit in
that attack way. Uh, with a golf club.

1473
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:02,370
Rarely your windows exploded and then you
drove into a tree where you fucking on

1474
01:33:02,371 --> 01:33:05,460
mushrooms. Did you think you
could drive into that little?

1475
01:33:05,461 --> 01:33:09,000
Not In the center of the trunk.
Tiger me a fucking break.

1476
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:11,520
What are you sticking up for?
You know why?

1477
01:33:11,521 --> 01:33:15,150
Because he married her the fucking
idiot. No, he's got this contract.

1478
01:33:15,151 --> 01:33:19,350
You can't get out. He's, he's looking
to lose all the a fucking idiot.

1479
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,000
Okay.

1480
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,290
I hope. I hope she listens
to this. I don't even know
our God damn name. You know?

1481
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:28,680
I don't know your name sweetheart, because
you never did anything with your life.

1482
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:32,880
You know, it was the last time
you even fucking, you ever,

1483
01:33:32,881 --> 01:33:37,260
even when it's swim meet.
What about the preschool level?

1484
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:39,600
When kids are just happy,
they can even fucking stand up.

1485
01:33:39,601 --> 01:33:40,590
Did you even win a ribbon?

1486
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:45,570
What have you ever done
besides suck the Dick

1487
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:52,110
suck the Dick.

1488
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:57,240
It was the greatest golfer of the last 50
fucking years other than Jack Nicklaus.

1489
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:01,740
You know that's your big
accomplishment in life. Oh your heart.

1490
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,940
Let me ask the fellows that question.
Let me ask you this.

1491
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:10,500
What have you or shacking up
with fucking Oprah like Stedman.

1492
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:13,530
Do you think he gives a fuck
if she fucks around on him?

1493
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:18,360
Going to chase him down or
down the street with a ladle?

1494
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:23,340
Some other fucking utensil. Cause
you know Oprah be eaten, right?

1495
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,490
You think he flipped it? I wouldn't give
a shit gun. Fuck whoever you want. Oprah.

1496
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:29,343
I don't give a shit.

1497
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:30,630
Okay.

1498
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:35,430
Can I have another car?
That'd be awesome.

1499
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:39,840
What are you doing today?
Nothing. Doing nothing.

1500
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:44,640
Playing fucking Xbox. That pitch is
doing what everybody wants to do.

1501
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:49,590
Absolutely fucking nothing.
No. Wait. Why don't we work.

1502
01:34:49,591 --> 01:34:53,580
We work so we can, we can have one
zillions of what that bitch has.

1503
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:56,550
She has the nerve to get mad at this
guy because he's out there banging some

1504
01:34:56,551 --> 01:34:57,384
fucking

1505
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:58,700
okay.

1506
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,710
Cause he's tired of her fucking lazy ass.

1507
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:08,670
The fuck is wrong with people. Why
not the one window? What I said it?

1508
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,730
Let's say, yeah, she's fucking lazy.

1509
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:15,390
Okay.

1510
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:18,390
Anytime you see a guy fucking around
on his woman, I'm telling you,

1511
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,090
part of it is because he's a dog.

1512
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:25,980
The other part is because these
women are so fucking, well,

1513
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,300
they'll just lazy
to,

1514
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:32,380
it's like they're not even human.
They're just slothful.

1515
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:33,660
Okay.

1516
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:37,720
Do you know they just sit on religious,
just fucking laying around.

1517
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:39,240
Get off your ass is all you.

1518
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:44,100
You want us to stop fucking around you?

1519
01:35:44,101 --> 01:35:46,620
Get off your fucking lazy ass is
what are you think about? Dead.

1520
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:52,450
All right. That's 49 minutes.
Here we go. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1521
01:35:52,451 --> 01:35:55,600
I'll fucking women out there. Somebody
had to go down, so we had to get hurt.

1522
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:59,140
You know, I had nothing. I was
flailing. I was on the fucking ropes.

1523
01:35:59,141 --> 01:36:02,470
What'd you want from me?
All right.

1524
01:36:02,471 --> 01:36:07,050
49 minutes and 31 seconds. I have another
fucking, uh, oh, I didn't finish hyper.

1525
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:11,980
My gigs let me finish hyper my
gigs. Um, I just added a date.

1526
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:17,490
I'm going to be in a Cincinnati Zia,

1527
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:21,970
Newport, Kentucky. Uh, I'm going
to be at the funny bone. All right?

1528
01:36:21,971 --> 01:36:23,830
So why don't you all you fucking rednecks,

1529
01:36:23,831 --> 01:36:27,990
get her done and come down to
the fucking club. All right.

1530
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:31,510
Now I know I'm not going to be standing
there and overalls with a fucking piece

1531
01:36:31,511 --> 01:36:31,960
of shit

1532
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,460
hanging out of my teeth going,

1533
01:36:33,461 --> 01:36:36,730
you're trying to shoot a
fucking thing and your gun.

1534
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,220
That's crazy. And a fucker can't
Kirk or tier one a hard one.

1535
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:44,650
I know.
I'm not going to be knowing that.

1536
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:48,580
Why don't you broaden your
fucking horizons? All right,

1537
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:53,080
God damn pig fuckers. When are you guys
going to come into the 21st century?

1538
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,770
Um,
where am I going to be after?

1539
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:02,860
Um, oh, I'm going to be
at the, uh, the Wilbur,

1540
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,410
the Wilbur Theater in Boston.
Jody's going to be at the fucking Wilbur.

1541
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,950
I'm at.
We actually added a date on May 6th,

1542
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:16,690
and for some reason it's not up on my
site. May 6th and May 7th, May 8th,

1543
01:37:16,691 --> 01:37:21,400
and it'll be at the Taj Mahal in
beautiful downtown Atlantic city.

1544
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:25,710
And when I think a glamour,
I think of Jersey. Um,

1545
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:27,370
I'm going to shit on every fucking place.

1546
01:37:27,371 --> 01:37:31,960
Then I'm playing [inaudible] Jersey shore
scumbags going to come down there with

1547
01:37:31,961 --> 01:37:34,420
your fucking track suits.
Huh?

1548
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:38,980
Oh look in like some grease
stuff. Fucking $6 million, man.

1549
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:40,630
You're not impressing me.

1550
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:46,030
Chicks with your big fucking
Olympic sized Jody Watley.

1551
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:51,040
Who bearings. I know that's not
real gold. Just like you're Tan.

1552
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:55,130
It's fucking fake. Come on down. Uh,

1553
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,650
what else do I got a,
I got a Gig in a,

1554
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:01,740
in Los Angeles at the Hollywood improv.
All right,

1555
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:08,130
well how do I shit on this? I
live here. Come on. You phony.

1556
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:12,390
Fuck ads all been done.
How about some fucking Mexican show up?

1557
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:15,660
You know, Jesus Christ,
you're 80% of the population.

1558
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,660
You figure you could send a fucking crew
to come down there and represent your

1559
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:21,960
people. Starting to think you guys
don't like me. What did I ever say?

1560
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:25,800
Bad about Mexico? Nothing. And you know
why it's cause I haven't read about it yet

1561
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,800
and that's it. Then I'll be a Carolines
in June. I'm going to be in Montreal,

1562
01:38:31,801 --> 01:38:35,310
Canada, you know, I love that.

1563
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:40,950
That's like the minor league for Paris.
That's what that shit is. You know,

1564
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:46,890
all those silly little French guys going
up there acting like they don't speak

1565
01:38:46,891 --> 01:38:51,450
English, you know, with
their pointy noses. You know,

1566
01:38:51,451 --> 01:38:55,860
they all get that Wayne Gretzky face and
their little feathered mullets like Ron

1567
01:38:55,861 --> 01:38:59,670
do gay, you know, I'm going
to be coming up there.

1568
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:03,330
You know what sucks is every time I do
Montreal, it's never during hockey season.

1569
01:39:03,331 --> 01:39:06,570
So I, I haven't been to their new,
their new place sucks. Anyways,

1570
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:10,440
I actually went to the
old forum in March of 89.

1571
01:39:10,441 --> 01:39:13,350
You can fucking look this up too because
I remember they played the Minnesota

1572
01:39:13,351 --> 01:39:18,150
north stars.
I was at that game and uh,

1573
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:21,930
and I had a good time and that's the
podcast for this week. Everybody,

1574
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:23,850
you see that we had a spelling test.

1575
01:39:23,851 --> 01:39:28,320
I talked about Avocados and I went
off on the broads for like 10 minutes.

1576
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:30,300
There's your podcast
for this fucking week.

1577
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:34,170
I'm really hoping that we get everything
ironed out. I'm sick of saying this.

1578
01:39:34,171 --> 01:39:37,650
I don't know what the fucking problem is.
All right, but I'm the talent. All right.

1579
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:39,300
I'm not on the computer side.

1580
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:40,770
Okay?

1581
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:45,270
Okay. That's not up to me. I don't call
the place. All right. I got a headset on.

1582
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:49,540
I just fucking execute them. All
right. I'm responsible for all

1583
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,960
field shit,
not this behind the scenes stuff.

1584
01:39:51,961 --> 01:39:55,950
So send all your complaints
to a bill burrs web guy,

1585
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:00,810
www.doperswebguy.com
back slash what the fuck?

1586
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:03,620
All capitals.
All right.
