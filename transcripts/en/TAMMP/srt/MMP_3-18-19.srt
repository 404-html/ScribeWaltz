1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,570
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn?

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:07,550
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, March 18 2000.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,590
I take what's going on?

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,400
No,
no.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,370
What's up with you? What are you say? Um,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,850
I am uh, you know, I realized this
morning when I was washing the dishes,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,930
I just come from the gym by Dubai, don't
do it. And then I did my upper body.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,900
I actually ran into somebody this
past weekend. They'll say, dude,

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:35,070
I always see at the gym that was,
he's like, you're always doing legs.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,600
That made me feel good. You
know, being a child of the 80s,

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,490
you never did. Your legs was just
all about the upper body, right?

12
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:49,280
Just building yourself up from the
waist up like a house of fucking cards.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,660
And all it took was one leg sweep.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,060
One for Dota and putting up fucking three
15, four times, dude. One leg sleep.

15
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:01,290
What damage land on your side.
Separate your shoulder.

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,320
Right?
Just covering up the skinny little legs,

17
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:08,490
trying to fucking kick the guy off in
some fucking parking lot that they put a

18
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:13,470
tent over so they could sell
some bud lights with Lyman.
It. Remember those days,

19
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,930
your member member that right.

20
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:19,830
We get fucking hammered and then the
fuck and the red line would shut down and

21
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,610
we'd have to fucking steal a cat.
Sorry,

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,710
I'm pitching the, uh, the
sequel to goodwill hunting.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,270
How soon before they reboot that,
right. I would say goodwill,

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,320
this is a leather chair. I'm
not farting profusely here. Um,

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,840
what was I gonna say? Yeah, the SQL to
fucking goodwill hunting. All right,

26
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,230
we'll marry the check there.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,590
Minnie driver,
he marries her.

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,690
They have four kids now that
divorced because, you know,

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,750
just hugging Robin Williams
doesn't erase a childhood.

30
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,650
So eventually his demons,
because he is who he is,

31
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:05,310
came out the fucking marriage
and now they got four kids.

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,370
And uh,

33
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,270
the one that's most like will doesn't
get along with them, you know,

34
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,190
cause they're so alike,
right. A Den. Uh, I dunno.

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,280
I Dunno where it, if somehow
this iron man, they're still,

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,300
they're actually promote the movie or
fucking one of those fucking God damn.

37
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,390
What is that chicken?
And there's,

38
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:30,090
there's like no end in sight to
those fucking movies, right? Yeah.

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,610
Okay.

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,410
It's like become an incestuous now.

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,460
Now they like doing like the
oceans 11 of like superhero movies.

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,870
Yeah.

43
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,360
He's fucking poor actress man.
You know, back in the day,

44
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:47,170
used to dream of getting a role of plane
that this play into that now everybody

45
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:51,910
that just, everybody's selling. If
a dude, I just, if I could just be,

46
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:54,130
if I could just be a lightening man,

47
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,280
I could get a bungalow in fucking
Oxnard. Um, but who knows.

48
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:06,150
Congratulations to Liverpool. They
one, I missed the game yesterday.

49
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:09,240
They want two to one.
I was hoping that one to nothing.

50
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:12,750
So I could say to nil sound like I know
what I'm talking about. As far as I know,

51
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:17,730
there's still one point behind the fucking
man city cuts all that Middle Eastern

52
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,930
money. You want your money
clean from a pure nation,

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,990
a pure part of the world.
Like the United States of America.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,130
It's right cause we're always
on the right side of the ball.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,580
As is any comedian out
there listening right now.

56
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,680
If you want to get laughs
when you go overseas,

57
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:39,750
just start reciting our propaganda.

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,050
You don't even need a set up or anything
and people just start laughing. Beacons.

59
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,430
Afraid of people. Just stay. Just
laugh. All right, the standings.

60
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:48,300
What do we got here?

61
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,130
Okay.

62
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,950
Oh,
the first place by two points.

63
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,390
Oh my God, you gotta be shitting. Oh
wait, wait, wait. Before I get excited.

64
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:03,550
Is it still, is this
the latest one? It is.

65
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,450
Are you fucking kidding me?
What happened?

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,900
What happened to man city with
the never ending oil money?

67
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,430
What happened? Ah, the old breakfast
buffet. Gotcha. The Yates came in,

68
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,870
but their big ballet to that big bay cat.

69
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,590
All right, I love it. I love money
against money cause I'm a capitalist.

70
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,690
I want to see how this is going down.

71
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,410
Is there anything better than watching
these giant hardware stores just putting

72
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,750
each other on a business?
I can't get enough of it.

73
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,080
Just fucking throw it down.

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,420
Like blood sport on TV be the
ones that shallow the Hamish.

75
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,120
No one was share lab and
this part of the region.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,160
It's part of the world unless
we say shawl. Oh, watch that.

77
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,330
You want to build something?

78
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,900
We rolling off the others.
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,580
Anyway, supplying a head here. Uh,

80
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,810
this morning after I went to the
gym, did my leg, she yesterday,

81
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,250
my pasty spindly legs that just
never seem to want to get any bigger,

82
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,370
but I have to do them to,
to,

83
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,470
to keep my a sciatic nerve issue at bay
because what happened after years and

84
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:23,740
years that drive in myself to gigs,

85
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,750
right. Playing every shit
hole from here to fucking uh,

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,300
Chilkoot Charlise I did them
all. White privilege, um,

87
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,130
Hashtag not so much.

88
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,240
I hate when white people because they
actually had to work for what they wanted

89
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,980
in life.
Think that they're not privileged.

90
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,960
Okay.
My

91
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,550
Dad didn't have a yacht. Therefore, um,

92
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,790
do you need to look it up?
Doesn't mean you don't have to work.

93
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,640
It just means that no point was your
skin color a detriment. If anything.

94
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,550
It was a positive. Uh, that's not true.

95
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,930
I was one of the people that that
did get put up Canada College.

96
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,740
I like when white people talk about
affirmative action to when like nine black

97
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,980
kids get in and they say that's why they
weren't able to join the other 30,000

98
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:15,620
white kids at the university. Oh
that's why that, that's what it was.

99
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,170
That's what held you back.
You know,

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,360
you couldn't get into the upper
fucking 92% of white people.

101
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,990
You were in the lower 8%.
And now I'm supposed to feel bad for you

102
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,660
snow.

103
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,620
Sorry. Um, anyway,

104
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:42,560
so I was doing the dishes and I wore a
long sleeve shirt cause it gets a little

105
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:44,330
cool out here in the
desert in the morning.

106
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:47,690
So I wore a long sleeve workout shirt
so I didn't want to get any water.

107
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:52,040
My sleep's fucking gross and be out
the same way. When I put lotion on,

108
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,740
I take my wedding ring off cause I don't
like when it gets underneath the ring,

109
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,970
it fucking grosses me out.

110
00:06:55,971 --> 00:07:00,920
So I take off my shirt and I'm standing
there shirtless watching, um, relaxed.

111
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,480
Ladies,
um,

112
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,060
upstanding shirtless washing dishes.
Um,

113
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,120
the way I wish my wife would.
Um,

114
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,000
and it was reminded me of every joke
that I heard a bunch of comics do back in

115
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,370
the day when they were
talking about cops going like,

116
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:24,170
is there a rule that when you get arrested
you have to not be wearing a shirt

117
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,790
then never wearing a shirt.

118
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,400
And it was fucking true when
it finally dawned on me today,

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,000
probably that was because a lot of
them couldn't afford air conditioning,

120
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,970
you know, and God knows, you know,

121
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,430
they want to get a lot of seasons. When
they first did cops, they were like,

122
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:43,280
well how many AUC can you get five
seasons out of this? It's like, well,

123
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:47,370
we're mainly going to shoot in Florida
and down south and everybody knows it

124
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:50,350
gets hot down there harder than June bug.
Fucking a lampoon.

125
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,330
I'm going to fucking July morning.
Um,

126
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,400
so that's my theory with the no shirt
thing. I also think it's a fuck.

127
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:02,690
It's something that's done by
people that go in and out of jail.

128
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,190
That's just part of the culture is, you
know, you don't wear a shirt to same way.

129
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:11,900
Like, uh, you know the people that go
to like the fucking Ivy League schools,

130
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,500
you got to wait like the
fucking that do shout fit,

131
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:18,950
whatever the fuck you call that, the khaki
pants with the fucking loafers. This,

132
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:21,710
that fucking thing that,
you know,

133
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,930
it's actually one of my favorite looks
when the white person steers into being

134
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,540
white rather than being ashamed of it.
You know what I mean?

135
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:33,140
Or are trying to put on a blue
collar jacket, you know, cause every,

136
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,730
once every two days you go out,

137
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,900
walk down to the fucking mailbox
to get you fucking mail. You know,

138
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,790
I like people that fucking steer into it.
You know,

139
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,480
what does that look called?
It's like I can't, I, I,

140
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,330
I have like a vague
that,

141
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,630
that thing on Instagram that don't be a
bread. I love the way those kids dress.

142
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,170
Okay.

143
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:58,530
You know,

144
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,710
the parents had money and now they
know they're getting it and they're not

145
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,040
ashamed of it. They don't have one ounce
of guilt and they're just like, listen,

146
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,910
my daddy polluted all the
rivers and when I take over,

147
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm going after the oceans.
You know,

148
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,830
you got to respect it.
It's my goal in that, uh,

149
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,960
there'll be no more polar bears by the
time I'm done running my daddy's company.

150
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,460
I enjoy that. I like that. Just a little
bit of honesty. That's all, you know,

151
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:30,810
just being who the fuck you are. All
right. Um, I watched the f one yesterday.

152
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:34,990
Did anybody see the first race of the
year down in Australia? Australian, uh,

153
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,110
Grand Prix, the local
favorite. Daniel Ricardo.

154
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,260
Where's he from? Perth resting
place with a great bond. Scott.

155
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,770
And he's with the Renault team
this year. Who, by the way,

156
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,650
I love the look of their cars, the yellow
and the black. That looks cool as hell.

157
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,000
Granted, I'm a Bruins Fan, so I
dunno. Maybe that's what it is,

158
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,620
but I think those cars are Cooley Shit.

159
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,340
And this poor bastard Danny Ricardo
a the fucking, the race just starts,

160
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,320
he barely goes on the grass in the
front end of his car. Fucking blows up.

161
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,880
Okay,

162
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
his front wing hit something
in the whole front of the car,

163
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,410
we're going to get fucking exploded.
So here's my question.

164
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,430
Why do they a bumpy grass? Like that day
that was hit a tree stump or something,

165
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,280
especially right there near the start.

166
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:24,600
Somebody always goes off the
grass a little bit. Yeah.

167
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,840
Fucked up his car.

168
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,350
And then he was like a layer had to go
in and change the nose up to the front.

169
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,000
Uh, the first lap and then he's down a
lap and then his car just shit the bed and

170
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,400
it's just like he,
he left red bull for this.

171
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,853
I Dunno.

172
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,530
Anyway, so I'm, I'm, I'm basically,
I root for Daniel Ricardo.

173
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,480
Okay.

174
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
For some reason I wrote for rough for
Ferrari knowing that they're just not

175
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:55,830
going to get it done. I root for the
Haas team cause that's the American team.

176
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:56,940
We did all right yesterday.

177
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,530
Okay.

178
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,310
If you think, you know, one out of
two people finishing as good. Um,

179
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,000
but you know, we did come
in, uh, what's his face?

180
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,020
Magnuson came in sixth place,
eight big points.

181
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,920
Right. And what's his face? It
was the other driver we got there.

182
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:18,240
What the Hell's his name? Roman
Grogan. Yeah. He didn't finish.

183
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,670
Uh, well where the fuck were
the Ferrari's? The Ferrari's?

184
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:27,240
We're in fourth and fifth Max
Verstappen who's basically,

185
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,480
I think going to be the next Lewis
Hamilton if he could get a better ride.

186
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,370
Cause for whatever fucking reason,
those red bull cars, you know, they're,

187
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,470
they're taking fuck with the Ferrari's.
But now with the Mercedes,

188
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:40,890
so one and two is Valtteri
Botox and Lewis Hamilton.

189
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,363
Okay.

190
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,410
I tried, you know, I love
greatness, but I just,

191
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,960
I can't get into the fact how
Lewis Hamilton things fell.

192
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:53,560
Terry Botox should basically be his gimp,
right?

193
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,490
Baltar's head. This amazing
start. Lewis had the pole,

194
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:59,550
he fucking blows by him and the first
turn and then he just pulled away for the

195
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:02,220
rest of the God damn race
Lewis who is having his issues.

196
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,280
And whenever that happens,
he always acts like a baby.

197
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,100
You started bitching that Valtteri
was too far in front of them,

198
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:13,460
wasn't helping them out. It's like when
the fuck do you want to do that for him?

199
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,323
Ah,

200
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,970
just a fucking, I, I,
you know what, he just,

201
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,060
he reminds me of a couple of comedians
and actors that I've worked with,

202
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:27,930
like where the whole fucking seen
the whole show. It's about them

203
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,423
all right.

204
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,010
And if overall what happened was good,

205
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:35,940
but they are part of it wasn't as good
as they like the day day to have a little

206
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:39,270
fucking hissy fit. Maybe that's why
he's fucking great because he has great,

207
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,900
and I would never say that he wasn't,
but Jesus, he always had like,

208
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,370
I've seen like,
you know,

209
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,040
I've seen Vettel not winning last jam
and Kimmy Reagan and was going to win

210
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,740
something or he was out in front ever
heard him fucking bitching about it.

211
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,380
He just rear ends people in front of them.
Uh,

212
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,590
just buggy. You know, Mercedes
is winning. You're a team.

213
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,060
You took first and second,
you're fine. I know, I know.

214
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:11,940
The whole deal is the way he's wired.
That's why he's so great.

215
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:16,260
But it's just like, it's such a
fucking, it's such a chick move.

216
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,550
You know what I mean?
Like,

217
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:22,000
if you have some shit you have to do
that day is a guy, you go out and do it.

218
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,820
If your wife's got a bunch of shit,
she just be like,

219
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,350
I thought maybe you could come with me.

220
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:29,470
We could maybe have they a
lunch til he dragging into it.

221
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,673
MMM.

222
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,610
You wouldn't know it, but it's
still loved the guy, you know,

223
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,280
I can never hate on fucking greatness.
The guy is fucking great.

224
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,350
But that part of him,
you know,

225
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:46,080
I guess we all have that part of ourselves
that maybe we could all work on. Um,

226
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,470
anyways, I'm very excited that it's,
it's, it's back. F one is back, you know,

227
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:54,910
it was cool. They were like, it's
better. 112 days said, so last race.

228
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:58,630
And I was thinking like, well, I
haven't drank in 113 days. So freckles.

229
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,250
I took a day off right before
the last race of last year. Um,

230
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:08,251
I'm almost a third of the way again to
breaking my record of 367 days since I

231
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,184
started drinking.

232
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,010
Okay

233
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,650
man. And what the first 15 years
of my life never had a drop.

234
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,540
I don't see myself beating
that streak anytime soon. Um,

235
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,350
so I think I'm going to try
to go until June of next year.

236
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,450
Okay.

237
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,020
So then I would do a calendar year,
January to December,

238
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,880
and then I would also
do an entire birthday,

239
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,320
like my entire time of being 51 I didn't
have a drop. I think that would be cool.

240
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:35,200
Then I would go on for like a
fucking year and seven months.

241
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,430
Right.

242
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,920
And at that point I have all
the alcohol out of my house.

243
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:43,940
And then I think what I do is I, uh, I
don't drink in La. I don't drink at home.

244
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,680
And when I go on the road,

245
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,553
mmm.

246
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,160
One day out of the,
I go on the road,

247
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:52,270
two weekends a month and
one day out of those things.

248
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:56,350
So I'd be drinking two times a
month, 24 times a year. Okay.

249
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:59,410
Whatever the fuck you going to do, I
think that'd be all right. You know,

250
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,240
I got to figure out what the
fuck's gonna open for me.

251
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,180
All my open a fucking crushing it now,
Paul Versey check out the tour dates.

252
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,530
Joe Barden. Nick, we got to
check out puck off. He's got, uh,

253
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,220
the fuck did he just have on there?
Darin McCarty.

254
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,900
He's still in the pilot of the
fucking Nhl awards right now on that.

255
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,160
Eh, the fuck am I going
to have now, you know,

256
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,810
fucking law heads down to San Diego,
crushing it on the sports radio. See,

257
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:31,690
this is what happens when you
don't bring cupcakes on the road.

258
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,270
They move up into the business.
So I'm just putting it out there.

259
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,130
Are you the funny guy at the office?

260
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,400
Do you think that you'd like
to be a standup comedian? Well,

261
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:46,160
why didn't you submit your
tape to Bill burg.com?

262
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,210
Maybe you could play some chuckle hut.

263
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,310
Do 15 minutes in front of a bunch of
animals before you bring up the freckled

264
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:58,190
brick who's closing out the show? Oh, by
the way, how about those brewing? So on?

265
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm a, Greg has showed up, right? I missed
the whole game. That's why. Of course,

266
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:04,360
it was fucking exciting.
I missed the whole God damn game.

267
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,190
I came in right at the end of the streak.

268
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:10,390
I watched two games where they continued
it and then they lost two in a row and

269
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:14,530
then I missed the next game and they
went in and over time, Brad Marshawn

270
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,410
fucking in overtime and then he does
the Condom Mcgregor celebration and I

271
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,690
missed the whole goddamn thing.
But you know what I did see,

272
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,370
I did see a maple leafs game.

273
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,890
Who the fuck were they playing?
Somebody who had like a big,

274
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,430
big time lead like a five to two
lead and they came back at one.

275
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,700
Yeah.

276
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,720
I don't know. They were in the
Saint Patrick's Day jerseys.

277
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:42,110
What has happened to my short term memory?
It's out the window.

278
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,700
Um, I've got to start
playing brain games again.

279
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,230
Who the fuck were they playing anyways?
I,

280
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:55,280
I uh, Toronto is my, if the
Bruins don't win it this year,

281
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:58,130
Toronto is my teeth. That's who
the fuck I root for it in the West.

282
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,690
I always root for the Saint Louis Blues.

283
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:02,930
Those are the two teams that have gone
the longest without winning the fucking

284
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:05,630
thing. And A, I don't want, Oh,
how much longer do you want their,

285
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,260
their fans to suffer?
Which is why I think it's bullshit.

286
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,650
When that was an Antonio Brown,
whatever his fucking name is,

287
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:17,210
that wide receiver from, from the
Steelers has a fallen out with his team.

288
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,530
The bills make a deal. They're
like, all right, you're coming in.

289
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:24,500
And he's just like, yeah, no, I'm
not going there. You guys suck.

290
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,950
Then it goes to the fucking rate is,
it's just like,

291
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,050
so what it bills fans supposed to do?

292
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,540
Okay.

293
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,570
I've never understood that. John
Elway. I'm not playing for the colts.

294
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,630
Well then you're not playing the NFL CFL.
You can't,

295
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,960
right Colby Bryan, I'm not playing
for the Charlotte Hornets. Well,

296
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,130
enjoy Europe.
It's not how it works.

297
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,410
I want to go where the
kids do when immediately,

298
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,670
um,
bunch of fucking babies.

299
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,620
You know what I mean?
I mean,

300
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,620
I guess I understand maybe the quarterback
position just because if he don't

301
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:08,980
have an offensive line did
she just got to get running,

302
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,470
but you playing fucking basketball,
Jesus Christ,

303
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,300
you can't even touch anybody
anymore. Right. And I can say this,

304
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,680
having not played organized sports
for 40 years, I know what it takes.

305
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,890
Uh, you know what I mean? Is this
is just me bitching as a fan.

306
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,060
I was excited to see the bills get a,
going to an offensive weapon there.

307
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,120
You know, if you want to see a bunch of
grown men cry, you wait till the day,

308
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:39,660
the fucking bills when,
when the God damn Superbowl.

309
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,080
All right.
Then when the red sox finally won it,

310
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,160
everybody was fucking freaky.
You wait to when the bills went,

311
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,370
cause people are going
to run outside crying.

312
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,270
The tears are gonna freeze on their face
because they live in buffalo and they

313
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:56,010
just going to hug their neighbor,
right?

314
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,150
And then they're going to fall down and
land on that little heating thing that

315
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:02,870
heats up there fucking engine in the
morning and it's going to unplug.

316
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:06,960
And the next morning I remember
rabbi, rabbi, rabbi, rabbi,
rabbi, rabbi, rabbi prep.

317
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:09,090
It's not going to fucking start.
And then I'm going to give a shit.

318
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:11,220
They're going to get mad for half a
second and then they go, wait a minute.

319
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:12,840
Okay.

320
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,600
Wait a minute. They fucking, they
won the super bowl. Now I don't,

321
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:18,420
I don't give a shit anymore.
Um,

322
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,800
anyway, uh, plowing ahead here.

323
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,150
What else am I going to do
today? I'm going to go get
it. I'm getting three Mris.

324
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,030
I'm finally going to finally see what's
going on with my shoulders and then my

325
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:34,290
left knee. That's what I'm doing
today. And we'll fix my, uh,

326
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,450
both my shoulders and my knee and then,
uh,

327
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:39,360
I'll probably have some sort of
cancer from all that radiation. See,

328
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,700
that's how it works. Everybody, you know,

329
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,400
it's one of the reasons
why I love breaking bad is
every time they made a step

330
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:48,300
forward there, there was always a price
to pay and it, and at best they were even,

331
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:52,140
but they never really were. They always
sank down a little bit lower. You know,

332
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,910
doesn't make any fucking sense.

333
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,340
Okay.

334
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,780
I'll tell you everybody,
this world,

335
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,610
this world doesn't make
any fucking sense to me.

336
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,963
Hm.

337
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,670
Yeah.
This whole fucking

338
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:05,890
okay.

339
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,600
Food thing and booze thing. Here's
something. I finally had an epiphany

340
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,380
about being an adult and addiction
and being fat and fucking,

341
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:22,080
all of this shit that you try to avoid is,
um,

342
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,440
no one ever really tells you
like the,

343
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,120
the level of responsibility of when you
go out on your own just for yourself,

344
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,760
not fuck the whole thing up.
I was sitting there, right?

345
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,470
I'm on the Instagram and one of the
people I follow, he's in his twenties,

346
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,490
right? Eddie's Fellman like
the night out. All right.

347
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,690
His drummer. Okay. And everybody's
drinking. Everybody's dancing a,

348
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,400
it just keeps going and going and going
and going and going until like fucking

349
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:58,850
four in the morning. And, um,

350
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,020
I understand that you do
that when you're that age,

351
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:05,720
but there is a part of me thinking like,
what if I didn't do that?

352
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,120
Not like I danced in the street,
but you know what I mean. I,

353
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,580
I puked in the street til like
four in the fucking morning.

354
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:12,830
What if I didn't do that?
Like,

355
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,460
how many more miles on this engine,
what I have,

356
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,400
you know, cause like right now, I'll tell
you, my drug is eight hours sleep, honey.

357
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,043
MMM.

358
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,683
Okay.

359
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,570
I don't know, just as far as like,
I was really sitting there like,

360
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:33,570
trying to think how I'm gonna explain
that to my daughter one day. It's like,

361
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:33,871
all right,

362
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:37,080
you going off to college now you're
going to have this ridiculous level of

363
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:41,400
freedom. I remember the first time
when I finally fucking moved out.

364
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,750
Yeah.

365
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,750
I remember I was in New York City.
It was my first night hanging out.

366
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:49,580
I was hanging out at the comic strip.

367
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,393
Okay.

368
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,040
And
it hit me.

369
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:58,630
It's like I don't have to fucking
go home until I want to go home.

370
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,420
I don't have to answer to fucking anybody.

371
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,180
And this big grin just broke out
on my face like, Jesus Christ,

372
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:10,020
this is fucking amazing. Because of
course I was down in like, Jesus Christ,

373
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:12,780
they moved like two states away.
I don't fucking know anybody.

374
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:15,330
I'm in a railroad apartment.
You know,

375
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:17,780
I just talked to Lucian rest
his soul and he's like, yeah,

376
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,420
Guardian, have an ovoid
goes, I have no need, Rio.

377
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,820
Good luck with your dream.
Um,

378
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,690
I remember just sitting
there at that bar and then,

379
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:33,980
but then the epiphany is
that Jesus Christ, I could
fucking do whatever I want.

380
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:36,950
I can fucking meet a chick, take a
home. It's just fucking unbelievable.

381
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,550
And fortunately during that time,

382
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,210
everybody that I was hanging out with
was either they didn't drink or they were

383
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:50,330
already an Aa. And I've
always just been, you know,

384
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,990
I just did what people around with,
nobody around me is drinking.

385
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,670
They want to go on and go to a diner
instead. I would just fucking do that.

386
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:57,860
So I didn't drink a lot in my twenties,

387
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,090
but somewhere in my thirties it kind
of went off the fucking rails and a,

388
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:06,200
I wish I could go back a tiff.
I could tell you guys anything yet.

389
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,510
Don't bring the booze into the house.

390
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,880
Okay.

391
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,900
Have they just like literally,

392
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,020
why would you bake cookies and cake
and potato chip into your house?

393
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:17,060
You're going to become a fat fuck.
You bring booze in the house.

394
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:20,590
She's going to become a drunk.
I'm not saying an alkie,

395
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,340
but it'll just be something
that you just fucking dope.

396
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,540
Do you like smoking a cigar?
Don't buy a humidor.

397
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,440
Keep it at,
don't bring the devil India House.

398
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,380
Keep 'em down the fucking street.

399
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,310
You get any out to dealers because you'll
sit there for 10 minutes being like,

400
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:43,180
I fuck man, I'd love a God damned cigar
or I'd love to go get a drink. And then,

401
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:46,080
but then you sitting there
and I got fucking get dressed.

402
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:49,350
I got to get in the car to, you
know, fuck this. I'll just, you know,

403
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:53,130
I'll just sit here and hang out.
But the, the one thing I have,

404
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,960
this really fascinates
me is now that I don't,

405
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,873
um,

406
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,410
I'm really not doing anything is uh,

407
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,920
getting used to just being sober.

408
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,150
And I don't just mean, you know, booze.

409
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,990
I mean then also combining that with
trying to eat right because it's like at

410
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:20,970
the end of the night,
like I'm just used to being ramped up,

411
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,070
having a couple of pops and then when
you quit Bosun then that becomes like

412
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:30,060
food. Like eat something sugary or
read something salty and you know,

413
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:33,760
Leno just fucking get the rpms
going in your body. And then we're,

414
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,910
the reality is your body
doesn't want to do that.

415
00:24:35,911 --> 00:24:38,820
It just wants to be fucking idling,
chilling out,

416
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,000
saving it's stuff for when he
got to run from an earthquake,

417
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:46,320
a fire or some guy with an ax essentially.
And,

418
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:49,260
uh,
I dunno,

419
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,710
I feel like I need to take, uh, you know,

420
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:56,190
that shit that you put in your
gas tank to clean out your engine,

421
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,650
but then you get nervous.
Am I going to move the clots around?

422
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,170
Okay.

423
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,020
I feel like I got to
fucking do that, man. Um,

424
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,760
so now my big thing is like,
I've,

425
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,730
I've been cooking at home and last night
I asked for the first time in forever,

426
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,650
I made like a full meal,
like two sides and uh,

427
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,010
and I, it'll look a little stink.
So I made this little stake.

428
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,240
I had some steamed Broccoli and then,
uh,

429
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,500
I had the potatoes, right? Garlic
was a little bit of Rosemary,

430
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,960
a little bit of salt and pepper
and some butter. Oh my God,

431
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:35,790
they were fucking delicious.
That was basically,

432
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:39,720
that was the highlight of my night
was those mashed potatoes. Um,

433
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,540
but, uh, I'm going to fucking,

434
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,490
I'm trying to revamp my
whole lifestyle here.

435
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,440
Um, so when I returned to drinking,
which I will at some point,

436
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,490
I just want to make sure
that I do it in a, uh,

437
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,410
put like the way I drink soda or pap
few people in the Midwest, like a cage.

438
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:06,300
Like if I have like a bomb out, it's
usually back east. If I'm having a pizza,

439
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:08,610
then I would always get a coke.
And even then I can never really fuck.

440
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,160
I could never really finish it.
If I'm just having a bad meal,

441
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,050
I'll have like a coke or something like
that. If I could just do that with booze,

442
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,430
you know, those fucking people, they
can just have a glass of wine. Ooh. Mm.

443
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,360
That was delicious. That
complemented my meal. Right.

444
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,050
They don't sit there like a pirate
and fucking bite the cork off it.

445
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,750
Um, anyway, I did a, uh,

446
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,670
I did a Gig at the American legion.

447
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,830
I got to open for Ron White.
I worked with Joe de Rosa and,

448
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,330
um, it's the other guy, Alex.
I didn't get his last name.

449
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:53,140
He's fucking hilarious.
And A and John Sites,

450
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:56,920
we had a fucking great time and I'm

451
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,350
okay

452
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,161
afterwards.
You know,

453
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,000
we smoke some cigars and stuff and
there was a couple of buddies of mine,

454
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,740
they showed up and one of them showed up.
He bought a fucking,

455
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:06,360
one of those new Indian motorcycles.

456
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:09,870
The one that looks like the
Harley road king. Ah, fuck dude.

457
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,120
Okay.

458
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,020
I would love one of those two tone.
He had black with the green man.

459
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:19,310
That thing was fucking sick.
And uh,

460
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,290
and all those guys on those big bites,
they always go,

461
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,620
it's like riding a Cadillac.
You know, it's getting,

462
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,560
it's got the three lights
people can see. Ah, um,

463
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:28,971
ah man,
that's,

464
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:33,410
that's one of those fucking that
owner remain the dad fantasy.

465
00:27:33,411 --> 00:27:35,600
It's like if I didn't have a kid,
if I didn't,

466
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:38,690
if I wasn't living for somebody else,
Thou my God,

467
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:42,740
I would fucking get one of those. I
would take it out Sunday mornings. Right.

468
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,810
It's drive down the fucking street.
I freckled arms up, you know,

469
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,980
feeling like I'm in a motorcycle gang
when I really never killed anybody.

470
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,680
Pay My taxes quarterly. I blocked that
part out. Right. Drive down the street.

471
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,600
Um, I would fucking love one of those.
I love those boots as a bikes. I love,

472
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:05,870
I love those big ones with the, uh, the
white wall tires and shit like that.

473
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,780
Like I love a Harley rode
king without the bags on it.

474
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,070
I just think that that is just one of the
fucking coolest silken bikes ever. Um,

475
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,963
who knows.

476
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:14,860
Okay.

477
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,650
My daughter graduates high school,
goes off to college.

478
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:20,410
Maybe I'll do it then I'd
be like my late sixties,

479
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,790
I'll get one of those.

480
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:28,090
That's right around the time when you get
that three wheeler fucking motorcycle,

481
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,810
you know,
um,

482
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,540
which I would think in a lot of ways it
could be a little bit more dangerous for

483
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,810
all of a sudden you kind of had to
like, I dunno, like how does that work?

484
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:40,210
If somebody cuts out in front of
you and you got to lay it down,

485
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:41,980
you can't lay it down.
What do you do?

486
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,460
Um, you just fucking t bone the
guy and go flying over the fucking,

487
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:51,720
I don't know.

488
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,670
There's gotta be some sort of Robo
cop type thing that they can put on.

489
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,600
Can you buy one of those moto GP suits
with like the fucking airbag in it and

490
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,240
shit. They don't have an air bag for your
head. That's the problem. Wait a second.

491
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,410
Moto g p writing suit for sale.

492
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,950
It'll be like five grand if they do.

493
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,600
Well there's one for $478
so you know that's not it.

494
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,060
I appreciate it.
Put Air bag in there

495
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,030
with airbag and then you
get to like that would,

496
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,100
the thing is like that's
like hooked onto the bike.

497
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,390
Come on you fucking cunts.

498
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:37,790
Yeah.

499
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,710
Shop race, shop race suits
with airbags. All right.

500
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,360
Amazon.
There's one for 1000 bucks.

501
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:50,050
There's one for fourth 1500 bucks.
All right, that sounds about right.

502
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,080
You know the moto GP ones,

503
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:56,290
if you actually got one of those it's
like fucking three grand but is a thing.

504
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,390
You can have one of those and it's
not going to help you if someone,

505
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,800
an SUV runs you over.
Yeah, and another life.

506
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,190
I would have had kids younger and then
I would have lived in the middle of

507
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:10,810
nowhere and I would've had one. Oh,
well. Um, speaking of motorcycles,

508
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,210
motorcycle, uh, Japanese
and Italian motorcycles.

509
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,760
I don't have any advertising this week.
All right.

510
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,460
Japanese and Italian motorcycles.
Hey Bill,

511
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,910
on your Ma match 14th podcasts.

512
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:29,290
You wondered why Japanese and Italian
companies make better motorcycles.

513
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:32,150
That's not what,
all right.

514
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,370
I had a little glitch there and ran
out of batteries, ran out of batteries.

515
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,610
Um,
getting back to what I was saying,

516
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:44,110
I didn't say that you guys
make better motorcycles.

517
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,350
He just make the fast ones.
Like why don't mean,

518
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:52,000
why hasn't Honda India or somebody
like that and make a fast one? Um,

519
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,520
one explanation I've heard they're
probably better, but as an American,

520
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:58,480
I can't fucking say that.

521
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,950
One explanation I heard is that after
World War Two engineers and designers for

522
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:06,310
the access military
industry industrial complex,

523
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,740
we're forced to find civilian and non
military work. Some of the brightest,

524
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:15,070
smartest engineers in those
countries ended up in automotive,

525
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,780
motorcycles and electronics,
Honda, Yamaha, Sony, Ferrari,

526
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:21,190
Lamborghini,
Ducati,

527
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,410
or to caddy as they say
in England in particular,

528
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,270
or at least the announcer
does in particular,

529
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,770
aeronautical engineers who
had designed a fighter planes,

530
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:37,030
found success applying their knowledge
to motorcycle chassies designed because

531
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:41,080
many of the forces acting on a plane's
fuselage is similar to the forces on a

532
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:45,490
motorcycle leaned over, going
through a turn. That's fascinating.

533
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,640
Also because of rationing in the years
following World War II engineer's and

534
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,810
former access countries had to figure
out how to design and manufacturer with

535
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,570
less raw material like steel or aluminum.

536
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,840
You can see how efficient the engineered
German Italian and Japanese engines are

537
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,690
compared to a chunky Harley
Davidson motorcycle. Uh,

538
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,970
just post ride chat I've
heard over the years.

539
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:08,560
But I thought you might
find an interesting,

540
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:13,510
thanks for making me laugh and making
your podcast that it's really interesting.

541
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,260
Something else.
Um,

542
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,780
is that just the sheer amount
of space that we have over here,

543
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,191
you know,

544
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:27,520
that we're not driving down these little
streets that used to ride a fucking

545
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:31,240
horse and buggy around in that
everything needs to be really, the cars.

546
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,110
Motorcycles got to be quick and nimble
and all of that. You could just fucking,

547
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,110
you know, if you look at our
cars, it's the same thing.

548
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,840
It's all about zero to 60 in a straight
line because for the most part there's

549
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:45,770
not a lot of turns and shit, you
know, that we're going to be taking.

550
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:49,430
So I think part of it is also that, but
I really find that interesting that um,

551
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,360
okay, just through, you know,
a loss comes a wind like that,

552
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,960
that's usually what happens there.
Reminds me, I was watching, um,

553
00:32:59,490 --> 00:32:59,760
uh,

554
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,760
that Joe Rogan podcast with Mike Tyson
and he was alluding to the fact and a lot

555
00:33:06,061 --> 00:33:08,670
of boxes have that. Like, you know,

556
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,640
boxing is basically that.

557
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:15,690
There's never been like a rich kid that
I can think of that just, you know,

558
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:19,020
came from a great background
and everything just goes
in. And does that, like,

559
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:19,311
it's,

560
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:24,311
it's for somebody that just came from
nothing and you could literally literally

561
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:27,890
fighting your way out of it. Um,
that would be fucking hilarious.

562
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,150
So if one of those don't be a
Brad kids actually came, you know,

563
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,510
one of those kids that accidentally kills
his girlfriend while having rough sex.

564
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:41,220
Remember those fucking billionaire boy
club fucking lunatics from the 80s. Uh,

565
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,910
if one of him,

566
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:46,500
he came in and if he just steered
into it like a great wrestling heel,

567
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,570
like when he did his interviews,

568
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:51,450
he had his boat shoes with
no socks on and khaki pants

569
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:58,130
and he's just in his old thing is even
though we came up with all that money and

570
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,990
shit, he's just like a
complete fucking sociopath

571
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,530
and then goes in and like his nickname
should just be staring into all of that

572
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:11,300
shit.
Like what the fuck would be be like,

573
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,970
uh, Brad, the trust fund
kid, you know, fucking

574
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,550
van something or other as always the
fucking rich white people names. Right.

575
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,260
I miss that. I miss the Robert Baron
being famous. You know, I should,

576
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,280
I'd missed it the first time,
but like JP Morgan, wow.

577
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,020
Andrew Carnegie,

578
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,440
not man and nobody else then
just all became a corporation.

579
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:42,530
I think that that's why they did it.
They became a corporation. So then they,

580
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,730
their names wouldn't be out there.
So now it's like,

581
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:50,290
can you believe what Alberta ed raw
dig you believe? What would a Monsanto,

582
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:54,690
you don't have one fucking name,
you know,

583
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,700
just as far as bar room chatter goes.
Sure.

584
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:00,100
If he actually took the time
to care enough to research it.

585
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:01,570
Didn't you know a name?
All right.

586
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:05,900
I think I was kind of shitting on myself
by the end there. Um, all right. Okay.

587
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,240
What else do we got here?
Marginal tax rate. Hey Bill,

588
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:14,380
I'm listening to a recent podcast where
you talk about [inaudible] plan to tax

589
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,580
people at a higher rate.
Uh,

590
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,460
the marginal tax rate kicks in after
someone earns their first $10 million.

591
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,850
After that,
the income is taxed at 70%.

592
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,410
That fuck that.

593
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,630
Fuck that.

594
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,603
Okay.

595
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,960
That doesn't touch people who create
startups yet does when they turn around

596
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,980
sell it for fucking

597
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,110
tens of millions of dollars.
Of course it does.

598
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,410
Yeah.

599
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,540
Most comedians don't make
anything close to that.

600
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:47,170
You don't even know what comedians make.
That's not fucking true.

601
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,350
Comedians are crushing it right now.
And secondly,

602
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,280
what I fucking hate about all of this
shit is everybody's going to ignore the

603
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:55,690
reason why we're broke.

604
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,440
We're broke because we're fighting this
never ending fucking war that is lining

605
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:02,860
the pockets of about four and a half
a dozen to a dozen corporations,

606
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,470
and it's completely bankrupted
this fucking country.

607
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,510
So rather than take those people to task,
who pay all the fucking politicians,

608
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,900
now you're going to go after
regular fucking citizens
and we're going to have to

609
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:16,170
pay the tab. Go Fuck Yourself, dude.

610
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:20,440
70% tax on anything is fucking criminal.

611
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,113
Criminal,

612
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,070
okay

613
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,920
to take more than half
somebody is doing that work.

614
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:29,500
You don't get more than half of that.
Go Fuck Yourself.

615
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,910
Those politicians need to grow a fucking
Dick and some fucking balls and stand

616
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:37,620
up to those corporations that they're
fucking blowing. That's the solution.

617
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,690
Fucking God damn fucking people who
sit there and they demonize anybody.

618
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,140
Any individual that went out and
went after a dream and made it,

619
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:52,290
and then they have to turn around
and subsidize your fucking life.

620
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:55,410
Go Fuck Yourself.
You really want to take down the rich.

621
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,740
Go after these fucking corporations
that have all their money in offshore

622
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:02,850
fucking accounts. Kick him out of the
fucking country and stop buying this shit.

623
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:08,030
Don't fucking punish some person because
they started dollar shave club and

624
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:13,230
they're fucking dormitory. Now all of a
sudden they got to give 70% of it away.

625
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,300
You know what you sound like?

626
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:18,270
You sound like somebody who's never
going to make $10 million in their life.

627
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,250
Oh my God. That drives me up the
fucking wall, and that's the genius.

628
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:26,670
Once again of corporations, it's,
there's no name, there's no face to it,

629
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,610
but she could do it with individuals,
so now they're going to get punished.

630
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,340
Anyway, so let me finish
this. After the income,

631
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,420
it's tax 70% that doesn't talk to
people could create it. Startups.

632
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,910
That's just a statement that
you pulled out of your ass.

633
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,470
Most comedians don't make anything close
to that that's pulled out of your ass

634
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,460
that's pulled out of your reps.
I've seen like the top fucking, um,

635
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,590
earning comedians that Forbes fucking
lists. They're all over 10 million.

636
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:55,360
Some of them making $20 million.

637
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,130
They supposed to get 70%
of over 10 million away.

638
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,480
Okay.

639
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,280
Anyways,
uh,

640
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,490
the most skilled brain
surgeons don't make that much.

641
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:06,970
Yeah.

642
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,020
The people making more than 10 million
a year are close with extremely high

643
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:15,070
concentrations of wealth. No,
they're not. This is this what,

644
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,420
this is what you're doing,
dude.

645
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,660
What's you're doing is you're creating
this cartoon character of a rich person

646
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,200
the same way female comics created a
cartoon character of a white male comedian

647
00:38:28,211 --> 00:38:31,030
where he just goes down to the
club and the club are, and it goes,

648
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,480
what are your dreams?
How many doors can I open for you?

649
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,020
Nobody wants to see that it's
fucking work. I can't even,

650
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:42,300
I can't even read the fucking rest of
this. That's like that person going,

651
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,860
somebody who makes $10 million a year.

652
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:46,890
It doesn't work any harder than someone
who makes $20,000 a year. I was like,

653
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,300
what the fuck are you talking about?

654
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,600
Okay.

655
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,510
If you work for yourself, I don't
care what the fuck you make a year.

656
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,080
It never rents. It's,
it's seven days a week,

657
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,320
three 65 you're working
your fucking ass off.

658
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,563
Yeah.

659
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,930
Anyways, collecting it at a rate
that is unnecessary for on human,

660
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,460
any human on earth.

661
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,300
Being able to start from nothing is
what Amerit makes America great. Yeah.

662
00:39:11,301 --> 00:39:13,460
You're going to Yank all
these people back down again.

663
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,460
Those people also will make that
they create a bunch of fucking jobs.

664
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,220
There's a way to run your
country that your company, right.

665
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,340
Anyway,

666
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,350
so this is being able to start from
nothing is what makes America great and if

667
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:32,790
anything, a higher tax rate enables
more Americans to follow their dreams.

668
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That is complete bullshit because what
you're going to do is just yank your

669
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:41,730
fellow fucking countrymen down
to the ground. None of this shit.

670
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,970
You're not going to get to go out to
these fucking corporations there and all

671
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:47,730
these super rich people,
their money's already out of the country.

672
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,760
They got it running through
fucking 20 different islands.

673
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:51,980
Yeah,

674
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,850
and there's 20 different fucking
mountains are red tape that the IRS is not

675
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,280
going to take their time to go through
and that's why they're going to go after

676
00:39:58,281 --> 00:40:01,880
just regular fucking people because we're
standing here with that fucking pants

677
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:02,714
down.

678
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:03,820
Okay.

679
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,500
Allowing people to hoard massive amounts
of wealth only shrinks the middle class

680
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,680
creating larger conglomerates and pushes
us further towards a horrible dystopia

681
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:16,600
where everything is commercialized.
Well, first of all, dude,

682
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:21,610
you're about 40 fucking years too
late at that party, all right? It all,

683
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:24,250
you're all, you're all these
fucking tax things are going to do.

684
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,500
They're not going to fuck
with any corporation.

685
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,680
They fucking brush the IRS off their
shoulder like it's a fucking net.

686
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,950
All you're gonna do is you're
going to go after new money.

687
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,160
Somebody went out and started something.

688
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:42,960
Who the fuck are you to say how much
money anybody can fucking make because you

689
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:46,260
don't have an idea that will
enable you to make $10 million.

690
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:49,740
Somebody has to fucking subsidize your
life and you're going to ignore the

691
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:52,590
fucking elephant in the room and you're
just going to go after the fucking

692
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:56,190
individual. Go Fuck
Yourself. Go Fuck Yourself.

693
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,560
Okay?

694
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,830
I didn't want to fucking hear this.

695
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,600
This is this fucking bullshit that dead
fucking chick is talking about there

696
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,900
that everybody's all high and mighty on.
She's talking about individuals.

697
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,030
She's not going to go out
after the cold corporations.

698
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,650
They're going to pay her fucking bank
account that she's going to go out and

699
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:15,590
give speeches to after she's
done with her political career,

700
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,990
to the two to 300 fucking grand a night,

701
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,030
just like the fucking Obama's,

702
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,730
but everybody's going to sit there and
act like it's only the bushes in the

703
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:27,800
trumps.
The fucking fucking,

704
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:32,240
Obama's just like the Clintons are lining
their pockets with that same fucking

705
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:35,210
corporate money that is never going
to be fucked with and they just,

706
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:38,270
they're going to go to stand up
comics people that start apps,

707
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,670
people who start dollar shave club,
that who the,

708
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,950
that's who the fuck is
going to get yanked down.

709
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,350
And you sat there and you, and ever
we've all sat back, support the troops,

710
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:52,110
support the troops and he can't
fucking speak out against the war.

711
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,750
And you literally watched them
bankrupt his fucking country.

712
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:57,450
And every year in August, we're
like, we don't have any more money.

713
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,050
We don't have any money.
What's the solution? Do we
go after the fucking banks?

714
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,970
Do we go after the corporations?
No,

715
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,390
we just raised the level of debt that
this country is going to accept and now

716
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:09,630
we're going to turn around and we're
going to make sure that no, no individual,

717
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,840
okay,

718
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,850
who doesn't fucking pour
water in the fucking, uh, uh,

719
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,600
rivers and pour water,

720
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,660
poor fucking the chemicals in the
Damn rivers and all that shit.

721
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:22,480
Just let all of those fucking people,
all of those cons,

722
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,130
who fucking polluted your fucking God
damn food supply to the point you got

723
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:30,130
girls getting their fucking periods at
nine years old and a kid could grow a

724
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:34,330
fucking full beard by the time
he's 10 ignore all of that shit

725
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,130
and just sit there and be like, I don't
think you need to make $10 million.

726
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,570
Go Fuck Yourself.
You know what buddy?

727
00:42:41,571 --> 00:42:44,960
I hope you make $10 million and I hope
you get to keep more than God damn

728
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:47,630
fucking 30% of it because you earned it.

729
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,390
You should have to pay
cause you fucking cause.

730
00:42:51,391 --> 00:42:54,220
So what could you earn
too much fucking money.

731
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,890
Listen,
I've got to tell you something right now.

732
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,650
If these corporations were
paying their fair fucking share,

733
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:02,270
I wouldn't have a problem
with this and you,

734
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,880
if you wanted to cap it at $10 million,
fine,

735
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,650
but that's not what the
fuck you going to do.

736
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,710
Okay.

737
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,950
All right.
I got heated there.

738
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,470
Yeah.

739
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,550
Fucking God damn stupid ass
fucking morons out there

740
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,780
okay

741
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,780
with you. Yeah. Why don't you
read up on what the fuck it takes.

742
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,190
Okay.

743
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:25,360
What are you read up on what it takes to
fucking go from not having anything to

744
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:26,410
fucking get in there?

745
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,100
Why don't you actually figure out how
hard you have to fucking work to even get

746
00:43:30,101 --> 00:43:32,920
anywhere close to half
of that fucking money.

747
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,160
Okay.

748
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,650
How fucking strong you
have to be mentally.

749
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,190
How much bullshit you have to get put
through as you fucking watching other

750
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:45,760
people around you that you started out
with, watching them slowly go crazy,

751
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,390
watching them kill themselves and
all of this other fucking shit,

752
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,340
and then turn a complete blind eye to
fucking banks and corporations and all of

753
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,760
these fucking assholes. Let,
yeah, let's go off to people
making months. Yeah. Yeah.

754
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,770
Fucking nationwide drug epidemic.

755
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:05,520
Let's just completely ignore all the
fucking pharmaceutical companies.

756
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,830
That's fine. That's fine.
Let's just go after Joe blow.

757
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,200
Who fucking worked his fucking balls off?
Yeah.

758
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,383
You know

759
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,180
who the fuck are you to say?
What the fuck?

760
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,790
Just a certain segment of people are
going to fucking make and you're going to

761
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:22,630
ignore all those goddamn corporations
and don't even fucking tell me to Ho go

762
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:27,250
after them to how they run the fuck they
run. All of these fucking politicians,

763
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,710
every one of them's on their
fucking knees blowing them.

764
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,210
And occasionally when you got a guy like
Bernie Sanders who actually wants to

765
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:35,130
stand up to those cons,
what do they do?

766
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,130
They fucking box him out and to
give him no coverage whatsoever.

767
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:41,820
Now what are they? Do they go with the
fucking made man? The Hillary Clinton,

768
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:42,690
right?

769
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,750
And then she loses to this orange headed
Khan and now we're dealing with this

770
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:46,584
shit.

771
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,513
Okay.

772
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,240
Jesus fucking Christ.
All right,

773
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:54,930
mother law was some messed up
passive aggressive behavior.

774
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,170
I have to end this podcast
soon cause I gotta go fucking,

775
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,353
Oh my God.

776
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,861
Nobody who's making,

777
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:09,890
who's not making $10 million
should fucking be telling
somebody what they should

778
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:11,780
be. Fine. Am I saying what
the fuck you should be paying?

779
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,500
I want to hear what's your fucking ideas?

780
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:18,540
Then I'm going to bet that if
I ever get over 10 million,

781
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,040
I'm going to be fucking subsidizing

782
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,040
what's, you can sit on your
fucking ass and not do anything.

783
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,900
And if a fucking nine to five job and
it'll be over right at fucking five

784
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:32,920
o'clock on Friday,

785
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,770
you could do whatever the fuck you want
for the rest of your fucking weekend.

786
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:39,550
Well,

787
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,950
what poor people who fucking are running
companies got to figure out all through

788
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:47,240
the weekend how to keep that thing afloat
so you still have your fucking job.

789
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,133
Then on top of that,

790
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,690
they supposed to give 70% of their
money over 10 million a year.

791
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,140
She can get another fucking beanbag chair.
Go Fuck Yourself.

792
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,700
Unbelievable. Yeah, we
haven't, we still haven't.

793
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:02,400
We shown that just giving people
fucking money doesn't do anything.

794
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,100
Okay.

795
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,840
There really is that fantasy that,
you know,

796
00:46:05,841 --> 00:46:08,210
if you give people fucking opportunity,
uh,

797
00:46:08,211 --> 00:46:10,430
you know they're going to make
something of themselves not true.

798
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:11,700
Yeah.

799
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,070
That's only half the recipe. That's
like, if you get a bag of sugar,

800
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:17,100
you can make a pie. No, you
can't. You need fucking eggs, Ede.

801
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:22,040
All kinds of other fucking shit.
Somebody has to have the drive,

802
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,200
they have the vision and
they gotta be strong enough.

803
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,610
Okay.

804
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,150
There when they keep getting a dick knock
in the dark to keep fucking getting up

805
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,520
okay

806
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,850
and staying positive and not letting
his fucking business each you up.

807
00:46:33,851 --> 00:46:36,490
I had a fucking text from a buddy of
mine last night, I couldn't believe,

808
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:38,530
I haven't talked to him about
how fucking negative be got.

809
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,720
And I'm trying to find a nice way to say,
dude,

810
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:42,100
don't let this business get to you.

811
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:45,640
Don't let them put the fucking pilot
light out because when they do,

812
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:48,100
you're fucking done.
All right.

813
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:52,510
I never had to have that fucking talk
when I was unloading trucks working in a

814
00:46:52,511 --> 00:46:57,090
warehouse.
I Dunno.

815
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,740
Listen,
I am all for

816
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,270
fucking pay and taxes
and all of that shit.

817
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,500
If they would actually spend it on
fucking the public schools, if they would,

818
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:11,770
if they would actually spending on trying
to give people tax breaks to fucking

819
00:47:12,441 --> 00:47:15,260
keep industry in this goddamn
country and they haven't,

820
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:18,320
everybody who's thought about themselves
and they've sent the thing out the

821
00:47:18,321 --> 00:47:19,130
fucking window.

822
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,860
So now what's going to happen is
you're going to start going after the

823
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:26,480
individual and somehow demonize somebody
that actually went after dream and is

824
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:28,850
corrupted.
His function country is actually got,

825
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,070
you're not going to fucking Yankees
fucking pants down the fuck outta here.

826
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,310
Fucking bullshit.

827
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,380
I think for you to make a statement
like that, at some point your life,

828
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:44,500
you should, you should actually have
made over $10 million a fucking year.

829
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,420
So maybe you'd have a
little bit of empathy.

830
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:51,470
You could actually speak with some sort
of fucking knowledge instead of sitting

831
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:54,590
there playing the God damn victim.
All right.

832
00:47:54,591 --> 00:47:57,620
If you want to start a fucking revolution
to go off to banks and corporations,

833
00:47:57,621 --> 00:47:58,700
I'm fucking all for it.

834
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,760
If you want to start yanking other fucking
knew your own fellow countrymen have

835
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:05,240
done nothing wrong down by their fucking
ankles because they had the balls to go

836
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:09,850
after something,
it fucking actually become successful.

837
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,390
And then you're, you're gonna decide
how successful they need to be

838
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,280
because these people are fucking honest
enough to actually report their goddamn

839
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,930
income. They, meanwhile,

840
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:27,200
you got the fucking country wants the
Goddamn Corporation after it's gone

841
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:32,201
through 20 fucking Goddamn islands is
now getting a loan from the last fucking

842
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:36,770
island I interest free
tax free fucking loan.

843
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,850
His money comes back to them in the form
of a fucking loan and then that Phantom

844
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:45,280
fucking corporation forgives the
loan and the guys pay in 0% taxes.

845
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,250
Okay,

846
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,380
how about that buddy?
How about that? Yeah.

847
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:55,381
Well let's ignore corporations that
keep us in wars that bleed this country,

848
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:59,860
die dry, and let's go after
the dollar shave club guy.
There you go. There you go.

849
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:03,220
Let's go after the guys who started
barstool sports. Yes, they're the,

850
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,280
they're the fucking problem motivated
fucking people who started from nothing

851
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,140
and in it hit the mother load.

852
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,033
I Dunno.

853
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,310
Jesus Christ. That was fucking 10
minutes of my life. I'll never get back.

854
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,940
All right. Mother in law was some messed
up, passive aggressive behavior there.

855
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:23,241
Bill,

856
00:49:23,241 --> 00:49:27,260
my boyfriend's mother is probably the
most passive aggressive piece of shit you

857
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:30,020
ever met in your life, by the way.
I still have to talk about this.

858
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:31,940
The fucking level of
money that I'm making.

859
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,800
I'm lucky if I get to keep a third of it
in on paper.

860
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:38,600
I'm not paying 70% tag.

861
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:41,870
You wait til that fucking thing kicks in
and if you think they're going to stop

862
00:49:41,871 --> 00:49:44,510
at 10 million and then it's
going to be well at 5 million,

863
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:47,540
should they pay this at 1 million?
Shouldn't they pay this?

864
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,290
Any check that I get? Any fucking
check that I get. I just, I just,

865
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,880
I take 70% already and throw it out
the fucking window with commissions,

866
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,700
expenses and then the taxes that I pay.

867
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,740
That's why people fucking go broke.

868
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,620
They go out and they get $1 million
and they think they have $1 million.

869
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:11,980
It's like you don't,
you have about 375 grand if you're lucky.

870
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,150
That's what $1 million is before you're
going to implement this bullshit.

871
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,173
Yeah.

872
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,500
Kind of a fucking American to fucking

873
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,790
it is for pulling down another
regular guy. Who was you? Yeah.

874
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:35,060
Why not get inspired by that person?
No.

875
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:37,730
You should give some year
money that you made back to me.

876
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,590
Fucking go fuck yourself.
Oh my God.

877
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,010
Why doesn't it everybody
get to play it down?

878
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:50,160
A Bennett fell football just because
their NFL dream didn't make it right.

879
00:50:50,161 --> 00:50:52,860
Why don't you just let them
do that? Uh, dear bill,

880
00:50:52,861 --> 00:50:56,190
my boyfriend's mother is probably the
most passive aggressive piece of shit you

881
00:50:56,191 --> 00:50:57,150
ever met in your life.

882
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,800
She's still relatively young in her
early fifties and acts like a college kid

883
00:51:01,801 --> 00:51:03,300
around her friends.
Oh boy.

884
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,720
Yeah.

885
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,410
It's probably more annoying than the
last 12 minutes of this podcast. Uh,

886
00:51:08,411 --> 00:51:12,250
you just know that she was a sorority
bullied when she was younger and now she

887
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:14,980
treats her family very
passive aggressively.

888
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,530
Okay.

889
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:20,430
Oh Wow. For example, when she came
over for dinner to our house recently.

890
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:21,670
Okay.

891
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:25,760
We asked if she could remove her shoes
as we don't appreciate the filth from the

892
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:28,180
street infecting our floors.

893
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,290
This slide at her from the get go
and then she went to the bathroom and

894
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,930
deliberately left skid marks on the toilet

895
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:41,050
and came out on that announcing to the
room that we should clean it regularly to

896
00:51:41,051 --> 00:51:42,580
prevent that from happening.

897
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:44,783
Oh my God.

898
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,200
I know that sounds crazy,

899
00:51:47,201 --> 00:51:52,201
but this is the same person who also
made a big deal about how somebody should

900
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:57,450
get tested for an STD because my,
oh,

901
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,940
saying how I should get
tested for an STD because,

902
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,030
okay.

903
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,640
My last boyfriend had
an uncircumcised penis.

904
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:09,020
Please let me know what you would do to
put her in her place once and for all.

905
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,970
MMM.

906
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,200
Oh, this is a tough one. This is
family. A family, the family, Becky's,

907
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,763
um,

908
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,370
mother-in-law with messed up
passive aggressive behavior,

909
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:29,350
but you're calling it your boyfriend.
Yeah.

910
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:32,020
You got to nip this in the bud
before you even fuck or the bud,

911
00:52:32,021 --> 00:52:35,200
whatever the fuck you say.
Nip in the bud before, uh,

912
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,510
before this goes any fucking further.

913
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,873
MMM.

914
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,020
You don't want to marry into that.
And if you do marry into it,

915
00:52:44,021 --> 00:52:45,190
you got to set up boundaries.

916
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,373
MMM.

917
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:53,370
Uh, here's the deal. I would just, uh,
I would say something to your boyfriend

918
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,900
and what I would do.

919
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,140
Yeah.

920
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,860
Uh, that's probably not going to
work. You know what I would do?

921
00:52:59,861 --> 00:53:01,900
I would just say I don't
appreciate that comment.

922
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,360
And if you have to have a fight with her,
I have a fight with her and just say,

923
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:08,470
listen to your coming over my house and
these are my rules. If you don't like it,

924
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:09,310
don't come over here.

925
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,040
And if she has a fucking problem with
that and your boyfriend is a problem with

926
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:15,010
that, fuck the both of
them. Fuck the both of them.

927
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:15,990
Yeah.

928
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,711
All right.
Yeah.

929
00:53:16,711 --> 00:53:19,920
There's no reason for you to be walking
around on egg shells where you live.

930
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,390
Fuck this fucking person.

931
00:53:21,391 --> 00:53:25,580
And you'll basically show your future
mother in law who you are and your

932
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:26,120
boyfriend,

933
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,830
who you are and you know, whoever has a
problem with it and go fuck themselves.

934
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,700
You can come over and then leave skid
marks in my toilet and say somebody should

935
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:35,410
clean that.

936
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:38,450
You should have grabbed her by the back
of her fucking neck and the seat of her

937
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:40,580
pants and thrown her out bounces style.

938
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:42,850
Okay.

939
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,370
Right out of your fucking house.
The fuck out of my house.

940
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:46,930
Okay.

941
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,620
Clean up my shit.
Get the fuck out of my house.

942
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,940
That's an easy one.
That's as easy as the $10 million a year

943
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,540
thing there. Uh, I, I'm open to
it too. It's hilarious of sale.

944
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:04,420
I'm open to more debate on that 70.

945
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:09,430
I'll talk to somebody who will actually
talk about the corporations and banks.

946
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,170
If you want to talk about that first
and what you plan to do with them,

947
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,280
then I will listen to your fucking over
$10 million and I don't make anywhere

948
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:21,790
near that.
But like I plan to,

949
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,070
I'm building a company,

950
00:54:24,071 --> 00:54:28,030
I plan on that and I don't plan
on fucking working my ass off.

951
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,990
So then I could just go give it to a
bunch of corrupt cops who aren't going to

952
00:54:31,991 --> 00:54:35,260
give it to you.
They're not going to give it to you.

953
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,710
They're going to give it in the
form of contracts to peak to people.

954
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:42,820
At big construction companies to build
more luxury, high rise apartments.

955
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,060
They're going to give them the kickback
fucking money and they're gonna charge

956
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:51,110
way more money for the fucking materials.
All of that fucking shit.

957
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,050
Government fucking jobs,
building roads and all of that.

958
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:56,720
That score is going to go,
it's not going to go back to the kids.

959
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:59,270
It's not going to go back to the
schools and it's not going to go to you.

960
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,640
It isn't. It never does because
they're all fucking corrupt.

961
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:09,140
So if you want to talk about how to
somehow pay politicians more money so they

962
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:13,160
don't, so they have
fuck you money. So they,

963
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,150
they don't have to fucking sit there
and suck the dicks of these corporations

964
00:55:16,151 --> 00:55:18,640
and these bags.
Then maybe we could try to fucking

965
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,840
have as honest accompanies you a
country as you could possibly have,

966
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:29,220
which is impossible because
people shit on socialism.

967
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:31,920
They shit on communism is shit
on capitalism. None of them work.

968
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:36,180
None of them work because human
beings are inherently flood. Alright,

969
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,090
so there you go. That's my uninformed
bullshit for the fucking day.

970
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,450
God bless all of you. I got some
shit to do. I know the podcast,

971
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:43,261
it was a little bit short,

972
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,290
but you're probably sick of me after I
was on my tree stump there for fucking 12

973
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:48,030
minutes. All right. God bless all of you.

974
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,450
I hope your dreams come true and I hope
when you go out and you make the money

975
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:55,230
that you earned, some cut doesn't
come in and take 70% of it. All right?

976
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,010
See you Thursday.
