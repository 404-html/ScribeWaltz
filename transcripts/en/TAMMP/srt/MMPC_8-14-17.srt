1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,400
Okay.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,990
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

3
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:06,570
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,660
August 14th, 2017. What's
going on? How, why?

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,510
Yeah. How's it going? Oh my God.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,603
Paul [inaudible]

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,040
fucking destroyed last night on
his standup special and Tarrytown,

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:22,963
New York.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,700
And uh, I want to thank everybody
that came out for the, uh,

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,730
for the two shows that we had
there. And uh, we just, I dunno,

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,080
it just went as good as it
could have gone, I felt and uh,

12
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:40,520
I was really proud of him. You
know that first one's always, yeah,

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,523
you got to figure it out.

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,730
How'd it go up there and try and be
relaxed as you're like, Holy Shit,

15
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:48,480
I'm shooting a special
look at those TV cameras.

16
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,750
Look at the chip camera swinging
by my damn face. You know,

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,700
you got to block all of that.
No,

18
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:56,160
that the crowd's going to be
looking at that shit. You know,

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,830
you learn that they have to turn off the
fucking air conditioning because most

20
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:05,820
of those old venues, the AC so frigging
loud, it messes with the audio.

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,680
So you're then going to go out there
under hot lights with HD makeup on with no

22
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,620
AC and progressively through your set,
it's going to get hotter.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,390
So he learned all of that and
you know something. God dammit,

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,100
he saw the fire any fucking
walked through it. And um,

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,790
okay.

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,200
He just, uh, I dunno, it just
couldn't have gone any better.

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,570
And uh,
there you go.

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,130
So we're going to edit that thing down
and hopefully sell it to one of the

29
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:39,820
goddamn networks. That's
the guy, that's the goal.

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,560
So congratulations to Paul
Versey. Uh, that's it.

31
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,450
And put them to bed. I told
him that before he went out.
That was just like, dude,

32
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:54,040
just look at it this way.
Okay, you're putting all these
jokes to bed. This is it.

33
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:54,851
Okay.

34
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:58,930
Go out there and give them the sendoff
day deserve because the second you're

35
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:02,380
special comes out, everyone's seen that
material, then you can't do it again.

36
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:04,600
And everybody will be like,
dude, you already did that.

37
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,690
You did that on your last fucking special.

38
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,080
No, your last special
called chuckles. Like,

39
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,450
what the fuck is wrong
with my goddamn computer?

40
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,260
Okay.

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,030
I'd been having all my God,

42
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,350
I even having like the worse
technology experiences.

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,010
What is going on? Why is the
screen just all black? Then I got,

44
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,730
then I go to touch it and it does that,
what does that make it a hit escape.

45
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,230
Can I hit escape? Why don't they
have an escape button for your life?

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,480
Um, oh, it worked. It worked to, Oh,

47
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:41,700
the old escape button.

48
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,130
Okay.

49
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,540
You know, there's somebody could turn
that into a little lead, like in a mood,

50
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,320
like turning into a movie.
A big time Hollywood movie.

51
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,670
Yeah. The, the escape button movie. Yeah.

52
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,380
Go in there and you can pitch it.
Hey,

53
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,350
you know that escape button on your
keyboard or you on your laptop?

54
00:02:57,351 --> 00:03:00,100
And they'd be like, Yup,
Yup. Uh Huh. Uh, just

55
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,990
to [inaudible] guy. He fucking
the, he pushes it, you know.

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,900
Okay.

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,610
And uh, he disappears and all
of a sudden his wife was like,

58
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:13,370
wait a minute, I thought I told you
cold and start where? Where'd he go?

59
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,520
And then whenever he fucking comes to,
he's always a,

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,090
okay,

61
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,520
let's flush this.
Let's flush out this fucking off a movie.

62
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,220
He was always in some
someplace better at first.

63
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,370
Okay.

64
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,820
But then there's, you know, he goes to a
baseball game, he's like, this is amazing.

65
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,020
And then he,
you know,

66
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,990
no one believes that it's true
except for his dump fat best friend.

67
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:33,820
Okay.

68
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,470
You know, they hit escape again, then
they're at a steak house, you know,

69
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:40,780
and they just keep hitting escape that
eventually they, uh, they're some fucking,

70
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,160
I don't know where the hell did they go?

71
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,030
They had escaped and they end up
in fucking Syria and North Korea.

72
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,780
That's where you get a note from the
industry. Can it not be North Korea?

73
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,770
Could it be, could it be like Canada? Like
Winnipeg? What if they went to Winnipeg?

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,590
That's funny.
Right?

75
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,420
I just feel like with today's
political climate to say North Korea,

76
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:04,680
I just think that,
you know,

77
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:08,850
then they're starving and we
like the fat friend fat is funny.

78
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,350
Fat As nonthreatening.

79
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,103
Okay.

80
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,420
Um, I don't know. You guys can finish the
rest of the fucking movie. Uh, anyways.

81
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,980
Um, so I was very proud of Paul
and all that type of stuff and uh,

82
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,740
going to try to keep the
podcast light, uh, despite the,

83
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,980
despite all that fucking
just horrible shit.

84
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,390
Okay.

85
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,840
That happened down in Charlottesville.
It's just fucking four.

86
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,310
I don't think I don't want to go.
I know.

87
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,610
I did hear one fucking funny
thing about it. I mentioned,

88
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,050
I'm going to say who I mentioned it to.

89
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,330
I mentioned it to somebody
else or go Jesus Christ to,

90
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:47,660
can you fucking believe that shit down
there in Charlottesville? They, he goes,

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,430
he goes, no, what happened?

92
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,200
I mean, I don't know. I
don't know if that is like,

93
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,500
I don't,
I don't know how you missed it,

94
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:03,010
but I mean there literally is that much
information coming out at you that you

95
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,770
could miss all that shit that
went down there. And uh, I mean,

96
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:10,410
I don't even need to comment on
what the fuck went on down there.

97
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,790
If you're any sort of a
human being, uh, you know

98
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,170
that dude in that fucking car,
I swear to God,

99
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:21,960
like I'm trying to think of a proper
punishment for that guy. And I,

100
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:23,970
I can't think nothing is like enough.

101
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,340
Okay.

102
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,560
To fucking drive. Just do that. You know,

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,870
you know what's funny about
that guy as I bet that guy,

104
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:34,340
he's talked about Isis and how cowardly
terrorism is and then he gets in a car

105
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,840
and does what the fuck he did.
It's just like, it's like, I dunno.

106
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,800
Hey, there must have been,
I mean, obviously beyond
joining that fucking group,

107
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:49,070
there's something wrong
with that guy mentally. Um,

108
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
anyways. Um, see that's why
I didn't want to bring it up.

109
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:57,890
Where do you go from there and then
fucking Trump, I'm done with that guy.

110
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,950
The guy's just no longer
funny or anything ease. Uh,

111
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,350
I've just done with that fucking guy.

112
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,960
Yeah.

113
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,590
The fact that he wouldn't
just straight up denounce it.

114
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,420
The fact that he's going to go, oh, you
know, there's hatred on both sides. Hey,

115
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,220
turn on both sides and he's doing
like that. You know what came first?

116
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:19,050
The chicken or the egg got
slavery. Slavery came first.
You fucking dope. It's,

117
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:21,920
it's documented.
It's just so fun.

118
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,940
Like he's been catering to that racist
fan base cause he needed their votes.

119
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,530
I'm not saying everybody
voted for Trump is racist,

120
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:32,080
but like for that fucking guy to do that,

121
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,950
it's absolutely fucking reprehensible.
It's sickening.

122
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,050
Fucking sickening. Okay.
And I'm not a fucking,

123
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,073
you know,

124
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,490
I'm not one of these guys that thought
the sky was falling because this guy got

125
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,930
in the office,
you know,

126
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:51,020
everybody freaking the fuck out like
what the fuck was going to happen.

127
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,340
But I will just say his track record

128
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,490
on the Klan, you know, to be just
not even commenting on it and being,

129
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,600
do you know, if I was doing standup and
people in the Klan started showing up,

130
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,610
I would be looking at what the fuck am
I saying that's making these people be

131
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:15,080
like, oh yeah, this guy,
he approves of what we do.

132
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,970
Okay.

133
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,400
At the very least I'd be
like, Hey, not for nothing.

134
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,290
You guys over there with the
Hudson, I fucking, you know,

135
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,430
I'm not down with you guys like
fucking kids. So you're morons.

136
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,300
You fucking morons. He never
does it. Never does it.

137
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,363
You know?

138
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,970
And I think he was just trying
to make a joke with the cops,

139
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:38,190
but the don't push the heads up, but just
a while, the shit that you've seen that,

140
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,600
that all that police brutality that's
been going out to make that fucking joke,

141
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:45,170
the guy, it's unbelievable.
And now I'm hearing like,

142
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,020
this is what, see, I'm not even a name
fucking names, but like all these Fito,

143
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:54,970
it's like fucking Taylor swift that
was gonna run for Senate people.

144
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:58,030
We can't go down this fucking road.
The very least.

145
00:07:58,031 --> 00:08:03,031
Can we at least stick with
career fucking politicians?

146
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,910
Can we at least do that? Can we, you know,

147
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,720
which would you want? Like you want
me to be your fucking accountant?

148
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,310
You want to comedian to be an accountant?

149
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,740
Why would you want an actor or a musician?

150
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,230
Fucking God knows what else.
I, I just, I don't know.

151
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,240
I don't even know what the
fuck we're doing now. I just,

152
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:28,160
I don't even know what the fuck
we're doing. So, um, anyways,

153
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:32,000
that happened. And uh, you know,
fortunately it wasn't a big rally.

154
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,983
You know,

155
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,780
they're Nazis is still a little, a
little mom. And Pop fucking group, which,

156
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,440
you know, that's about the only good
thing that I took away from it. But, uh,

157
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,030
I dunno, you know what's fucked up
about the whole thing though, as I said,

158
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,260
I wasn't going to talk about it.

159
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,050
Okay.

160
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,840
Is when people started texting me
like, dude, you watch in this shit.

161
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:56,920
So I go online,
you know,

162
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,980
to watch a video of the rally and all
the bullshit to see what's going on.

163
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:02,680
And I go on and when I click on it,

164
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,510
I immediately see Bobby flay and he's
selling me something from Lipton ice tea.

165
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,680
So what's so fucked up is, uh,

166
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,330
and I think it was actually,

167
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:22,030
I was actually on the Huffington
post and I fucking hate those guys.

168
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,480
Okay.

169
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,520
You know, and they're all liberal is
how can you fucking believe it's a blog?

170
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,390
It's like, dude, you're making money off
of it. You're making money off of it.

171
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:33,350
So there's something you would think
on just something like this is so

172
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:36,200
reprehensible. We shouldn't
even put a fucking ad in
front of it. Other than that,

173
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,370
I understand you've got to make you money.

174
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:41,690
I have advertising on my fucking podcast,
but there was just something fucked up,

175
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:44,570
like this is the most
horrible, blah, blah, blah,

176
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:45,890
whatever the fuck they have as a headline.

177
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:49,280
And then you click it on and it's fucking
Bobby flay set selling me fucking ice

178
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:50,114
tea.

179
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:52,560
Yeah.

180
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,660
But you know, and that's how the
game's played, I guess. Anyway,

181
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,710
so let's get the fuck out of
that. All right, Boo Nazis,

182
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,250
uh, boot Donald Trump being a
fucking pussy. That guy such a fuck.

183
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,770
I'm so sick of him and that fucking guy
from North Korea acting like the tough

184
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:12,100
guys acting like the tough, you know what
I mean? You know what they shouldn't.

185
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,900
You know they should,

186
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,460
they should fight the fucking undercard
on a McGregor Mayweather. All right,

187
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:19,290
why don't you guys
settle your fucking beef?

188
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,680
I'd love to see the two
of them put on fucking

189
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,040
okay.

190
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,760
The whole fucking get up the
box, insurance, the mouth
guard, the gloves, the boots,

191
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,710
and go out there and you just really see
what a couple of pants he's, you know,

192
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:37,711
that Fatty Donald Trump with his fucking
wig flopping around it probably one of

193
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:39,851
the fun.

194
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:44,110
It'd be funnier than all the standup
specials that came out this year combined.

195
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,400
It would have been tremendous.
Like that's,

196
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:49,390
that's the way I think that that's the
way they should solve world problems.

197
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,480
Although, you know what's his
face is like a black belt in judo,

198
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,940
Vladimir Putin at fucking, that dude
looks like a bad guy. And like, you know,

199
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,860
little spy movies right now I'm in over
my head. Why do I try to talk politics?

200
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,080
Because that's what everybody's fucking
talking about and asking me about I

201
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,301
guess.

202
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:10,240
But how about those red sox take it to
on a tree from the New York Yankees.

203
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,430
He had 100 bucks on each game. You know,
I get 50 with version 50 with my agent,

204
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,930
right? They're both Yankee fans. So, uh,
you know, we fucking blew that, that,

205
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:24,100
that first one bell, middle reliever.
I don't know what happened to him.

206
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,840
By the way, did you see that guy in
the mets made, he swung his leg around,

207
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:33,310
made that weird pitching motion and he
fucking slammed his balls between his

208
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:37,210
thighs. And then after that is
fucking pitching hand went numb.

209
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:39,670
Figure that one out.
Figure that one out.

210
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,620
Okay.

211
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,890
Why the fuck are guys wired like
that? Why if he get, he could,

212
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,960
how the design fall of men that you
could throw an object in somehow,

213
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,480
basically kick yourself in the,
and then you're throwing hand goes numb.

214
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,410
Okay.

215
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,250
It's unreal. You know what it is? The
men are like the death star, right?

216
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,740
We got that one little shaft.

217
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:06,650
All you do is you just fucking throw
something down and then the whole fucking

218
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:09,530
thing blows up and that would be on nuts,
you know?

219
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,463
Okay.

220
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,930
I don't know what the women want is
women.

221
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:17,670
You just tell me look older and then
that's it. The whole fucking plant,

222
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:18,504
it explodes.

223
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,450
Uh, Shit. Um, anyways,

224
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,480
I've been in it,

225
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,520
so I remember what was going to talk
about and I've been having like the worst

226
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,390
technology fucking weekend here.
Um,

227
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,290
I'm about to buy my, uh, my second
cell phone charger of the weekend.

228
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
I brought one,

229
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,020
I left it at the theater and then the
next day I woke up and I bought one.

230
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,470
I bought one.
And uh,

231
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,600
yeah,

232
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,470
drove from fucking, well,
there was a red bank,

233
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:59,910
New Jersey up to Tarrytown, New York.
And then I don't know what happened.

234
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,070
I don't know where the why or when, but
I fucking lost that one, so I got to go.

235
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,660
Bye. Fuck another one. It's just my phone.

236
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,090
My fucking computer
just keeps cutting out,

237
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,400
I guess now that I hit the escape button,
I'm fine. I don't know. I'm, I'm uh,

238
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,810
I'm just not meant to live in this
fucking era of all of this shit.

239
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,750
I need to go back to when there
was just like rotary phones,

240
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,530
which was impossible to lose because
you wouldn't take it with you.

241
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,490
It was just in your house.

242
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:33,760
The only way you lost it as it fills it
in fucking sink hole your house and you

243
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:38,410
lost all your house. So there was
a fire in your house, you know,

244
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,220
or somebody came to Maria with the black
gloves and they would fucking cut the

245
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,910
phone wire. Then you lost your
phone and you lost your life.

246
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:48,070
But you say you didn't care.
Right. Was this sent, wait,

247
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm trying to say was it
was a simpler time. Um,

248
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,990
I gotta tell you, dude, I'm fucking
sold on the Jersey shore by the way.

249
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,190
All these years,
all these years of Paul Versey great.

250
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,320
Paul Versey fucking crushed
his special last night.

251
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,220
It's been shitting on New
Jersey. I fucking five. Finally,

252
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,010
the same way goes like to Yara. I know
what your deal is with this fucking state.

253
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,240
I don't know why you think, you know
there's more animals that live here.

254
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:17,850
The New York, there
are, I'll give him that.

255
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,040
It's a little dirty or
animal in New Jersey,

256
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,750
but there weren't there the under dogs.

257
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,220
So I was going around Terry town and
I was just taking pictures of people,

258
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,680
all the fucking animals that are up here.

259
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:31,500
What it is about this part
of this neck of the woods,

260
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,910
like fucking West Chester.
Um,

261
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,750
is it so fucking beautiful up here?
It could cleans up the animal.

262
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,270
You don't see it,
but if you really do,

263
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:45,690
if you fucking block out the trees and
the beautiful houses and buildings behind

264
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:49,140
these people and you really look at them,
you know it's a bunch of animal.

265
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,340
I want it to Terry town and there
was bunch of people like had all the,

266
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:55,850
all the new rage now be seen like those
does their motorcycles but they're

267
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:56,720
really small.

268
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,770
We call a mini bikes but they look like
it's like somebody took a Ninja and they

269
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:03,250
just made it smaller.
Like this whole group of them.

270
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,550
Okay.

271
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,680
Was riding through like a motorcycle gang?

272
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,070
I don't if they were marketing
motorcycle gangs, I have no idea.

273
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,890
I don't know if they were more likely
to beat the shit out of you because

274
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,380
they're insecure about the size
of their motorcycles. I don't,

275
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,860
I don't get how it fucking works,
but there was like 40 of them we'd,

276
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,530
I'll ride through town and I was
laughing my ass off going, here I am.

277
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,050
Here I am in fucking, you know,
if I'm not in West Chester,

278
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,230
I'm Oberson West Justice.

279
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,280
Look at these fucking animals
and I already learned up
here. There's already is,

280
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,660
there's always this snooty thing in
all the fucking real estate, you know,

281
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:41,480
are you above the boulevard
or you're below the boulevard?

282
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,910
Are you in the flat lands?
Are you in the hills?

283
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,930
Are you on this side of the
tracks or that side of the tracks?

284
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,650
This side of the river,
other side of the bridge up here,

285
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,810
I already found out that there was,
there's this snooty,

286
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,910
if you live on the other side of the
Tappan Zee bridge or the Tappan Zee Bridge

287
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,710
is there's my fucking Google Map lady
was saying when I was driving up there

288
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:07,760
making right to go onto exit
one c four a Tapan zee bridge.

289
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,163
Yeah,

290
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,690
you're less than you live on
the other side of the river.

291
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,690
Stuff is cheaper over there.
It's more expensive to live here.

292
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,260
Therefore you are less than me.
You are less than God likes you less.

293
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:26,190
God loves everyone,

294
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:31,191
but he loves you less because you live
on the other side of the fucking river.

295
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,160
Actually cornered this woman last
night who was in real estate, right?

296
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,800
She's up at the Bar,
right?

297
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:41,590
And I'm going up there to go get a couple
of rounds of drinks or whatever people,

298
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:42,700
you know,
cause I'm a hell of a guy.

299
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,150
Okay.

300
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,540
And she's like, Hey, you know,
first he special yet. And I
said, it's great. You know,

301
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,240
I do the tip accomplishing. What are
you doing? She goes, I'm in real estate.

302
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,420
I said, wonderful. I got
some questions for you.

303
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,310
And I fucking grilled her up up. Uh,
uh, uh, went law and order on her.

304
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,010
Yeah.

305
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,010
And I fucking was breaking it down to
find out what's the deal with all of these

306
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,000
luxury apartment buildings?

307
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,010
They're going up like fucking
like luxury apartment buildings.

308
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,210
That's how many luxury apartment buildings
they're building in New York and Los

309
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:20,370
Angeles. The only reference is what
they are. And I'm like, what is the,

310
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,760
what's the deal with these fucking
luxury apartments? Who is building them?

311
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,900
Why are they building them?

312
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,370
What kind of a fucking moron pays rent
in a luxury apartment when they could

313
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:32,680
actually just go buy
something and live in it.

314
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,040
That was less than the luxury apartment,
but at least they would own that.

315
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,570
Who makes that dumb decision? First
of all, who's paying for these?

316
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,930
And she said, it's a lot of
foreign money. Uh, China,

317
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,190
Russia and Middle East money,
right. Then I go, all right,

318
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:52,800
and then who the fuck's in them? And
she said, she basically said, I got,

319
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,550
when I said, who's dumb enough to
throw money in the toilet like that?

320
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,340
She said, about 15% of
the population. I go,

321
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,470
all right, so you're banking on, I got,

322
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,380
how do you put your head on the
pillow every night? She goes,

323
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:10,590
this isn't my passion. I go, but you
are selling them. How do you do that?

324
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,810
How do you fucking go?
All right,

325
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,480
come on the lower 15% dummies,
please walk into my office today.

326
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,410
Long story short, I go, when does it
burst? When she goes, well, you know the,

327
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,900
you know of people seem to be, they keep
building them, they keep filling it.

328
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,820
When does it burst? Well, you
know, but, but when does it burst?

329
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,630
She goes two years dead serious.
She goes, two years, two years.

330
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:35,910
It's going to be fucking
overseas. What you do? I go,

331
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:39,360
you sit on your fucking money.
All right.

332
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,090
If you need to buy something now,
because the fucking, this is me.

333
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm like that fucking ball guy who screams
about taxes. I mean, uh, the stocks,

334
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,330
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

335
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:51,300
Both from a little fucking conversation
that I had about three 30 in the morning

336
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,440
as we were closing down this fucking bar.
Um,

337
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,590
celebrate and Paul Versey
crushing his special.

338
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,170
Okay.

339
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,160
Uh, I, I'm telling you right now, just
sit on your fucking money. Like, oh,

340
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,090
I don't know. What the fuck
did I say initially? I guess
I said, yeah, if you, if,

341
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,320
if you're getting killed in taxes
and you got to buy something, no,

342
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,490
just don't rent a function,
a fucking luxury apartment.

343
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,320
It's got to be the dumbest
fucking thing you could ever do.

344
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,490
Look at the luxury of this all.

345
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:25,300
Look at all those luxury than I'm
paying for that. I don't fucking out

346
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,590
just hanging in there in two years,
you'd be able to buy the fucking building.

347
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,520
Of course you won't cause it will
still cost millions of dollars.

348
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:38,150
But you know what I'm saying?
Don't be a fucking SAP. Alright.

349
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,920
All those buildings that do
doing is killing everybody's
fucking view. You know,

350
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,930
they're all going to be fucking
empty within two years down.

351
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:47,300
I'm calling it right.
They're all going to be,

352
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,350
people are gonna be jumping out of those
fucking tags and two years we're taking

353
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:52,184
college.

354
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,963
MMM.

355
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,780
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
All I know is I haven't been home.

356
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,440
And too many days I miss my daughter,
my wife and I can't wait to get back.

357
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,970
And um, and that's it. I
got a nice 10 days off,

358
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:11,200
but I had the best fucking
time down on the Jersey shore.

359
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:15,130
The fucking food was amazing. I
went down to this place, juniors,

360
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,950
I don't even know where I was at.
All right? Like I was pretty cool.

361
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,440
I had a different opener every night
versus he opened the first night,

362
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:23,860
fucking killed it.
I went to bed like a God damn angel,

363
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,990
like a fucking angel. All right. I'm
already white as a fucking angel,

364
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,880
you know, at least to ghost went right
home, went to sleep, woke up the next day,

365
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,140
worked out,
fucking crushed it.

366
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,170
Right next day I had fucking Bret Ernst
came up who absolutely fucking murdered,

367
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:45,340
who you have to go see. Uh,
I hadn't seen him in years.

368
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,920
It's weird how we seam the comedy store,

369
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,680
but he that just went up
or I'm going up or what?

370
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:52,270
I'm going up and he's
going up in the other room.

371
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,660
I just hadn't seen him in a few years.
That dude grown by leaps and bounds.

372
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,640
Absolute fucking monster destroyed.

373
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,900
He had me pacing a little bit
before I was going up or not,

374
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:05,560
fuck Brett's killing breads, Kellen
Shit, what am I opening with? Right.

375
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,010
And then later on that night he took me
down to wherever the fuck he was took

376
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:14,011
went down and this place juniors
someplace on the Jersey shore and we got a

377
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:17,710
tomato pie, which I had never
heard of, which is basically,

378
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,210
it's like a South Jersey Philly thing
where according to them they put the

379
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,370
cheese on first.
Then the tomato sauce,

380
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,820
but the one that I had looked more like
a swirl of looked like tomato, cheese,

381
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,790
tomato, cheese, like a big
fucking circular thing.

382
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,350
Like when you fucking through computers,
refreshing that. A little pinwheel thing.

383
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:38,020
That's what it looked like.
Fucking I might've been,

384
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,450
might've been one of the top five pizza
slices of pizzas of it had in a while.

385
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,440
Okay.
And I'm going to tell you why,

386
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,320
because I live in Los Angeles and
all the pizza out there sucks.

387
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,210
Even the stuff that they say is
good, you know, it all fucking sucks.

388
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,270
Every fucking last place in
la absolutely fucking sucks.

389
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,820
I don't know why you just can't.
Anything that involves doe sucks.

390
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,360
The bread sucks. The
pizza sucks, Bagel suck.

391
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,640
All of that sucks. However,
you know, other than that,
they got a tremendous fuck.

392
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:17,050
Pasta sucks. But you know,
amazing steakhouses, Burgers,

393
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,620
Thai food, Mexican food. That's what you
do out in La. But you do not get pizza.

394
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:25,470
You don't get bread. You don't
do any of that shit. Um, and I,

395
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,450
and I was coming from that,
eating that shit to go into this.

396
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,120
It was fucking unbelievable.
That in the fucking muscles,

397
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,620
the bread with the fucking sauce. It was
unbelievable. Like an asshole. I mean,

398
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:38,500
this shit at like fucking
two in the morning. Um,

399
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,660
and then I kept going to this place,

400
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:45,430
lcs in red bank to get
a sandwich and just,

401
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,640
I would pay for just the bread alone,
by the way.

402
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:53,380
I went with the Turkey with the cranberry
sauce over there, fucking delicious.

403
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,540
And I made the mistake of getting a large,
by the way,

404
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,200
which was the size of my fucking leg.

405
00:22:57,201 --> 00:23:00,820
So the next day I went back and I
got the Italian, which was amazing,

406
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,920
but I still like the
Turkey a little bit better.

407
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,530
So I was eating as my stomach growls here.

408
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,070
I was been eating like a
fucking king out here and um,

409
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,960
I dunno, I, I kind of fell in
love with the Jersey shore.

410
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,800
Always wanting to see Asbury park.
Went down there, check that out.

411
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,030
Went into the uh,
I dunno all those play every place down.

412
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,970
There's like Bruce Springsteen
or Jon Bon Jovi played here.

413
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,230
I know the place is not
called the fucking stone pony.

414
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,640
That's a fucking bar I used to drink
and in the fucking village that is no

415
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:37,250
longer there.
That was my fucking spot name.

416
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,640
He used to drink in there back when
I had my drinking under control.

417
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,580
Then I was hanging out with all the
comics that hung out with back then.

418
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:46,100
Didn't drink and uh,
we'd go in there.

419
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:49,700
We used to play fucking video games and
shoot pool and just give each other shit

420
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,720
like we always did for like four or
five till four or five in the fucking

421
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:58,220
morning. Um, whatever that fucking pony
places called. I know it's sac religious.

422
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,910
Tell you jerk. I got to look. You know
why I'll get the name of it right now.

423
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,390
Cause I bought my daughter
a onesy from that place,

424
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,640
which I think she'll only be able to
wear for one week because it looks at the

425
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:13,930
side, it looks like it's the, uh, the
size that she is now. What's it cost?

426
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,260
My wife had to say, oh, what
is this stone pony? I'll wait.

427
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,560
The stone crow is the bar I
used to hang out at. All right.

428
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:25,370
So I was saying it right.
I sent the picture of the ones he didn't,

429
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:28,130
my wife and she knew that it goes like,
what size is that?

430
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:32,500
Cause she's currently wearing, you know,
this month to this month. It's just like,

431
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,100
can't Jesus, can you just, you know,

432
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,330
can I do one fucking thing right over?
He just fucking one thing. Can I do that?

433
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,660
Um, so last night I hung out
until four in the morning,

434
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:46,480
but I only had a couple of fucking
drinks cause I kind of realized,

435
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,523
MMM,

436
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,700
I'm not an ally.

437
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,510
I'm not going to undiagnosed an
undiagnosed string of alcoholics.

438
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,340
You know, where, uh, I'm the classic
alcoholic where I can't just have one,

439
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:03,920
like I'm doing it, I'm fucking
doing it. That's it. All right.

440
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:06,380
But the next day I could just be
like, all right, but now, you know,

441
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,730
now I'm not drinking and I walk around
like, I need it, man. I fucking need it.

442
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:13,940
I don't wake up like missing a tooth
and all of that fucking shit. Like,

443
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,490
um,
but uh,

444
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:18,970
you know,

445
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,300
I have way too many that night when I
went down to juniors and had that great

446
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:26,190
food and everything. And I also noticed
too, I was throwing them back like,

447
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,850
like fucking water

448
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,580
and,
uh,

449
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,120
and it's just not a good thing. I'm just
sick of being fucking hung over. So,

450
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,280
you know, last night I
only had a couple, um,

451
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,150
I'm kind of, I think I'm done. I'm
just done with it. I like waking up,

452
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:49,240
not fucking hung over. I like
getting up, going to the fucking gym.

453
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,900
I like doing that shit. And uh, yeah,

454
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,690
I'm not saying I'm done for fucking good,
but I'm just kinda just, yeah, I'm done.

455
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,870
I had a hell of a run.

456
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,600
All right. Started at fucking
17. Drank until about,

457
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:12,400
I dunno, 22. And then it went like a
10 year period where I didn't drink.

458
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:13,510
I barely drank.

459
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,610
Yeah.

460
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,780
Barely fucking drank. And then, uh,

461
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,420
then a guy named Joe to Rosa came down.

462
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,350
It's my life.

463
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,210
It's not fair for me to put it on him.
All right.

464
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,860
But what does it say?

465
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:33,690
We were not good for each other and uh,

466
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,620
that was probably 2004.
So I'm talking like a nice,

467
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,060
I been on like a 13 year sort of a,

468
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:44,250
although I took a year off one
time from 2010, 2011 a year.

469
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,490
I went a year and two
days without drinking.

470
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,370
I've gone a couple of
stretches of 75 days,

471
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:52,680
50 some days here or there or whatever.
But uh,

472
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,053
mmm.

473
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,670
Yeah. I mean, I'm always, you know, if you
get a nice cold bottle of fucking wine,

474
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:01,920
this is a good meal. Maybe I'll have
a glass, but I just don't feel like,

475
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,680
but then it's like, I'm going, I'm
going to finish the fucking bottle.

476
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,130
Yeah.

477
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,120
I mean, what are we doing here?
Right. Uh, so I don't know.

478
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,060
I don't feel like I'm mature enough
at this point in my life to, uh,

479
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,700
handle shit like that.
And I'm at the point to where it,

480
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,520
I don't think I even
enjoy it anymore. So, uh,

481
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:22,240
for the 90th time on this fucking podcast,
I'm going to try to stop drinking.

482
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,930
So I was a social drinker.

483
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,570
I think I want to go to Aa just
cause I like crowds, you know,

484
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,660
just go up there and just
fucking make them laugh and shit.

485
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,023
MMM.

486
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,950
Anyways, what am I talking about
here? How many minutes in it?

487
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:42,920
We're 27 minutes in here and I get
to vacate this fucking hotel room.

488
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,440
I'm staying at this stupid ass fucking
yeah.

489
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,850
Fancy fucking wanted to share it in,
right?

490
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,420
People are just going to stay at
the fucking Sheridan, these kinds,

491
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,200
I swear to God,

492
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,980
you order the Internet at 1201 it goes
off and you've got to buy it again.

493
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,893
MMM.

494
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,120
Oh wait, maybe it's free. All I had
was an access code. I, you know,

495
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:06,550
I take that back. They're not fucking
cool. All right, let's, let's,

496
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:11,130
let's read a little bit of a,
let's read a little bit of, um,

497
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,040
uh, Eric. Oh, by the way,
then the other thing too,

498
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:18,430
you know what I don't like about Trump
supporters is when they compartmentalize

499
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:21,420
that racist shit when they
go like, you know, hey, I,

500
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,870
that stuff where he doesn't
condone, you know, he doesn't know,

501
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,270
uh, chastise the Klansmen that
not neo Nazi said like him.

502
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,430
I don't like that. I don't like
that part, but I'll tell ya,

503
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,910
I think the way he's handling it
had been Hilary. You know? Well,

504
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,840
why can't fucking stand either, but
at some point, you know what I mean?

505
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,350
It's like if you had a friend,
right? He's a good friend of yours,

506
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,870
but he was also in the clan.

507
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,083
Yeah.

508
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,740
Dude, he's such a great host.
You have them all over again.

509
00:28:56,741 --> 00:29:00,500
All we fucking, he's really polite,
but he drops the gun board. I mean,

510
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:03,050
at some point you don't,
you have to have some sort of a standard.

511
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,870
You can't tell me that there's
not a better republican. Okay.

512
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,200
They're all right.
Please tell me.

513
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,280
Please tell me there's something
somebody better than this guy. All right.

514
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,640
Oh, here we go. Oh, it's old zip

you know fizzling lying and everybody.

572
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,810
But John Daly, I think he
kicked Gif, they should recast,

573
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,680
they should fucking green
screened him in there. You know,

574
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:07,010
can somebody Photoshop that in? Somebody
just says, I like you John Daly.

575
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:11,510
There's no lying in you.
They just be like,

576
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:14,030
you know how much should the Heidi, you're
drinking when you're drinking a day.

577
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Cause I drink like a case of beer some
days up to maybe 35 40 and they go 35 40

578
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:23,870
he's like, oh yeah. And then
they go, then one he goes,

579
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:28,370
I know I probably switched to whiskey
and then he just started laughing. Like,

580
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:29,990
just be like,
I know it's fucked up.

581
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,200
Talked about how he played his best
golf when he was a little drunk. He was,

582
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,580
you know the balls, you know, you just hit
the ball better, you know, you're looser,

583
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,030
the body relaxes.
And uh,

584
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,520
I really wish I watched golf
more when he was playing,

585
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,100
cause he didn't take all that fucking
time. When he went up to address the ball,

586
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,260
he just went up and he
just fucking hit the thing.

587
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,930
Crushed it like seriously.
Watching that guy swing is one of the most

588
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,820
incredible things I've
ever seen in my life.

589
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:05,530
I actually saw some fucking idiot did
that thing where he put the tea in his

590
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:08,530
mouth with the ball.
He let John Daly do a John Daly Swain

591
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:15,130
and we daily didn't fuck up. Thank
God. But I gotta tell you something.

592
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,000
If you ever took that to this day,
he would've killed him.

593
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,270
He literally would have killed that guy.
He would have gone to jail.

594
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,670
You know what? That guy from the
fucking New Jersey Nets, right?

595
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,720
Shut that limo driver I need.
You would be in that role.

596
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:35,410
They have a row of cells of uh,
athletes who accidentally killed somebody.

597
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,000
He would have been right there. You know,
what did you do? I shot my limo drive.

598
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:40,870
What'd you do?
And you know,

599
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,560
I tried to hit a golf ball
out of this guy's mouth and I,

600
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,940
I missed an eye kitty's head.

601
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
How far do you think John Daly could
have hit a human head that was still

602
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:51,190
attached to a body?
So he has to rip it off the body.

603
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:53,170
I could say you get hit at least 17 feet.

604
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,160
That's the level of Torque and power
in that man swing to check out John a

605
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:03,170
videos if you get a chance at work. Um, I,

606
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,600
it's crazy. It's so fucking like
it's an overly used expression,

607
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:12,190
but refreshing when you watched the guy,
he's not trying to hide anything.

608
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:14,380
It's just like, I know
that's why he's still, yeah,

609
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:17,080
one time it was a rain delay and uh,
you know,

610
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,430
just went in there and made these two
golfers and yeah, we just got hammered,

611
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,600
just got absolutely hammered.

612
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:26,380
And then the next day we came out in the
same clothes hung over and we actually

613
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:27,220
will play.
Great.

614
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,600
All right.

A upside down.com you're turning me.
I wish it wasn't one.

618
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,610
I was just say it was one less
civil in that syllable in this.

619
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,210
So I could fuck her. Really
make that song happen. Um,

there's a better way for you to
buy business travel. You know,

621
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,020
one thing I've learned about these
fucking people that advertise,

622
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,390
evidently they all have a
better way of doing something.

623
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,440
It's called upside.com.

remember in the panic room

678
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,480
when she had to go out of the panic chroma
that she went back in and as she went

679
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:38,290
to go back in,

680
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,320
there was like some issue where maybe she
would've caught her fucking arm in the

681
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:44,230
door
and I was just thinking,

682
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:47,620
what if she fucking did and it closed
and then she had to make the decision?

683
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,330
Do I reopen the door,

684
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,890
expose my kid to the bad guy or do I
just sit here while my arms slowly just

685
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,460
fucking dies? And then, then
I'll die in here. You know?

686
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,780
See, this is why I don't write movie
scripts because that would fucking happen.

687
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:03,610
And every like, oh my
God, it was terrible.

688
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:07,390
Then she fucking died and the kids saw
it and then he couldn't figure out the

689
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:11,110
code and then everybody died.
Right. It was a double feature.

690
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:16,060
After that we showed the local news,
um, white people, this is, Oh God,

691
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,250
we're going to get into the ration.

692
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,260
Are we really going to get into the
ratio here? Okay. White people. Oh,

693
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:23,710
Billy ambassador.
I'm unsure.

694
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:26,920
I'm sure you address the current events
at the top of the Po, this podcast.

695
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:29,500
I skipped over most of it.
As you may have heard.

696
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:34,501
I just thought of trashed Trump for not
having the fucking humanity to trash,

697
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,370
you know, some of the dumbest
people on the planet, you know,

698
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,720
and actually blaming the
people that they attack

699
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,590
also. I just don't
fucking get it. He goes,

700
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:51,460
I'm pretty moderate and have the same
Ron Paul ideas about government is,

701
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:55,030
you seem to have a, sorry
about the generations trying
to keep a tight yet. Dude,

702
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:57,520
I don't even know what the fuck
I believe anymore. He said,

703
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:01,960
I watched my Facebook feed all
day. Denounce White people.
All right. First of all,

704
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:06,070
why would you go on a Facebook feed?
Are you trying to depress yourself?

705
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,730
Are you trying to make yourself upset?
Why would you go on there?

706
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,571
What did you do next?

707
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:14,830
Did you go on Twitter and look up Hashtag
white people so you could infuriate

708
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:18,310
yourself more and get an even more,
um,

709
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,690
like delusional view of
what the population is like?

710
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,100
You know,
I dunno.

711
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,510
I mean, if you watched all
that shit about the Klansmen,

712
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:34,580
you'd think that every white person was
in the Klan. I mean, it's just, I dunno.

713
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,080
Anyways, plowing ahead here.
Uh, he says, uh, I look white,

714
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:42,770
but I'm first generation American
with my parents coming from Italy.

715
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,310
Okay. Yeah. You're, you're telling
you, okay. I get it. All right.

716
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,120
My policy on making general statements
about entire races is I don't,

717
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,040
and stereotypes.
Sure.

718
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,460
Why people love things like
jarred jam's budding criticism.

719
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:03,600
I never say white people or black
people because if history has taught us

720
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:07,170
anything,
it's the dumbest thing you period.

721
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,690
I think you meant to say the
dumbest thing you can do. He goes,

722
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:14,460
I'm tired of it all day white people.

723
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:18,810
There's white people that I voted for
Barack the first time I ate Nazis.

724
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:22,140
And it's fucking pathetic that
I have to say that out loud.

725
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:26,490
I think Trump is a con. I hated Hillary.
I don't wish for the south to rise again.

726
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,130
I'm not offended as a white person.

727
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:33,060
I'm just tired of the laziness
of an am I way off here.

728
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,440
Uh, look, I know what you're
saying, but dude, it's like,

729
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,480
is this the worst thing
you have to deal with?

730
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,000
You got to expect people in a
highly emotional state. All right?

731
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,720
Such as this.
You know,

732
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,970
when you're in a highly emotional state,
you,

733
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,380
you're going to say stuff in a way that
you wouldn't if you were a little more

734
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:58,080
relaxed.
And then secondly,

735
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,200
if you're going to fucking go on
a Facebook feed and get upset,

736
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:07,140
I don't have any sympathy
for you. Like, it's,

737
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:12,540
you know, it's, it's,
it's a Facebook feed.

738
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,850
There's no,

739
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:20,490
the qualifications to comment on Facebook
is you have to be smart enough to sign

740
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:25,260
up for Facebook. That's it. So
that's what g it's not a think tank.

741
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,320
It's not a ted talk,
which even those things,

742
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:31,320
I'm starting to think of just a
fucking bunch of snake oil salesmen.

743
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,320
Everybody acting like some fucking
amazing is happening, you know,

744
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:38,700
cause somebody is up there with a laser
pointer talking about the future. Um,

745
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,530
yeah, I mean, all right. I understand
what you're saying. Like I'm not,

746
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,321
I'm not going to lie to you.

747
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:48,250
There are times where I'll see like these
people being applauded for shit that

748
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,990
they're saying.
And when I'm listening to what I'm saying,

749
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:53,050
it's like if you took out white people
there and then you inserted black people

750
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,770
like that and that person was white,
they would be in trouble. However,

751
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,540
however you do have to take it with a
grain of fucking salt because of the great

752
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:04,810
fucking life that you
have. All right. And, um,

753
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,670
I dunno, I, I think he should maybe try.

754
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,590
I would try to listen more
to what the overall point is,

755
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:16,670
rather than wasting time being offended.
You know,

756
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,060
I'm a white guy, I'm a fucking,
life is great, you know,

757
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,690
I can pretty much go wherever the fuck
I want to go. I go down to the mall,

758
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:27,950
I buy a tee shirt, nobody fucks with
me. Right. I'm not saying it's easy,

759
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,401
but I mean,

760
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:30,740
compared to what other people compared
to what other people fucking out of,

761
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:33,480
I guess this is the best, you
know, this is the inside lane,

762
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,423
you know,

763
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,690
I could fucking look the other way,
but there's definitely days I'll,

764
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,920
I'll say this is definitely days that,
you know,

765
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,410
nonwhite people say some shit or like,
you know,

766
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:45,420
women will say stuff about men being like,

767
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:50,280
that's so fucking overtly fucking sexist
and not only not being called out on it,

768
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,680
you're being applauded for it.
Like you're brave.

769
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,850
And what you're saying is just as fucking
ignorant is what the fuck you're doing.

770
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,960
However, at the end of it, I,
you kinda gotta be like, well,

771
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:02,370
okay,

772
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,380
because of what's happening
that's so fucking pissed.

773
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:05,610
Like I give it a little bit,
like,

774
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:10,020
I just thought I'd give it a little bit
depending on my mood. Um, I do that, but,

775
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:13,690
um, all right. You don't,
what the honest thing is,

776
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:16,540
is if I'm sitting there and the
person who isn't white says it,

777
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:18,430
I'll get into a debate with them.
All right.

778
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,860
But if I'm with all white people
and they're complaining about it,

779
00:45:20,861 --> 00:45:24,610
I'll tell him to shut the fuck up. I think
I'm just a contrarian and all depends.

780
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,890
Um, I don't fucking know, but all I do,

781
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,060
all I know is after watching all
that fucking horrible shit. Yeah.

782
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,400
I just think, you know, there's,

783
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:38,840
there's a certain level of empathy
that, uh, he should try to tap into,

784
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,020
try to put yourself in other
people's positions a little bit more.

785
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,190
And um,

786
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,020
I dunno,
I guess to try to compensate

787
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,870
for the astounding level of
fucking ignorance that's out there.

788
00:45:52,871 --> 00:45:56,680
I guess she got to try to make yourself
an even better person or somehow,

789
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,251
I don't know.

790
00:45:57,251 --> 00:46:00,820
I don't know what to tell you because
I'll be honest with you is when our people

791
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:02,320
go, Hey, I'm not in a fucking

792
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,363
mmm,

793
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,350
oh, not in the clan. I'm not
a Nazi guy. I'm not, I don't
belong a hate group, blah,

794
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,210
blah, blah. And Bernard Shit,
everybody has their fucking issues.

795
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,540
And when you're a comedian,
it's like you're running for office.

796
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:17,630
It's like you run this campaign that
never fucking stops and you're meeting

797
00:46:17,631 --> 00:46:20,870
people. Like, I was just in Red Bank,
New Jersey, now I'm in Tarrytown,

798
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:22,970
now I'm going to go to fucking La,
you know,

799
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:25,340
the end of the month I'm going to
be in Boston, in New Hampshire,

800
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,440
then I'm going to be in
Mississippi and Alabama. Um,

801
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,680
am I really promoting my upcoming dates,
talking about racism. Look amazing.

802
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,290
Next thing, I should have
Bobby flay reading this. Um,

803
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:41,300
but the point is as I'm going to
meet all these fucking people and um,

804
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,380
I dunno, I gotta be honest with you.
Everywhere I go, no matter where I'm at,

805
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:54,410
when I'm in a room and it's just
all white guys of a certain age,

806
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,580
my generation and older,

807
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,820
you can literally take a fucking,
I swear to God,

808
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:07,110
like one of those sands of
time timers and just go, okay,

809
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,320
when is the n word common?
I'm trying to remember.

810
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:15,530
I'm trying to remember the last time that,
you know, it doesn't happen every time,

811
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:20,180
but I go in there and I literally started
having anxiety going, Oh God, you know,

812
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:23,570
I look around and what I'm doing
is I'm judging too. And I'm like,

813
00:47:23,571 --> 00:47:24,290
when's it coming?

814
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,170
Someone's going to fucking say it or
someone's going to say something a little

815
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:28,004
borderline.
Yeah.

816
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,683
MMM.

817
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,320
And it's depressing.
Like I was hanging,

818
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,880
yeah.

819
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,713
Uh,

820
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:39,510
recently on a row gig and it was all
white dudes in there and Mayweather

821
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,290
accused. Mcgregor is saying something
racist and Mcgregor's going, I, you know,

822
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,180
I didn't fucking say anything
racist, but blah, blah, blah,

823
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:47,590
Blah and all this type of shit.
Right.

824
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:52,420
And then this random white guy is watching
it. He goes, yeah, what's a big deal?

825
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,050
He's like, this guy's an n word, net
guy's Whitey. I mean, it's a fight.

826
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:58,780
Who gives a fuck what you say? And I'm
just, I'm just thinking in my head like,

827
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:04,270
dude, they're not saying
he said that like, like,

828
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,940
but that is like,

829
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,380
that's how his fucking brain
process that information.

830
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,120
And it's, it's, I dunno,
it's, it's so fun.

831
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:21,680
It's depressing
cause you know what it is.

832
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:26,210
Everybody thinks they're as smart and
everybody thinks they have it figured out.

833
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,380
You know what I mean? Think about
when is the last time you, I mean,

834
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,600
sometimes your conscious gets to you,

835
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:37,440
but does your brain really ever say like,
uh,

836
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,600
I mean, it takes a lot to
fucking admit that you're wrong,

837
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,900
regardless of color, sex or anything.
They'd be like, you know what,

838
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,750
I shouldn't have done that.
I was wrong. I, you know,

839
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:52,950
I now realize how fucking ignorant
that takes a look into truly mean it.

840
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,550
Not to just get on the good side of
your wife against the, she'll bang here,

841
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,470
right? To truly fucking sincerely
mean it and then try to make a change.

842
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:05,040
It takes a fucking lot.
And, uh, for anybody.

843
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:11,190
So I dunno. So I've gone
through things like,

844
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,210
you know, if somebody does says that,
what do I do? Do I fucking confront them?

845
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:16,680
Okay.

846
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,520
Do I get into the fucking debate?
I've tried every fucking technique.

847
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,550
Do I get up and walk out every
fucking tactic? Nothing works.

848
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,940
Not that fucking works.
Um,

849
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,500
that is depressing.

850
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,830
So I try to avoid that social situation.

851
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,280
Maybe that's what I'll do in the future.
Maybe that's what I'll do in the future.

852
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,940
Uh,
anyways,

853
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,020
that was like a time over the f I don't
remember what the fuck I was when I was

854
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:52,040
in, I was in Durham, North Carolina, and
that fucking guy goes, you know, Bill,

855
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:56,840
I like you, you know, you're a good
person. You know, you don't bill. He goes,

856
00:49:56,841 --> 00:50:00,230
I like meet good people. And I
was like, Oh God, here it comes.

857
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,930
I like meeting good people.
He sees testing the waters,

858
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:07,580
he sticking his toe and you know,
Christian Good Christian people,

859
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,720
white people, and then boom,
the fucking Edward comes.

860
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,500
So that guy who headed off at
the pass is that you don't buy a,

861
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:20,140
I like being good people and I was
just like, Oh yeah, do you, you know,

862
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,040
I like meeting bad people who the
fuck doesn't like making good people.

863
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,320
And then he, then he shut up. Then you
shut up. And then he got really mad at me,

864
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,680
you know, when I was
talking about, you know,

865
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,110
I dunno like the Middle East or something
like that. And I was just going like,

866
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:36,820
dude, they in another lane
us. You know what I mean?

867
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,660
They've got a couple of crazy fucking
leaders and then everybody else is a bunch

868
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:43,930
of you and me walking around, they're
trying to get a sandwich, you know,

869
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,660
you and I were trying to get the fucking,
uh,

870
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,310
the NBA package and they're
trying to whatever fucking sport.

871
00:50:50,311 --> 00:50:53,320
But what sports are they into
over there? Soccer. Right.

872
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:57,790
Everybody's into the fucking soccer.
Um, anyways, so, yeah, I dunno.

873
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,620
I understand. You know, but, uh, I dunno.

874
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,480
I, I don't, I don't, I don't have any
fucking answers. I don't fucking know.

875
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,330
All right. Younger girlfriend,
not ready for marriage.

876
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:11,750
Okay.

877
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,410
Okay. Hi Bill. I'm a big fan of
yours and would like your advice.

878
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:16,970
I'm a 35 year old guy.

879
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,840
Okay.

880
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,560
From the Bronx dating a 20 year
old Japanese girl in Japan.

881
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,170
I love her a lot and want to marry her,

882
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:27,860
but she tells me she's not ready for
marriage and children yet and can't really

883
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:31,250
say if or when she'll be ready.
Yeah, it's cause she's 20

884
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:32,480
okay.

885
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,780
It was, I love her, but getting
married and having children,

886
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:38,740
it's very important to me. If I were
younger I would say, okay, no problem.

887
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,200
And just keep dating and
see if anything changes.

888
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:44,920
But at 35 I'm starting to feel pressure
to get married sooner rather than later.

889
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,240
That societal pressure. But I worry that
I'm getting too old to be a father. Well,

890
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:52,690
I just had one at 48, so, um,

891
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,060
Alec Baldwin's fucking knocking them out
in his 50s. He said, I'm okay right now,

892
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,780
but in five or 10 years I feel I might
not have enough energy to run around

893
00:52:01,781 --> 00:52:04,480
chasing little ones. And if she's
still not ready in a few years,

894
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:08,080
that would put me in a very difficult
position. You just think it's smart, sir.

895
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,600
I'm happier than I've ever been with her.

896
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:14,680
And happiness can be so fleeting that I
don't want to ruin it with what I have

897
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:19,210
with her, but at the same time, I can't
wait forever. What would I do? Um,

898
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,270
I would,
I would listen to a,

899
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,980
I would listen to logic.

900
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,773
All right.

901
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,500
I, I really think, you know,

902
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,360
most of the time, you know, if who's
dragging their feet to the altar,

903
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:43,730
it's usually the guy. Okay,
not the woman. Why would they?

904
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,710
For the most part,
generally speaking,

905
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:48,230
they're marrying somebody that
makes more money than them.

906
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,880
So there's no fear financially.
If you fucking,

907
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,920
you know,
they're not going to lose half the house.

908
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,230
They're going to get the whole house
and they're going to get a fucking check

909
00:52:57,231 --> 00:53:00,350
from you. That's basically what
the fuck happens. You know,

910
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,170
it's like the showcase showdown
at the end of the price is right.

911
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:06,110
And you're the guy that they go, hey,
thanks for playing and you just walk off.

912
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:08,390
And then everybody crowds
around the person that one,

913
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,660
that's usually the woman in marriage.
Okay.

914
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:14,270
And I don't hear any shit from women
because all you guys do is bitch that you

915
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:16,520
don't make as much money as men.
So what I'm saying,

916
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,560
cause if you're just going to say that's
not the fucking case than what he had

917
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:23,760
bitching about fucking equal pay for.
All right? Either you're making less a,

918
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:25,110
you're not.
All right.

919
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,700
So for you to sit there have been saying,
I love you.

920
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:33,990
I want to spend my life with you and
fucking have children with you and start a

921
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:38,991
family and live happily ever after for
her to say I'm not ready for that yet.

922
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:43,830
And I can't really say if or
when I will be ready. Yeah, Dude,

923
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,480
she's 20 years old. She has no idea
who the fuck she is. You're, you're,

924
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,960
you're fucking 15 years down the road,
you know who you are,

925
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:54,220
you know what you want,
and uh,

926
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,050
I don't think she's going to
figure that out with you. You know,

927
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,070
you're taking their best years away from
her when she should be out fucking seen,

928
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:04,320
figuring out what the
fuck she wants and you,

929
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:07,980
and your best years of cause.
Now you're ready.

930
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:12,030
So you need to go out and meet a fucking
mature woman. Who was it not mature.

931
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:14,550
I'm not saying this woman's immature,
she's not in, but she's fucking 20.

932
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:16,320
Okay.

933
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,230
All right. This is what happens.
This is what happens when you, when,

934
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:24,250
when there's that level of an age
difference at this age. Okay. Look,

935
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,150
if you were 45 and she was 35, she'd
be fucking, you know, pressure and you,

936
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,083
mmm,

937
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:36,250
I dunno dude. I would just hate for
her to at 23 to be like, you know, uh,

938
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:40,840
I don't, this isn't like what I want
and now you're 38 you push in for,

939
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:45,790
you don't want it. Then I think I
would, uh, pull the rip cord now,

940
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,983
you know,

941
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,620
that's what I would do. I
don't fucking know. I mean,

942
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,740
it's hard for me to tell you to fucking
break up with somebody over a paragraph

943
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:59,090
of information on a podcast as I sit
in a bed in the hotel room, isn't it?

944
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,360
So take all of that with a grain of salt.
All right. You know what I would do, sir?

945
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,740
I would ask you.
Good friends.

946
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,710
Ask you good friends with the fuck
they think because they know you.

947
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,820
And like she'd have to have a nice long
fucking distance phone call with you.

948
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:13,670
I guess you're in Japan right
now. I would do that. You know,

949
00:55:13,671 --> 00:55:15,710
maybe you get some friends into Japan.
I don't fucking know.

950
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,190
That's a big decision, but just
from that little information. Yeah,

951
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,790
I get out of it,
you know?

952
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,140
And I'm also saying don't do that cause
I don't fucking know you. All right?

953
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:25,650
Okay.

954
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,660
Jason's Christ bill. Could your waffle
anymore than that one? All right.

955
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:30,840
I dumped my girlfriend
and now I regret it.

956
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,510
Yeah.

957
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:36,860
Is this the followup song too? I kissed
a girl and I liked it. Um, hi bill.

958
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:40,040
I started watching your
podcast watching my podcast.

959
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,930
I don't know how you're doing that.
You mean listening to my iPod?

960
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,910
Kaz. Oh, this person is not from this
country or it doesn't speak English.

961
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:49,210
And he was, I'm going to read this right,
is the same way this person wrote it.

962
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,460
I started watching your podcasts since
few months because the best Romanian

963
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:58,060
standup comedians always said that they
listened to yours in their podcasts.

964
00:55:58,061 --> 00:55:59,350
Get the fuck Outta here.

965
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:03,350
Romanian comics.
Listen to this podcast.

966
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,360
Shout out to Romania.

967
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:07,843
Huh?

968
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,950
Is that where all the Gypsies Come?

969
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:14,120
The Richard Pryor's and George
Carlin's of fucking pickpocket hers.

970
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,230
I gotta tell you, man, they're fucking
amazing. They're pains in the asses,

971
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:23,160
but Jesus Christ can those fucking people
pick your pocket you almost like and

972
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,870
they leave. You can't find your
passport. You almost fucking applaud him.

973
00:56:25,871 --> 00:56:30,650
I don't know where you are, but that was
good. I had no idea. God bless you. Um,

974
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,740
I dunno if they come from Romania, the
Gypsies, Transylvania, that Gypsy stay.

975
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:40,480
Move around. Now about the
story, me and this girls,

976
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,960
we had a complicated too.
You've got a threesome.

977
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,340
He couldn't broke up with two girls.

978
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:50,500
I had a complicated story and I tried
six months to be what they are until I

979
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:53,950
finally succeeded.
So after one year and a half,

980
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:58,000
a very nice relationship, he
was giving it to her, of course,

981
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:01,570
with ups and downs before I
leaved to Germany to study,

982
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:06,571
I decided alone that will be
better for her if we split up.

983
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,680
So I dumped her and said to her
that we should remain friends.

984
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,770
My decision was because
I got scared of her love.

985
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,410
She would leave all of her
dreams and stuff only did
come with me and be with me.

986
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,490
And T to hear that at
19 years old is scary.

987
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,320
It's scary as shit. Uh, now after
nine months when the moving out,

988
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:34,180
euphoria has vanish, I now know that
I made a big mistake and I realized

989
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:39,230
how cunt I was to her.
I think you mean country,

990
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:45,590
uh, in the past month. So she moved
on, but we still kind of talk,

991
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:47,090
but I cannot sleep anymore.

992
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,050
I developed a little problem with
drinking alone and trying not to feel

993
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:55,130
something. A little advice
would be nice. Thank you.

994
00:57:55,131 --> 00:57:59,450
And all good for you and your family.
First of all,

995
00:57:59,451 --> 00:58:01,490
fuck can you did great with your English.

996
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,900
I knew exactly what the fuck you were
talking about. I could never do that.

997
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:07,880
Well I don't even know what you guys,

998
00:58:07,881 --> 00:58:12,881
what do you speak over there is it
gives a Calder Romanian tap pansy.

999
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:14,643
Um,

1000
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:15,850
okay

1001
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:19,800
dude, you're 19. You're going to
meet somebody else. I mean, um,

1002
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:24,320
on your way to finding the
person you're going to,

1003
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:28,040
you're going to be with you fuck up.
Like anything, any success story.

1004
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:31,640
You make mistakes and you learn
from them along the way. All right?

1005
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,890
If you really love her,
I mean this is what you could do.

1006
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,410
Call her up one time and just say,
listen,

1007
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,890
I just want you to know
that breaking up with you.

1008
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,980
What's the biggest mistake I've ever made?

1009
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,540
I've had a problem sleeping. I've been,
I've developed, I've been drinking,

1010
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:50,450
trying to forget and just
tell her why you did it.

1011
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,150
It just totally communicate with her and
see what, see what she says. All right?

1012
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:01,460
And you know, if she doesn't take you
back, you can live with that. Okay?

1013
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:05,840
The bottom line, dude, you fucking 19
years old, okay. Don't start drinking.

1014
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,210
Don't do, don't make the
mistakes I made. All right?

1015
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:13,280
You're in the prime of your fucking life.
Turning around. Wake up every morning.

1016
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:17,550
Have some positive thing that
you say to yourself. All right?

1017
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:22,230
It's simple as today's going
to be a great day. Alright?

1018
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,290
Fucked up that relationship
with so and so.

1019
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:27,950
But I forgive myself and I'm going to
go out that door and I'm going to be a

1020
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:31,100
fucking rail. Like, you know when
you can attract somebody else too.

1021
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,830
You go out there,

1022
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,710
have a good time and when you
meet a woman right that you like,

1023
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,000
just, just fucking be straight
up on. It's how you doing, man?

1024
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:44,780
I'm trying to be positive, trying to
be positive. I went through some shit.

1025
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,360
I'm trying to get over it and
I'm trying to be positive.

1026
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,650
What's going on with you there,
Cutie Pie. Start doing that.

1027
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:55,700
Don't fucking start drinking and being
a sad sack, you know, drinking again.

1028
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:59,840
Oh baby, I'm drinking again. All
right, that's it. But this is a good,

1029
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:01,130
this is going to be
good experience for you.

1030
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,320
You can learn how to
fucking open up as a guy,

1031
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,610
communicate your feelings and learn how
to fucking get closure with the woman

1032
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:11,360
that you broke up with or who knows.
It opens back up. Who knows? Right?

1033
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,440
And then also you learn how to not
make self-distribute learn how to pick

1034
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:17,750
yourself up off the fucking Mac.
Cause I'm a tell you right now,

1035
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:18,740
you're 19 years old.

1036
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:21,950
If you think this is the first time
you're going to get knocked on your ass in

1037
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:26,300
life, um, you're, you're
sadly mistaken. All right?

1038
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,300
You got to learn how to get back up again.

1039
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,590
So this is a great opportunity no
matter what. All right? So there you go.

1040
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:37,010
Grasshopper, take those positive words
and go help yourself a great fucking day.

1041
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:42,020
All right. How do you make friends
after turning 25 Oh, Jesus Christ.

1042
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:46,250
What do you mean? Just, I don't know.
Buy a round of drinks. He says, my man,

1043
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:50,600
double be no fun, Dude. That,
that dead, uh, old Billy.

1044
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:54,350
No fun is complete bullshit. I've been
having too much fun. I happen all right.

1045
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:57,110
And I've been having a problem
turning off the fun faucet,

1046
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:01,160
if you know what I mean. Um,
I'm struggling here. All right.

1047
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,100
There's always a reason.
There's always a reason. Oh,

1048
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:07,220
he just shut his special bump. Oh,
written fucking tomato pies. Bang.

1049
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:11,970
Oh, I'm on a fucking flight. And the guy
asked me if I want to drink, but Sally,

1050
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,090
all right, big fan. You may
have had this question before,

1051
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,620
but I've moved into a new town and I've
learned that I have no guy friends.

1052
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,340
I mean,
I'm plowing like crazy through these apps,

1053
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,640
but I miss just going to the bars with
the fellas. Okay. So, um, yeah, I'm an,

1054
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:33,380
I'm an old guy. So you're, you're on
these dating apps and you fucking,

1055
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,270
you motherfuckers,
man.

1056
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:36,910
Yeah.

1057
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,900
Good Lord. How fucking easy is it
to get laid? Jesus Christ. He goes,

1058
01:01:40,901 --> 01:01:43,540
I keep trying to arrange to
go out with guys some work,

1059
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,900
but they all commute in from
another town and have girlfriends.

1060
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:48,070
They need to tend to,

1061
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:52,210
I find myself going back to my hometown
a lot on the weekends to see my buds are

1062
01:01:52,211 --> 01:01:55,430
laying pipe with miscellaneous
chicks where I live now.

1063
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:01,240
So my very sad question is, how
does a guy make friends, chairs,

1064
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:05,170
uh, you poor baby, you just don't
their bag and all these chicks.

1065
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:07,480
You know what I would do?
I'd fucking hang out with them.

1066
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:08,860
Okay.

1067
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:12,220
I just started hanging out with
them. The fuck. Do you care?

1068
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:16,150
You can always find a fucking cruel
dopes to go watch a fucking game with.

1069
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:21,020
Um, you know what I would do? I don't,
I don't know. He said cheers so much.

1070
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:25,230
It's the assuming gifts fucking
somewhere over there and Great Britain.

1071
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,350
What do they say in Australia too?
I don't fucking know. Anyways.

1072
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:34,610
Um,
do you play sports?

1073
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,280
Go play some pickup hockey.
He'd go play some fucking softball.

1074
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,840
Go places to pick up soccer, football,
whatever the fuck you call it.

1075
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,750
I would do that. I would get
involved in some sort of an activity,

1076
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,690
a sports related. Um, if
you're into like, I don't know,

1077
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:53,120
you don't sound like you're in to a
comic con shit considering all the women.

1078
01:02:53,121 --> 01:02:56,480
You seem to be fucking so,
yeah, I would, I would, I dunno.

1079
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,940
I would do something like that.
Is there an APP for that?

1080
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:05,630
I have no idea. All right. What
time is it here? All right.

1081
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,840
Time for me to wrap this up. Uh, my
girlfriend doesn't appreciate me.

1082
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,400
Aw,

1083
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,340
but go for it.
Doesn't appreciate me.

1084
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,140
Ooh.
Um,

1085
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:21,550
hey Billy back fat.
I liked that one.

1086
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:27,220
Um, I'm a 21 year old guy. Currently
unemployed. Well, why the fuck? Yeah,

1087
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:29,260
you're a guy without a job.

1088
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:34,150
It's like being a woman without tits
and we went the fuck or a vagina.

1089
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:37,660
Yes. Women. That's what we look
at. You like. I'm sorry. We are,

1090
01:03:37,661 --> 01:03:41,500
we're fucking animals blamed God. That's
how we're wired. I'm a 21 year old guy,

1091
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:46,060
currently unemployed and I live with my
girlfriend and we've been together for a

1092
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:50,830
year and I'm, and I'm s oh,
a year and seven months now.

1093
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,480
Uh, recently, it seems like she
doesn't appreciate me anymore.

1094
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:59,830
Yesterday when she was at work, I made
her coffee, did the laundry for her,

1095
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,740
bought her some pizza,
and then picked her up.

1096
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:07,060
And all you heard that night was how I
didn't rinse the dishes enough before

1097
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:10,600
putting them in the dishwasher.
She doesn't act like this.

1098
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,960
Uh,
she doesn't act this way to anyone else.

1099
01:04:13,961 --> 01:04:16,180
And I feel like I can't do
anything right around her.

1100
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,020
Would love to hear your feedback and go
fuck yourself. Yeah, here's the deal.

1101
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,840
Here's the deal.
All right?

1102
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:26,620
And you'll never get a woman
to admit this, all right?

1103
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:30,010
But one of the great things
about them having a boyfriend,

1104
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,810
he said he's going to pay for shit.
He's going to take him out.

1105
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:38,230
He's going to buy or buyers stuff,
right?

1106
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:45,200
He's going to fucking, you know,
your job as a man is to provide,

1107
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:49,900
okay. A woman, you know, after you give,

1108
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:54,680
you push her off the dock with you Johnson
there, she can make a fucking baby,

1109
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:56,163
all right?

1110
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:01,280
And then immediately just be the greatest
fucking mom and it's fucking magical

1111
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:03,650
to watch.
What can we do?

1112
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,780
We pick up heavy shit that they can't
pick up and we go out and we earn a

1113
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:12,020
living. Now here's the thing, as a man,

1114
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:15,950
the second you're sitting there and you
don't have a fucking job, and she does,

1115
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:20,740
and now she gets to feel
what it's like to be a man,

1116
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:24,730
which is you fucking come home,
right?

1117
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,690
You've busted your ass all day.
You know, if you're fucking young,

1118
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:32,020
you don't have your dream job yet unless
you Justin Bieber or somebody like that

1119
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:35,920
or you made it for professional
sports. Generally speaking, your 20s,

1120
01:05:35,921 --> 01:05:38,180
just the struggle of the dream Pope.

1121
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:42,520
And it comes true at some point in your
it thirties so she's coming home and

1122
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:46,080
she's seeing you sitting there
like a little fucking homemaker.

1123
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,210
And you know every guy sometimes you know
when you come home and you look at you,

1124
01:05:50,211 --> 01:05:51,780
you know,
if your wife stays at home,

1125
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,490
your girlfriend stays at
home and you just look at us.

1126
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:57,070
But she would not have any kids. It's
like, what the fuck did you do all day?

1127
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:58,370
Yeah,

1128
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,970
it's like every Saturday for Yo,
what the fuck?

1129
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:06,350
You know? But at the end of the day,
like getting up and look at me, she's,

1130
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:09,110
you know, she's, she's fucking
beautiful. She's bagging me, you know,

1131
01:06:09,111 --> 01:06:13,160
all that shit that guys, I
think of reporting. But for
women, you got to provide,

1132
01:06:13,161 --> 01:06:14,990
dude, you got to get a
fucking job. You want,

1133
01:06:14,991 --> 01:06:16,970
you want your girlfriend to
fucking respect you again.

1134
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:18,500
You got to get a fucking job.

1135
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:19,830
Okay,

1136
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,330
you got to start bringing home money.

1137
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,073
That's it.

1138
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,340
That's it.
See what I do is I actually,

1139
01:06:25,341 --> 01:06:28,340
I bring home money and I do
the fucking dishes, you know?

1140
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:33,080
So then whenever my wife gives me shit, I
could be like, what? What is the problem?

1141
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,360
Okay. I'm like, fucking Babe Ruth here.

1142
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,460
I'm hitting home runs and
I'm pitching a no hitter.

1143
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,510
What the fuck else do you want?
What is the problem?

1144
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:45,560
So you that you know why I can say that?
Because I have a fucking job.

1145
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:49,670
You don't have a job, sir.
So no matter what the fuck
you do, her problem with you.

1146
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,650
It's not that he didn't
rinse the shit off.

1147
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:55,280
It's not that you did this wrong or
you would drive it too fucking fast.

1148
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,760
It's the fact that when you guys
go out to get a meatball sub,

1149
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:02,840
she has to pay for it, you know? Yeah.

1150
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,990
You want to see the all their feminism
go right out the fucking window.

1151
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:08,810
You stay home.
You'd be Mr Mom.

1152
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,080
That's what happened here,
sir. What happened here, sir,

1153
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,920
is you stopped being a man to her.
The second you don't have a job,

1154
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:23,230
when you're with a woman, you immediately
become like this fucking 20, 25, 30,

1155
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:27,580
35 40 year old fucking teenager.
They look at you like you're a child.

1156
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:29,743
MMM.

1157
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:36,040
That's it. So you need to get
a fucking job. Am I might,

1158
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,300
uh, ladies, I, am I wrong? I'm
speaking for you here. Okay.

1159
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:41,390
If you think of fucking run just right
into the podcast and I read your opinions

1160
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:44,060
and then I'll make fun of
myself. All right? Okay.

1161
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,860
I got to get out of this fucking hotel.

1162
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,440
MMM.

1163
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:51,120
That's a podcast. Go fuck
yourselves. I'll check in on you.

1164
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:52,670
And,
uh,

1165
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,720
a dark day and uh, you
know, I'm a, you know,

1166
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:58,150
after all that fucking depressing
shit I saw in Charlottesville,

1167
01:07:58,151 --> 01:08:00,670
I'm going to try to be, and I'm going to,
I'm be fucking nice to everybody today.

1168
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,090
All right.

1169
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,760
I'm going to try to go on a nice
little run up being nice to everybody.

1170
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,960
Go out of my fucking way to not be a cunt,
okay.

1171
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:12,030
To be a little more empathetic as I just
trashed women and spoke about them in a

1172
01:08:12,031 --> 01:08:14,350
nice big generalized way.

1173
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:19,070
I'm basically a fucking hypocrite and I'm
for life can stand why you guys listen

1174
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,690
to me. Go Fuck Yourself.
I'll see you Thursday.
