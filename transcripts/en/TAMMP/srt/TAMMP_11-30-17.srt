1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,740
Hey, what's going on? Is Bill burn

Just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,950
Duda Duda Hey, guess what? What?

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,010
I uh, I am fucking on it this
year when it comes to Christmas.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,030
Hey, Christmas. Go Fuck
Yourself. That's what I'm saying.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,520
I'm talking all kinds of shit.
I'm backing up.

8
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,830
I'm wagging my fucking
head at your Christmas.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,790
I'm sorry. I'm just excited. I got all my
shit wrapped and I shipped it out that,

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,770
hey,
fuck you over.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,653
Over.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,140
That's it. All you need to do
is get a pair of Jordans, right?

13
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,660
Whatever the fuck verse he says
in it and that's it. It's over.

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,000
The greatest fucking feeling ever
this holiday is like, you know,

15
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:59,460
when you become an adult, it's dreadful.
It's like, Oh fuck man, I gotta you know,

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,070
I got to bring the kid over here.
I gotta fucking get this person something.

17
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:07,960
Oh Jesus, what do I gotta get this guy
a calendar or something. I got a show.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,910
I got to show him how much I care about
is stories that have no fucking point.

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,773
You know,

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,320
God at least get him a stocking stuffer
for how many minutes of my life did he

21
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:20,340
wastes this year. Just the, the, the, the,

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,640
the fucking stress of that.
Um, I gotta tell you something,

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,860
buying the things and wrapping him,

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,440
slapping a name on them and then
once you mail that fucking thing,

25
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,960
it's like a high, heavy, like runners
talk about like runner's high,

26
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,370
you know,

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,980
which is hilarious because if you look
at the look on their face when they're

28
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:41,260
running, it does not look like
they're enjoying themselves.

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,650
Every person I've ever seen jogging
down the street, like not everyone,

30
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,580
but most of them,
they look like they should acquit.

31
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,570
Like two miles ago they'll
lean into one side.

32
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:52,690
They kind of got that fucking stroke mouth
going. You're not, they'll fucking one.

33
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,810
It's like to have just enough already
enough. We get it. We get it. We get it.

34
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:02,940
You're a, you're, you're, you're a
fitness fucking group guru. Slowdown.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,870
Walk Goldman at a Taco stand. All right.
Get yourself a fucking Taco or something.

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,860
All right. Just relax. Um,

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,020
who do you hate more joggers
of bike riders? Yeah.

38
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,800
Who Do you hate more joggers
of bike riders? Neither.

39
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:21,340
I like everybody on the poverty of
force that balances out your life.

40
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,780
Get the hell out of my office.

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,840
And you crushed on the podcast.
Let's see if you've got another one in.

42
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:32,710
You don't hit me. I gotta go. I gotta go
to the gym by you're going to the gym.

43
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:37,290
What for all Hollywood? You're trying
to get you abs going for 2018 yeah,

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,490
a beefcake.
Alright,

45
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,830
bye. Um, oh wait.

46
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh Jesus. The anticlimactic. Then
you've got to come back. Come on.

47
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:54,370
Give me a kiss goodbye. Let me kiss
goodbye now. Actually, you know what?

48
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,740
Give it to me when a gum, when you
come home. All right, I'll see.

49
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,660
[inaudible] gross. Oh, I got all the tags.

50
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:06,640
Knee up for the gifts and stuff.
Sarah's. Yup. And I try to make your Nia,

51
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,450
when I said from uncle bill and Antione,

52
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,500
I try to make it look like
your handwriting, but it
clearly looks like mine.

53
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,030
It doesn't need to be.

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,570
Plus I'm left handed so it's smudge to
cross and I forgot to sign your name to

55
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,820
the card. The one that said
how much we care about them.

56
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,980
It's the second time I've done that.
You are the worse.

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,140
There's going to be a lot
of Hosta. I didn't do that
to you. You No, I'm kidding.

58
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,400
Come back please.
Um,

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,650
the fucking shit that women are into.
It was just, you know, she got a car.

60
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,590
Did sign my name to, what
about you? All right.

61
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,100
How could you do that?
Everybody's getting sick care.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,660
No, they're not. They
have lives. Um, anyways,

63
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,100
I got the shit fucking rap.
I got,

64
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,930
I got like one more thing to get my laugh
and have all of that fucking wrapped.

65
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,060
All right. And I just see, hey, you go,
alright, here you go. Leave me alone.

66
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,840
And then I'm gonna I got,
I'm like eloquently come off the wagon.

67
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm still on the wagon. I
got 15 weeks in. All right.

68
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,270
I'm already a third of the year
in 26 weeks is half a year,

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,440
but that takes me into February and
I'm going to the rose bowl so that,

70
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,730
that's the next tough one.

71
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,410
That's the next hurdle I have to get
past is if I could somehow go to the rose

72
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:28,390
bowl and not get all fucked up,
which I've done before. I've done it.

73
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,960
I don't think I've done a couple of
times. I've done the Rosebowl sober. Um,

74
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,880
I don't know what, but, uh, I'm
actually, I was thinking the other night,

75
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,630
like when I come back to drinking,
all right,

76
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,490
when we rekindle our relationship,
you know, like you have a c,

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,290
there was a particular person out here in
Hollywood, had an abusive relationship.

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,770
Skye was beating the shit out of her and
stuff, and then she went back to him,

79
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,950
you know, being like, no,
we fixed it this time.

80
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,290
And I remember the talk show
hosts were like going like,

81
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,840
are you sure you know what you're doing?
This is me going back to boots. Um,

82
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,550
with my little barbed wire tattoo.
Um,

83
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,330
I think I'm just going
to go straight to heroin.

84
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,310
Like I for some reason feel
like I can handle it at my age,

85
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,740
you know,
cause I know how stupid it is to do.

86
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:18,130
I would just do it like one time and
just be sitting there like right in the

87
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:22,010
living room to just don't, don't have
the shame that most junkies have.

88
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,400
You just sit down with your
family and just say, listen,

89
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,020
this is something that I want to try.

90
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,910
I'm just going to do it once and I would
appreciate it if you guys would hang

91
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:35,770
out during my entire high and make sure
that I don't tip over and bust my head

92
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:39,250
open on the coffee table with ava.
We have the kid proof things around it.

93
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:43,000
It'd be actually a lot of that kid proof
shit becomes junky proof after a while.

94
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:47,230
You know, I'm, I'm kidding. And
I'm not making light of the, uh,

95
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,790
nationwide heroin epidemic,

96
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,630
but we all know that the nationwide heroin
epidemic is not the biggest story in

97
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,930
the country right now.
That's not the biggest story.

98
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,010
It's not that they've poisoned our food
supply fellow Americans. It's not that.

99
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,590
It's not that after all the protests is
still going to put that fucking pipeline

100
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,570
and it's not that. What
is the biggest story? Huh?

101
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,740
Matt Lauer buying a fucking Dildo
for the stand in weather person.

102
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,390
It's not that

103
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,390
having a president who's out of his fuck.
Nate's not debt.

104
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,740
The biggest story in the United States
of America right now is Eli Manning is

105
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:36,171
being sat on Sunday and it's 210 game
streak is coming to a close and all of New

106
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,230
York shut down.
They couldn't believe that Alicia Manning,

107
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,700
I didn't know his name was Alicia.

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,120
I have never seen such a
fucking ridiculous reaction
while ignoring real fucking

109
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:52,854
problems.

110
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,620
There's like 30,000 fucking tornadoes or
whatever the fuck we had. Hurricanes, Eh,

111
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,990
have fuck all that Miami is.
Give me on the water,

112
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,850
like delay the fucking texts that
I got from New York sports fans,

113
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,530
my friends, like the level that they
were having a fucking meltdown, you know,

114
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,750
fuck the roper dope that's going on in
the Middle East right now where you got

115
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:19,751
to fucking band a fucking 3,500 nitwits
bankrupting a billion dollar company is

116
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:24,840
they got a bag of rocks and we're flying
f eighteens, Adam blowing all our cash.

117
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,640
Fuck all of that.

118
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,450
Eli Manning is being sat on Sunday.

119
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,500
I got a buddy money.
He flipped out so bad.

120
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:38,250
He's actually betting against the
giants. It's like, dude, if Gino sucks,

121
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:42,210
which I don't think he's going to,
no one knows how good Geno Smith is.

122
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,440
He played on the jets.

123
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,270
No one knows how good anybody is when
they play for the jets. Did the jets.

124
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,380
Sorry everybody out in Queens. But you
know there's an element of truth to that.

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,100
Okay? The patriots used to
be like that. All right,

126
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,480
so there is hope for you guys.

127
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,200
God knows bill Bellacheck is 70 years
old and we all saw Tom Brady's try to

128
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:03,480
recover that bad snap the last week.
Right.

129
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,600
You saw when he was running after
that thing, he looked as age.

130
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,750
He looked like a guy who
forgot to set as parking brake.

131
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:13,320
It was hobbling after his fucking
car and then realize like,

132
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm not going to break my leg.
I don't fuck it.

133
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:19,530
I got insurance on this car and
it just flopped on the ground. Um,

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,620
if Geno Smith shits the bed,

135
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,620
Eli is going to be back
in the second quarter.

136
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,500
And by the way,
this happens to every quarterback,

137
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,430
no matter how good they were, no matter
how good of a class act, they weren't.

138
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,070
This happens to it. But what the
fuck happened to Peyton Manic?

139
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,590
Okay.

140
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,590
After all those years of standing there
with at least 19 inches of his 42 inch

141
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,860
neck exposed between his
helmet and his shoulder pads,

142
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,750
it finally fucking gave out.

143
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,350
And what did that fucking Guy Jim or say,

144
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,150
okay.
Ah,

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,640
the fucking national enquirer
of fucking sports owners.

146
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,440
He turned his fucking
back on him. Okay. It.

147
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,560
Peyton Manning, he went to fucking eastern
Europe. He went to Transylvania, right?

148
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:12,510
And he got fucking child's blood pumped
into his fucking or whatever the hell it

149
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,580
virgin blood pumped into his fucking neck.

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,970
And he comes back to Jim or say it says
[inaudible] [inaudible] right. Whatever.

151
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,240
That whenever the fuck he talks,

152
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,330
why don't you put me in
this week? Whatever the fuck
he said to them, you know,

153
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:30,800
probably made more money doing that
and then it'll put water right.

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,140
What did Jim or say say he said Peyton,
with all due respect,

155
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,770
fuck you and your fucking
three feet and neck.

156
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,180
We'll move on on what tank and the rest
of this season so we can get Andrew Luck.

157
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,160
That's what the fuck happened. Look
what happened to Brett five rhe right.

158
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,440
Be fucker. He actually had to
go to the jets. Eli Manning,

159
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,210
all these guy with his
quiver and bottom lip.

160
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:01,830
All he's gotta do is sit on the fucking
bench for a couple of place. That's it.

161
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,590
It's all you got to do.
Everybody losing their fucking minds.

162
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,930
How could they go this?

163
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:11,300
How could they do the exact same fucking
thing that they'd done to everybody?

164
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:15,380
I don't remember the end of Derek Jeter
as career when all those sports writers

165
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,440
were fucking bitching about him
saying he's a, he's costing the team.

166
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:21,110
He's too fucking old.
Should they move him over to first base?

167
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,410
This happens to everybody.
You know?

168
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,240
You don't think that
talking about me right now?

169
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,640
Yeah,

170
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,320
the way I'm fucking look in these days.

171
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,560
I have like three friends of
mine that are are, I love them.

172
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,150
They're the biggest New York fans ever
and I got like fucking phonebook level

173
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:47,560
texts about what was going. You think
it's going to end pretty with Tom Brady?

174
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:52,561
This guy wants to play the least like 60
it's some point or fucking Bob Kraft is

175
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:58,450
going to have to sit down and be
like, Tom, it's you're too old.

176
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,390
I mean look at yet you still
have a Beatle mania haircut.

177
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,090
What fucking year did
you come in the league?

178
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,800
You got to fucking Moe Howard haircut
with the fucking part. I mean,

179
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,620
I don't even know what to tell fucking
Bill Clinton was still president when you

180
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:19,390
came in.
MMM.

181
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,030
Yeah.

182
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,840
I Dunno what to tell you. This happens to
every, but yeah, it's obviously a shame.

183
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,530
Eli's fucking great. Uh, I gotta tell you,

184
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:33,300
it sucks is a patriots fan watching
the giants just fucking dismantle and I

185
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:37,080
wanted one more crack at them.
We had nothing to lose.

186
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,940
You already kicked our ass fucking twice.

187
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,420
We'll come back like tex
Cobb for a third one.

188
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,340
And I was loving and there would always
be an asterick even if the giants made

189
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,830
the Superbowl. And even if with the
Patriots made the Superbowl this year,

190
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:55,810
if they came back without Tom
Kauflin and we won that one,

191
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:58,990
that still would be at, at, that
still wouldn't be the same. They went.

192
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:02,830
That's the level of respect that I have
for fucking the giants organization.

193
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:07,570
Tom Kauflin and Eli, Alicia Manning. I'm
just breaking your balls. New York fence.

194
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,190
I know. It sucks. You know what?

195
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:12,880
It really is all you guys flipping out
and you're acting like you love Eli

196
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,571
Manning,
but you really are,

197
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:18,070
is you're a bunch of selfish cons
because watching eli gets benched is just

198
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,430
reminding you of how fucking old you're
getting and now we're all going to die.

199
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,390
It reminds you of your own mortality.
So rather than deal with that,

200
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,200
you call it sports shows,
losing your fucking voice,

201
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,020
you know,

202
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,680
and meanwhile we're fucking blown $1
billion a month fighting people who have

203
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:39,430
sling shots in a bag of
dynamite. Um, anyway,

204
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,760
um, I swear to God, if I was running,
this is how I would handle isis.

205
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,860
I would just fucking
take, I would, I would,

206
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,630
whoever those fucking gamers are that
at got to play on the giant TV screen in

207
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:53,830
Dallas Cowboys Stadium.

208
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,140
If you're good enough to do those
guys who had those drone races in,

209
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:01,660
in that stadium,
that would be my defense against Isis,

210
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,560
some intelligence and that I have those
fuckers sitting in cowboys stadium when

211
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:10,120
the cowboys didn't have a game and I
just have them flying around, you know,

212
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:14,530
blowing up at jungle Jim's. I mean,
that's how I would handle it. Okay.

213
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:19,360
And considering I haven't even physical
fiscally researched this on any level.

214
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,660
I haven't talked to anybody who's even
remotely informed about what's going on

215
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,594
over there.

216
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,770
The fact that I did this in my
own self contained think tank,

217
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,670
I cannot even begin to describe to
you how much this makes sense to me.

218
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,280
You know, come on dude, you got,

219
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:39,310
you don't sit by yourself sometimes
and just start solving all the world's

220
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:43,030
problems. You start walking
around your house whispering,

221
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,450
pretending you're getting interviewed by
Oprah. Come on. We all do this though. We

222
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,660
Oprah sitting across from you. Do
you consider yourself a hero? Um,

223
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,240
is you sitting there muttering to yourself
and then somehow you come into your

224
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:57,410
fucking present,

225
00:13:57,411 --> 00:14:00,480
need you to sit in there scrubbing like
a fucking old rice checkoff a bowl.

226
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,070
Okay.

227
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,410
And you have,

228
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,690
let's split second of just really stepping
outside of yourself and being like,

229
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:08,640
well I'm really,
I'm a fucking crazy person.

230
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,040
Yeah.

231
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,650
And then all of a sudden the front door
opens and you family walks in and you'd

232
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,840
go right back into character
and they have no idea.

233
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,040
Yeah.

234
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,010
Could you stand in there with this
phony smile and awareness sweater?

235
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm sorry. Anyways, a
happy trails. Matt Lauer,

236
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,140
you know, you did a hell of a job waking
everybody up, uh, for the last 20 years.

237
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,540
And uh, hey, you got a little sideways.

238
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,210
How do you buy a sex toy for somebody
you work with and then write a letter?

239
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,130
I mean, Jesus for, what?

240
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:50,080
Did she just walk around with a fucking
neon sign around your Goddamn neck?

241
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:50,960
I swear to God.

242
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,500
These people get to successful and they
just like wanting to sabotage their own

243
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,800
fucking career. Oh. Although
maybe he's just like old school.

244
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,740
He came in, he came in the
league when that we'll all
right. He was, I don't know.

245
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,220
Okay.

246
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,780
When you could do that,

247
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,140
cause you gotta think when
he first started buying
like fucking shit like that.

248
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,430
If it was the late nineties, when you
think about the cell phone technology,

249
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:17,340
texting didn't even exist. There was
none of that shit. There was no Facebook,

250
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:19,890
there was nothing.
Um,

251
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,120
tell me what could that one poor woman do?
Reg Run off a bunch of copies,

252
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:30,290
put them on telephone poles.
It just so you know,

253
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,440
and then he just had my assistant
run out and tear him down.

254
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,460
Matt Lauer screaming from the window.
I said turn right.

255
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,630
Um,
I dunno.

256
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,210
I Dunno. Anyways, I'm
going to be in New Mexico,

257
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,390
in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
south west part of the state. Um,

258
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,570
he's part of the country and I'm
going to be an Arizona this weekend.

259
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,780
Come on down. I mean, you
have to route 66 casino.

260
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:02,460
Where the fuck am I going to
be in Arizona? I like Arizona.

261
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,780
Doodah Doodah because it's only an hour.
Oh,

262
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,530
wave on a southwest flight
again on the fucking plane.

263
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,420
I listened to their stupid jokes.

264
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,140
Then they say we're beginning
our initial [inaudible]

265
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,370
please raise all your tray tables
in your seats. Please welcome.

266
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,250
This fucking thing isn't loading.
Why is my signal for work?

267
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,100
Okay?

268
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,780
Oh, Jesus Christ. Well, we'll get
back to this, by the way, by the way.

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,850
This is the degenerate tour.
Um,

287
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,370
and then on December 10th
I just added this date.

288
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,350
I'm going to be at the Arlington
Theater in Santa Barbara, California.

289
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,820
All right. Santa Barbara.
Speaking of Oprah Winfrey,

290
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,440
one of her giant houses is update.
Maybe she'll show up to the show. Um,

291
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,440
I'm going to be up there and then December
14th will be at the hard rock live in

292
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:59,360
Hollywood, Florida in December 16th,
Bob Carr Theater in Orlando, Florida.

293
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:03,510
And on the 15th, I'm going to them magic.
I got to get some tickets for that,

294
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:07,820
by the way. I got to figure out what
the fuck I'm doing over there. Um,

295
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,850
anyways, so when I read some
advertising here, what else did I want?

296
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:14,310
All my ribs are feeling better in
case you were asking in case you were

297
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,144
wondering.

298
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,070
I got Mizzou and I'm trying
to lay off the drums.

299
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,540
I'm trying. Um, did, I mentioned that I'm
building a drum room finally in my house.

300
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,230
I've had it. I've had it with having
to drive to go to my fucking drums.

301
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,590
Just having a kid now you got to wait
till they take a nap and then you run out

302
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,830
there and for fucking 20 minutes
to an hour and six minutes,

303
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,520
he play fucking drums with the
little kid monitor there. Right.

304
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,180
So you can see when she gets up,
then they go back.

305
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:45,240
And that's how I'm going to do
it. That's, that's my game plan.

306
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,960
Um, you know what? He actually did,

307
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,961
I have almost every modern
drummer from the 1980s and um,

308
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,250
I was looking at him the other day and uh,

309
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,750
I saw that old Steve Jordan one that
they didn't like 86 or 85 where a Dave

310
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,000
Garibaldi broke down his ghost notes and
all that shit for messing with the kid.

311
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:13,950
I got to get that down. I got to learn
that shit. That's my next fucking goal.

312
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,290
All right.
My goal isn't to become a better person.

313
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,550
My goal is to recreate what was already
created and then hope that somebody

314
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:24,330
notices and is impressed by me.
Um, all right, let's read a,

315
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,650
We got four reeds here today.

316
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:28,920
Can you guys hang in here and listen
to me read out loud for the next few

317
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,650
minutes? Okay. If you think the bullshit
I was saying was remotely amusing music,

318
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:32,850
this part will be hilarious.

319
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,410
We're exposed really my level
of intellect. All right.

320
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,240
Tipsy elves,
everybody.

321
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,700
Everyone needs an ugly Christmas
sweater this time of year.

other products you saw on the website.

325
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,000
I've yet to go on it.
I don't know anything about these.

326
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:59,150
I know that hipsters love this
shit. Hey hipsters. Here we go.

327
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,800
Tipsy elves has hundreds of Christmas
sweater designs that are like nothing

328
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,350
you've seen before. This is where
they show my, I show my age.

329
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,670
I don't think Christmas sweaters are ugly.
I think they're very festive. Uh, the,

330
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,690
it's like wearing an oriental rug
that has like snowmen on it. Um,

331
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,250
they're not for the faint of heart.

332
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:22,020
Be The life of the Party with
Hilarious Leigh or reverent designs.

333
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,240
All right,

I sit there saying I'm remotely amusing
and these kinds have the balls to come

337
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:36,270

You know,

338
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:39,110

level fucking special. Alright,

00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:50,950
These guys are definitely bringing it.
What the fuck?

342
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,330
Uh,
oh my God.

343
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:56,890
Okay.

344
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,800
They got an Obama one that
says miss me yet on the back,

345
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,100
they should have all his drone attack
with a list of all the people who weren't

346
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:08,020
terrorists. Can we fucking be balanced
in this country? Jesus fucking Christ.

347
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:11,020
I don't understand this hero
worship of that guy. I really don't.

348
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,290
What did he do? You know what
the best thing about Obama was?

349
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,450
He could deliver a fucking speech,
you know?

350
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,540
And I don't even know how good he was
considering he was in between Bush and

351
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,670
fucking trumps. So that's
really like, you know,

352
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:28,160
that's really setting the bar for
like low. He, he for me one, she,

353
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,730
you're not going to fool me again.
I mean, how do you not follow that?

354
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,710
And then I don't know what this other guy,
but Donald Trump is so fucking bad. He,

355
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,610
I actually had this thought the other day.
Well thank God Mike Pence is in there.

356
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,800
Um, okay, I've got to give it up

359
00:21:57,661 --> 00:22:01,740
I am actually digging
the soup. Um, anyways,

360

of the latest guy who got fucking ousted
out of his career for buying sex toys.

365

Talk about how every man looks
better in a suit. You know, guys,

379
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:24,350
when I sit on the promenade checking
out who's going to be my next boyfriend,

380
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,640
I have to admit I am,

381
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,320
I gravitate to a guy's junk
that's in a three piece suit.

382
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,010
I don't know what it is. I just feel like

00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:34,940

monogram and more in dope.

387
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:50,471
CIDO has been featured in major
publications including Gq,

388
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,310
Forbes, and the fat. I
think douchebags read Gq.

389
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,570
Don't take what kind of an asshole has
that kind of fucking time to pick out.

390
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,490
Like the perfect pen and pencil set.

391
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,850
There's what you write out your fucking,
you know, $64 to the electric company,

392
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,130

international spy but isn't one,
you know,

397
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,160
it just kind of fucking old people
out of their pension. I'm sorry.

398
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,640
Anyways,

Me On ds me on d is why are
we fighting these doses?

412
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:23,420
But Dude, dude to brds
Biondi you go. I did.

413
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,120
I fucking pick dudes.
I've been Robin lately on this song.

414
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,860
Why do I keep doing? I got to pick up
easier word to rhyme with that. I'm,

415
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:34,400
I'm been just been off my game lately.
You know,

416
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,530
Mandy's Mandy's Isis is on a jungle
gym do to do to me undies. Mondays.

417
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,610
We can beat him with the Slim Jim.

418
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,750
Why go down that road bill?

419
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:50,440
Every year millions of people receive the
least like gift of all time, underwear,

420
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,390
underwear, right? Even if you get your
wife some sexy underwear, that's kind,

421
00:25:56,391 --> 00:26:00,460
it's kind of a gross gift, isn't it?
I guess on some level she's psyched.

422
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:03,640
You're still attractive, but you know
what you really are saying, you know, oh,

423
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:07,030
come on. You know, what are you
saying? You know what I mean?

424
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,760
I'm surprised feminists haven't
brought that up. Lingerie is slavery.

425
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,620
Um,

426
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,060
but we still give it to our families
and our loved ones who just wanted,

427
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,440
isn't that a weird sentence
to just read out a contest,

428
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,880
but we still give it to our families and
our loved ones who just don't want it.

429
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,260
It's kind of rapey. Uh, but maybe it's
not that underwear is the problem.

430
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,600
It's the kind of underwear.

431
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,290
Let me tell you about me undies be Andy's

Dooby dooby do is fucking
here with movement watches.

443
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:18,510
You can skip the crowds,
you know,

444
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,090
standing behind that
woman with her white ass.

445
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,260
So anything worse than a wide flat
ass with no signage on it, you know,

446
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:28,440
at least you could do is fucking,
you know, rent it out, right?

447
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,900
We'll be back with ASCE shaming.

448
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,210
You could skip the crowds and standing
in crazy lines and find a gift they'll

449
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:40,140
love at prices that beat
department stores movement watches.

450
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:44,670
Start at just 95 bucks.
All right?

451
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,540
Just throw it in a stocking handed
to the person. Get on with your life.

452
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,350
Put some bourbon in your eggnog.

453
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,790
You had done at 95 bucks
at a department store.

454
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,990
You're looking at four to 500 bucks.
Sorry. Moving watches at just 95 bucks.

455
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:00,930
Edit a department store.
You're looking at four to 500 bucks,

456
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,550
okay?

457
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,970
Uh,
for this kind of a watch,

458
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:05,980
because you can get about what you
get to watch for like 95 bucks.

459
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:10,150
But it's like a fucking Timex movement
figured out that by selling online,

460
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,940
they were able to cut out the
middleman and retail markup,

461
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,870
providing the best possible price.

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,000

it? I think that's like 28 minutes.

471
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,470
Um, yeah, I'm going to
try, you know something.

472
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,540
I'm going to try to get out
and do some standup tonight.

473
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:02,660
I think I'm going to do that cause I
got some gigs the next couple of nights.

474
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,330
Right? Go out there, shake
the fucking dust off.

475
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,740
I've been in the edit room almost every
night of this week. Okay. Only two nights,

476
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:13,640
but it felt like every night with my add.
Um,

477
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,540
we are currently editing season
three of f is for family.

478
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,310
Um, I don't know when it's going to be.
It's going to be out later on next year.

479
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,080
Uh, that's how it works. Animation.
It's a very slow process. But, um,

480
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,360
I'm really loving how this
season is coming together
and I'm hoping you guys are

481
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:33,620
too.
And if you don't,

482
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,030
then I guess we won't get a season
four and if we don't get a season four,

483
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:42,880
I will be sad. But I also have a lot of
free time, so it's one of those deals.

484
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,980
So who knows,
who knows what happens there.

485
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:48,370
Maybe I'll just take the show and just
start fucking putting it up on my website.

486
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,280
Maybe I'll do something like that.
That would be stupid building.

487
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:53,800
You have to finance it
yourself and you'd go bankrupt.

488
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:57,430
Just fucking watch season three. So I
could stay with my cushy deal at Netflix.

489
00:29:57,431 --> 00:30:01,660
Can you do that for me? If not, can you
go to the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit?

490
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,690
Uh, I'll be announcing more
special guests as we go.

491
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,050
We might have a surprise guest at night.
We're reaching out to some people.

492
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,290
We'll see what happens. Um,
it's always a great night.

493
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:14,350
We always tell Patrice stories,
we'd give each other shit and uh,

494
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,510
it's obviously for a great
cause. Okay. That's it.

495
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:20,920
Please enjoy the music as we transition
into a, an old school Thursday afternoon,

496
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:24,730
just before Friday, Monday morning podcast
from a Thursday from, I don't know,

497
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,050
years gone by or possibly earlier
this year. I have no idea. That's it.

498
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:33,430
Have a wonderful weekend.
You can't and I will.

499
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,540
I will talk to you on Monday.

500
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,453
Okay.

501
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,630
Same.

502
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,723
We break

503
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,553
other,

504
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,680
there's this youtube video that we go.

505
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,970
Bill Burr was telling us that he found
a fine video club called best, uh,

506
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:55,010
best wrestling Promo ever starring. This
guy jumped at Jeff Farmer. I'm judging,

507
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:57,170
I'm guessing that it's from like the 80s,

508
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,900
and this is before Vince
Mcmahon sewed everything up.

509
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:04,190
So it's an independent wrestling thing.
I don't know. I don't know where at,

510
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:09,210
but this guy is legit. So basically what
it is, is this guy jumping Jeff Farmer.

511
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:11,920
He's got, you know, he's going to promote
your show. Then Jeff Farmer jumping,

512
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,501
Jeff Farmer,

513
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:15,890
he's going to promote his big wrestling
match coming up on the Saturday.

514
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,910
He's going to do the ric flair thing.
I'll read something.

515
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,060
He's supposed to be doing that shit
and eat. It. Might have a little, uh,

516
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,590
a little bit of a tough, tough time.
We've all been spoiled by the, uh,

517
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,180
nurse of the wrestlers and, uh, how,

518
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,340
how they're able to rock the mic and
really get on there and ad Lib and talk.

519
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,770
And, uh, this guy apparently
doesn't have the skills.

520
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,430
He's still in the development phase.
I'm not going to judge his entire career.

521
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,280
Right. He got salmon here.
He's a wrestling expert.

522
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,630
Sam as an expert. I mean, yeah,

523
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,360
it will really come running down
the hall with those floppy feet.

524
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,110
We've got to promote that. Kevin Smith's
calling the show today too. Oh yeah.

525
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,500
Show just keeps getting better and better.
Oh my God.

526
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,330
He tweeted a while ago that he's,
he's sleeping on his phone right now,

527
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,820
so, so they wake them up for the,
uh, the interview today. So, uh,

528
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,810
Kevin Smith in about 15, 20 minutes.
All right, let's check this out.

529
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:10,180
Best Wrestling Promo. Ever earlier
we talked to jump in Jeff Farmer.

530
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,370
No, now do that interview. Both.

531
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,340
There's jumping Jeff Farmer hello back.
What a Matthew had with mildly. Yup.

532
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,370
Probably the hardest back
I've ever had in my life

533
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,720
when things aren't going my way.
Motley Crue,

534
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,880
you turned the tables on me,
you've turned the tables in a wrong way.

535
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,660
You've got me mad now.
I'm still around.

536
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,770
I've listened to everything you had
to say. I did everything necessary.

537
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:47,930
But when you turn around and you back
there me one way or another and you freak

538
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,000
me out of what? Quite filling
mine when I get angry. No,

539
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,920
I'm the one doing the challenging.

540
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,630
I'm issuing a challenge to you motley
crew in the ring with me this time.

541
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,800
Um,

542
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,660
going full bore.

543
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,020
Yup.
And Joe Farmer.

544
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,600
That guy is the worst.
10 is the worst intro ever.

545
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,890
Get your ass kicked last week.
Yup. Yup. Yup. Motley crew's

546
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,720
panic on his face. Like he looks like
he's good. That's what I was supposed to,

547
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:29,170
I was supposed to go on with this shit.
He looks like he's going to piss himself.

548
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,940
What? I guess I'm just saying he
played the fake staying in one point.

549
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,030
Is that True Sam? How's he look
familiar? I don't think so.

550
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,980
He never had a career in wrestling really.

551
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,620
Someone was trying to say he's
in the wrestling hall of fame,

552
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,570
the w whatever the whatever
that is. Awe. Oh no,

started health deal school. Yes ma'am.

554
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,290
I thought you knew everybody. You
don't know now. I'll give it around.

555
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,040
I've listened to everything. Know that
guy. Oh no, go ahead. You got another guy.

556
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:06,030
What are you doing thing you had
to say and get everything. Oh,

557
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,320
give a list of when you Carlo Round and
you back there me one way or another and

558
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:15,150
you beat me out of what's rightfully
mine. That when I get angry. No,

559
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,950
I'm the one doing the challenging. I'm
assuming a town to you, Motley Crue.

560
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,800
Get in the ring with me

561
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,840

562
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,900
job and Joe Farmer, that
guy's plastic too, by the way.

563
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:40,200
All Wrestling Promo bloopers are,
she's a genius and great.

564
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,300
Kim Proterra it. This is fantastic.
Some bloopers out there, dude.

565
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,740
Have you ever seen the one where booker
t calls Hulk Hogan the n word and then

566
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,250
grabbed his head cause he's
humiliated holding calls. Tony Atlas,

567
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,670
a black boy back when
he was a thunder lips.

568
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,873
This one's great.

569
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,543
Whoa,
whoa.

570
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,593
I should

571
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,170
take the best is when he turns around and
he looks at the girl and his crew like

572
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,970
Vince is going to kill it, so yeah. Yeah.

573
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,863
He

574
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,200
should have been able to
say what you sound good

575
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,630
wrestling promo genius.
It's genius.

576
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,930
LEX Luger's genius.
The Lex Luger blooper right there.

577
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,063
Lex Luger one.

578
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,423
Yeah.

579
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:16,250
The best part is he goes to cover his
face and then he makes it look like he's

580
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:17,084
rubbing his hands.

581
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,640
He's thinking maybe this will fly
after all, so I got to cover up.

582
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,740
That just fucked up the whole time he's
got his chest, his pecs doing that,

583
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,930
moving up and down. This one, this
one's good because it's taken,

584
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,310
like when they do smack down,

585
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,660
they tape it to rebroadcast
and they edited sometimes,

586
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,520
but if you have a satellite dish you can
pick up the satellite feed and watch it

587
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:41,960
live. So they got the satellite feed of
whole Kogan just completely like fucking

588
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,590
starting over.
Okay.

589
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,440
Oh,
he messes up in front of him.

590
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,730
I have something to do with building.

591
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,330
This company just makes you sick.

592
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,610
The fact that I am the one that
put this company on the map,

593
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:09,850
it helps you make it what it is today
that makes you sick to your stomach

594
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:11,840
brother.
Yeah.

595
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:18,510
Are All those weird chats with you
have all those billions of dollars,

596
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,340
the houses that your kids within the
$20 million vacation home and blah,

597
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:27,800
blah blah, blah, blah. Shut up

598
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,740
just by ass.

599
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,240
Starting to believe in your own bullshit.
Hogan.

600
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,790
I could have had anybody
play the part of Hulk Hogan.

601
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,850
I could have had anybody bring whole in

602
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,910
one second McMahon.

603
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,080
You actually think anybody
cut a with Hulkamania.

604
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,550
Look at all the guys.

605
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,120
You take the ball to look at
all the guys that had the belt.

606
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,060
Look at all the guys.
The the goal.

607
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:13,550
I know nobody ran as hard and
as long as I did make man,

608
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,860
it sounds like a real argument.

609
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,010
If you actually think I was just
the right guy at the right place.

610
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,930
If the Ra at the right time

611
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,270
really say it one more time
so you completely understand.

612
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,890
If you actually believe mine,

613
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,580
if you actually think that
I was just a right gay guy,

614
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,560
right place, right time.
Well then Europe picker,

615
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,420
delusional pastor that I fucked.
You are McMann.

616
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,013
Yes.

617
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,990

to get in the ring. You were the one

621
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,090

622
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,850
Oh Man, we've got a good
bit here. Losing him.

623
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,260
You'd go with a fucking minute that they
really did mess up, didn't they? Yeah.

624
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:36,200
What the fuck is it sounded like
a regular. All right, let's go.

625
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,500
He said this is good.

626
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:42,240
You better make up with the select slugger
and the Kemper Taro one dude. Yeah,

627
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:45,800
that does do that. One
next. All right. Lex Luger.

628
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,520
Mr Lugo. Mr Luger, I saw it just
happened out there with Ron Killins.

629
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,290

What kind of disgusting.

632
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,420
This big,

633
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,510
clickable lack of respect does that Billy,
what's his name?

634
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,030
Show book it a match
for the total package.

635
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,530
Lex Luther and super pro Super Saturday.

636
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,590

afford to pay me and Russell? Ron,

637
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:24,310

to let him stars. God

638
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,740
marriage took big us right
Achilles. Look at me. I'm a package.

639
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,130
I will

640
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,450
rip them apart. I'll
piss down. Fuck that up.

641
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,913
Oh,

642
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,360
I don't think I stunk royally.

643
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,730
Even the interview where he
has his whole costume on,

644
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:49,370
but his voice is just
regular regular voice.

645
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,433
Come to the point.

646
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,290
What's that?
What's that one sound?

647
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:56,910
This was Kim's Tara fucking gene and
a lot of metal title for less than 48

648
00:41:56,911 --> 00:41:58,750
hours.
It can be quite so coffee

649
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,970
come to the point completely.
It's really Hurghada hand.

650
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,160
He tried the thing ahead, man on me.
There's going squad. Dang. Palm Sunday.

651
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,130
Anyways, Hercules
Hernandez. Mr. Wonderful.

652
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:16,670
Paul Andar you I'd been familiar before.

653
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,510
If I'm filling a million right now in the
third turn my back. I didn't want that.

654
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,620
You what happened with
me like the duty yard dog

655
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,190
and the goon squad.
I didn't pay.

656
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:35,330
I didn't recover. It only covered
while you recuperate beyond that.

657
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,553
I am full

658
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,830
watch gene open.

659
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:41,090
She never goes to the bathroom that
are going on in the real genius.

660
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,250
I think he was laughing
when he said 30 yards.

661
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,070
It's just a matter of time. Like
I said before, I thought to,

662
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:50,840
you mean can I put it to everybody?
It's just a matter of time like yeah,

663
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,150
but tower here that runs
the world wrestling,

664
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,620
her world wrestling federation
has done like, Hey, can't go on.

665
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,283
Right.

666
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,180
You're all going to go down one by one
and I'm going to make sure that for the

667
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:10,650
weapon that you gave me,
whoever you're like our restaurant is

668
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,640
that type of treatment.
Did it change?

669
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:23,680
You guys want to do, bring
it up, turn around and I say,

670
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,970
I'm going to carry the start for a while,
but I do and I view all right,

671
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,913
what a beat.

672
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,840
Yeah.
I have a little too visual because

673
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,370
this, someone's been a, this
is, it sounds really good,

674
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,540
but there's a couple of things coming in.

675
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,370
A botch mania on youtube and shock
master master. You've seen it before.

676
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:50,360
I think shock masters remaining
is very visual, but a, okay,

677
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,450
here's 10 labs in my life.
Shock. Master's up their shop.

678
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:59,370
Masters in might be in the top five. Wow.
Shock Master. This is my favorite one.

679
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:02,500
It's psycho said he doesn't
realize he's, he's alive. Okay.

680
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:04,770
Y'All fans.

681
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,860
But there are a lot of skeptics that
think that perhaps you can't take it.

682
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,140
How do you address those skeptics?

683
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,000
Wallace skeptics and all the
people that have a little bill

684
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,000
five house
tonight.

685
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,630
There you hear it. A man of
few words sat. Go sit back.

686
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,860
You're alive. Pounds. Let me do that
again. Yeah, we covered phone though.

687
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:34,570
I made a few words on words.
This is a,

688
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,630
the shock master. Look man.
What's the setup on it?

689
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,380
Basically their version of
it. They were supposed to, uh,

690
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,660
they had a mystery partner and he was
supposed to be like the next big good guy

691
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:52,590
and WCW. And A, you're supposed
to bust through the wall,

692
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:58,290
but nobody told him there was a support
to buy for under like at the base of the

693
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:02,370
wall. Yeah. So he tripped right over
the two by four falls flat on his face.

694
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,560
The entire thing is the
funniest thing you've ever seen.

695
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:14,730
It's staying in the British bulldog.
A horrendous,

696
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,100
they was supposed to be this big
pump up of the shot massacre.

697
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:23,520
But when he fought, when, when ric flair,

698
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,940
cause he's one of the greatest of all
time of this surrounded by five bumps.

699
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,200
Awful.
And his reaction to what happened,

700
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,180
I watched this 700 times in the, and
I cry every time. The shock master,

701
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:43,510
he was just an old wrestler from the date
of you eat from, it was tugboat in Dwi.

702
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,200
He said they put a storm trooper helmet,

703
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,910
literally a storm trooper helmet that
they covered in glitter. Oh sparkles.

704
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,540
Makes sure you have the, the
the the sting lead in. I will.

705
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,360
So this was actually so bad that
this guy had a whole gimmick.

706
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:04,080
He was going to be the next main event
guy. They changed his entire gimmicks.

707
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:06,030
So that he was just a
Klutz that always lost.

708
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,990
They couldn't do anything with them
after that because of his debut. Yeah,

709
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:17,350
Jack.
Other than

710
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,500
what happened already,

711
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,360
helmets and how to go get it
and put it back on his face.

712
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,790
Glittered puttered his fucking head. Do
you think other wrestlers laughed at him?

713
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:06,863
Voice.

714
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,450
His voice was done by a guy off the set

715
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:15,670
who had a live mic. Oh, they
didn't tape it. He did it live.

716
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:20,230
So when he trips, you can
hear them go, Oh God, oh no.

717
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,870
That was Rick

718
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,970
flair. He goes, let me tell you something.

719
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,260
You watched the whole thing would at home.
You don't understand.

720
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,020
The home

721
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,430
vicious was doing a bad promo.

722
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,960
Now we just watched too bad for all those
British bulldog and sting were awful

723
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,810
and ric flair had,
this was like the Rick flesh show,

724
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,810
so he was trying to put this together at
flair. Flash trying to buck, but when,

725
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,460
when he fell through the
wall, ric Flair, when,

726
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,970
Oh God,

727
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,840
that fall the greatest thing forever.

728
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,100
How bad the Promo we up to that point,

729
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:24,130
he's panicked grabbing for that helmet.
And this is in front of an audience,

730
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,770
the live audience,
and it's live on TV.

731
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,180
This is their big thing
leading up to a paper view.

732
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,070
Live television by the paper view so you
could see this guy that was supposed to

733
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:38,360
be debut.
This is

734
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,870
perfectly clear. They're expecting
big things from the shock man.

735
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,173
Maybe the next hole,

736
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:51,210
this thing right it completely
to yet for the most,

737
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,730
the whole thing going to stay on.
If you have a wrestler, he wrestled

738
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,590
a little low on this.
This is the best.

739
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,850
Bear with us a little further so he could
get something more lead up. All right,

740
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:06,843
good

741
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,610
admissions bad.

742
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:29,680
They're all nervous cause flares.
They're square. It's just like disgusting

743
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:36,163
yelling.

744
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,720
That's the

745
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:11,250
worst outfit I've ever seen.
Listen,

746
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,190
it looks like he's wearing
a pumpkin on his tag.

747
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,280
He said,
oh my God.

748
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,850
Held up
shaking his head.

749
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,570
He's got to put his helmet on because
the other guy's going to do his promo for

750
00:50:39,571 --> 00:50:42,740
him so you can't see his mouth shut.

751
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,730
It's in the top labs

752
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:57,430
just because it's not even a
regular restaurant. The shock

753
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,580
must must've breakthrough.
I watched.

754
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:09,370
I watched this alive in 1993 it's the
greatest moment in pro wrestling history.

755
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,820
There's never been a better [inaudible].
It's killing me.

756
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:17,750
Eight different things that you think
they watched this and just laugh.

757
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,540
They did. It completely destroyed
his career. Not only do you have to,

758
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,730
you have to be as quiet as you can because
you can hear Rick flair say, Oh God,

759
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,220
you can hear offset
where he's supposed to,

760
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,170
where he's getting ready
to do his promo for them.

761
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:34,940
You can hear them making fun of him,

762
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,023
laughing

763
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,840
to yourself if you can this hell.

764
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:57,590
I've been through the mall. I was
trying to drill a hole, you know,

765
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:02,090
and we're doing his costume of injustice.
He had a,

766
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:07,091
for a giant fur vest that was
three quarter lane buttons,

767
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:11,310
a giant sparkly helmet and jeans and boots

768
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,840
and no shirt shop master.
The shock master wasn't an ass.

769
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,520
They literally, after this show,
they changed his entire gimmick.

770
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,760
He became a construction worker
that constantly falls down.

771
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:30,080
That was his career
bell's palsy.

772
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,700
The stroke master keeps having them.

773
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:40,870
Okay guys, shock Mr rules. I don't
think I'm going to be able to license.

774
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:44,810
This is the greatest thing I've ever
seen telling you to smoke. Okay.

775
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,670
Everybody can change so I will try.

776
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,300
It's like big Jack Jack.

777
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:28,470
His voice hasn't started yet.
You see him,

778
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:32,290
you see him motioning with his
hands and voice didn't start yet,

779
00:53:32,291 --> 00:53:36,570
but guys behind stage isn't talking yet
so he's just motioning like he's talking

780
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:39,860
like he's a mine. None of them
said you fell through the wall.

781
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,420
Jack [inaudible] like Yo,

782
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,110
I'm actually impressed with this guy
to be able to yell without laughing.

783
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,390
He's so bad. He probably
didn't know it. Still

784
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:59,420
no muscles at all. He's terrible.
He's got the shot to producer.

785
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:04,710
He's got to get my stomach stapled.

786
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,080
I keep breaking the wall and falling.

787
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,270
I wish we could hear the audio better.

788
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:18,530
Try to nail a founds the logo to the
these pummel you with how cupcakes are

789
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:20,280
made.
Dvt and

790
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,900
he fell and this is a thing too,
if you shit fell.

791
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:33,290
No hands on his head like sweat on his
fucking fucking stupid helmet and his

792
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:39,740
Elma with fallen.
He's gut down on the fucking floor like a,

793
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,750
what is sand pail on his head?
Oh

794
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:49,860
No. Stopping him. So when
he puts the helmet back on,

795
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,360
I love the fact that
that he's standing there,

796
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:55,760
he has to wipe the ground dirt off the
dust

797
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:02,010
and look at staying as bad. All I have
to say is he's calming everybody down.

798
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:06,150
I hit the moment. All I have to
say is I'll part is going to shock

799
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:15,210
my row
once off.

800
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,940
Timing was,

801
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:27,340
I got to see it again. You get to
talk Yo. Yeah. Do you want to hear it

802
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:33,330
really hard to hear the whole outfit.
Everything but it does make a mistake.

803
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,810
It doesn't have a body. Terrible. Hello.

804
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,560
Wait, stop it. Stop it. Stop
it. Stop it. Stop it. I'm sorry.

805
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,940
You got to understand too.

806
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,080
This was sid vicious and the Harlem
heat and they were beaten up.

807
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,840
A British bulldog is sting for like months
and this is the guy who Dan is going

808
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:10,500
to match the intensity.
These are the top three guys,

809
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:13,860
the top bad guys in the company,
top good guy,

810
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:17,790
and they had no one with
them the day that this is,

811
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,220
the guy ain't fucking got to stop

812
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,020
Doron

813
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,210
foot or less.
I would love to know what they're like,

814
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,360
what is the shock master thinking after
his helmet goes on and he's like, I just

815
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,500
is this big mom.

816
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,600
Oh,
I wish I could see that from behind them

817
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:54,570
is the best on someone tweeted that they
made fun of this on raw recently? Yeah.

818
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,370
Oh good. Yeah. We get it with the club
shit where I get you to clap right here.

819
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,241
All right, good. Yeah.

820
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:02,680
Supposedly they went real inside
and made fun of this one wrong.

821
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,110
It's all a year ago. Less
than a year ago. All right.

822
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:08,290
Here's one more from the shock master.
Yeah.

823
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:13,610
Jack Door,
man.

824
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,240
He just fell.
There's no two by four that he just fell,

825
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,650
wait a minute,

826
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:41,470
this is what he's doing and he's waiting
for that guy to start telling you want

827
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:43,840
to. He yells, he thinks it's his voice.

828
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:49,480
Pantomiming the guy was yelling at him.
He thinks that it's his boy,

829
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,840
his backstage voice guy,
but it's not if the guy

830
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,700
can't even pay to mine

831
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,390
is this five seconds,

832
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:07,391
which seems like a million years where
every one is collecting themselves.

833
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,910
Audience, the front flap, the shot master,

834
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,550
everybody went,
Holy Shit.

835
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,770
His helmet so discombobulated.

836
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,080
What he's hearing is what
he's supposed to be saying.

837
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:31,150
There is a storm trooper helmet.
He got the Holloway.

838
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:34,760
Yes. Yes. It's not an exaggeration.
That's the storm troopers.

839
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:38,030
Storm trooper helmet with Glen
Brown and he went to the next style.

840
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:43,040
He got the captain caveman and cap his
jeans that he drove to the arena and I

841
00:58:43,611 --> 00:58:47,120
think I heard a better version from
the guy that just tweeted me, hey man,

842
00:58:47,121 --> 00:58:51,300
I gotta wake up at nine 45 I got to go
to the airport. You got to go bill. Yeah.

843
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:56,310
I came by to say hi and we appreciate it.
Yeah,

844
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:00,460
he's going back to, I will. I will
be back next week. Yeah, next week.

845
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,630
Any time there will be back on the show
next week. All right. Thank you Mr Bern.

846
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,700
Keep up the podcast.
I'm a big fan belt upon.

847
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,020
Take it Isabelle and it goes
this shot they're all looking at.

848
00:59:12,021 --> 00:59:13,790
Then go into shock.
Master just fell through.

849
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,760
They all see the whole kid going
down the toilet. Could you go back?

850
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:19,580
Can you go into shock master on raw?
Just see if it's a better clip.

851
00:59:19,581 --> 00:59:24,080
Shop master on Ra is the, is the, is
the shock master on wrong? Like that's,

852
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:27,230
that's the one they made
fun of him. That's not the
original shock master. Yeah,

853
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,590
they have a a clip of it though in the
beginning just to set it up. All right.

854
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,511
What'd you go with this?

855
00:59:31,511 --> 00:59:34,800
That I just want to stop the [inaudible]
want you to hear his promo now let's go.

856
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:38,973
No,

857
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,770
they call me the shock master,

858
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,010

859

01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,930
All ready.

862
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,220
Hello.
Can you pause this glitter?

863
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:11,000
I think he has a glitter
stormtrooper helmet

864
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,930
on his chest.
From what he found

865
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,090
fucking storm trooper helmet sparkles.

866
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,900
And why is it all scared of him?
Cause he looked all scared.

867
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,980
Why didn't he turn around Douche bag?
He just fell through the fucking wall.

868
01:00:33,981 --> 01:00:38,300
Shock master is a dud and
the promo is terrible.

869
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,550
Be this brutal villain. This
guy from another planet. Oh.

870
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:48,890
Oh my gosh. Jeans and boots and and boys.

871
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,490
The first thing you see is him
fallen. You want a patient? Me,

872
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,780
I just fell through the wall. Oh
motherfucker. That is so funny.

873
01:00:56,781 --> 01:01:01,640
Now what is the setup on this now is this
is from 19 or 2009 it was a year ago.

874
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:04,700
They made fun.
I'll see much better audio,

875
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,250
but he doesn't have
his promo on his phone.

876
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,030
None other than

877
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,473
hello.

878
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,510
You heard someone say, what
did he fall to? The 40 fall.

879
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:30,910
What did he has his backstage or fall?
Oh,

880
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:31,953
I love this guy.

881
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,640
None other than

882
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,003
I told you.

883
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,110
Oh God

884
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,820
told you. It's just so bad.
It's everything about is
poorly done. Everything,

885
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:55,663
man.

886
01:01:56,610 --> 01:02:01,230
It's just additive from the original one
to shut out some awkwardness. Oh yeah.

887
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,710
And then one thing I noticed,
yeah, this is when they, uh,

888
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:08,040
and then rod did a spoof on it a year
ago. Yeah. Cause they were putting out,

889
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:13,220
when was the original shark master for
1993 I saw the fucking 17 almost 17 years

890
01:02:13,261 --> 01:02:17,000
later. Raw fucking goofed off. Let's
see how they goofed, right? No,

891
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,010
but we just are coming.
I think it's coming from that

892
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:23,420
wall. You know, it sounds like it's
coming from over here. Yeah. Hm.

893
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,833
Lito

894
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,990
awesome.

895
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,320
Where's the,
where's the voice?

896
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,920
Sounds like it's coming from
right over there. Oh, there it

897
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,480
is.
A crap.

898
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,480
Did they anyone even get it?

899
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,850
I love the shock master
clip. Yeah. Oh yeah.

900
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:13,320
It's out of a lot of labs I had
and that shop master. That's great.

901
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:17,450
And then they would dusty Rhodes,
who is one who's probably in the top five,

902
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:22,400
like my guys of all time to
like dusty and we're flair.

903
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,010
Was The rock the Best
Micah? No, not at all.

904
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:28,880
Not Probably 91 he might not
have even been a top five.
Really, man, he was great.

905
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,270
Fantastic, dusty. Ric flair.

906
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,670
Flair is better than Roddy
Piper. Um, hi, my name five.

907
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,440
Uh, I'm trying to think us that was the
rock was good at making catchphrases.

908
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:47,420
How about sergeants? No, no. Um, oh Jake.

909
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:51,110
The snake isn't in, in the top, in the
top five probably. And um, you know,

910
01:03:51,111 --> 01:03:54,300
not the rock is not in the top five.
Even the top 10 stone call,

911
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:57,440
it was probably better on the Mike in
the Rocco's it fiber. That's the five,

912
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:57,531
right?

913
01:03:57,531 --> 01:04:00,860
The Rock was just good at
making catchphrases and
then he is the best though.

914
01:04:00,861 --> 01:04:04,800
Dusty and flare are neck and neck also.
See One,

915
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,740
they're all saying oh and hard. Had a
really good one. Really good blooper. Uh,

916
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:13,320
yeah, the best blooper of all
time. But come on. Oh, hold on.

917
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,410
That damn it.
God Damn shot master.

918
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:21,560
That is one of the bat is hysterical.
I like on,

919
01:04:21,561 --> 01:04:22,820
are we able to laugh until I come?

920
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:26,500
Actually fucking tears are coming down
my eyes and try the own heart. One funny,

921
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,930
I just recently stopped
watching it and laughing.

922
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,140
But you still watch it
with this thing like, wow.

923
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:37,520
He went right on his fucking head. He's
the worst thing that could've happened.

924
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,530
The worst thing,
dude right there,

925
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:44,650
and the helmet falling off
and he scrambles to put it
on and it's so clumsy and

926
01:04:45,021 --> 01:04:47,600
they were just standing
there trying to be tough.

927
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:49,940
Be tough with all the
glitter on his chest.

928
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,513
Hi

929
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,990
Lisa. She's very pissed off.
Yeah, she, yeah. Lisa and Jersey.

930
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:40,480
Lisa.
Hi Lisa.

931
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,420
The product of woman,
he's wet.

932
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,890
I just can't believe that
women fall for his crew.

933
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:54,510
Oh, you're an easy mark.
Listen to you. Yeah,

934
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:59,430
I would get you with and within
within two days of knowing me you'll,

935
01:05:59,431 --> 01:06:03,870
you'll be subscribing. Yeah, right? Yeah.
Just by mean just by your answer, Sweetie.

936
01:06:03,871 --> 01:06:07,110
I can tell you go. This is
classic. Yeah, right. Whatever.

937
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:12,000
Here's what is on your mind.
I'm an big arrogant, big
mouth fucking asshole. Right?

938
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:15,870
And you want to curb,
you want to destroy that any way you can.

939
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,120
So here's what you do. If you're pretty,
this is when pretty girls fuck up. They,

940
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:23,100
they try to hear, hear, giggling.
This is, this is, this is,

941
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,680
here's what pretty girls fuck up.
They tried to get me good.

942
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,950
I'm a fat mother fucker. So what they
tried to do is they play the love game.

943
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,950
They give me something they think
is precious, which is pussy.

944
01:06:31,951 --> 01:06:33,920
That's what girls have to give.
But after

945
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,810
that's an attack mode,
what have a plan can you have on that?

946
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,160
Your pleasant on a tag.

947
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:46,830
If you want to destroy a man's fucking
arrogance, what do you do to do that?

948
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:51,440
Other than use your pussy.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

949
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:52,290
Do you hear what she's doing?

950
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:53,970
The singing because she didn't
really don't have an answer,

951
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:59,790
but my God,
it's like what else can you do?

952
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,680
Talk about fucking a fringe where we ever

953
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:08,520
talk about that. Yes, I
could. I innately it mainly,

954
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:10,350
here's what you got to understand,
ma'am.

955
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:14,340
We don't like you no matter what.
You know,

956
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,760
we don't care if you know
all the quarterbacks in NFL,

957
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:20,940
we don't know if we don't care
if you know every team color,

958
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,920
we don't care if you know all the GMS.

959
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:24,450
We don't care if you
know every basketball,

960
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,960
we don't care because
innately we don't like you.

961
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:32,580
So you try to infiltrate
your personalities on us
and you realize that you're

962
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:36,360
not interested in. Then you try
to fuck us when that doesn't work.

963
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:37,800
Your hours

964
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:45,170
that you're interested at first and then
look at if I work hard to get what I

965
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:49,050
want, which is pussy. Right. You agree
with that? That we work hard to get pussy,

966
01:07:49,051 --> 01:07:53,940
right? Yes. What then after I
do what I do. What's your job?

967
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:57,580
Oh, you did. Don't you
like the companionship or

968
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:01,960
yes, but in a, in a possession
kind of way. Like, like you,

969
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:06,220
you go wash this girl cheat. You know
what women have to do grow on you.

970
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:11,110
My girl been around for four
years. Grow on you. Oh my God. Yes.

971
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:14,710
You love it.
You love it.

972
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:18,190
I can't imagine that you're
dating an intelligence.

973
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:23,040
Beautiful. She's a genius. Really. She's
fucking a genius girl. I big doctors,

974
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:26,640
lawyers, teachers, people tell you I
don't make no fucking homeless people.

975
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:29,820
Retards. No one that dates on
Paxil or no shit like that.

976
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,420
He's telling you, she's telling you
that you just had a miscarriage.

977
01:08:33,421 --> 01:08:34,860
So that sounds like an intelligent woman.

978
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:37,560
Oh, when I was a goofy bitch.
But that's, that's a bitch.

979
01:08:37,561 --> 01:08:40,550
You fuck when you just meet
the visuals led tape mess

980
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,950
that a miscarriage. That's, that's it.

981
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:48,280
That's the price you pay when you
meet a bitch on off the street.

982
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:52,380
That was a snack for portraying. I'm
just talking about like, like the girl,

983
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,070
we would go out to dinner, he would curse
me out for a little while. You would,

984
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,280
you would understand because you innately,

985
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:01,470
you don't have your own philosophy cause
you're not really saying anything now.

986
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,670
Yeah. Get waiting. When Patrice brought
up the fact that uh, the pussies,

987
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,340
the weapon when they go with, when you
girls go into battle for the first time,

988
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,600
this is before any get to know you get
to know you, whatever it was. It's just,

989
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,720
we know that's all you
want in the beginning.

990
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,640
Well that's all we want. But
in the beginning, I, that's
not all I want to listen.

991
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:24,050
That's all you got. All you got
is pussy. Why would I try to

992
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,290
sound like that?
You sound like you know,

993
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,170
this is the way I keep
her on track and this is

994
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:32,360
yes,
I look at your mouth like the,

995
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:35,750
you can tell there's no guidance in
your life because you're too comfortable

996
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:36,890
yapping about nothing.

997
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:44,810
Nothing. Right? Because I'm
a guy and that's what we do.

998
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,490
But you but you, the stuff you
talk about that you think is about,

999
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:53,300
so you talk constantly.
Thank you.

1000
01:09:53,301 --> 01:09:57,230
But it's always interesting when
guys talk. Hi Lisa. Thank you.

1001
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,750
We got a couple more here. Let's go
Kevin in Nebraska. Kevin. Hi Guys.

1002
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,820
Jump in and find your spot and go.

1003
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:08,390
Hi Dr. O'Neil. Man, you need to shut off.

1004
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,590
My wife was showing

I'm sorry man. I only get no good
soldiers in trouble, but this is is,

1006
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,760

Kirsten, what's up?

1007
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:24,220
Hey, I totally agree with Patrice.
Absolutely agree with Patrice.

1008
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:27,400
Women needs know their place.
No,

1009
01:10:27,401 --> 01:10:31,750
what they do do it well and please
their man and their man will be around

1010
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,940
forever. Good girl. Wow. Or ever.
Absolutely. Men need a writer.

1011
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:40,420
Be a writer. It's not that
difficult. Keep your mouth shut.

1012
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,960
Do what you're told.
Be who you are.

1013
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,820
Is that what you're saying? Is that
what you do with your girl? Oh,

1014
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,160
hi. Thank you. Karsten let's go
to John and Utah. John deep voice

1015
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:59,510
treat saved my marriage.
I was the, uh, the doting,

1016
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,040
the doting husband and
it was all about her, uh,

1017
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,400
started listening to him and things were
going bad. And so I started going, Whoa,

1018
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:11,570
whoa. Treats do. I started
following his advice.

1019
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,320
What would though

1020
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,270
perse, but it's turned it around and
work the happier than we could possibly.

1021
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,060
D D shirts you're going to be. She is
what he said his, yeah. What? He said,

1022
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:27,410
we're happy.
A happy man is a happy relationship.

1023
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:30,770
A happy woman is a miserable
man portrayal. Wow.

1024
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,890
You want it?
She wanted me to be the man.

1025
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:37,830
That's what they fucking point is.
You got to do a one shot deal,

1026
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:42,290
a relationship advice show
for like one hour, two hours,

1027
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:45,050
whatever you want to handle this.
He is just simple. We'll, we'll,

1028
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:46,640
we'll work that out of Washington.

1029
01:11:46,641 --> 01:11:50,030
We'll get Patrice on Neil on the
show by himself. Just taking calls.

1030
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,210
Why your relationships? Here's
why you can, here's why.

1031
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:55,310
You should always understand
why it's legitimate.

1032
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,400
I'm a fucking mess physically.

1033
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,600
Like I'm trauma tried to get a shave one
of these days but naked if you will get

1034
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:06,170
me making it next to my girl,
you will go, what the fuck?

1035
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:10,670
Like my self esteem has to like when I
fuck I have to go, why is she fucking me?

1036
01:12:10,671 --> 01:12:14,750
I wouldn't never give me no pussy and
it's like I'm looking at it going,

1037
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:17,750
what is she up to?
This is like my low self esteem.

1038
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:23,360
She got to be an ulterior motive.
My son was, Dave's a low is high.

1039
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:28,790
I go, what is this? But after, but I
stopped realizing it's a mind thing.

1040
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:33,020
All they want, all they want is just a
motherfucking, they can look at and blink,

1041
01:12:33,021 --> 01:12:36,630
slow and respect and and you know
it's not about beating them and, and,

1042
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:38,270
and subjugating them.
It's about,

1043
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:43,130
they look at you and feel like they
don't need to be your Mama. That's it.

1044
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:48,080
But they go, wow, this motherfucker is
in my corner. He handles his business.

1045
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,020
He now said, this is what I'm
saying. Your House situation,

1046
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:56,000
you become a million times sexier because
that's a man shoe that you did is buy

1047
01:12:56,001 --> 01:13:00,080
a fucking mansion. That's a man.
Shit. You bought a mansion Anthony,

1048
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:04,790
so it's like your girl can't help him go
this mother fucker. When you're renting,

1049
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:08,270
she can kind of that other half of
her voice that tries to put you down.

1050
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:12,980
She could look at you and go, this
faggot Wynton at 59 but man, it's not

1051
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:20,930
snake written a house. Pussy ass
Nigga. You bought a mansion again.

1052
01:13:20,931 --> 01:13:25,130
Clothes.
She wants you more 59 fine.

1053
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:29,270
You're hotter than he was when he was
renting. It's a fat fuck man. Wow.

1054
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:34,030
That's really good. Hey. Ah, wait. Hold
on a minute. Let's go to John. Jay,

1055
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,940

Oh yeah, John and Pennsylvania.

1056
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,840
Hi Patrice.
I'm impressed.

1057
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,600
You know how to keep your
woman alive without a contract.

1058
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:46,990
Yeah, man, it's mine. Shit, dude is
mine. I'm telling you, it's like,

1059
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,610

1060
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:55,720
It's just stay one back dude. Don't
ever let them convince it on one day.

1061
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:59,890
What will they do without like a man's
guide is you ever see a woman at once?

1062
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:00,903
Like they'd try to,

1063
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,080
you see out have success to a woman is
doing as being like a guy. It's like, I,

1064

Like fuck it.

1066
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,580
I'm a female ob like a woman.
A woman has an insane on position.

1067
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,930
Always. [inaudible] is not any sexier
than the bitch that works at Mcdonald's.

1068
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:27,250
If she's cute. That's the thing about
us. We've done point. Very good point.

1069
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:29,650
I'll see a woman while she do a
call on you. The black doctor,

1070
01:14:29,651 --> 01:14:32,950
Phil black dots wood.
That's the name of your shop.

1071
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,440
We're going to give like one or two
hours. See how it goes. Landfill.

1072
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,150
It's going to be, there's black
doctor Phil with Patrice O'neil.

1073
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,800
Dad's all alright. Uh, Dodds listening.
We got to set that up. You want to do a,

1074
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,980
I don't know when, when, when.
It makes sense. It sounds like.

1075
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:51,910
Get my fucking hole man straight like I
just go off with a on an improper turn

1076
01:14:51,911 --> 01:14:55,270
on the freaking channel and just let
the phone's ringing and see what happens

1077
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:58,000
for an hour. Yeah, we'll, we'll set
that up in the very near future.

1078
01:14:58,001 --> 01:14:59,880
Let's go to turtle from WAC.
Bag it.

1079
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:03,310
Hey guys, listen. Patrice,
you're absolutely right.

1080
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:07,120
I've been jumping through hoops ever since
I met my wife trying to get the pussy

1081
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:09,940
and once he got it,
they put up more hoops to jump through.

1082
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:13,480
I got to go home and implement
the o' Neal standard in my own,

1083
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:15,300
the O'Neill standard.
Wow.

1084
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,360
She knows eventually you're going to
figure out if she doesn't constantly apply

1085
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:23,260
pressure that you're going to figure
out. Holy Shit. What? Like my man,

1086
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:25,510
he was nervous that his wife
was going to leave him and I go,

1087
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:28,240
let me ask you a question like if
you really, if we really sit down,

1088
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:31,420
if my woman left,
Yo woman left your woman and you go,

1089
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,950
what would you really miss them

1090
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:39,810
exactly like what would you miss?
It's your own arrogance.

1091
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:43,720
Our arrogance is men because
their possessions and if
they leave, it's like, um,

1092
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,560
it's like losing your favorite pencil,
but it's like

1093
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:53,380
waiting, waiting, a relationship,
a loving relationship.

1094
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,130
Here's a,

1095
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:58,820
maybe your favorite pennysaver putting
what doesn't even sound like it's a

1096
01:15:58,830 --> 01:15:59,870
number two pencil.
No,

1097
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,173
we break.

1098
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,503
Wow.

1099
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:15,130
[inaudible]

1100
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:11,060
[inaudible].
