1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,880
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:07,881
It's bill burr and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,790
Monday,
uh,

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,380
February 3rd,
2014.

5
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,910
How the hell are you or how's it going?

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,540
I'm a little bit handicapped this week
because my internet isn't working.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,670
I Dunno why. I Dunno what happened. I
hit the little reset button, you know,

8
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,820
you'd take out the little pin
and you stick it in the side.

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,380
You do a little fucking five count and
you sit there staring at the God damn

10
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:35,270
lights, Blinky, blinky,
blinky, and then what happens?

11
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:38,910
So it's supposed to all be good.
Well, not this week. I don't have any.

12
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:42,480
So if you think my reading is bad when
I'm reading it off a nice giant computer

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,650
screen, whether you're here this week,
when I'm reading off my fucking iPhone.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,510
Oh wait till you hear it.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,980
Um, all right, well let's get down to it.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,960
How about that fucking Superbowl?
Was that awesome or what?

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,350
I'm speaking as a patriots fan by the way.
Um,

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,790
I gotta be honest.
Like if Peyton Manning,

19
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:12,750
he won his second super bowl and uh,
then he had to, and Brady had three,

20
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:16,110
then that's stupid ass debate
is going to start again,

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,190
which I have not heard
since Peyton, uh, lost,

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,660
or I should say the colts lost when they
played the saints and I didn't want to

23
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,590
fucking hear it. All right. And I love it.

24
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:32,040
So all you wa Peyton manning fans for
all these years who've been telling me

25
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:36,130
that fucking Peyton's better than Brady.
Look how many

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,960
fucking October. Um, you know,

27
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,540
it was a classic, a classic, uh,

28
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,570
Peyton manning stat yesterday is despite
the fact that they got the living shit

29
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:52,434
kicked out of him,

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,390
he still set the record for most
completions in a Superbowl game,

31
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,080
right?
He completed 33 passes,

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,240
33 passes. So you gotta be like Jesus
Christ. What he throw for 500 yards,

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,970
400. At least 33 you don't
need through for 280 yards.

34
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,000
That's less than nine yards a catch.

35
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,100
It was 8.7 yards a catch thinking it
Dunkin down the damn field and he got half

36
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:23,430
of those fucking yards in the,
uh,

37
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,670
the end of the third quarter when
Seattle went to like a fucking prevent,

38
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:31,050
just gave them the middle of the field
and gave him those six fucking points,

39
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,380
which pissed me off. I wanted
them to shut them out. Right.

40
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,310
It's embarrassing how much I
root against Peyton cause I,

41
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:39,300
it's like it has nothing
to do with the guy.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,570
I think he's a great fucking
quarterback was just what I really,

43
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,780
I'm doing as I'm hating on Peyton is if
I can be a am I have two white to use

44
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:52,860
that expression as I dislike
Peyton manning is I am.

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,860
Um, um, it's,

46
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:59,620
it's really just all the sports fans that
I've run into over the years who just

47
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,993
with Peyton Manning,

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,170
it was always individual stats and
then blaming everybody around them.

49
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,400
The coaching, the defense to ready
engage, well, blah, blah, blah, blah.

50
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,020
Paula fucking crap. Give me a God
damn break. Give me a fucking break.

51
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,940
Did you see that?
Look on his face.

52
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,650
About three quarters of the way through
the first quarter in my family that is

53
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:21,820
known as Peyton face.

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,480
And that's when he starts pouting and
he gets frustrated and he gets upset and

55
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,870
he can't have your fucking
later looking like that.

56
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,060
Now nobody on ESPN is going to say it.

57
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,520
None of them are going to fucking say
that shit because they fucking dropped

58
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:40,210
down at the stats God and suck it's
Dick Everyday on fucking sports center.

59
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,430
They don't watch the game.
All right.

60
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,500
None of those people on ESPN or even human
beings, they walk in as human beings,

61
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,840
right?
And then something happens,

62
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,300
they drill into their head and they
stick a chip in there and then they just

63
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:55,090
become like these, you
know, like, I don't think,

64
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,650
I only think like their lip should move.

65
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:59,680
I think like their jaws should just
open and close like one of those wooden

66
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,330
puppets,
you know,

67
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:04,630
those ones that are dressed like
those guards there and the nutcrackers

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,740
okay.

69
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,180
Right. That's what, that's what the
one that ran credit rock got robbed.

70
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,120
They should just be doing that shit.
[inaudible].

71
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,580
Um,
I can't even tell you.

72
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,850
I had no idea how hard I was
rooting for Seattle until the game

73
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,530
fucking started because I thought,
you know,

74
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,590
as you guys all know how much I
hated that stupid 12th man and like,

75
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,570
you know what have been a great drinking
game was how many times Joe Buck said

76
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:41,650
it is really loud here,
right?

77
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,370
With the stupid sound,
a meter and all of that shit.

78
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,450
And I actually got a lot of
people on Twitter were given
me shit going. Yeah. How,

79
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,780
how dumb do you feel now?
I never shit on Seattle.

80
00:04:55,781 --> 00:05:00,290
I never said they were bad team. If you
listened to my podcast, you've dumb cunt.

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,510
I said it was yours to lose.
I bet on you guys to win it.

82
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,950
But that doesn't change. And even your
championship does not change that.

83
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,620
That 12th man thing and everybody
dressing up like characters and bring in

84
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:18,621
fucking new year's whistles to the
Goddamn game is not the dumbest thing that

85
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:19,330
I've,

86
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,330
embarrassing embarrassing ball washing
thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.

87
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,800
The 12th man stinks.
You have nothing to do with the victory.

88
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,680
Despite what the players and
the owners are going to say.

89
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,100
They all make millions
because of your dumb ass.

90
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,390
That's why they say a nice shit to you.
All right.

91
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:41,990
Okay.

92
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,400
Jesus fucking Christ.

93
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,690
Jury think there's some running back and
the other huddle as he's listening to

94
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:49,190
the play going,
you know,

95
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,090
I'd really like to execute this play
the way we have all week in practice,

96
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:56,690
but golly, golly, is that crowd loud?

97
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,820
Um, but congratulations to the
true fans of the Seattle Seahawks.

98
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,550
The real ones, the real ones, the
ones who showed up when they suck too.

99
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,740
The ones who when they got better,

100
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,940
didn't go out and buy a bunch of shit and
start dressing up like fucking a green

101
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,080
Ben Franklin or whatever the fuck those
people were doing in the stance. Um,

102
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,090
I gotta ask you, be honest,
Seattle Seahawk fans,

103
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,790
now that you actually have something to
crow about, pun intended, you know, don't,

104
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,930
now that you actually have a Superbowl
trophy, you guys are actually champions.

105
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:32,010
You can actually sing champions.
Now.

106
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:35,910
Doesn't that loud things seem a
little fucking ridiculous? Didn't,

107
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,890
that just kind of seem like,

108
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:42,510
you know that mother that can admit that
our kids not talented so they got to

109
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:47,070
like somehow come up with everybody
gets a trophy, everybody gets a ribbon.

110
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,210
You know what you guys have
created up there I hope is over.

111
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,000
Not as far as like your
run on on championships.

112
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:01,900
I'd never wished that against you,
but as far as that loud horseshit, um,

113
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,670
if Kansas City next year tries
to break the record again,

114
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,320
if that whole fucking thing starts like
who is the loudest crowd and I guarantee

115
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:14,840
it it will. I can't say it guy. It
wouldn't surprise me if it what?

116
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,430
It is embarrassing.

117
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,130
You have your Superbowl trophy
for the love of fucking God.

118
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,720
Please stop looking each other
in the street going 12th man.

119
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,643
Okay.

120
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,060
Was that really even a congratulations?

121
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,023
Uh,

122
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,280
I was losing my fucking
mind watching that game.

123
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,190
I absolute lot of people, I guess
it didn't like the game or whatever.

124
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:47,300
Thought it was boring.
I fucking loved that game.

125
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,080
That game was the biggest
fucking beat down.

126
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:55,670
I'm trying to think if it was as bad.
This is bad for like Bronco fans.

127
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,750
I'm not rubbing this in be this really
has to disk goes back to the Patriots

128
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:04,751
cults like 10 fucking years ago when
Brady had three rings and Peyton had none

129
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:05,290
and will

130
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,880
monetary about, you know, [inaudible]
he's got the runes blow four,

131
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,510
I got its start team. I got to pills in
her own. Their stories got, Ooh, you bulls

132
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,913
right.

133
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,010
These fucking losing every year
and the first goddamn round.

134
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,980
Um, anyways, but last week I
hope you got an outpour. Um,

135
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,190
people who didn't give a fuck
about the game. I hope you, um,

136
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,620
you took my advice and you let
the game go for 90 minutes.

137
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,310
90 minutes is the magic number.

138
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,200
That is the magic number.

139
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:45,160
If you want to avoid everything and
actually watch the game and be on the edge

140
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:46,150
of your fucking seat,

141
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,100
provided if it's a good game is
you let it go for 90 minutes,

142
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,790
90 minutes you're hanging
outside, you'd drink it, bears,

143
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,040
you're doing whatever the fuck you doing,
hanging with like three,

144
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:01,990
four other people tops who
also into the game. All right.

145
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:02,824
We come in,

146
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,000
we sit down and we just
start when everybody shut
their phones off so we don't

147
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:11,860
know anything, right? Press play.
And then for the rest of the game,

148
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,840
we didn't watch one commercial.

149
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,880
We didn't have to sit through one
challenge flag. Anytime anybody got hurt.

150
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:23,830
We fast forward to it. We fast forward
through the entire fucking halftime show.

151
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,640
Didn't see any of it.
All we saw was the game.

152
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,800
And the second it ended and the coaches
were walking out and they'd go out.

153
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:36,070
All right, well let out a
little, we'll play catch shut.

154
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,780
We shut the fucking game off.

155
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,660
Didn't watch one second on ESPN.
Nothing.

156
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,410
I'm guaranteeing you.
Everybody there was going,

157
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,700
that's like one of the most enjoyable
Superbowl experiences I ever had.

158
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,870
It was fucking great. Anytime they cut
down to Pam Oliver, that other chick,

159
00:09:55,871 --> 00:10:00,190
you just fast forward the whole fucking,
it was tremendous.

160
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,840
Absolutely tremendous. Um, but anyways,

161
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:08,050
let's talk about the fucking game.
So anyways,

162
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:12,700
the rest of the world is 90 minutes ahead
of us and we're still downstairs. Um,

163
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,740
you know,

164
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,740
out my back yard smoking
a pork shoulder right?

165
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,160
I made one of my famous apple pies. Law
heads. Fucking kill it in on my grill.

166
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,380
You want to talk about
losing your man card?

167
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:30,820
I had another man come over my house
and smoke a pork shoulder on my grill.

168
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,690
I couldn't believe I woke up this morning.
My wife was still next to me.

169
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,790
Do you realize like in the south like I
would legally be considered a homosexual

170
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,810
if I did something like that?
I know.

171
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,770
I fucking know and ever since
I'm telling you right now,

172
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,900
I ain't no man who locked himself.

173
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:52,610
The person foresee allows another
man come on fucking smoke on his grip

174
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,890
grilling. That's okay. Smoking.
That's a whole other thing.

175
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,820
You know what I'm saying?

176
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,660
I wouldn't be surprised if
not only if he's wanting them,

177
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,080
them a a a homeo tack.

178
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:10,630
Sexuals if fees also
one of them terrorist,

179
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,880
he's probably building a dirty bomb
shape like a dick. That's all I'm saying.

180
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,100
Yeah. I just, you know,

181
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,750
one of the keys to being successful in
life is knowing what you suck at and then

182
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:32,430
being able to find talent in that area
and then delegating. That's what you do.

183
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,390
But delegating, you have to be
like, you gotta be careful though.

184
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:40,050
You can't delegate so much of your job
that you're just sitting in your office

185
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:42,360
twiddling your thumbs,
cause then you're fucking useless.

186
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,780
There's a fine line between putting a
team together and then just sitting in in

187
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:53,280
a fucking room like a, uh,
like a fucking goddamn mop.

188
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,880
So I still made an apple pie.
I put on an apron,

189
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,320
took out some flour and some
sugar. I don't give a fuck. I am,

190
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:05,980
I'm good at making desserts.
All right? I don't know.

191
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:07,990
It's embarrassing. But I, I like sweets

192
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,520
and my mom always made great pies
and when I moved out, I missed them.

193
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,080
So I learned how to make
a fucking show me. Um,

194
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,820
oh Geez. I can't even look myself in
the mirror after this fucking podcast.

195
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,770
What do you want from me people?
I'm flying blind here. All right.

196
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,440
I don't have the Internet.
I'm doing a podcast without the Internet.

197
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:35,260
This is like a pilot flying at
night without his instrument panel.

198
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,130
Am I in a spin and my uh,
my level with the horizon,

199
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,770
I don't know my going up my going down,
God,

200
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:45,160
I wish I had a beverage so I could
actually look at it to try to figure out

201
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:47,350
which way I'm going.
Isn't that what you do?

202
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,530
You just put like a glass of water on the,

203
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,450
on the airplanes dashboard
and then you just,

204
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:55,450
you just use that as your fucking horizon.
Come on man.

205
00:12:55,451 --> 00:13:00,451
That's pretty ingenious for a comedian
who has zero hours up in the air.

206
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,190
Um, anyways, so let's
get back to the game.

207
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:11,191
So the entire world is like 90 minutes
ahead of us and there's something cool

208
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:12,100
about that,
right?

209
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,130
Like they all got on the spaceship and
they went to a better planet and we all

210
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:17,710
sat back like, gag, go fuck
yourself with toughing it out here.

211
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,430
Non on cigars and shit pretending
we know how to fight. Right?

212
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,770
So we go upstairs and they finally like,
you guys want to watch the game? Yeah,

213
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,030
let's fucking watch it. All right,
so we go upstairs, we put it on.

214
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,230
I fast forward like, you
know, get right to where it,

215
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,540
right before the kicker is going
to kick the ball. And I hit pause.

216
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,900
You guys ready? Everybody, Jake?
Yeah, we're ready. Let's go.

217
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,090
Bomb fucking kicks the ball off.

218
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,240
My Broncos get the ball and the
very first play from scrimmage.

219
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,290
All right.

220
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,960
Peyton calls an audible
the fucking Manny Ramirez,

221
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,720
who I thought, you know, when
you get kicked out of baseball,

222
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:59,140
I didn't think that you could then just
go play football. But once again, Jesus,

223
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:04,141
what a fucking talent this man is Manny
being Manny hikes the ball over Peytons

224
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:11,380
fucking head ended up God damn end
zone, whatever the guy falls on it.

225
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,160
They get as safety,
very first play from scrimmage.

226
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,420
And I'm not going to lie to you.

227
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,950
I literally put my hand over
my mouth and I was stunned,

228
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,720
absolutely stunned because uh, you know,
I'm not gonna lie to him. You know,

229
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,460
you guys know what my
prediction was last week.

230
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,540
I thought that game was going
to be a classic. I'm, I'm,

231
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,650
I knew the AFC was weaker. I definitely
kind of felt that Seattle 49 is,

232
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:38,320
might've been the super bowl,
but it's fucking Peyton manning.

233
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,170
And I knew [inaudible] had a
great defense and all that.

234
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,000
I just thought it was
going to be back and forth,

235
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,820
um, through the first half.
This is what I thought.

236
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:54,610
And I thought it would maybe one one team
where the yellow was going to be up by

237
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:57,670
like two, three points,
maybe four at the half.

238
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,400
And then in the second half I thought
that the Broncos' defense was going to

239
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:06,550
cave in, that Marshawn lynch was
going to fucking run all over them.

240
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,610
That obviously did not happen.

241
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,570
I think the Broncos went in there
are obviously we'll like, alright,

242
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,310
we gotta stop, we gotta Stop Marshawn
Lynch. And they did. They did.

243
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:21,310
And they were like,
well that Wilson guy is not playing well.

244
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,620
If we're going to get beat by,

245
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:26,390
our offense is going to be
with that guys fuck it up.

246
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,930
And other than a couple
overly excited throws,

247
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,560
you know where he overthrew that
guy right out there and the flat.

248
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,880
Other than that, that kid fucking settled
down and had the game of his life.

249
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,600
I thought he, he, he made
some great fucking throws,

250
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,240
had no picks, no fumbles, no
nothing. He did not hurt the team.

251
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:53,500
All he did was moving forward. He
played a great fucking game, dude.

252
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:58,120
It was total 100% fucking domination.

253
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,620
Let me think about that. They had
two field goals. They had a safety.

254
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,640
They had a touchdown or
offensive touchdown. I think
it was a run, right? Yeah.

255
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,960
Marshawn Lynch.
That was a run.

256
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,160
That's 22 field goals at six fucking
annoys me going through the whole game.

257
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,500
That's 20 points now that it isn't,
oh is oh here it is.

258
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:21,020
A comedy be trying to add this up,
right?

259
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:26,021
Three and three is six plus seven is 13
plus two is 15 they had a kiss special

260
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:30,950
teams kickoff return.
That was fucking 22

261
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,800
what else did they,
I don't fucking room.

262
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:39,200
They had a pick six that's 29 points.

263
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,700
Then they scored another 14 I don't even
fucking remember now telling you I'm,

264
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:48,860
I mean, I might be wrong, but
they could have shot them out.

265
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,730
They went into the prevent and the
at the end of the third quarter,

266
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:56,510
which was fucking brilliant,
just give up the middle of the field,

267
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,140
let them burn out the rest of
this fucking quarter and we're up.

268
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,860
Even if they score a touchdown,
we're still up by almost 30 points.

269
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:08,060
There's no fucking way this scoring
30 and the fourth quarter it was over.

270
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,010
I've never seen the starting quarterback
get taken out of the game. Like, well,

271
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,210
there's no sense risking you getting
injured in a fucking Superbowl. I can't,

272
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:21,530
I'm trying to think. Did they take
Troy Aikman out that year when they,

273
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:26,510
uh, they won like 50 something to whatever
against buffalo or did they take Joe

274
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:27,470
Montana out?

275
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,933
MMM.

276
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,270
And that 55 to 10 game,

277
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,540
I don't think Jim Mcmahon came out when
they beat the shit out of the Patriots,

278
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:40,170
that 46 to 10 game.
So this is what I'm doing during the game.

279
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,630
This is how much of a psycho I am.

280
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,400
Every time Seattle scored points,

281
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,330
I stood up and I high fived each
person I was watching the game with.

282
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,010
Every time I'd go, Tom
Brady, Tom Brady, Tom Brady,

283
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,590
Tom Brady is,
I was going around in the fucking room.

284
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,910
I just look,
I'm too dumb to follow politics.

285
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,750
I'm not good at math.
I don't understand science.

286
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,070
So sports is all I have.
So when I put on ESPN,

287
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,100
it has been an absolute dream for me
since 2010 to not listen to the who is

288
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:26,270
better Payton or Tom Brady.
And if he won yesterday,

289
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,940
I was going to have to
fucking listen to that again.

290
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,580
So this is completely just selfish,

291
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,300
totally selfish because I didn't give
a fuck about Seattle either and there

292
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,270
would've been nothing funnier then
after all that screaming and yelling,

293
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,570
if they didn't win it, the whole fucking
thing. I mean, I didn't give a fuck.

294
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,140
It would have been hilarious.
But the second the game started,

295
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:52,490
like when Seattle started playing,
well first I saw Peyton, right?

296
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:55,220
And then there was the safety.
And I was like,

297
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,950
I was literally nervous at the
beginning of the game going, Oh my God,

298
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,000
is he going to just carve up this
fucking unbelievable defense?

299
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,310
And then this argument's
gonna start again.

300
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,750
I'm making this whole Superbowl about
me. I realized this, this was all,

301
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:12,070
this is all I gave a
shit about. And then, um,

302
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,240
and then Seattle started doing well and
I started seeing, you know, Pete Carroll,

303
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,540
very surprisingly, I don't think I
saw him went, Woo, the whole game.

304
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,090
I don't think I saw him
do that once. But, uh,

305
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:26,210
I got out and then I was looking at
him like, ah, fucking Pete Carroll.

306
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,840
I don't want to see this guy win.
Like I was just fucking,

307
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:33,740
I was like this little gargoyle in
the corner just sitting there. Like,

308
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:37,700
is there any way both teams could lose
so I could be satisfied as a sports fan?

309
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,800
I was just like one of the biggest clients
that ever watched a fucking game. Um,

310
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,480
and then I just realized that it was more,
it was more about a,

311
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,400
Oh yeah.
And not only that,

312
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,580
first he picked the Broncos and I picked
Seattle and that's a back to back years

313
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,200
were Paul Versey has been
dead fucking wrong. And uh,

314
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,940
this is the thing about Paul and this is
why you should never ever, and you can,

315
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:07,250
you can call in Diversey
effect if he has callers.

316
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:09,290
And you could tell him I said this,
don't ever,

317
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,320
ever take gambling advice from that man.
I'm not saying he's a good guy.

318
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,690
I'm not saying he's not a standup guy.

319
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,940
I'm not saying he's good on
a great husband and father,

320
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,580
not saying he's not a great comedian.

321
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,910
I'm just talking about the gambling part
of Paul versus New Jersey brain via New

322
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,460
York. All right. That fucking guy

323
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,720
he's never going to learn.
He is,

324
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,520
that guy loves offense.
It's a cliche at this point.

325
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:48,330
The say defense wins championships.
Paul just, he can't hear it.

326
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Paul's like that guy that's
head fucking 19 beers and he's,

327
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,020
and you're trying to go gimme your keys
and he just will always think that he

328
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:00,680
can drive.
That's what he is.

329
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,820
I hope he listens to this when
it comes to be in a gambler.

330
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:10,830
That fucking guy loves.
He's flesh.

331
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,590
He likes the Flash, he
likes pinky rings. Offense,

332
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,240
throw the bomb.
That's his big thing.

333
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,460
Aaron out scare the defense. He loves
it. Waste to play. Just throw it.

334
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:26,370
70 fucking yards.
He is,

335
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
he's a time square fucking kind of guy.

336
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,400
He likes the lights,
he loves the fucking off fence.

337
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,660
I on the other hand, am a
miserable, middle-aged Andy,

338
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,740
Andy Rooney cunt.
So I of course love defense.

339
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,920
I love it. 10 to seven game. I love it.

340
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,600
I love it when people sit those so
fucking boring. I absolutely love it.

341
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:56,420
I love a pitcher's duel.
I Dunno why.

342
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,620
Okay.

343
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,131
I know why.

344
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:01,980
Because I'm a Kinda guy that will watch
the Superbowl and root for both teams,

345
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:06,330
the loose. Um, so
anyways, congratulations.

346
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,120
In all seriousness, congratulations
to the fans of Seattle lie.

347
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,340
That's gotta be fits. Great guys.
Haven't fucking won a championship.

348
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:18,000
So when was it? Let's
see. 77 was the bullets.

349
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,620
No, 77 was Portland. 78 was the
bullet. 79 I believe was, uh,

350
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,650
the supersonics.
Um,

351
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:30,960
okay.

352
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,440
The loudest fans, they are the loudest
fans. Hey, us, Seattle Seahawks fans.

353
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:36,750
Do you ever think if you cheered
that loud for the sonics,

354
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:37,584
they wouldn't have left?

355
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,713
Yeah.

356
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,270
Ah, it's just never going
to get old teasing them.

357
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,300
They don't give a fuck.
They have a championship parade.

358
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,320
So now they're actually talking
because they're so young. I mean, dude,

359
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:56,630
that was fucking, that
was seriously, I know.

360
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:59,750
I'm still breaking it balls
just because it's fun. Um,

361
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,060
that was seriously one of, I
knew the afcs week, but I mean,

362
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:06,080
there are only so weak.

363
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:11,081
That was still Peyton manning with one
of the most prolific offices in the

364
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:12,800
history of the modern era.

365
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:17,420
Fuck the whole game because the game
has changed so much. But like, um,

366
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,240
Jesus Christ, I mean, that game was over,

367
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,140
over in like
even I who never,

368
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:32,070
I always say it's never over. It's never
over. It's never over even, I mean,

369
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:33,470
it was just,
it was fucking over.

370
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,780
Yeah.

371
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,760
The fucking game was over.
Joe Barton.

372
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:42,220
Nick was sitting on my couch,
just La. He started the laughing

373
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,390
in the,
uh,

374
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,580
when the guy was ran the fucking
ball back to start the second half,

375
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,880
cause he's sitting there going like,
what did he say? He said, Bill, he goes,

376
00:23:55,881 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm glad you have money on this game
because if you didn't I would be back

377
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:04,880
outside drinking and I start laughing and
then, you know, and as we're doing that,

378
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:08,960
we're fast forward through
all the fucking, you know, um,

379
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,360
halftime show and as he's saying
that, I'm laughing, we hit pause,

380
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,850
everybody, you know, bathroom
break and then we hit play.

381
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,390
They kicked the ball off and the
dude starts running back and,

382
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,280
and partner has this high pitched
laugh. I just, Sam, go ahead.

383
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,470
Once the fucking thing back,
dude,

384
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:33,860
it was an absolute beat.

385
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,280
I have to think that
everybody in Washington,

386
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:42,550
the state of Washington has to
have laryngitis like for fuck eat.

387
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,230
Especially if you watched the game and
you didn't miss any commercials, you,

388
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,430
you just watched it like,

389
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:53,300
like a nerd and just sat there like
a good little fucking TV viewer.

390
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:54,920
And you watched the whole halftime show.
I mean,

391
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,810
everybody in the state of Washington has
to have laryngitis. I'm trying to think.

392
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,520
The only disappointment you had
was that you didn't shut them out.

393
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,990
And even then it was just like that was,
they did that on purpose.

394
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,260
They just gave up the middle
of the field. Jesus, Bill,

395
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,120
how many fucking times are
you going this week? Got It.

396
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:17,770
They gave up the middle of
the field. You can't, uh,

397
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,740
you know, who would've thought I'd be so
fucking elated to see Pete Carroll Win a

398
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:27,930
championship?
I just ate just he party.

399
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,220
There was a couple of fucking
things this week. I didn't hear it,

400
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:32,990
but I guess on Bill Simmons Podcast,

401
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:36,620
he interviewed Larry Byrd and Larry Bird.

402
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,100
They asked him who he would want to
play with the most in today's NBA,

403
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:44,840
and he said, Coby Bryant,
Kobe Bryant. He just said, no,

404
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:45,830
the guy plays hurt.

405
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:49,220
He just fucking just went on and
on about how awesome the guy was.

406
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,960
So I have to retire trashing Coby Bryant.

407
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,040
It took Larry Bird to let
me know that I was wrong.

408
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,870
But isn't that why you
listened to the podcast?

409
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,600
Doesn't it make you feel
better about yourself? You
know what's funny by himself?

410
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,280
Fucking arrogant. I still don't
think I'm wrong about that guy. Um,

411
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,090
I can't get past my blind hatred of
the fuck. Its not even the Lakers.

412
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:18,410
That's their fucking stupid
ass fans. God, they're dumb.

413
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,200
They're so dumb.

414
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:27,010
He just gives us this like 8% of them
even remotely could even explain a pick

415
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,940
and roll. I gotta tell you,
if you're not from out here,

416
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:35,290
you gotta come down here and go to a
Laker game and just sit amongst them just

417
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:39,460
to see how fucking dumb they
are. God, they had dumped,

418
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,560
I mean I'm talking like not summer school.
Dumb.

419
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,650
I'm just talking about
fucking learn a trade.

420
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,570
Drive a truck. Dumb. Right.

421
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,880
And I know there's people out there
learning a trade right now and I know what

422
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:56,420
you're thinking.

423
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,530
What I just said was insulting and I
don't care that you think that because I

424
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:04,340
know you're too dumb to
figure out where I where,

425
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:08,750
where you can fucking find me doing
stand up even though it's on my website.

426
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,380
Get just too fucking stupid.

427
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,060
I really shouldn't say shit like that
cause there's always one dumb fuck who

428
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:19,894
takes me seriously.

429
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,620
Do you remember last week when I was
saying how Hawaii part of this country,

430
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,350
even though it is, I'm just
saying it just nobody, nobody, um,

431
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,400
black or white looks right on that island.

432
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,800
You have to be Hawaiian or,
or Asian and you look fine.

433
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,730
But we,
we,

434
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,790
the rest of us do not look right
on an island. We just don't.

435
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,660
And then the joke was, when I
fucking come here, you know, well,

436
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,930
I lean up against the tree.
I looked like an American.

437
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,340
Like you can't tell me that.
And I said,

438
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:56,850
I'm so sick of these native Americans
complain and f I have to argue with one

439
00:27:56,851 --> 00:28:00,360
more Apache. It was completely ridiculous
and over the top, and everybody,

440
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,180
one fucking moron on
Twitter, he said, Bill,

441
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,700
the reason why you look
normal as this country,

442
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,870
he's because capital letters you would,
you killed all the native Americans.

443
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,270
It's just like, dude arguing with
the Paches didn't give it away.

444
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,690
There's always going to be
that one fucking person.

445
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,230
It just has to fucking take it seriously
and ruin it for everybody else.

446
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,370
All right. Am I done whining?
What else did I do this week? Oh,

447
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,210
um,
what did I do this week?

448
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,970
I thought I did something. Oh,
you know what? I haven't drank.

449
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,060
I haven't drank in a seven days.
It's been a week.

450
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:48,730
And I realize now that it is, um, okay

451
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,340
that basically I have to go once I
go seven days and I go and I get past

452
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:58,070
something like going to a
Superbowl party and I don't drink,

453
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,160
then at that point I can go a year.
Like now I could, I could go a fucking,

454
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:07,180
it's that first week.
Well I haven't drank in two days.

455
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,800
I haven't drank in three
days and I just think,

456
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:10,420
well if I drink I can start over again.

457
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:14,800
I can easily go for days and
beat my streak once personally.

458
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,920
Once I get seven days in, now I got
to hit in the street going, you know,

459
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,320
I got the hot bat here.
I don't want to end the streak.

460
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:21,880
I don't want to start over again at one.

461
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:28,370
So I got through the Superbowl and it
was brutal trying to get through it.

462
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,320
Um, oh man, we had such a fucking
great time. And then in the end, right,

463
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,040
cause we smoking this pork shoulder
and the last time we had we had the

464
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:41,610
temperature too high. And
by we, I mean La head. Um,

465
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,550
this time we slashed Lawhead had
it lower and it took a lot longer,

466
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,960
which it was totally worth it.

467
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:50,900
But we watched the game and like two
fa there took us two hours to watch the

468
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:52,640
game,
just flew through the whole fucking thing.

469
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,440
And then by the end of the
game, the pork roast, uh,

470
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,670
the w was ready and the pork
shoulder I should say was ready.

471
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,790
And we just sat there and fucking Chow
down laughing that we missed all of the

472
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:14,230
bullshit. Um, and it was funny.
Nia comes home and she's like,

473
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,600
what'd you think of the game? We were
like, yeah, we just finished it and blah,

474
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:21,250
blah, blah. And then she starts talking
about Bruno Mars and all that. We like,

475
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:25,990
yeah, we didn't see it.
She's like, it is. Oh,

476
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,220
we didn't see it.
So then she goes and we recorded the game.

477
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:34,720
She goes and she rewinds it.

478
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,290
Okay.

479
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,660
Are Fast Forwards, whatever the
fuck she had to do to get to it.

480
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,120
I guess we want rewind. Yeah, cause
we watched it yet. I hit stop. Yeah.

481
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:46,490
So she had a rewind back there
and she goes to put it on in law,

482
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,360
had sitting in my living room and it
comes on and there's this creepy fucking

483
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:55,361
singing of children in like in there,

484
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:59,840
like all, they're backlit. So he sees
this silhouettes and they're singing like,

485
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:04,220
whoa, whoa, Whoa, that
fucking Grinch music.

486
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:05,450
Whatever the fuck they was singing,

487
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,400
sort of holy sort of
creepy pedophile music.

488
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,380
Oh, there's so innocent.
Let's let them sing innocent,
creepy fucking church music.

489
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:18,920
Right. And I look over
at La and I go, Hey Jay,

490
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,780
this is what me miss.

491
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,020
And Jay was over in the corner and he
just fucking look up and he just made this

492
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:28,780
face. He just goes, but
I've got to tell you, um,

493
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,470
I actually watched, I did, and I, then I
watched it. Now that the game was over,

494
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:37,670
I didn't give a fuck. And I
actually really like Bruno
Mars. I watched it. And uh,

495
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,790
oh, what a halftime show that
was, that was a tremendous show.

496
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,260
Came out with the DW green spot,

497
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,760
played a fucking drum solo. Oh, he was
tremendous. What an entertainer did.

498
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:53,300
The James Brown dance, Gillette
peppers came out their shirts off.

499
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:57,800
I fucking called that a call that I
called it on Conan. I did Colin this week.

500
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,210
I said flee was going to catch a cold
cause he wasn't gonna wear a shirt and he

501
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,740
should be the only one
complaining about the web. Um,

502
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,280
so anyway, so it was, it was
fucking absolutely phenomenal.

503
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:18,281
Superbowl some a Sunday and I did
not have one fucking drop of alcohol.

504
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,650
And uh, I feel great when I got to
be honest, you'd not drinking is, uh,

505
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,550
it's really hard right around
four o'clock in the afternoon

506
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,860
till about two in the morning.

507
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,180
Those 10 hours are hard. The other
14 are easy, you know, eight them,

508
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:42,900
I sleep, you know, and I just
got to get through six hours.

509
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,770
But those other 10 men, I got to
tell you, those are fucking brutal.

510
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,840
But I'm a nice little streak here,

511
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:53,340
so I'm going to try to go until my
Canadian tour. And then once, you know,

512
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:58,710
the Canadian tour starts, I mean, they
got Cuban cigars up there. They got,

513
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,280
it's just gonna be, uh,
it's going to be cold.

514
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,380
Who wants a Heda? So whatever.
So I'm to, you know, it's funny,

515
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,270
as I overheard somebody who
wasn't a doctor say that,

516
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:16,140
um, that basically, uh,
to cleanse your liver,

517
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:19,560
it takes 42 days to cleanse your liver.
So like an idiot,

518
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,810
I just don't drink for 40 days,

519
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,710
42 days thinking I'm cleansing my liver
as I'm putting in all these fucking,

520
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:26,544
you know,

521
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,790
I'll eat at Mcdonald's once or I'll
fucking just be eating processed fucking

522
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:36,330
food. I'm not cleansing my liver, but
at least I got the alcohol out of there.

523
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:38,940
Right? I'll drink a little
water with some lemon, you know,

524
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:42,720
I do what I tried to do, but

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:50,070
proflowers proflowers everybody for
getting Valentine's Day is as bad as

572
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:55,140
forgetting her birthday. I debate
that. I mean, they're both bad,

573
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:56,880
but I would say for getting
her birthday's worth,

brought to this work. Um, you,

581
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,980

manning when super Superbowl.

582

610
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:16,040

a fucking banana. Um, all right,

611
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,560
let's get into the questions
for this week. How far are we?

612
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:21,470
I'm feeling 40 minutes. Oh, 39 19.

613
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,540
The internal clock of a
comedian. Um, all right.

614
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,800
Los Angeles water shortage.
Hey there, Billy water.

615
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:35,240
Well I heard Los Angeles is
going through a doubt drought.

616
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,240
Um,
but what are people doing about it?

617
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,440
Are People shutting off
sprinklers? No, they're not.

618
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,190
My friend says they
still run the sidewalks,

619
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:49,280
sprinklers in his neighborhood every
night unless it rains for a few nights

620
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:53,870
straight. How does this area come back
from something like this? How does a,

621
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,780
how's your doomsday bunker coming along?
Um,

622
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,330
all right, here we go. Um, yeah,

623
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,190
well basically people will run their
sprinklers until the government says, Hey,

624
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,930
don't run them anymore.

625
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,080
So we haven't gotten to that
point in the drought where it's,

626
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:17,000
you can't run your sprinklers. So that's
why people are still running them.

627
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:21,860
And uh, it rained yesterday, so, uh, I
think we're going to be all right. But,

628
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:25,730
uh, I would ask you the same question.
How was your doomsday bunker coming along?

629
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:26,780
Um,

630
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,780
personally I don't have one and I take
great comfort in knowing that I can only

631
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:36,410
die once and that, um, just without
water I'll be dead within three days.

632
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:39,020
So I've had an unbelievable life.

633
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,090
I have no desire to
survive the apocalypse,

634
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,790
you know,
just at the,

635
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:53,030
just at the very basic level,
the lack of toilet paper,

636
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:57,830
toothbrush and toothpaste,
that alone, you know,

637
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,870
watching my teeth, turning brown,
having a slowly yank them out,

638
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,850
you know what I mean?

639
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,220
The loss of electricity in
listening to you stereo, that alone,

640
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:13,350
it's, it's just, it's
not worth living anymore.

641
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,410
You gonna to go back to fucking live in,
in a clan,

642
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,210
some God damn cave or some shit.

643
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,680
I guess the garages will be
the new caves of the, uh,

644
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:28,000
I guess of the millennium here. Do you
know? Oh, you know what? After the, uh,

645
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,960
after the Superbowl was over,
we all sat around the dining room table.

646
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:36,570
I told you neo hooked up to because I
was too stupid to figure it out. And uh,

647
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,310
we put on dark side of the moon,

648
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,590
which I have not listened to wire
to wire in years. I would arguably,

649
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,560
that might be the greatest
album of all time. Um,

650
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,810
I don't think anything can touch

651
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,850
and you know something, I hope that you
got the, can somebody out there tell me,

652
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,870
and this is a vinyl question,
I want to know on album,

653
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,800
what is there a better album
to put the headphones on,

654
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,420
lay in there and the duck and
just listening to that album.

655
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:14,900
And if you're young right now and your
whole life has been digital downloads and

656
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:15,734
all that,

657
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,950
I highly urge that you get a stereo and
you buy that album and put the fucking

658
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:27,290
lights out and put the headphones on.
You got it. You have to experience it.

659
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:31,610
Like that's, that's, you know, we watch
it. It was a bunch of old people there,

660
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:34,250
you know, my age and a little
bit younger and older, whatever.

661
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,640
And we were talking about how fucking
great the album was because nobody had

662
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:42,470
heard it in a while. And uh, someone that
was just sitting there going like this,

663
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:45,770
that's what she did.
Like back in the day,

664
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:50,360
like your parents be like,
where you going? I'm going
upstairs to listen to music.

665
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:54,860
Like you just, you just listened to
music. You weren't on a fucking treadmill

666
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,640
doing night. He just, I don't,
I mean, I, it, you did listen
to the radio in the car,

667
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,730
whatever,
but it was different.

668
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:05,180
You didn't have like your whole fucking
playlist and Bluetooth and talking on

669
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,030
the phone. It was just like,
it would really was, it was
an activity like, hey man,

670
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:10,970
I got the new whatever record you
want to come over and listen to it.

671
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,570
And everyone would sit on the
floor and do some drugs, man.

672
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:18,620
And you'd put on the fucking album.
I miss that. I never had that level.

673
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:23,520
I never did the drug thing. Um, but,

674
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,360
uh, I know that I just made me think
of Philip Seymour Hoffman, man.

675
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:31,140
What a fucking tragedy that is.
Huh? Jesus Christ. You know what?

676
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,800
I actually saw him?
Um,

677
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,160
I was dating this wonderful girl
and I fucked it up of course,

678
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,590
because I'm an idiot.
Um,

679
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:41,990
okay.

680
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,990
And liked in late 1990s and
Phillip Seymour Hoffman and John C.

681
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,340
Reilly did a play called true west and
they would switch parks every other show.

682
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,440
And, uh, I went down with the, the
woman I was dating at the time,

683
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,590
she said, you gotta go, we gotta
go see this. And I was just like,

684
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,390
I don't want to go see so much. He play
right. I was too busy doing stand up.

685
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:11,320
And she's like, no, you got to fucking
see this thing. And uh, went down and um,

686
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:16,410
and got to see both. Both of them
of course were unbelievable. And uh,

687
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,860
it just, it's just a fucking
worst. It's the worst.

688
00:44:19,861 --> 00:44:24,861
If I've learned anything in this
business as I've gained a respect for a

689
00:44:26,401 --> 00:44:29,490
addiction
and just,

690
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,370
I dunno just how fucking

691
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,650
powerful that is.
Okay.

692
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:40,040
You know, I actually in a way like with
like, even like with the, with like booze.

693
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,810
Yeah.

694
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,450
Like I, I'm trying to think the
last time, maybe like a November,

695
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:48,140
I went longer than seven days,
but even then I fucked up after 10 days.

696
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,830
And uh,
I was talking to draw all man.

697
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:57,810
We went over to d Rose's house apartment
the other night. Me, Keith Robinson,

698
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:01,080
de rose. I'm naming a lot of names
here. I usually don't do this shit,

699
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:03,570
but we got into this fucking debate.

700
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,350
Okay,

701
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:07,900
I don't want to do this because you
guys are going to blow up Joe's fucking

702
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:11,800
Twitter. And he gets all fucking of
sensitive about that shit. But we, well,

703
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,350
me and Joe gonna going to be
doing an uninformed again.

704
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,440
We have to have the debate.
It was basically,

705
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:22,441
it's centered around a certain
artists or certain artists and his,

706
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,330
uh,

707
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:30,390
unbelievable young wife and whether
or not this person was a creeper,

708
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,420
not and, oh, did it get heated?

709
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,350
Joe Actually got so mad. You
know, like when you get so mad,

710
00:45:38,351 --> 00:45:41,950
you're standing up and you imitate the
other person in the argument while you're

711
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:45,730
doing a dump dance. Like, I
know what you're going to say.

712
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,620
Woo. Started doing this dance. And
everyone started laughing at him.

713
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,500
It was fucking, I mean, it started
at 1:00 AM I finally had to leave.

714
00:45:56,501 --> 00:46:01,210
I was like, I have a dog. I got to go
home. Okay. I gotta take my dog out.

715
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,830
I think I left a little bit after
too, and I guess it kept going. Um,

716
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,480
and of course the next day we fucking
laughed about it. But, uh, God dammit.

717
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,930
Nother fucking great guy.
What was the last time? Well,

718
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:17,110
I guess sometimes somebody who stinks.
Overdoses. That's it. You don't,

719
00:46:17,111 --> 00:46:19,030
you don't wanna fucking wish
that on anybody, but uh,

720
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:20,580
okay.

721
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,020
Everybody's talking about Philip Seymour
Hoffman is amazing movies to talk about

722
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:27,780
how great he is.
How about how awesome he wasn't twister.

723
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,820
That guy was such a great actor. He
was even, he was even great in twister.

724
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,500
I remember the first time I saw him was
incentive a woman and I don't, I don't,

725
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,550
all I remember was like,
who to,

726
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,740
who is that actor when he was sitting at
that table and they had the one of the

727
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,310
council there for the school?
I can't,

728
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:46,140
I can never remember what the
fuck and movies are about.

729
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,270
It was all the shit that he was
doing when he wasn't speaking.

730
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,530
Okay.

731
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:59,240
Um, oh, like in Boogie nights when,

732
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,990
how subtly they let you on dead.

733
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:07,991
His character was gay when he was holding
on to that clipboard and he was biting

734
00:47:08,421 --> 00:47:13,010
on that pen. The total fallot fucking,
you know, we came up with that shit.

735
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:18,940
Then I also loved the way he was
standing in one of those scenes.

736
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:24,461
He had like his right arm was down and
then his left arm was across his body

737
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,710
grabbing onto like his
right elbow or vice versa,

738
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:33,130
which I remember like how many kids who
are really insecure used to stand like,

739
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:39,730
you know, when you were a kid, we would
size kids up and I'm in one of our,

740
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,800
I saw a kid standing like
that. It'd be like, all right,

741
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:44,500
I don't have to worry about that kid
trying to fucking kick the shit out of me.

742
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,300
Anybody who stands like that is the guard.
I didn't know that it meant garden.

743
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,410
I just thought it meant like you
were a pussy or something like that.

744
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:53,340
But I never saw an act or make a choice.
Even though I,

745
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,300
I've seen a zillion human beings do that.

746
00:47:55,301 --> 00:48:00,301
I saw him do that and like a boogie
nights of Grady wasn't big Lebowski,

747
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:04,030
just everything. I've
never even seen Kapolei I'm
embarrassed to say that, but uh,

748
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,810
it just sucks, man. He was on my favorite
stuff. Fucking blows that, right.

749
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:12,430
That isn't, that isn't funny, right? This
isn't what this is about, this podcast,

750
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,200
his podcast is supposed
to be making you laugh.

751
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,670
Get you a great start to your
day. Um, all right, let's,

752
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,700
let's continue on here. So in
answer to your question, sir,

753
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:26,440
I have no plans for,
uh, for the dooms day.

754
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:27,503
Um,

755
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:28,810
okay.

756
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,810
I'm going to get a bat.
That's what I'm going to do.

757
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:40,130
I get a gun, but you know, I'm
going to shoot it without earplugs.

758
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,220
My ears already ring from
playing drums and um,

759
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,590
I, I, you know, then what?

760
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,890
Then I win the battle and then my ears
ring even more and I'm walking around

761
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:53,950
with Tinnitus and there's
no fucking hope for a cure.

762
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,760
Forget tonight is I'm just praying
for toothpaste. I mean, fuck that.

763
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:02,470
I don't want to live. All right. Sochi,
is that how you say it? No. Yoshi,

764
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,250
uh,
Billy SSR.

765
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,450
Have you heard how much the
Olympics have costs so far?

766
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,590
5 billion. That's more than
the last 12 Olympics combined.

767
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,070
What do you think all
the extra money is going,

768
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:20,920
or where do you think all
the extra money's going? Um,

769
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,870
do you have any Olympic predictions?

770
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,793
MMM,

771
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:30,930
what I think all no extra money while
they got to make all that snow and that

772
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:32,910
extra snow in case it doesn't snow.

773
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:34,450
Okay.

774
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,290
I mean, just to cover a mountain and
snow when it hasn't snowed. I mean,

775
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,630
I figured that's got to cost
at least 2 billion. Right?

776
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,040
And you know, I know it
does. And how fucking now,

777
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:48,370
what do I think of when I think it's
an unbelievably corrupt country,

778
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,890
even more than one than
the one that I live in.

779
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:54,730
So I imagine all the scams that go on
here go on over there because they are

780
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:56,170
human beings just like us.

781
00:49:56,171 --> 00:50:00,790
And I think it's probably even fucking
10 times worse over there because of

782
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,290
where their jump off point was.

783
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:06,610
We at least had a nice phony jump off
point in this country that all men are

784
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:11,611
equal and everybody has the freedom of
speech and everybody has the right to

785
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:16,900
protest and a no taxation without
representation. We had a great fuck.

786
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:19,990
We had a way better lie
than they had in Russia.

787
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:21,510
Okay.

788
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,320
You know,

789
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,660
Russia's was just say everybody
gets the same amount of Meatloaf,

790
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,390
man. Right. At least from day one,

791
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,220
we knew that there was going to be people
gorging off high on the hog and the

792
00:50:35,221 --> 00:50:37,500
rest of us were getting pig feet.
We knew that shit,

793
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:40,140
but as long as someone else
was just getting the tail,

794
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,790
we were happy in the middle class and
that worked for a long fucking time.

795
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,420
And now it's over up.
Dude.

796
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:53,450
How about like these fucking hype about
how about these fucking three major

797
00:50:54,991 --> 00:50:59,800
bankers have killed themselves and the
last week and if we can get past well,

798
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:03,000
bad things happen in threes.
Um,

799
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,680
that scares the shit out of me.
I'm not going to lie to you.

800
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,870
Those guys were probably all making seven

801
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,810
to eight figures I would think.

802
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,280
Okay.

803
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,720
And they fucking off themselves and
there's no sign that a woman was involved

804
00:51:19,721 --> 00:51:22,570
that broke their hearts or you know,

805
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:24,881
I just,

806
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:29,590
that that is scary where they going to go
rogue and say what was really going on?

807
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,510
Are they just looking at that Ponzi
scheme and just thinking like, yeah,

808
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:36,460
there's just, there's no way to
fix it. The wolves are at the door.

809
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,560
I'm going to be the Oswald. I'm going to
be the fall guy. So they fucking get mad.

810
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,960
It's just insane. What are the
odds? What are the odds of that?

811
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:48,700
What was the last time like three major
oil people all killed themselves within

812
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:53,440
the same week for the love of God. Can I
get some conspiracy theory on this one?

813
00:51:53,441 --> 00:51:57,340
I would love to hear your theories.
I'd love to hear him. You know,

814
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:02,500
because that's the kind of guy I
am. Um, all right, where are we?

815
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:07,530
Let's get onto the next thing here.
Long distance hiking followup.

816
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,920
All right, here we go. Hey Bill.

817
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:13,090
A few weeks ago you asked for advice
on how to deal with animals in the

818
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:17,350
wilderness. Most people that get mauled
either left food in there. Oh yeah.

819
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:22,351
That's why I this massive fear about
going into the woods and accident

820
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,870
accidentally stumbling upon a,
uh,

821
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,820
a mamma bear with her cubs
or a, a, a mountain line.

822
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:35,950
I'm always on a trail. And to the left
or the right of me is a higher like,

823
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,250
like cliff and the thing is
just sitting there. You don't,

824
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:41,950
you know when they sit there and they
put their head down and they're fucking

825
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:46,630
shoulder and back muscles go like
fucking like if they were in a muscle

826
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:49,810
competition, like that would be like
the Schwartzenegger like stance.

827
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:53,170
They put their head down. You know what
I'm saying? Just waiting to pounce on me.

828
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,550
And this is what the project says.
Most people get mauled either. Uh,

829
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:02,730
most people that get mauled either left
food in their tent or tried to pose for

830
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:07,090
a picture with the animal or did some
other dumb shit you would never do.

831
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:07,961
But yes,

832
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:12,280
on very rare occasions and animal will
attack somebody who did nothing wrong.

833
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:17,200
Here is my advice. If that happens,
first of all, you did do something wrong.

834
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,280
You've ventured out into the wilderness,
you left the tribe,

835
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,810
you put yourself at
risk. All right? I mean,

836
00:53:24,811 --> 00:53:27,320
I guess if you're in your
backyard and there's a bear there,

837
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:29,570
but if there's a bear in your backyard,
you,

838
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,050
that's urban sprawl that when
he's not in your backyard,

839
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,330
you're in his front yard.

840
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:39,170
There's no fucking reason a bear
should be outside your house.

841
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,920
You need to move back down towards the
village. You're right, they're antisocial.

842
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:48,050
Get a hobby. Say hello to somebody
you know, have a couple of drinks.

843
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:51,830
Get some alcohol, courage,
India, and go walk up to the
pretty girl. Say Hello. Okay.

844
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:55,100
Stop trying to live with the
fucking house. All right? Bears.

845
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,590
If you're attacked by a bear,

846
00:53:57,591 --> 00:54:02,591
you should leave your backpack on to
protect your back and use your hands to

847
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:05,180
cover your neck.
What about your face?

848
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,820
Usually the bear will leave after a while,
but if it starts to chew on you,

849
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:15,710
that's when you need to fight back. Oh,
really? What? What should I go with?

850
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,270
Should I set up the,
you know,

851
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:22,190
the overhand right with a couple of
jabs or should I try to kick him in his,

852
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:26,810
uh, bear balls? What if it's
a woman? What do I do? Do.

853
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:30,020
I try to stick my toe when it's badge.
Uh,

854
00:54:30,021 --> 00:54:33,440
it's bare Vage it's badge. Um, mount wines

855
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,610
with mountain lions
playing dead will not work.

856
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,560
You need to fight back right away.

857
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,970
Your best chance is to
aim for the nose and eyes.

858
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:49,950
Dude, this is fucking hilarious.
I mean, I, I think I would have,

859
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,190
this is none of this shit work
wouldn't work against Mike Tyson.

860
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:56,470
Forget about a fucking
bear or a mountain line.

861
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:01,450
Wolves playing dead won't
work in a wolf attack either.

862
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,720
You can either climb a tree,
put it in a headlock,

863
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,520
or shove your fist down its
throat. I'm not joking. Look it up.

864
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,580
You know what? I always thought you
could do a, I don't know about it.

865
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:17,160
A Wolf I always thought
against this was my,

866
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:18,590
yeah.

867
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:18,860
Well,
you know,

868
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,820
when I'm laying in bed and I'm thinking
about getting attacked by a fucking,

869
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:27,260
you know, some rabid dog or
whatever, if somebody was sick,

870
00:55:27,261 --> 00:55:30,650
that dog on me when I'm laying in bed,

871
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:34,580
totally relaxed and have my wits about
me and I don't have a urine running down,

872
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,570
my leg is, I run towards my
Prius, like I wouldn't real life.

873
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,800
I um,

874
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:48,110
my plan of attack was when the
fucking dog is coming at you,

875
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:52,160
you stick your forearm out
and you just feed it to them.

876
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,280
You just jam it right into his fucking
mouth and right as it climbs down and it

877
00:55:58,881 --> 00:55:59,660
has you,

878
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:04,660
you then take your other fucking
forearm and you come up over the top,

879
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,970
smashed down on the
top of the things neck.

880
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:12,620
As you push your forum up and you
break its neck, do you go Bam,

881
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:19,000
which is the sound of a broken neck flap.
I'm sorry,

882
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:22,280
I don't want to make the snap noise.
I don't have a twig in here. That's,

883
00:56:22,281 --> 00:56:26,570
that was my game plan. Either that or
just stick your arm in there and you just,

884
00:56:26,571 --> 00:56:29,360
you just fucking start
stepping on the dog's feet

885
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,550
because dogs are kind of pussies,
man. They'll go after you,

886
00:56:34,551 --> 00:56:37,700
but the second you fucking do something
back to you, do you know what it is?

887
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,290
They don't have any shame.

888
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:43,730
They don't mind going and then
getting hit and then going

889
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,880
like, they don't give a shit.
It's not like other dogs again.

890
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,390
They can literally do that and then go
on the other side of the block and get

891
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:56,130
laid. There's like, no,

892
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,580
and they don't even remember
what just happened and less,

893
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:04,130
there's still pain in their
little dog paws. So, um,

894
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,320
I don't fucking know. I don't even know
what I'm talking about here. These,

895
00:57:07,321 --> 00:57:11,280
these are all like,
these are all creepy fucking questions.

896
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:16,020
I always felt if I was on a boat and I
saw an alligator swimming towards one of

897
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:19,350
my friends and it went
by the boat or a shark,

898
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:24,620
I would just try to time it where I jumped
down and I just fucking land right on

899
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:28,260
its head. And I just figured that
that alone would so freak it out.

900
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:31,680
They would leave or you know,

901
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,550
the shark or alligators would be,
uh, would be feasting on to people.

902
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:40,380
That's what I would be worried about
after the show, after the shock, you know,

903
00:57:40,381 --> 00:57:43,380
when the sharks, like what the few
motherfucker, when it's coming back,

904
00:57:43,381 --> 00:57:46,870
that's what I think. Like sharks,
I think just leave alligators. I,

905
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:51,480
they just seem fucking relentless
to me. Um, all right, killer bees.

906
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:55,620
Here we go with killer bees.
Africanized honey bees.

907
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,910
You're supposed to run away for at
least half a mile. Now this I know,

908
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:04,050
do not flail your arms
and do not kill one.

909
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,880
They will swarm you if you kill one.
But honestly they,

910
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,060
they look just like normal bs to me.

911
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:16,970
So I don't know how to tell when
you're in danger. Oh my God.

912
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:21,170
Run for a half a mile
for fucking half a mile.

913
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:25,010
What's the fastest,
fastest mile I ever ran was like a six,

914
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:30,370
18 like freshman year in high school
when I weighed about 140 something pounds

915
00:58:30,891 --> 00:58:32,480
and now a buck 75.

916
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:38,420
So I think I could run maybe a
seven minute, even with the fear,

917
00:58:38,421 --> 00:58:41,600
just the pain is going
to offset the adrenaline.

918
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:46,550
That's going to be a long 15 minutes.
People. Oh God. Can you imagine me?

919
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,630
Balding Stung up.
Fucking swollen redhead,

920
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:59,670
just coming over their health. Jesus
Christ. What a site. All right.

921
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:01,740
Spiders kill almost nobody.

922
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,010
Most can be very dangerous if
you catch them at the wrong time.

923
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,340
Some snake bites obviously
require immediate medical care,

924
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:12,120
but I would be more afraid of
lightening if I were you. So yes,

925
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:15,900
it can get gruesome, but these attacks
are very rare. Absolutely. I mean,

926
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:20,490
I know shark attacks a very rare, but it's
just like, I would love to try surfing,

927
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:22,480
but just, you know, just
the fact that, you know,

928
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,160
you got to stand that surfing is a
sport where you're risking getting eaten

929
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:31,740
alive. I mean, it's just fucking,
I mean, it's just not worth it.

930
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,330
Goddammit. It looks like
fun though, doesn't it?

931
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,940
But all right. Basic travel
advice or what, you know,

932
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:41,980
I got to read some more,
uh,

933
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,970
advertising here before I get on with this
fucking bullshit. Yeah. Uh, live reads.

934
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:51,120
All right, we got two more of your
body. Two more, two more, two more.

935

01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,840
That's Eva [inaudible]
dot com Promo code bill c.

995
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,550
Then I talked a little bit of Shit and
then I fucked up a lot in the last one,

996
01:03:35,551 --> 01:03:40,260
but still much better than the,
uh, than the past there. All right,

997
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:43,740
let's continue on here. Um, all right.

998
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:47,700
Basic travel advice.
A good morning.

999
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:51,180
To our fearless leader,
sir. Billiard of bald.

1000
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,700
Uh,
I am 24,

1001
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:58,290
I'm a 24 year old and me and the
wife are taking a trip to Chicago.

1002
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:03,440
Wanted some advice on a couple of things.
Neither of us has ever planned on a,

1003
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,730
has ever been on a plane before.
You are a frequent flyer.

1004
01:04:06,731 --> 01:04:09,870
So why don't want it to know exactly
what we can expect at the airport,

1005
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,680
when to be there. What close to
prepare to take off at what time,

1006
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:17,790
problems we will mostly raw,
most likely run into et cetera.

1007
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:22,860
Jesus Christ. Dude. Um, all right,

1008
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:26,070
well go ahead and pack and then take a
third of that stuff and throw it over

1009
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:30,150
your fucking shoulder cause
you never gonna wear it. Um,

1010
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,960
depending on how long you're leaving,
if it's just a weekend,

1011
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:37,110
I would go with the carry on. If
it isn't, I would check everything,

1012
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,660
walk onto the plane with a couple of
magazines in order a drink and watch and

1013
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:46,710
just enjoy watching everybody
else fighting, you know,

1014
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,420
for that overhead space. Fuck
them. Um, that would be my advice.

1015
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:55,440
And also just know that your wife is
going to bring half the fucking house and

1016
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:59,430
it's not worth telling her that she's
not going to need it. All right. Um,

1017
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:03,750
the only thing worse than having to pay
for extra bags is watching her cry that

1018
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:04,800
there's nothing to wear.

1019
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:09,120
And then having to go downstairs to
the fucking lobby mall there and pay 10

1020
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:12,840
times the price to get her a fucking
dress. All right. Number two,

1021
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,710
best places to eat there.
Best Burgers of pizza.

1022
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:18,930
A personal favorite too.

1023
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:22,380
I would like to add than I am milk
white and red headed like you.

1024
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:27,590
So place that is not in the stabby
stabby Magee Magee part of town would be

1025
01:05:28,411 --> 01:05:33,030
preferred. Really wanting some advice
from an experienced vet. Thanks.

1026
01:05:33,031 --> 01:05:35,850
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,

1027
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,730
I don't know where the best
places already eaten Chicago.

1028
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:42,330
Like I visit there and I just eat it the
closest place and then I go and do my

1029
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:46,110
show according to Jim
Croce. Uh, the south side,

1030
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:51,120
the south side of Chicago is
the baddest part of town. MMM.

1031
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,670
But if you go down there, you better
best be ware of a man named Leroy Brown.

1032
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,070
And um,

1033
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,730
I believe he has a custom
continental and he has a Cadillac to,

1034
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,600
he got it. 32 gun in his pocket, full fun.

1035
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:12,430
He got raised up any shoe
Ratto and he's bad, bad. Um,

1036
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:15,940
I don't know where to fucking eat there.
All I know is that a, what you should do,

1037
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:19,690
you can find all of that out on a website.
One of those Foodie fucking websites.

1038
01:06:19,691 --> 01:06:23,920
They'll tell you where
to go. Um, so, but it's,

1039
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:25,270
those foody things can be wrong.

1040
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:30,070
A lot of the times what you want to
do is ask a local whatever you stay,

1041
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,290
just find somebody who has a heavy
Chicago accent and just say, listen,

1042
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,260
I'm a tourist.
I don't want to go to the touristy place.

1043
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:41,950
Where do you go to get whatever the fuck
you're looking for? You want a pizza?

1044
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:46,030
You want a burger? And that guy will tell
you, all right, that's the way to do it.

1045
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:50,770
Okay, here we go. All right.
Uh, oh, by the way, you know,

1046
01:06:50,771 --> 01:06:53,820
I forgot to mention when I saw that
drum clinic, the common thread one,

1047
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:56,830
there was a musician there,
uh,

1048
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,660
drew of a band called drew of the drew.
Um,

1049
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:06,130
if you like not mainstream music and
you'd like to see somebody who's really

1050
01:07:06,131 --> 01:07:09,100
trying to do something different,
uh, check that guy out.

1051
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,440
Yeah.

1052
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,660
Um, I was, I was very, uh, very impressed.

1053
01:07:14,661 --> 01:07:18,410
It made me feel old, like they would,
they would draw in from shit that like,

1054
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:21,290
to me,
I already considered like new music.

1055
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:26,980
Like all that Dj Dubstep Shit like to me
is like came out in the last six months

1056
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:30,710
even though it's probably been
around for fucking 20 years. Um,

1057
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:36,770
anyways, drew of the drew, check
it out. Anyways, Jane. Oh, phobia.

1058
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,130
Maybe I'll, I'll put up, I'll put
up a link actually. A Billy bobag.

1059
01:07:40,131 --> 01:07:45,131
Baggins is it gain or phobia you
afraid of the gynecologists a fucking,

1060
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:50,630
uh, I am a 28 year old
college guy. Who has,

1061
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,470
was it Jane or Phobia?
The fear of women?

1062
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:59,630
I've never heard of this. Uh,
he said, when I was a kid,

1063
01:07:59,631 --> 01:08:01,490
I used to get the shit kicked out of me,

1064
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,650
and girls would always spread rumors
about me and it would really screw with my

1065
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:09,670
mind. Wait a minute, you didn't
get along with men or women.

1066
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,200
Well, what were you, what
were you doing? You know what?

1067
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:18,680
That's the last thing needed to hear.
Well, what's wrong with you? I'm sorry.

1068
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,530
Forgive me. I'm not a trained
professional, so you know,

1069
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:26,360
you're asking more on and you know
I'm going to behave accordingly.

1070
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:27,590
Here we go.
As I grew up,

1071
01:08:27,591 --> 01:08:32,360
I started to resent and hate all the
people around me that my mother tells me

1072
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:36,410
about false rape accusations.
And that makes, oh,

1073
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:41,680
and that makes females look even
more scarier than they already were.

1074
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:45,440
See, guys, just kick the shit out of you.

1075
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:50,950
Females psychologically fuck you up bad
and don't even have a tint of remorse or

1076
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:56,690
empathy. Jesus Christ. All right, dude.

1077
01:08:56,691 --> 01:09:01,100
So your mother's a psycho and she
put all these fears on you. Yeah,

1078
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:04,040
you gotta maybe I would seek some
professional help before you turn it into

1079
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:07,400
Norman Bates. Uh, all right,
let's continue this then.

1080
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:12,080
I hear about all the women raping men
in the divorce courts and in general

1081
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:16,730
adding more fuel to the fear. Dude,
you're over thinking this shit. I mean,

1082
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:19,760
you probably heard half of that from me,
but I'm an idiot. Don't listen to me.

1083
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:24,470
He says, gotten to the point where
when a female introduces herself to me,

1084
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:29,030
I just see her as a potential mind
raping and prolonged exercise of getting

1085
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:33,800
verbally abused. So I just
always say sorry, but I have
somewhere to be right now.

1086
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:34,643
Goodbye.

1087
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:38,403
Okay.

1088
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,830
And I walk away, sir, can
I steal that from you?

1089
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:48,340
I want to use that next time they get
pulled over. Yeah. License Reza. Sorry.

1090
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:52,140
When I have somewhere to be
right now, goodbye. And you just,

1091
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:54,640
just act like the rain man and
they'll fucking leave you alone.

1092
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:57,820
That's actually brilliant. Uh,
he said they scare me so much,

1093
01:09:57,821 --> 01:10:00,880
but I'm still attracted to them.
Oh my God, Dude. You listen,

1094
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:03,820
you gotta you gotta you
gotta get past this.

1095
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,600
Hopefully you're still
young and this is early on,

1096
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:10,780
but this is something where you were,
you know,

1097
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:14,000
everybody is trying to go towards the uh,
late,

1098
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:18,010
we'll just call it a whatever
planet live happily ever after.

1099
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,200
But if you're off by just one degree,

1100
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,400
you're not really going to notice
when you're 22, 24, you know,

1101
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:28,090
but by the time you're 40, you're going
to be about a million miles off course.

1102
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:32,730
So let's try to get you some help.
I would go see a therapist or,

1103
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,840
um,
and I know I've been joking around,

1104
01:10:34,841 --> 01:10:38,800
but I kind of have to do that
because this is a podcast. But, um,

1105
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,340
well actually because it's a podcast,
it's supposed to be funny.

1106
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:47,410
I'm not saying you can't
have a series podcast. Um,

1107
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,700
yeah, I would go get some help quickly
and I would get rid of all those fears.

1108
01:10:51,701 --> 01:10:55,000
And I would say a lot of
the fears are probably, uh,

1109
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:58,120
put into your head by your mom when you
were really young and you need to try to

1110
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:01,570
get those out of there before they take
any more route than they already do

1111
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:06,160
already have. Well, it's finished
here. He said, my mind says,

1112
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:10,360
stay the fuck away while my Dick
says do it. Do it. Fucking do it. Uh,

1113
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:12,940
but in this climate of unrestrained female

1114
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,470
hypo agents,
and what the fuck that mean?

1115
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,380
This shit that makes
women invade male spaces,

1116
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,590
it makes them change everything
to suit them. Dude, dude,

1117
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,230
you're taking your fucking fear
of women. You're, yeah, you're,

1118
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,140
you're blowing by me.
Listen, are you a great guy?

1119
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:34,800
If you're a great guy, there's a
great woman out there for you and the,

1120
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:38,370
and it's a beautiful thing
then not all like this.

1121
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:41,550
What you're doing is you're taking the
worst of the worst of females and you're

1122
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:46,460
printing it with a broad
brush. All right? Um, oh,

1123
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:49,080
Jesus Christ. I'm relating
to this guy here. He said,

1124
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:52,110
I'd rather stay celibate for life.
All right. Now I don't relate to that.

1125
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,480
I am a loner to a vast degree,

1126
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:58,560
but I got a loving family to back me up
so I ain't on the fringe or anything.

1127
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:01,620
I plan on just working
towards my career and it did.

1128
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:03,690
I write this like 20 years ago.

1129
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,560
Jesus Christ plan on just working
towards my career in education.

1130
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:11,610
But either way I'll have to deal with
women and it's been hard to do since

1131
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:12,840
lately too.

1132
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:17,100
So lately since my social skills
tanked over the last nine months.

1133
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:18,680
Yeah.

1134
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,221
Trauma,

1135
01:12:19,221 --> 01:12:24,080
Conga Line of horrific events happened
and I am working on getting the

1136
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:28,400
confidence back through Brazilian
Jujitsu already lost 11 pounds and I'm

1137
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:32,000
starting to feel a lot better. All right,
well just don't go choke out any women.

1138
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:36,620
All right, I'll try to put
them in the triangle. He said
anyways, is there any way,

1139
01:12:36,621 --> 01:12:38,560
but martial arts are a great way to uh,

1140
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,690
build self esteem from what I've
heard anyways. Is there any,

1141
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,740
is there any way to get rid of the insane
fear I have about women or is it just

1142
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:49,670
15 years of hurt that'll take
almost forever an undo. Thanks.

1143
01:12:49,671 --> 01:12:54,080
And go fuck yourself six ways from
Sunday and good luck with your standup.

1144
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:57,920
Um, all right, I'll see. You were
only 15 is that what you're saying?

1145
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:02,010
All right dude. First of all, it's
great you took up Brazilian Jujitsu.

1146
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:05,000
We should know how to defend yourself.
And a don't be a content about it.

1147
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:09,620
When you become a black belt, uh, use
it to save nerds and protect yourself,

1148
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:13,460
but never be a bully. Um,
and then as far as women,

1149
01:13:13,461 --> 01:13:17,570
I would actually try and talk to somebody
about this and I would try to have

1150
01:13:17,571 --> 01:13:21,110
more of an open mind because right now
if you're only 15 years old or even if

1151
01:13:21,111 --> 01:13:25,160
you're young in your early twenties,
mid twenties, you're basically,

1152
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:29,480
you got the lottery pick as
far as women goes. All right.

1153
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:34,220
They're all available.
All first round draft picks,

1154
01:13:34,221 --> 01:13:39,120
bunch of first round draft picks
just sitting there and you know,

1155
01:13:39,121 --> 01:13:42,870
depending on when you open your mouth
and start talking to one is when you pick

1156
01:13:42,871 --> 01:13:45,840
in the draft, if you know what I
mean. Sooner rather than later.

1157
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:50,410
But I would just talk to
somebody about, um, about,

1158
01:13:50,411 --> 01:13:53,410
about some of your issues.
Maybe it's school,

1159
01:13:53,411 --> 01:13:56,710
they got some free fucking therapy or
something like that if you're too young to

1160
01:13:56,711 --> 01:13:57,544
pay for it.

1161
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,010
But,
um,

1162
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:02,800
I dunno,
I would talk to somebody,

1163
01:14:02,801 --> 01:14:06,590
I would talk to some of your
guy friends about it. I would,

1164
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:07,391
you know what I would do,

1165
01:14:07,391 --> 01:14:12,391
I would openly talk about
your fear of women to,

1166
01:14:12,561 --> 01:14:16,750
um, to friends. You know, and I would,

1167
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,660
I would sit down with your
mother and just say, listen,

1168
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,480
I have major issues with women right now.

1169
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:25,630
And I think some of it stems from a lot
of the negative things that you've said

1170
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:30,610
about them. And I need you to stop doing
that because it's fucking with me. Don't,

1171
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:35,260
don't say that part, but say it in a
nicer way. Um, but if she's, you know,

1172
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,233
I dunno.

1173
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:38,750
Yeah.

1174
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:42,110
That's the hardest fucking thing is
because you are born into the religion of

1175
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:47,111
your parents ain't no and
into all of their beliefs.

1176
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,200
And hopefully they have more
good than bad, but they're human.

1177
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:54,230
So they're going to be wrong.
And you know,

1178
01:14:54,231 --> 01:14:58,010
when you're a little toddler all the
way through like seven, eight years old,

1179
01:14:58,011 --> 01:14:58,940
your parents are God.

1180
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:01,940
Like you just think they know everything
and they have all the answers.

1181
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:05,630
They never look unsure.
You do everything that they fucking say.

1182
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:07,750
Okay.

1183
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:11,950
So a lot of that stuff just really
takes deep root. Like, it's,

1184
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:16,980
it's law in your head and
then he is a teenage years.

1185
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:20,470
Did you start breaking away? You realize
some of his bullshit and let's win.

1186
01:15:20,471 --> 01:15:22,570
Some anger can come out
and that type of stuff.

1187
01:15:22,571 --> 01:15:26,200
So I would say what you're
going through is normal.

1188
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,930
It's just that you maybe had an extreme,

1189
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:32,290
a helping of some fucking anti woman shit,

1190
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:36,280
which I can relate to because I did too.
When I had to fight through that shit.

1191
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,230
I mean it took me out and
get married till I was 45.

1192
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:43,360
I had made your fucking issues. But
uh, it's like anything, look, it,

1193
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,270
just use the martial arts thing as a,

1194
01:15:46,271 --> 01:15:50,170
a metaphor or a simile,
whatever the fuck you're supposed to.

1195
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,730
Whatever the right terminology is. Look
at you. You did that. You stuck with that.

1196
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:58,540
You lost 11 pounds. You work towards
that. Look at, look at what you're,

1197
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:02,530
you're getting, you're getting positive
results and it hasn't been easy. Right?

1198
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:05,200
But You keep showing up.
You get positive results.

1199
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,720
I would do the same thing
with your women issues.

1200
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:12,250
I would just start working
on it. Um, you know,

1201
01:16:12,251 --> 01:16:15,490
next time a woman comes up and says hello,
don't say I have somewhere to go.

1202
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,240
Just say hello back and stay in the
conversation for as long as you can.

1203
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,000
And when you feel like
Bailey, just say, listen,

1204
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,900
I'm really shy around women and it's
something that I'm trying to work on.

1205
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:26,980
Just put it out there.

1206
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:31,600
And you know what I guarantee
80% of them are going to say, oh,

1207
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,350
you know, when they do that, they're
going to love it. And next thing you know,

1208
01:16:35,351 --> 01:16:40,210
you're out there watching a romantic
comedy with some lady having a good time.

1209
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:43,690
But I would, I would address it sooner
than later. I'm telling you, dude,

1210
01:16:43,691 --> 01:16:47,890
it's you literally, it's, you think
it's a mountain. It's, it's a fucking,

1211
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:50,350
it's stepping up onto the curb.
It's all in your head.

1212
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:55,420
And that's totally normal because I would
guess that your fears started when you

1213
01:16:55,421 --> 01:17:00,010
were in your, my mom's godlike phase of
your life. So you think, you think it's,

1214
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:03,340
uh,
what's that fucking mountain everybody.

1215
01:17:03,341 --> 01:17:07,090
Everest that everybody tries to
climb up. It isn't. It isn't. Okay.

1216
01:17:07,091 --> 01:17:11,270
It's a little fucking ant
hill. And Don, you can do it.
All right. I believe in you.

1217
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:14,840
Good luck, sir. There you go. Well,
that's the podcast for this week.

1218
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:20,270
Congratulations to the, um,
to the Seattle Seahawks.

1219
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:25,010
All right.
You finally won.

1220
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:31,360
You fucking won the Superbowl and
now I can't give you any more shit.

1221
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:36,080
Actually, I still will just stop
doing that loudest crowd ever. Right?

1222
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:39,290
You got the fucking trophy. You been there
now act like you've been there before.

1223
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:43,490
Do not disappoint me next year. You know,
it's, you know, it's coming next year.

1224
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:48,500
You know, it is. There's going to be so
many people dressed up like characters.

1225
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:53,240
You're going to make the raider fans,
I don't even know what the expression is.

1226
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:54,920
I don't know what happened.
Jesus Christ,

1227
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:57,170
whatever happened in
that rate of fan base,

1228
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:02,090
that crushes me every time they panned to
the end zone and everybody's out there.

1229
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:04,910
Somebody dressed like Fred Flintstone.
It's like, what are you doing?

1230
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,450
I'm all right. That's the podcast.
Oh, by the way, and I forgot to,

1231
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,740
I have been watching our,
actually,

1232
01:18:12,741 --> 01:18:17,060
I watched a bunch of hockey this week
because of, uh, you know, I didn't watch,

1233
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,190
watch any of the Superbowl
hype, but Gee, Oh gee.

1234
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,830
[inaudible] with that Bruins performance
against the Canadians. Jesus Christ.

1235
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:28,850
How do you not get up for a
game against the Canadians?

1236
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:31,250
I know the Canadians have a good team,
but Jesus Christ,

1237
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:34,940
we looked fucking horrific.
Um,

1238
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:38,000
but it's good though. It's all
good. Canadians have a good team,

1239
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:42,320
so hopefully we'll meet each other
in the playoffs. Playoffs and a,

1240
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:46,550
we'll have another classic.
That's what I'm hoping for.
So, uh, all right. That's it.

1241
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,350
I'm at, where the hell am I? This week?

1242
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:53,740
I'm going to be in a casino
in a outside of Minneapolis.

1243
01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:55,220
It's already sold out,

1244
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:58,790
so thank you to everybody in Davenport
and every other goddamn city out there in

1245
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:01,460
Minnesota.
And I can't wait to get out there.

1246
01:19:01,461 --> 01:19:05,630
Hopefully it doesn't fucking snow too bad.
And I'm able to land without incident.

1247
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,570
All right, that's it. I'll talk to
you next week. Go fuck yourselves.
