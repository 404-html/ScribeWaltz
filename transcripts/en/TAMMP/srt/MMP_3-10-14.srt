1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,060
Hey, what's going on as bill burn? It's
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:10,780
March 10th,
2014 how you're doing?

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,850
How I um,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,530
I am in a country mood this week and I
have deaf desperately trying to bring

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,780
something positive. All right. I've been
on the road here for 10 fucking days.

6
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:24,400
I was going to do this
thing with Versie again,

7
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:28,510
but he's still sleeping and I got to
get this thing up and get on with my day

8
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:31,060
cause I got a two hour ride out to London,

9
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:34,570
Ontario tonight and I
got a fucking job to do.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,810
I'm in the middle of a fucking eight
day run kit, you know, seven days.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,010
Then I got Montreal tomorrow
and then I got a day off.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,480
I got a fucking day off and I'm going
to go to the Bruins Canadians game.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,900
And um,
you know,

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,560
I have a great fucking time
cause you can hear my voice is a,

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,070
it's actually better. It doesn't sound
better, but it's actually better.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,090
It's holding up.
Well,

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,150
today is the halfway point
of the epic 20 Day Canadian.

18
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:11,750
Tor. Tor. Tor, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um,

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,720
we're having a great time up here.
Um, probably too much fun. Uh,

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,490
um, off the wagon as of last
Monday. Um, but you know,

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,640
I only got fucked up twice this week.
You know,

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,780
I got really fucked up about two nights
ago, but other than that, and uh, I,

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,570
I didn't miss being hung over.
So for the most part,

24
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:35,860
like last night I had a beer two nights
before that I had one glass of wine.

25
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,060
I mean,
if you want to call that,

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,720
if you want to call that ticky
tack shit drinking. All right?

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,070
You want to sit there with your fucking
toes pointed at each other and your

28
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,080
knees together.
Right?

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,260
Like some fucking jerk off waiting for a
bus in a Norman Rockwell painting then,

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,240
then you, you do that. All
right. I don't count those. Okay.

31
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:03,220
For what I heard a glass of wine
every day is actually good for you.

32
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,970
Fucking arteries.
Race.

33
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,640
Yeah.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,540
Oh, you hear that somebody finally
committed a crime up here in Canada.

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,630
What did he do? Did he put on
somebody else's skates? Oh,

36
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:21,070
sorry about that. Sorry. I like these
people up here. Everybody says, sorry,

37
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:25,580
I say sorry all the time. You know,
hey, there's this pancake you made.

38
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:29,050
Tastes like a fucking, somebody
wiped her ass with it. Sorry.

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,880
I'm sorry you didn't, you suck
it. Make it a pancake. Right.

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,880
Um,
I actually had an apple for breakfast.

41
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:41,881
If you're wandering trying to stay
in shape when I'm up here now,

42
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,260
it was kitten who, I'm not going to
lie to you guys. I am fucking shot. I,

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,230
I've been just traveling and doing
my God damn act every fucking night.

44
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,270
I am so sick of my God damn voice,

45
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,050
which is great because it's making me
say new stuff on stage and I've been

46
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:00,520
writing a lot. Now I'm not saying
that I actually sit down and write.

47
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:05,080
What I'm really saying is I'm just
saying different shit on stage and um,

48
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,070
you know, it was a lot of shit. Jokes,
flooded Dick Jokes. But you know,

49
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,540
I'm getting through it. It's been a,
it's been amazing. Absolutely amazing.

50
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,220
We're on a four day run here in a,
in Toronto and the Greater Toronto area.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,190
Uh, we started off down in, uh,

52
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,210
I don't even know what the Fuck Hammer
Ville Hammerstein I don't know what it is,

53
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,220
but the nickname is fucking ham.
Hamilton.

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,850
The nickname is hammertime stop.

55
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,280
Hammertime Doo Doo doot doot boop boop.
Um,

56
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,080
was unbelievable.
Great fucking show down there.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,880
And then I also found out for a buddy
of mine that around the corner was a,

58
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:46,840
with at that unreal team. Canada
game was in 1987 when they, uh,

59
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:51,370
when they beat the Russians
Gretzky Lemieux right?

60
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,260
You guys,
were you guys member D of fucking member?

61
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,940
Um, I died, let's see,
I played a pickup game,

62
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:05,890
a hockey and Ottawa. That was great. Me
and verse, he skated on the frozen canal.

63
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,280
We held hands and split a beaver tail
and whispered sweet nothings into one

64
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:16,610
another's ears. We didn't get a beaver
tail, but the rest of it happens.

65
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,100
All right, then I stand by it. No, we,
uh, we did skate on the canal, man.

66
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:25,510
It's fucking unbelievable.
Ottawa. Underrated. Brutally,

67
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,300
brutally,
brutally fucking underrated.

68
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,690
You want to surprise your girlfriend
or soon to be wife with a honeymoon.

69
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,870
She'll never forget or
possibly forgive you for,

70
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,860
take her to Ottaway everybody.
It's a government town.

71
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:46,030
Did you guys know that Ottawa is the
capital of Canada? I didn't know that.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,550
It's one of those towns.

73
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:52,060
Everybody's got the big government job
and right around five everybody takes off

74
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,470
and even the Starbucks closes.

75
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,830
But if you go across the fucking river
is a bunch of places to get yourself a

76
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:03,400
beer.
It was a little a rink out here.

77
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,010
I Dunno, it's guys I got, I
have absolutely nothing. Um,

78
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,790
I'm too old to be on tour this long.
And uh, today's the halfway point.

79
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:17,740
So I got another 10 days and I'm
out of the 10 days to go on this.

80
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:21,840
Last night I was at our Massey
Hall. For those of you who, um,

81
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,920
never heard of it. Um, if you favorite
band has ever played a show there,

82
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:30,580
it's worth taking a trip. Unbelievable.
Second I walked out there,

83
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,850
I was saying diversity like Jesus Christ.
I'd love to take a special here.

84
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,620
But then I heard, um, I heard their fees
as through the fucking roof. Of course.

85
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,310
You know, like I'm the only asshole that
walked in there and said, you know what,

86
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:46,420
I said, this will look visually
look really good on Cuba. Um,

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,400
but uh,
yeah,

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,910
it was definitely a very humbling to be
on that thing because I kind of looked

89
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:55,180
up some of the history before I got
out there and evidently one night,

90
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,160
miles Davis,
Charlie Parker,

91
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,630
Charles Mingus and fucking Max Roach
put on arguably one of the greatest

92
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,030
concerts of all time.
Louie Armstrong played there.

93
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,690
I'm not a big rush fan,
but I guess that uh,

94
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,370
all the world's a stage they
filmed there are recorded there.

95
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:20,480
Neil young recorded some stuff there and
then old Billy red face came in and did

96
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,560
he shit and Dick Jokes.

97
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,690
I had some guy after the show told me
that he saw George Carlin performed there

98
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:27,800
in the 80s. So it was definitely, uh,

99
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,270
it was pretty awesome to become a,
I don't know,

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,690
part of that history there. Uh,
I'm definitely fucking coming back.

101
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:38,720
So here's the deal. So at the
end of the show, you know,

102
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,590
versus he wants to go see that fucking
movie where somebody is getting murdered

103
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,180
on a plane every 10 minutes.

104
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:48,560
And for some reason they can't figure
out who the fuck's doing it. Okay.

105
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,870
And I'm sitting here having this
argument with first he's going to,

106
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,650
I'm not going to go see that shit.
And he's like, he's like, dude,

107
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:59,300
it's fucking Liam Neeson, Liam Neeson
Nizam, whatever the fuck you say his name.

108
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,210
And I'm like, I liked that guy. Okay.

109
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,900
But snakes on a plane
is snakes on a plane,

110
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,460
even if there's no snakes on the plane.
You know what I mean? It is what it is.

111
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,290
It's fucking still good.

112
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,840
And I know somebody going to shoot
a gun on the plane, you know?

113
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,210
And somehow, even if
he misses it, I dunno,

114
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,640
just, it's fucking dumb. It's just dumb.

115
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:30,990
As back in the day when they had
a smoking section on an airplane,

116
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:35,370
you remember dice Clay's bed, you're
in a fucking tube. It's the same thing.

117
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:40,230
If you're talking about smoking or you're
talking about a fucking murder mystery.

118
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,640
How many God damn people could you
fucking kill on a plane. And you know,

119
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,980
somehow the fucking guys going to be
able to climb down into the luggage area.

120
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,030
It's gonna pull up some carpet
and there'll be a trap door there.

121
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,420
I must have flown on 9,000
fucking planes in my life.

122
00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:01,710
Can somebody please tell me where that
fucking trap door is? It doesn't exist.

123
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,570
It's a separate fucking compartment.
It has to be.

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,420
And even if it isn't after nine 11 I'm
sure they fucking welded it shut, right?

125
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,440
They always show that movie. Somebody
goes down to visit their fucking dog,

126
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,690
right? And then there's some sweaty
Middle Eastern look and guy down there.

127
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,580
That's what they have now.
Back in the day,

128
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:26,740
it was some sweaty Russian looking guy.

129
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,700
It's whoever the fuck
were at odds with any,

130
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:33,880
they're always sweaty and they
need a shave and that down there.

131
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:34,960
And they have absolutely,
you know,

132
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:38,230
and they have absolutely no
fucking morals whatsoever.

133
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,040
And they're always down there
in the fucking luggage. Right?

134
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,560
And then he got the John McClane guy.

135
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,450
How many fucking guys have been on the
fucking plane? John McClain did one.

136
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:52,570
Then he,
Bruce Willis has been on the plane.

137
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,080
Wesley snipes has been on the always
bet on black mother fucker, right?

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,500
You thought that one was the last
one. He comes, oh, Liam Neeson.

139
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,463
Okay.

140
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,270
You know something?
Fuck air fucked movies on airplanes.

141
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,320
Okay.

142
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,550
Fuck all of them.
They all,

143
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,650
you name me one movie that took place
on a fucking airplane. That was good.

144
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,911
All right.

145
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:21,710
And I will immediately block you on
fucking Twitter for actually saying it's a

146
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:22,730
good fucking movie.

147
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,603
Okay?

148
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,370
You can fucking kill somebody
on the plane. But you know what?

149
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,300
Pretty much everybody's going to say it.
Are you going to do it?

150
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,280
Let's just say you had some little fucking
heart attack missed like the ice man.

151
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,510
Remember the ice man, they made a movie
about him. That guy where he would just,

152
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,380
he was sitting there talking about all
the murders he committed, you know,

153
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,700
talking through his clenched jaw.
Looks like an old sea captain,

154
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,950
but he was a fucking hit man for the mob.
He had dismissed.

155
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:59,670
He said he'd go into studio 54 and he'd
act those swishy and he'd walk up to a

156
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:01,980
guy, hit on him, and then
he'd spray him with this miss.

157
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,680
And like three seconds later the
guy would have a heart attack.

158
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:09,710
Let's just say you had the fucking iceman
cometh fucking heart attack missed.

159
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,650
All right,
now

160
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,220
you're in a row of three people.
Where do you think the best places to sit?

161
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,640
If you want to murder one of the
other two people in your row?

162
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,220
I'm guessing the middle seat.
Okay.

163
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:33,221
If I have to put this air quote caper
together and you'd take the fucking missed

164
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,990
and I'm going to fucking, I want to give
the guy on the window a heart attack.

165
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,650
I'm going to spray it in him and that
fucking guy is going to go into cardiac

166
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:44,270
arrest.
All right,

167
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:49,271
and do you think the guy sitting to the
right of me or the fucking lady to the

168
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:54,320
right of me in the aisle seat is not
going to notice this person convulsing?

169
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,020
All right, well let's just say they
fucking drop dead. It's so powerful.

170
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,580
They just dropped dead.

171
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,200
And just happen to slump
to the fucking side.

172
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,980
Now I might be able to get away with that.

173
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,933
All right?

174
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,190
But only if that person had already
had an already recline this seat.

175
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,093
Okay.

176
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,560
Hadn't already reclined their fucking
seat because when we go, you know,

177
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:24,120
we begin our initial descent,

178
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,420
the fucking stewardist or
the male stewardess is going
to fucking come over and

179
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:33,360
be like, excuse me sir, sir. Excuse me.

180
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,170
Could you wake him now I can't wake him
cause I fucking sprayed him with a heart

181
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:38,004
attack.
Missed.

182
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,020
What I can do is press the button forum
and put his fucking deadhead between his

183
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:47,460
fucking rigor mortis legs.
If you'd like Peter.

184
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,130
Otherwise name is Peter. All right, now
you killed one person. What the fuck you,

185
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,070
you're going to just start
going around killing people.

186
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,630
One person is going to die every 10
minutes unless I get a sack of cash in

187
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:05,631
Rhinelander Wisconsin to buy fucking two
30 you think the airline would give a

188
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,684
fuck?

189
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,113
All right.

190
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,220
$250 million ransom. Is that
what the fuck you want? I mean,

191
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,470
how much is it going to cost
them to settle out of court?

192
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,970
It's going to cost less than that
because they have all the money, right?

193
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,340
I don't like fucking movies

194
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,580
on airplanes and I don't like movies
where people have pointed ears and nobody

195
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,710
fucking addresses it. The other day
I'm sitting there with Verdesian,

196
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,850
we're flipping through the
fucking stations and one of
those hobbit movies comes

197
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:39,110
on and this fucking asshole, he's got one
of those, let it be seventies haircuts,

198
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,900
whereas hair is plenty long enough
to not show his fucking pointed ears,

199
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,520
but for some reason he's got it scooped
around the back of his ear like he's

200
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:50,030
gonna fucking blow somebody.
And I just look at, I go,

201
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:51,830
look at that dude's fucking ear.

202
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,550
How does the guy with the
white beard not address that?

203
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,980
Like what the fuck happened here?
What are you?

204
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,003
Huh?

205
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,550
You're fucking Elf. What does that
mean? What do you, what do you,

206
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:08,090
what does your diet consist of? Salary
and Guinea pigs. You fucking Weirdo.

207
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,700
Get the fuck Outta here.

208
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,980
Okay.

209
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,250
Is that, is that racist? Am I going
to have to apologize? The elves,

210
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,200
Jesus Christ.
Fucking God damn moves with airplanes.

211
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:26,260
You know what I mean?
Please, right? Oh please,

212
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,330
I don't have time for that sweetheart.

257
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,760
All right, let's get back to this over
here. Oh, Vov over here. All right.

258
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:42,620
Back to the podcast. So many ways.
I'm still up here in Canada. Oh,

259
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,650
Canada.
I'm touring across the provinces.

260
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,130
Um, I've had some people come in, I, um,

261
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,030
okay.

262
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,720
From some pretty crazy places.
A Yukon territory's,

263
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,170
somebody told me that there's a theater
up there. Maybe I'll look into that.

264
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:02,310
The next hour of bullshit that I come
up with the next time I talk Canada,

265
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,460
which I'm definitely gonna do.
Um,

266
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,920
I had someone fly in from Brazil and then
I had this couple coming from Kuwait.

267
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,400
Okay.

268
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,280
You know, and this, and they,
yeah, we flew all the way in,
but blah, blah, blah, blah,

269
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:19,540
blah. And you know, we're going to hang
out here in Toronto, Yada, Yada, Yada.

270
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:24,490
And I said, wait a minute, I
go, could I do a show in Kuwait?

271
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:27,790
And they're like, absolutely.
And I said, I can say

272
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,010
what I said here tonight and
Kuwait and the guy goes, yeah.

273
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,200
And then the woman goes,
well,

274
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,600
but I'm just meeting those two.
I want to go there. You know,

275
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,970
they were some cosmopolitan motherfuckers.
I really would like to,

276
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,180
to the Middle East and not get kidnapped.

277
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,310
If you're in the Middle East and you know,

278
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:58,050
wear a fucking freckled white
boy from the u s can go,

279
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,430
you know, I would like to,
I want that middle ground.

280
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,640
I want to go to a place where I'm not
going to get abducted by people who

281
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:08,250
fucking hate my government.
And I also want to,

282
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't want to go to a place that's
subsists because there's a tent city right

283
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:17,520
outside the city limits and people
are living a, you know, on dog food,

284
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,880
you got a middle ground that I can go to,
you know,

285
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:22,710
or I can do some fucking shows out there.

286
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,060
I can tell my jokes and I don't have
to worry about the Shah or the fucking

287
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,140
prime minister.
Oh,

288
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:33,730
the fucking son of the king of the Rab
are going to come in and take me away.

289
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,810
I don't want that to happen. I'd
like to go over there. Right.

290
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,150
I want to go on where,

291
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:44,320
on one of those coolest fucking
things on my head with the little, uh,

292
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,030
oh Robic Bandana.
I do that.

293
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:50,290
I do that in a fucking second.

294
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,820
Looking like a cornerback at the end
of the game with my fucking Doo rag on.

295
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,150
Let me know. I'll go over
there. I'll fucking doe it. Um,

296
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,810
oh hey, there's a rumor. I heard a rumor.

297
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,330
Jesus Christ. Who was that? Who Sang
that fucking shock wasn't Spandau Ballet.

298
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,500
I heard a rumor.
There was a z in it.

299
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,510
I'm calling that there
was a z in their name.

300
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:21,511
For some reason it was like three fucking
chicks and they will all almost good

301
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:25,750
looking. You know what
I'm talking about? Um,

302
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,300
I heard a rumor.
Lyrics.

303
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah.

304
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,920
Banana Rama. You motherfucker. Why
didn't I think there was a z in it?

305
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,400
Yeah.

306
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,233
Well,
you know what?

307
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,950
The fact that there wasn't a it and
the fact that I look the way I do and I

308
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:48,000
actually said that they were only
kind of good looking as punishment.

309
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,350
I now have to go to lyrics dot come and
sing as much as this is, I can remember.

310
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,450
I don't remember him.

311
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,960
Who needs a friend who never shows?

312
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,200
I'll tell you what you want to know.

313
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,350
I could have saved a broken heart.

314
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,280
Okay.

315
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,440
If I found out long ago,
I don't remember. I was,

316
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,370
I heard a rumor who,
Ooh,

317
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,860
I've heard of roof that's actually written
on it. Paper. I heard a rumor. Oh h.

318
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,420
O. O. H. Ooh, I heard a rumor.
They say you got it broken.

319
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,060
Then they know what now you guys
are getting punished. This isn't,

320
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:29,180
this isn't a punishment. You guys know I
like this thing even though I can't do,

321
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:32,240
you know some current wrote me one time
I was telling me how much I suck at

322
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:36,320
singing. Like I don't realize
that like that isn't the joke,

323
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,740
but you know something.

324
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,660
For those of you people who are about
to them on any sort of, uh, uh, a, uh,

325
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,750
a dream and it involves you having
a website or a Twitter account,

326
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,580
Facebook or anything,
uh,

327
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,570
anywhere where people
can give you feedback.

328
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:59,730
Just know that people will find
fucking something to bitch about.

329
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,350
Do you know what somebody said?
Somebody sent me a fucking

330
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,410
email or a Twitter thing.

331
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:10,610
I can't remember what it might have been
the most nit picky thing anybody's ever

332
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:11,444
said.

333
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,520
Okay.

334
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,170
When I was down in,
uh,

335
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,470
Hammer Ville there Hammerstein why can't
I remember the fucking name Hamilton

336
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,570
when I was down there?
You know,

337
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,160
at wire to wire had a fucking great
show. Go Fuck Yourself. I killed it.

338
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,560
Thank you for coming out.
I went out,

339
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,320
I fucking took pictures with people.

340
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,710
I'm selling what's left of my DVDs the
last time I'm selling a DVD because it's

341
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:46,270
one step ahead of the fucking laser disk.
I got to get him out of my garage.

342
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,100
Thank you to everybody who bought
one. Um, somebody actually said,

343
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:56,050
great show, but Jesus Christ,
your wallet is way too big.

344
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,070
Can you fucking believe that
out of fuck did you even see it?

345
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,580
I maybe have my back to the crowd for
fucking two minutes in an hour and 15

346
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:12,820
minutes set. And it bothered you
out big. My fucking wallet was,

347
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,560
it's not my fault.
It's stuffed with fucking business cats.

348
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,980
People give them to me when I'm on tour.
Hey, if you're ever a hair fucking,

349
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,370
this is this thing. If you'd ever
like some of this, here's this thing.

350
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,550
I just stuffed them in my wallet and then
when I come home I stick them with all

351
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:33,970
the other business cards that
I'm never going to look at. Okay.

352
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,180
And when you're in the middle of a 20
day toy, yeah. Can get a little bit big.

353
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,120
All right. Why don't you stop staring
at my fucking ass? You weirdo.

354
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:45,260
The middle of my show. You ever
think maybe that it's, it's,

355
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,800
it's so fat because it's stuffed with
the plastic money that I've made up here.

356
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,190
Do you know Canadian currency? Is, is uh,

357
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,050
the greenbacks that dollars are
they made out of plastic now?

358
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,270
Very smooth plastic and I fucking love it.
Their money is the shit.

359
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,080
I've always loved American money the
best because that's the money that I grew

360
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,030
up with and I just think it looks cool.

361
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,670
And I like all the weird
shit that don't with it,

362
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:16,750
with the extra big fucking heads.
They got a little off to the side,

363
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,490
little nod to hip hop, you
know, don't wear your hat
like Donnie baseball anymore.

364
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:25,240
You got to do fucking the Jay z thing or
it's off to the side just a little bit,

365
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,823
you know?

366
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,283
MMM.

367
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,840
What am I going to say?
What the fuck am I talking about yet?

368
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:35,020
But the only thing that stinks about
their money as I guess you can't stack it,

369
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,600
there's something about
it because it's plastic.

370
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:41,140
It just sort of slides down to
the side. But uh, but anyways,

371
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:45,920
that was the nitpick bitch or the week.
Evidently my wallet was too big,

372
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,990
you know, I really liked that standup
comedians act a was really funny,

373
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:55,991
but I got to tell you the size of his
bill fold just really ruined it for me.

374
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,630
You know what sir or ma'am, whoever the
fuck wrote me that I got to tell you,

375
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,550
you have, you have a future
as a critic. You really do.

376
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,480
Because even when critics like something,

377
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:13,070
they find something to fucking
complain about. You know,

378
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,130
even if they like your show, like my
show, even a good review, if you read it,

379
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,160
it would be like the big headed freckled
fuck took command of the stage for an

380
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:30,641
amazing performance of stand up as I
watched his distractingly alabaster hands

381
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,250
motion through brilliant bit after that.
That's what they do.

382
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,820
They're complimenting you while on salting
the shit out of how the fuck you look.

383
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,250
You know,
I don't like when they do that,

384
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,420
it'll kill you don't want to criticize
critics is another thing I don't like.

385
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,100
I don't like when fucking critics do
that or they writing an article on a

386
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:55,060
celebrity and they do that
thing where they fucking, uh,

387
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,000
they, they always get to talk about
what the fuck they're reading.

388
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:04,980
Cause I guess they always an
interview these movie stars and uh,

389
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,400
in restaurants and they
always get as shit,

390
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:13,430
say as he fucking bites into a pan seared
salmon and crusted pork chop and older

391
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:23,391
and wiser little fella from the fucking
angry king show there on HBO with this

392
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:29,720
tailored fucking suit. Okay. I Dunno.

393
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,730
He has a sadness in his eyes as
he bites into a cherry tomato.

394
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,470
I've really fucking hate that.

395
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,540
I just feel like they just did just
build it up. They're just like,

396
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,110
how many fucking words? So I got to
write about this little fella here. Ah,

397
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,700
would that dumb fucking look on his face.
I'm really sick of that fucking,

398
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,110
I'm just sick of the look on that
guy's fucking face. It's, it's,

399
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,150
I don't know what it is.

400
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,780
It's bad enough when a regular
size guy has that look on his face,

401
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:05,320
like he's going to come over there and
slap the taste. Study your mouth. Okay.

402
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:09,910
I don't need some little fella sitting
there with his little suit staring at me.

403
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,890
Like I said something about him. I
didn't say anything about you. Okay.

404
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,563
So,
you know,

405
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,830
why don't you get your fucking for Bra
and pointing in another direction and

406
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,770
fuck you and your cherry tomatoes.
What do you think about that? Huh?

407
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,013
Okay.

408
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,560
Again,
out of my face before I tip you over.

409
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,030
Okay.

410
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,570
I'm sorry.

411
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,530
I really am in a country moote and this
APP has nothing to do with the little

412
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:42,810
fellow on the angry king show on Hbo.

413
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,590
It really has to do with the fact that,
uh,

414
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:49,860
I missed my wife and my dog.
I missed my truck, a mess,

415
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:53,970
all of that shit while simultaneously
having one of the greatest fucking tours

416
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:57,980
I've ever had been. Versie I haven't
so much fucking fun up here verse.

417
00:26:57,981 --> 00:27:02,160
He started doing this fucking
Rodney Dangerfield impression.

418
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,160
So that's all we've been doing up here.

419
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,070
All we've been doing up here is
it will just be sitting there.

420
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,590
Okay.

421
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,530
You know, drinking a beer and you just go,
you know, hey, this is a good beer. No,

422
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,990
I'll tell you,
last week I had a rough one

423
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,410
and I don't know why.
It's always,

424
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,430
it's just been funny the
whole fucking week to us.

425
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,100
I've skated almost every God damn day.
These fucking,

426
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,340
you know what's great about
Canada because this so far north,

427
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:39,690
they have to embrace the winter and
there's just shit to do. They got like,

428
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,950
I like looked up free public skating here
in Toronto and you would've thought I

429
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:47,910
looked up a Starbucks, the amount
of fucking hits I got on my phone,

430
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:50,580
it's just fucking tremendous.
So you know,

431
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,720
there's only so long then I
can go on a God damn treadmill.

432
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,230
Yeah.

433
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,621
You know,

434
00:27:56,621 --> 00:28:00,280
and with it just because you have the
option of just stepping off the fucking

435
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:03,340
thing. That's why I love my dog.
I love taking her on a hike,

436
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:08,190
going on a fucking hike, you
know, listen to some songs and I,

437
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,120
and I'm good boy, you're out here and you
fucking go out and you just go skating.

438
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,200
It's fun. So fucking good
time. Oh, you know what I did?

439
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:21,430
I got a friend of mine that lives up
here and he's an assistant coach on a,

440
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,360
on a hockey team. He's got a son
in the 10 to 11 year old group.

441
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,140
And I went to this rink,
they had four ranks.

442
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,180
They're all these different games and
I have to fucking tell you something.

443
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,670
I've never seen kids of that age play
the game the way these kids were playing.

444
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,530
They were fucking, it was an unbelievably
entertaining game. Was One. Nothing.

445
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:45,540
One, one, two, one, two, two and then
three, two and then they pulled the,

446
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,690
they got the dagger,

447
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,830
got the fourth goal and
these fucking kids up here.

448
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,230
Okay.

449
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,340
At Age 10 to 11 the level with
which they would play in this game.

450
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,590
It wasn't even the,
the kid with the Puck,

451
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,490
it was what the kids were doing away
from the park. How they knew where to be.

452
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,080
There was a fucking kid on the other team.
Last name,

453
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,630
kid number four or something.

454
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,260
I was like jealous how well
he could skate backwards.

455
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:18,530
This kid was like 10 or 11 years
old and the way you play defense,

456
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:22,880
I was actually watching him
learning. It was like, I dunno,

457
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,260
it was like an NHL gay, but everybody
was 10 or 11 like the way it was played.

458
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:30,710
Obviously, it wasn't as fast, but you
know, when I was watching it live,

459
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:35,450
I mean I couldn't really
tell. I was fucking blown away
by the talent up here. Um,

460
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,440
and it was a great game and when it was
three to two because the other team kept

461
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:41,830
tying it up,
I was actually on the of my seat

462
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,690
watching a game between 10
and 11 year olds. I mean,
it's fucking amazing up here.

463
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:50,890
So, um, anyways, I did that.

464
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,270
How far into the fucking podcast, Dan? My
Art, Jesus, I'm limping along this week.

465
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,370
29 minutes in.

466
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,660
Yeah.

467
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,370
You don't have been doing with Versie
this week. This is fucking, I've,

468
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,840
I've toured with Versie for so fucking
long. We're like an old married couple.

469
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,410
I've never seen anybody who hates
the morning as much as he does.

470
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:10,910
So this whole fucking tour,

471
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,090
I've never woken him up with a text cause
I always do that shit. I'll text them,

472
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:18,200
hey, you want to get breakfast?
And he's never quite awake.

473
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,510
So I just, I just wait till he fucking
wakes up and that, that fucking guy,

474
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,040
if you don't text him,
he will,

475
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,990
he'll sleep til like one in the afternoon
and he has still has the nerve to come

476
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:33,800
downstairs, look at a little groggy. He
always comes down like, God, how great.

477
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,690
How great was that mattress man?
Fucking epic at mattress was epic.

478
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,460
Everything's epic to him. Um, I dunno. So,

479
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,010
uh, that's why I'm doing the podcast
with dot. I'm next week we'll,

480
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:50,970
we'll wrap up the tour. We will wrap up
the tour. Uh, me and him will do the, uh,

481
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,970
the podcast together. Um, but
um, oh, I got to do another word.

482
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,110
I heard a rumor allegedly.

483
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,510
Okay.

484
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,250
They are, our dates in the works with
three of my best friends in comedy.

485
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:11,560
Quite possibly. I've heard rumors
that they might be doing a tour,

486
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,880
a club tour.

487
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,883
Okay.

488
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,650
That now maybe starting out
on the west coast, possibly.

489
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:23,450
Maybe starting in La, possibly
with yours truly hosting the show.

490
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,090
I've heard this fucking Romer

491
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,770
that possibly Rosebowl tailgate legends.

492
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,610
Jason Lawhead. Joe Barton. Nick.

493
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,750
Okay.

494
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,760
All right.
And Dude,

495
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:42,761
I called it Paul Versey quite possibly
could be doing a three man tour of clubs,

496
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:49,070
limited engagements
over the next couple of months,

497
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:52,880
sponsored by the Monday morning podcast,
the first tour.

498
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,560
I hope the first of many tours
to be sponsored by this podcast.

499
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,173
Um,

500
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,710
there are rumors that there are agents
right now working on over the weekend

501
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,030
suit on, tie off, wiping their brow,

502
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,820
trying to put together some
dates on this tour. Uh,

503
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,010
quite possibly next week there
might even be an announcement,

504
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,320
but right now that is just a rumor, but
I'll tell you what isn't a rumor. A,

505
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,330
I'm doing a date in Nashville on May 16th
and it's part of a Vince Vaughn's wild

506
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:31,850
west tour comedy tour.
And uh, let's see here.

507
00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:35,390
I just fucking tweeted about it. Jesus.
Bill, what the fuck is wrong with you?

508
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,940
Hang on, hang on, hang on
you to home. No, I got to me

509
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,500

512
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,150
I have their Twitter handle.

513
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:03,330
Is that what you say at wild west C F as

514
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:09,691
facebook.com backslash WWC f Nashville
as in wild west comedy festival.

515
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,410
Uh, Nashville. Um,

516
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,250
anyhow. All right. So that's enough for
the goddamn promotions for the week.

517
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,490
Yeah.

518
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,720
Um, all right. Just when
you think my singing

519
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,850
can't get any worse,
how about I try to top that with sound?

520
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,670
You do you think I can
sound more dumb than,

521
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,530
than the level of my awful
singing while I think I can, uh,

522
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:40,050
I've been sort of keeping up on this,
this,

523
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,860
the events that are going on
over in the Ukraine and, uh,

524
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:48,300
with my limited knowledge of what's going
on there now and my limited knowledge

525
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:51,240
of what's happened there in the past.
Um,

526
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,530
okay.

527
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,510
That ousted fucking president or prime
minister or whatever they call them.

528
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,260
Okay.

529
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,820
Yannick Covich, that guy's
a sellout cunt. All right.

530
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:05,490
And I'm not trying to stir up
some shit over there. Okay.

531
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,640
But after what style and
did there and World War II,

532
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:15,030
they should want nothing
to do with Russia. Okay.

533
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,320
Okay.

534
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,410
The fact that there's Russian
sympathizers in the Ukraine.

535
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:20,460
I don't fucking get it.

536
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:22,700
Yeah.

537
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,200
Why does o Vladimir give a fuck
about this? Yana Covich so much.

538
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,180
I actually looked up, Yana Covich
Russian puppet and I got a bunch of hits,

539
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,643
so,

540
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,510
okay.

541
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,450
What gets you let the Ukrainians
have their own goddamn country?

542
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,500
They didn't like you so much
that they actually overthrew you.

543
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,920
There's so much dirty
shit going on over there.

544
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:50,750
I think Vladimir Putin or whatever the
fuck his name is. He said that, uh, that,

545
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:51,860
that that was actually,

546
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,260
yeah,

547
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:59,260
by the u s whether it be hilarious if we
actually back that if we back that they

548
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:02,690
overthrew their fucking prime minister,
whatever the fuck his name is.

549
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:06,380
Yanna Covich Anna Kournikova,
whatever his fucking name is. Right.

550
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,530
And then we get to go
publicly. It'd be like, Hey,

551
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:12,710
what are you guys doing in Russia?
Leave him alone.

552
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,800
Saad modeling in their affairs.

553
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,350
Okay.

554
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,520
If we actually did do it,

555
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:24,050
I have to respect all Vladi Vladi
daddy there that he fucking said.

556
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,630
Uh, he called us out on it.
I think he called us out on,

557
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:32,090
I remember he called somebody else out
on it. I would fuck knows, God knows we,

558
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,610
you know, you know we did something
over there. Hey, let me tell you,

559
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,570
it was a rough week over there and create,
um,

560
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,643
okay.

561
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,070
I Dunno,
just fucking leave him alone.

562
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,150
Can't countries just leave other
countries alone? But you know,

563
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,070
I think that'd be great for this country
if we just fucking pulled all our

564
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:50,904
people back.

565
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,040
We just left everybody alone and you know
what all our corporations had to come

566
00:35:55,041 --> 00:36:00,020
back to and we started making Levi's
501 blues again. The button flies,

567
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,900
some z Cavariccis and we
actually made them here.

568
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:07,730
We didn't make children's sewn together.
You know, why can't we do that again?

569
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,200
And then you just legalize weed everywhere
and then you use that as the export.

570
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:15,560
And we got everybody fucking high
man and everybody mellows out.

571
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,800
Why can't we do that?
You know why?

572
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,570
Because everybody heard.

573
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,490
So the reason why you can't do it is
because it's the same reason why the

574
00:36:28,491 --> 00:36:33,491
fucking NFL has that stupid ass fucking
dumb ass game in England every year.

575
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,250
All right? It's because of the
ego. You want to put your stamp,

576
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:42,470
you want to put your
fucking mark on something.

577
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:47,210
You want to say that it was here and
then I took it to here. You know,

578
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,950
no one could just be like,
hey,

579
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:53,720
we're right here and isn't this a good
place to be? He always got, what about me?

580
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:56,550
What about my fucking legacy? And
that's what, that's what the fuck.

581
00:36:56,551 --> 00:37:00,560
And the guy from the NFL is doing.
All right,

582
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:04,040
Pete Roselle is the benchmark.

583
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,110
You got to somehow try to outdo him.

584
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,300
We went Pete Roselle and then Peter
Noone I think was the next fucking

585
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:14,450
commissioner. And then
you got this guy, uh,

586
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,170
was it Raykovich Roger Goodell.

587
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,560
I don't want the fucking guy.
He's name is bought out,

588
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,420
but he's got a somehow outdo Pete Rozelle.

589
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,330
Pete Rozelle brought the AFL and the
NFL together Monday night football,

590
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,950
the super bowl.

591
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,840
So the only way to top that is you somehow
after to try and go fucking global.

592
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,060
So he has that stupid ass dumb
ass fucking game in England.

593
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:40,550
Every God damn year for what?

594
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,700
Can't you just be happy being
billionaires are multimillion.

595
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,230
I would say that about everything.
I would say that about the fucking Nhl.

596
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:50,570
Why can't you just be multimillionaires?
Isn't that enough?

597
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,830
Why do you got to have the
Florida Panthers? Okay. And
you know what? Fuck you.

598
00:37:56,831 --> 00:38:01,150
If you live in Miami,
fuck you. Okay? Fuck you.

599
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,520
You got all that exotic pussy down there.

600
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:06,490
You also have to have a fucking
NHL team. Go Fuck Yourself, okay?

601
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:07,660
You want to go to a hockey game?

602
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,130
You get and you goddamn VW bus
and you drive to a cold city.

603
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,100
All right?
I for one,

604
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:21,101
have had enough of these fucking
winter teams down in the fucking south.

605
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,070
All right?
Having a winter classic game

606
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,680
when a classic game at Dodger Stadium,

607
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,810
people sit there and fucking tank
tops watch an ice hockey outside.

608
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,100
All right? Now, I don't want
get all hippy on you here,

609
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:39,980
but how many porpoises had to fucking
die so they can fucking have enough God

610
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:41,770
damn water to make that
whole thing happened.

611
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,310
You know a lot of people don't realize
that ice is actually made out of salt

612
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:49,960
water. Okay. And salt water is
the living, breathing oxygen.

613
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,270
That poor processive inhales
through its fucking gills. Alright,

614
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,060
don't porpoise. A porpoise
is a mammoth. Are they?

615
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,030
And I realized that this oxygen and
water before you guys actually take that

616
00:39:05,031 --> 00:39:08,600
shit seriously to porpoises
breathe through a porthole,

617
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,150
an orifice at the top of their head.

618
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,403
Okay,

619
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,000
I can look this up now. That's how
you spell porpoise. Poor poise.

620
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,213
Okay.

621
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,040
Is it a mammal? I spelt mammo
with three m's in the middle.

622
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,420
Did you mean mammal course? I
met Mammal Porpoise, mammal.

623
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,680
Any of the seven species of tooth whales
distinguishable from dolphins by their

624
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:38,950
row by they're more compact build,

625
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,410
generally smaller in size,
maximum length about two meters.

626
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,450
That's about 6.6 feet they
say and curved blunt snouts.

627
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,070
What's spatulate rather than

628
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:57,780
conical teeth. It was a great
word. Bachelor late. And Conoco,

629
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,750
I want you guys to you,
next time you get fucking hammered,

630
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,260
I want you to slip both of those words
in and if you can actually use them,

631
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,970
it's a great line to say to a
woman, you know, I like you.

632
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,750
I saw you from across the bar.
You know what really attracted me?

633
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,630
And she'd be like, what? And
you'd be like, you're blunt.

634
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,870
Snap with your spatulate
rather than conical teeth.

635
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,420
What would you like to drink,
sweetheart?

636
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,760
Blunt snout. That's a fucking good name
for a band. Maybe Jeremy Brown show.

637
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,360
Um, all right, let's, let's get to some
of the fucking questions this week.

638
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:40,890
I'm sorry, I, I'm just really
shitting the bed here. Um,

639
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,870
did I talk about everything?
I think I did. Oh,

640
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,990
people talking about the posters
where my posters relaxed.

641
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,570
They're all on their way.
Uh, we still got another,

642
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,850
there's still some more coming up this
week. Overwhelming response. And I got,

643
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:57,690
I got one guy in the mail room trying to
send all of these fuckers out, so, uh,

644
00:40:57,691 --> 00:41:01,740
you'll get them all right. And they
are autographed. So relax. Okay.

645
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:03,600
And if you don't get them,
I'll give you fucking money back.

646
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:08,400
But I'm saying don't give up hope. All
right. Hang in there. Hang in there.

647
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,080
Stay gold. Pony boy. Stay gold. All
right. Baseball season. Billy Ruth.

648
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,110
I grew up loving the game of baseball.
My greatest memories. Hang on a second.

649
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:21,630
I got fucking close this window.
There's some dose talking

650
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,430
fucking muted. All right.
Hang on. All right. I grew up
loving the game of baseball.

651
00:41:28,431 --> 00:41:33,431
My greatest memories as a child included
the smell of a Mitt and sensation of

652
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:38,240
throwing a ball hard across an infield.
I also grew up in an Orioles fan.

653
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,450
I'd fucking, Oreos were great when
I grew up and I was growing up.

654
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:43,550
They were the shit.
They were already.

655
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:47,480
They won in [inaudible] 66
and they want in 70. Uh,

656
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,290
they blew it and 79 and then
they won in [inaudible] 83.

657
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,920
Look at that right off the top of my
fucking head. But I can't read out loud.

658
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,350
Do you know I can do that?
And almost every sport.

659
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:00,500
I can go back to like the 60s and I
could tell you all the fucking champions.

660
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:06,080
66 the oriel 67 uh,
the cardinal speed,

661
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:10,880
the fucking red sox, 68 the
tigers want, and then they,

662
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,770
then they were having that fucking thing
while that, those riots and then the,

663
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:16,280
the,
the,

664
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,880
the subsequent white flight that
happened and that cities never recovered.

665
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,580
69 the amazing mets,

666
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,290
73 oral 71 I think was the pirates.

667
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,670
And then Clemente died or the die.

668
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:33,950
And (727) 027-0370 four was the A's.
75,

669
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,890
76 was the red. 77, 78 was the Yankees.

670
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:41,150
79 was we are family.
The pirates,

671
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:45,770
80 Phillies,
81 was the fucking dodges,

672
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,830
right. Tommy John, Tommy,

673
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:52,460
John was on the fucking Dodgers
that lost to the Yankees. And 77,

674
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:56,360
78 a one,
he turned codes,

675
00:42:56,361 --> 00:43:00,500
he goes to the fucking Yankees.
And what happens? The Dodgers win.

676
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,110
And that's why that
surgery's named after him.

677
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,280
82 was the cardinals.

678
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:13,250
A, they'd beat the brewers.
83 was the Orioles.

679
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,830
84 was the tigers.
85 was the royals.

680
00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:20,390
It should have been the fucking
cardinals of the implode.

681
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:23,450
F that awful call at first
base 86 was the mets.

682
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,370
Red Sox fans know that 87 was the twins.
88 was fucking Kirk Gibson,

683
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:30,440
the Dodgers. I can just
keep going. People.

684
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,480
I could fucking go all fucking day long.
I know what you thinking.

685
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:36,080
You probably think I have in front
of them right in front of me. Well,

686
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:39,770
that's just a compliment. 89 was
the aids. The roid brothers want it.

687
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:44,690
Then 90 was the red. 91 of course
was you twins. 92 93 that was zero.

688
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:47,960
You're fucking Blue Jays and the
94 that's a great trivia year.

689
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:52,760
That was the strike here and if you
listen to fucking Pedro Martinez,

690
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,560
he'll sit there and tell you,
you know what,

691
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:57,110
the fucking expos we're going
to win that year. Why you ask?

692
00:43:57,111 --> 00:44:00,050
Because they had a young,
him and Randy Johnson,

693
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:05,050
I think Tim Raines was still there
and a whole fucking great team there.

694
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:09,470
95 was the Braves. 96 was the
Yankees. 97 was the Marlin's.

695
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:11,090
They'd be j law heads,
Indians.

696
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,670
98 99 2000 was the fucking Yankees.

697
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,100
This is when he starts getting sketchy
for me. 2001 was the Diamondbacks.

698
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,210
2002 I think was the angels.
2003 was the Marlin's.

699
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:29,540
2004 was a red sox. 2005
was the white sox. 2006

700
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,760
was the fucking cardinals.
Was it 2007 was the red sox.

701
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:40,110
2008 was affiliate cause I was a 988 keys.
2010 was the Jane's then,

702
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:44,710
I don't fucking know.
2011 all right.

703
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,740
2013 was us.
The giants won another one in there.

704
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:52,940
Didn't they will say 2012 and
I'll say 2011 was the cardinals.

705
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,280
Oh my God. If you don't like
sports, you're in trouble now. Well,

706
00:44:57,281 --> 00:45:01,150
let's go do football.
I could do it.

707
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,340
I can do hockey if you want.

708
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,240
I can go all the way back
to about 1966 I believe.

709
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,810
All right. Canadian Maple leafs,
Canadians, Canadians, Bruins, Canadians,

710
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:22,360
Rowan's Canadians,
flyers, flyers, Canadians,

711
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:27,040
Canadians, Canadians,
Canadians, islanders,
islanders, islanders, islanders,

712
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,920
fucking Edmonton, Edmonton. Canadians,
Edmonton, Edmonton, Calgary,

713
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:38,400
Edmonton
91 92 was at Pittsburgh.

714
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,200
93 was fucking
Montreal.

715
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,230
94 was the rangers.

716
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,790
95 was a devils.
96 was the avalanche.

717
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:55,250
97 98 was it fucking
[inaudible]

718
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,190
99 was Dallas stars.
Why are you guys listening to this?

719
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,920
2000 was the fucking avalanche.
No. Was it devils 2001 report.

720
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,950
Avalanche thousand two fucking
Devil's 2003 if I can read links,

721
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:15,960
maybe lightning strike ducks.
Hurricanes.

722
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,010
All right, sorry, I'm back.
Let's read this thing here. Um,

723
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,510
I also grew up in an Orioles fan too.
That was fucking add textbook right there.

724
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,880
I love the oriels and I
love Major League baseball,

725
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:31,050
but why can't I get the baseball,
get into the baseball season?

726
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,790
It has nothing to do with my
team. Oh, I read that wrong.

727
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:39,300
But why can't I get into the baseball
season? It has nothing to do with my team.

728
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,190
I was happy for the socks,

729
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:45,360
but it's just hard to get excited about
the sport and I desperately want to.

730
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,210
Is there a greater reason I'm missing?

731
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,470
Uh, well, I mean,

732
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,210
it kind of sucks that there's no
salary cap and that, you know,

733
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:02,330
the red sox can afford to spend a buck
80 a year and the fucking Yankee you

734
00:47:02,331 --> 00:47:05,430
spend like two 20 a year.
Um,

735
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,270
so I mean,
essentially between the two of them

736
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,970
sang on a second.
I mean,

737
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:16,650
one of us is going to win the fucking
division probably 80% of the time.

738
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:17,581
I mean,

739
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:22,581
if you go back to 1996 the first
time the Yankees won the division.

740
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,920
All right.
And that wasn't because they spent money.

741
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:33,460
That was because George Steinbrenner
gets suspended and he wasn't allowed to

742
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:37,450
fucking metal. And He, I
swear to God he wouldn't, he
wouldn't trade it away. Jeter.

743
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,573
MMM,

744
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,290
definitely. What a terrier
way. Bernie Williams,

745
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:45,800
probably Jorge Posada and
I bet even Marianna Rivera,

746
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:49,490
just because nobody knew he hadn't
developed that cut fastball yet.

747
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,460
No, he probably, he probably keep
like to have them pick two of them.

748
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:55,900
He definitely get rid of Andy Pettitte.

749
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:58,330
He fucking was up that guy's ass
even when he was crushing it.

750
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,033
MMM.

751
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,430
But anyways, I dunno, somewhere
around 98 99 it's just,

752
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:08,210
it's just become like
ridiculously all about money.

753
00:48:08,211 --> 00:48:12,740
And I would say from there on,
if the red sox didn't win at the Yankees,

754
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:16,280
wanted to maybe Tampa
Bay when it one year,

755
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,360
I can tell you right now, the Orioles
have in fucking one. It's since,

756
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,800
I dunno when the 80s maybe early
nineties I have no fucking idea.

757
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,050
I would say that that's
kind of what makes it suck.

758
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,693
MMM.

759
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,050
I don't understand why all
leagues aren't run like the bike,

760
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:42,051
NFL football where Green Bay Wisconsin
can compete with New York City.

761
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,770
It's great.
It's a great thing.

762
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:50,550
So I would say that maybe that's why
you can't get into the regular seasons

763
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:53,820
because a lot of times by June,
what's the fucking point?

764
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,380
MMM.

765
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,180
And the great thing about the Orioles,
I mean, you guys had said that,

766
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:00,830
that great tradition there.

767
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,143
MMM.

768
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,560
You know, when in three world
series, essentially my lifetime,

769
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:10,410
I was born in 68 so I
don't remember 66 or 70,

770
00:49:10,411 --> 00:49:14,490
but I remember 83 and I just remember he
had all those great pictures when I was

771
00:49:14,491 --> 00:49:16,980
growing up. Frank Tenana, Jim Palmer.

772
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,860
MMM Nah,

773
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,500
fuck. There was another one
that you guys always had the,

774
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,110
had like three number ones and you're
starting rotation. You guys were brutal.

775
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,280
Eddie Murray at first base fucking,
I don't,

776
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,870
can't remember the other names. Who
the fuck knows? But it was great.

777
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,440
It was great to watch it catch.
It was hilarious.

778
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,470
Why do I think it's Doug to Sensei wasn't
any play third base for the fucking

779
00:49:40,471 --> 00:49:43,620
angels. Um, that's probably
why he can't get into it.

780
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,420
You probably can't get into it because
it's not a level playing field. It's a,

781
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:53,500
um, I dunno, I dunno
what to tell you. Sorry.

782
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,950
Just sort of fucking space
to halfway through that. All
right. Childhood crush us.

783
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:02,390
Billy Suave. Uh, when you were
growing up in the late seventies,

784
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:06,140
what celebrity ass would you have banged
if you had the choice? Well, I mean,

785
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:09,680
I was fucking like six
years old. So was I, I was,

786
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:14,530
I supposed to take out my little
Schmeichel is the Jewish people say, um,

787
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:16,850
I don't know what I would've done with it.

788
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,800
I'm a Charlie's angel
or perhaps Stevie Nicks.

789
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,810
Who are you into? And was there someone
that everyone was into that you couldn't,

790
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,250
why? Um, Oh man, I
fucking, I loved everybody.

791
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:36,050
I loved all three Charlie's angels.
I probably liked Farrah Fawcett.

792
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,820
She's the one I wanted to bang. Kate
Jackson was the one I wanted to marry.

793
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:45,770
And, uh, I liked, I liked Kate Jackson
when she was on the rookie sneeze.

794
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,660
She's a fucking nurse. She was married
to Mike Danco. What a fucking name,

795
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:51,620
Huh?
Mike Danco.

796
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,030
She had that great voice. Ah, man.
She was beautiful. And, uh, you know,

797
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,120
Jacqueline Smith, Matt Jaclyn Smith, she
had the same haircut is fair fosters,

798
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:07,580
except it was a Brunette.
I've always liked brunettes.
Um, so I liked all of them.

799
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:08,750
Okay.

800
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:13,130
And then I liked Kristy
McNichol much to her chagrin.

801
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,950
Uh,
who else?

802
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:17,710
Okay.

803
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,950
I fucking like the mall. Trying to
think of another show I used to watch.

804
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:22,720
Yeah.

805
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,130
I like Marsha Brady.
You know,

806
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:28,630
when she got a little bit older and was
wearing those fucking mini skirts, um,

807
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,220
even Jan a couple episodes, she
hoarded up pretty good for a young May.

808
00:51:33,221 --> 00:51:35,860
I liked that.
Um,

809
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:37,800
okay.

810
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,730
Joanie, from happy days when
she got older, you know,

811
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,010
was taken a few from Scott bail.
I liked her then.

812
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:47,570
Okay,

813
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:48,960
let's see.
Welcome back Kotter.

814
00:51:48,961 --> 00:51:53,520
And that was a bunch of don'ts except
for his wife. I wasn't into her though.

815
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:54,840
Yeah.

816
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,110
Uh, what else? Boat bad. Dope. Do,

817
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:04,600
what else did I used to watch?
Welcome Bay. This is when, you know,

818
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:08,770
you watched it a lot when you could
actually sing the second verse. Yeah.

819
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,430
Always could spot of friend,
but Pampa Bull.

820
00:52:12,431 --> 00:52:17,110
Welcome back to that southern and
dissolve them. Better. Bad at blue.

821
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,320
All right. I only could sing
the first fucking line. Um,

822
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,953
okay.

823
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,733
Was that it?

824
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,540
I think that was it.
I had a very sheltered childhood.

825
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:29,370
There was only like three channels.

826
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,383
MMM.

827
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,500
That wasn't a big radio guy.
I was too fucking young.

828
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:38,100
Like I only reason why I knew about kiss
was a couple of my friends had older

829
00:52:38,101 --> 00:52:41,970
brothers and one of my friends is really
good at drawing and he would drum,

830
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:45,550
you know, all the kiss characters
and I had no fucking idea.

831
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,200
My parents didn't take me to see
star wars had no fucking idea,

832
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:54,460
so I had no crush on prince slayer.
I remember that Shit.

833
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:56,980
That shit came out over the summer
and I didn't even hear about it.

834
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,480
I went outside,
I played baseball every fucking day.

835
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,210
I went down to the pool
and I went swimming. No,

836
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:05,950
we weren't even members
of the pool at that point.

837
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:10,951
They had like a community pool slash piss
tank that we will lose our members of.

838
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,950
Yeah. I just went outside and I played
every day, go outside and play, went out.

839
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,500
We rode bikes and played baseball.

840
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,890
We did what kids did back then and
that's why we weren't fat kids.

841
00:53:22,891 --> 00:53:27,240
We fucking went outside there. You, I
would say, yeah, the Charlie's angels.

842
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,570
I wasn't into to the bionic woman.

843
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:32,170
Okay.

844
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:36,940
I didn't get into her.
God Damn it.

845
00:53:36,941 --> 00:53:38,500
I thought there was way more than that.

846
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,450
Okay.

847
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,160
I know there was, I just
can't remember anymore. Um,

848
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,560
but was there anybody who everybody was
into and I couldn't understand it? Uh, no.

849
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,690
No I couldn't.

850
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,170
Okay.

851
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:55,610
I thought they were all fucking beautiful.
I really did.

852
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:58,970
Fucking women in the late seventies.
They will fucking go Cheryl Tiegs

853
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,150
I don't fucking remember. They were all
gorgeous. I remember every magazine cover.

854
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:09,900
It was a woman on the cover. Even I was
a little kid. You had a crush on her. Um,

855
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:14,020
childhood crushes. Right. I just
read that one. A instruments bill.

856
00:54:14,021 --> 00:54:17,530
I'm 14 years old. I suspect I'm
one of your younger listeners.

857
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,460
I'm growing to learn how
to play a new inch. Oh,

858
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:24,370
I'm going to learn how to play
a new instrument this year.

859
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,360
I already played piano and love
the progressive nature of drums,

860
00:54:28,361 --> 00:54:30,610
but I also want to be
able to shred a solo.

861
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:35,350
Any suggestions to which would be better
to start? Definitely stick with piano.

862
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:36,650
Okay.

863
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:37,483
All right.

864
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:42,590
There they have more fucking piano
sitting around than anything else. Okay.

865
00:54:42,591 --> 00:54:46,730
So your whole life, if you can just sit
down and just start playing a piano,

866
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:50,300
women will come over to your piano.
All right.

867
00:54:50,301 --> 00:54:52,760
Like flies to a few moths to a light.

868
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,740
That's a great one to learn how to play.
So definitely don't even Tommy Lee said,

869
00:54:57,741 --> 00:54:58,910
I wish I stuck with it.

870
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:00,883
MMM.

871
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:04,970
You got to stick with
the piano. Uh, um, uh,

872
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:09,450
obviously prejudice to drums,
drums of this shit. Um,

873
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,100
but if you don't shred a Solo,

874
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,873
I dunno,

875
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,850
you know what, maybe guitar,
Guitar and drums are great.

876
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:20,440
Those are both Badass instruments.

877
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:25,420
And Piano I said is this very
social thing your whole life,

878
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:29,110
you'll be able to sit down,
all right. Attract women.

879
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:33,610
And then when you become
married and you become a father,

880
00:55:33,611 --> 00:55:38,360
you can sit around playing the piano.
Oh, you know, Dad [inaudible] Dad,

881
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,770
Sarah pred.
Oh my keys playing the piano,

882
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:46,480
gather round children,
God and Cupid Donner and bled.

883
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:50,410
Said, you know, you can do
your own little jazzy version,

884
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,390
but do you Rico? Um, yeah.

885
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:59,560
But either way, I'm good on you for
learning an instrument, you know,

886
00:55:59,561 --> 00:56:04,030
and not becoming a Dj, even though that's
now acknowledged as a a an instrument.

887
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:05,770
Yeah.

888
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,230
You want to be able to actually
fucking do it. I don't give a fuck.

889
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:12,700
Those djs are amazing that they can take
little sounds and make it into a song,

890
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:17,230
but at the end of the fucking day, you
know, they're cutting and splicing.

891
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,430
Okay.

892
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:22,240
They're more like editing an album
while creating, if the same time,

893
00:56:22,241 --> 00:56:25,420
which I'm not going to lie you.
It's very impressive. All right?

894
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,100
But there's nothing cooler than,

895
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:30,640
than actually being able to play
the sounds that those miles had.

896
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:35,130
People are fucking sticking
together once you agree. Um, yeah.

897
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,400
Drums or coolest shit.

898
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:38,450
Okay.

899
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,580
I don't know what to tell you,
but you already play piano, man.

900
00:56:40,581 --> 00:56:44,390
So you've got that ear. Yeah. Guitar.
I would try. I would try them out,

901
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:48,290
but don't give up playing the piano, man.
That's a great one. A great one to play.

902
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,470
Unless you're in a heavy metal band
and they're all fucking rocking out and

903
00:56:51,471 --> 00:56:53,180
you're sitting there with the keyboard.
That's a tough one.

904
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:54,110
That was always a tough one.

905
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,920
There's always a tough one to try to
fucking Headbang when you're behind a

906
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:02,330
behind a fucking keyboard.
Oh,

907
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:07,010
we're halfway there, right?
Those guys in journey.

908
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,290
I'd actually like to learn how
to play the piano, you know,

909
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,520
but I just have too much sympathy
for my wife. I wouldn't do it. Hey,

910
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,990
let me tell you,
I can play drums with channel this.

911
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,960
I'll tell you us a little
rough. Um, boyfriend cheated.

912
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,110
Oh wait, before we get into this, let me,

913
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,740
let me read the last advertisement here
for the week. Um, he voice everybody.

914

You are a business owner,

915
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:34,230
but automated phone systems
and secretaries aren't
in your budget just yet.

916
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,860
And juggling incoming calls yourself
makes it hard to look like a professional.

917
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,210
Here's something that will dramatically
help you, help you and make more.

918
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,900
But here's something that will
dramatically help you make more money.

919
00:57:45,901 --> 00:57:50,901

of one or 100 he voice will help you

920

with a toll free number, dial by name,

921
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:59,580
directory and call routing tools. Your
business will sound like 1 million bucks.

922
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,810
Can't take a call. He voiceful transcribe
the voicemail and email it to you.

923
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:07,740

924
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:10,140
it right now.

All right, there you go.

931
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,050
I realize another reason why I suck so
bad at fucking reading is because my mind

932
00:58:40,051 --> 00:58:43,860
goes to other places and really
understanding how my fucking brain works.

933
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:47,010
I literally got halfway through
reading that and I started thinking,

934
00:58:47,011 --> 00:58:51,510
what pictures am I going to post this
week from my Canadian Tor, Tor. Tor.

935
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:56,850
Okay. Boyfriend cheated
bill. I'm a 25 year old girl.

936
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,350
You are a woman lady. All right.
Don't sell yourself short.

937
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,030
You're a woman. I found out my boyfriend
was cheating on me. The truth is I'm sad,

938
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:10,440
but at the same time I get that we're
not meant to be together forever. Um,

939
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:15,060
can you please suggest a fun way for me
to break up with him just in a way that

940
00:59:15,061 --> 00:59:17,220
makes him feel like he
did something wrong,

941
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:21,860
but also feel like less
of a man if possible.

942
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,620
Love to you and the all right.
Um,

943
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:26,400
yeah.

944
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,380
All right. Well first of all, you know,
you don't seem too broken up about it.

945
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:33,370
It's 25 years old. All right?
You're in the prime of your life.

946
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,133
MMM,

947
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,200
Jen. You're like, wow, we're not going to
be together anyway. So this guy broke up.

948
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:43,690
How can you break up with
them? Ah, Jesus. You know what?

949
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,440
Women are way better at this than I am.

950
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,490
Okay. Break up in a way that makes them
feel like he did something wrong. Well,

951
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:55,070
I mean, you could just say
it. I'm breaking up with you
because you cheated on me,

952
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:58,700
you piece of shit, but also make
them feel like less of a man.

953
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,540
All right, well, you know what?
I'm going to put that on you,

954
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:07,160
but don't go the usual hacky ways that
women go where they usually say he didn't

955
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:11,060
satisfy me a bed. Do you
have a little Dick? You know,

956
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:15,810
I don't go out and go fuck
one of his friends because
eventually you ready Brett,

957
01:00:15,811 --> 01:00:18,360
that that's just another notch
on your fucking bed post.

958
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:19,860
Unless you really want
to bang one of them.

959
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:21,963
Okay.

960
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,310
That's a really brutal thing to do.

961
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:25,910
That fucking breaks up their friendship
and you don't give a shit. Right.

962
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:27,400
Okay.

963
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,980
Um, I don't know what to tell
you. What could you do? All right,

964
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,670
let's see if someone did that to me.

965
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:39,690
Makes you feel like you did something
wrong and make what would make me feel

966
01:00:39,691 --> 01:00:40,800
like less of a man.

967
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,113
Yeah.

968
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:48,650
Why don't you just break up with them
and then I guess you got to go the hacky

969
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:52,210
route and just say, oh, by the way,

970
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:55,510
and then just pointed his dick and
just start laughing hysterically.

971
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:59,080
I Dunno. Maybe you'll come
off as a psycho that way.

972
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:05,570
Why don't you get him a
cake? Oh Jesus. Oh Man.

973
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:08,420
I almost don't want to even tell you
to fucking do this. This is brutal.

974
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:15,260
I get it. Is his birthday coming
up? If his birthday is coming up,

975
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:18,440
you take them out to a
restaurant and yeah. Yeah.

976
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:21,980
Have him bring a cake over or maybe
you have your friends to work because I

977
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:25,730
don't think the restaurant, we'll do
it and he thinks it's a birthday cake.

978
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:30,320
All right.
And it says in frosting.

979
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,223
MMM,

980
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:36,590
you cheated on me. You
piece of shit. Okay.

981
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:41,620
And then you have your friends if they
can sing and they'll just sing the happy

982
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:46,460
birthday song with new lyrics.
Why did you cheat on me?

983
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:50,780
You do. Why did you cheat on me? You do.

984
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,170
Why did you cheat on me?

985
01:01:54,171 --> 01:01:57,680
You do each bag.

986
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,220
Why did you cheat on me?

987
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,520
And he's got a big fucking candle shape,
like a dick.

988
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,360
Maybe funny if it's more of a limp Dick.
I don't know. Maybe something like that.

989
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:13,190
Yeah.

990
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,320
Hey look, I tried. What
do you want from me? Okay.

991
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,080
I want to tell you how it was
kind of rough. Um, anyway.

992
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:27,540
Ah, fuck. Um, all right. So tonight
I am, I want to thank, first of all,

993
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:31,260
I want to thank everybody, uh, who,
who's been coming out to my shows, this,

994
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:34,160
this tourism. And I know I sounded kind
of crabby and tired today, but, uh,

995
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,880
I'm having a great time and as a public
rink down the street and I want to go

996
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:43,080
skate around and get the fucking blood
going before I drive out to a London,

997
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,670
Ontario tonight,

998
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:49,260
I got Montreal next and then I got
my day off where we're going to, uh,

999
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,770
the Canadians and a Bruins game.

1000
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,270
And then that's the end
of the east coast swing.

1001
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:02,550
And then we started our west coast swing,
which will be Winnipeg,

1002
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:07,500
Edmonton, Calgary, uh, fucking Vancouver.

1003
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:11,580
And then that little peninsula out
there, whenever the fuck it's called, um,

1004
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,860
I dunno, whatever. Dude.

1005
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:18,520
I'm fucking out of it.
I need an,

1006
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,430
I didn't want to go skating
and then I'm gonna take a nap,

1007
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:24,300
but I'm going to fucking
kill it tonight in London.

1008
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:27,610
That is the game plan. I just threw
my hat down. Did you hear that?

1009
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,410
Throw it down. Get myself psyched
up for the shoulder night.

1010
01:03:32,411 --> 01:03:35,500
That's the podcast for this week.
Thank you to everybody

1011
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,180
who's come out to my shows up here.
I got to tell you man,

1012
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:43,180
don't sleep on Canada and come
up here during the winter time.

1013
01:03:43,181 --> 01:03:45,250
It's fucking great if you'd like to.
That's a,

1014
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:50,370
that's actually a great way to learn how
to enjoy the winter and come to Canada

1015
01:03:50,621 --> 01:03:54,760
in the winter. You don't actually talk
to somebody and they, they, you know,

1016
01:03:54,761 --> 01:03:56,000
I was saying how, you
know, I always wanted

1017
01:03:56,060 --> 01:04:00,170
the fucking build a rink in my
backyard for my kids that I don't have.

1018
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,510
And um, this guy was like,
oh yeah, I did it. You know,

1019
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,810
they all had these different techniques
on how to make the ice perfect and they

1020
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:12,770
build these little ass fucking rinks for
their kids and then tear him down and

1021
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:17,120
reassemble them every fucking year. It's
a, they're, they're amazing people, man.

1022
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,000
Really Fun people up here
and great goddamn food.

1023
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:24,080
The only thing that I'm going to bitch
about is in Toronto was sitting there,

1024
01:04:24,081 --> 01:04:29,081
we bought these Cuban cigars and there's
no fucking place to smoke up standing

1025
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:34,301
on a heat lamps like assholes freezing
our asses off during to smoke these

1026
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:39,100
cigars. Man, there's not
one cigar bar and uh,

1027
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:40,730
and all of Toronto.

1028
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:46,160
And something sad I
notice happened up here.

1029
01:04:46,161 --> 01:04:49,400
I finally went to the El Mocambo last
night cause I wanted to have a drink

1030
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:53,570
because that's where a Stevie ray Vaughan
and double trouble had this great live

1031
01:04:53,571 --> 01:04:57,650
DVD that they did and I always wanted
to go into, it's a great dive. Uh,

1032
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:59,810
all these people have played
their fucking, you know,

1033
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:02,990
the rolling stones did a
show there in like 1977.

1034
01:05:02,991 --> 01:05:07,160
It's a really famous place and I
went over there and it's closed.

1035
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,540
It's actually for sale and people
are kind of holding their breath,

1036
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:16,040
hoping that someone is going to buy it
and refurbish it and keep the legend

1037
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,430
going.
And I took a picture of it,

1038
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:22,450
the melancholy look on my
face last night and uh,

1039
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:24,790
I wish I had a chance to go in there,

1040
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:29,440
but I'm hoping that someone's going to
buy it and keep it going. Cause I, I, I,

1041
01:05:29,441 --> 01:05:32,650
that was one that was on my bucket list
and I fucking blew it last time I was

1042
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:37,240
here. I could have gone in there and I
just got too fucking busy. I blew it.

1043
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,270
Anyways, that's the podcast for
this week. Go fuck yourselves.

1044
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,070
I will talk to you next week.

1045
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:46,340
I'll let you know about the rest of the
tour and the upcoming possibly Joe Bart,

1046
01:05:46,341 --> 01:05:50,740
Nick, Jason Law had Paul Versey. It's
just a rumor, but what I bring it up,

1047
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:54,630
if it wasn't going to be a fact till the
next week and find out it was a rough

1048
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:54,850
road.
