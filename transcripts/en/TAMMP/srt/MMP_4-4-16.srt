1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,483
Okay.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,160
Hey,
what's going on is still burning.

3
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:07,240
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Man da. Um,

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,650
April 4th, 2016. How's it going?

5
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:16,600
How I yeah, I am an Ottawa,
Canada right now. Oh,

6
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,490
can uh,

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,770
it's fucking freezing here.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,470
Every time I come,
I know.

9
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:34,200
Stroll stick together. Um, yeah, we came,

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,770
we did fucking almost in Wichita. I
don't know what the fuck the named place.

11
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:40,060
Windsor.
We did Windsor.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,740
Me Versie and fucking Joey be job partner.

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,000
We did a Windsor the first day.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,450
Yeah.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,860
I don't even know what day that is yet.

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,480
Friday we did it on Friday and um,

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,230
I bought this little fucking bitchy coat.
Nia calls it the Kleenex code.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,470
It's just to Celine,
all those little ones in the 70s.

19
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,370
And when they had the big puffy coats,
well,

20
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:11,640
they're still making the puffy coats to
not just like, they're like little once,

21
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:15,200
you know what I mean? They look like
little, uh, you know, like you're,

22
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:19,160
you're a rib shack and you open a little
thing and then give me a little morsel.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Talent looks like there's a bunch of
those sewn into the code. You know that.

24
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:25,040
Thank you know what the fuck
coat on talking about? Well,

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,940
it was all north north face numbers.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,030
So I got dad on a Hoodie because I looked
at the fucking forecast and it said

27
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:33,990
that um,
you know,

28
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,510
it's going to be like 50 degrees
and that coach good down to 40.

29
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,300
So I thought I was fine.
I was fine.

30
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,580
I was snug like a little bug in a
rug with first. Was it two days?

31
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,130
What hell was I?
The second day.

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,340
Okay.

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,050
Oh, the second day I was at
Casino Rama. That's right.

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,100
And that's when it started to snow and
that's when I started questioning my,

35
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,300
my jacket game is the young kids
say my jacket game was not on point.

36
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:10,020
However,
by the way,

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,080
I didn't bring any of my fucking podcast
equipment because you know this trip is

38
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:20,060
a motherfucker. All right. This is one
of these, it's known in my businesses.

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,210
A thrash. All right?
Sometimes you go on the road,

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,210
it's a fucking cake walk. All
right. Whatever the fuck that means.

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,150
What is a cake walk? I know.
I've never even looked that up.

42
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,250
Is there a certain kind of way you
walk when you fucking carrying a cake?

43
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,430
Maybe that's what it is. Sorry if I'm
fucking, the levels are too high year.

44
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,770
Just trying to talk to him. I
recorded like a microphone. Um,

45
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,290
that's going to be my guess.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,180
Yeah.

47
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,490
Is that when you have a fucking cake,
you know?

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,450
Yeah.

49
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,020
If you have a KCI going to be be walking
a little gingerly, no offense to me.

50
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,650
Right?
So you walk a little lightly with it.

51
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,160
Maybe you know what you're walking like
you walk in like Paul Versey when he

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,190
puts on his fucking Jordan
fours for the first time,

53
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,710
you should have seen him
walking down the casino.

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,770
He was walking like on his heels
because he didn't want to create some,

55
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,820
I got to tell you something.
I don't fucking understand.

56
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,830
People who fucking stand in line and then
stab each other over a fucking pair of

57
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:27,690
sneakers. I just really, dude, did
you see they got the new Jordans?

58
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:30,930
Three zero dude,
that fucking crazy.

59
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,220
The new Jordan threes are fucking crazy.
I swear to God,

60
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:40,100
they all look like nurse shoes to make
big, stupid, bulky looking fucking things.

61
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,960
I think I have a pair of Jordan ones.
I liked the colors.

62
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,780
I never liked those fucking things.
Either one,

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
they came out and they were red and black.

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,860
I thought those were the ugliest
fucking thing. So I told you before,

65
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,210
I'm farther back in the day.
I liked those Bruce Jenner.

66
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,920
Um, the capital on shoes, you know,

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,190
just simple pair with fucking
three stripes on the side.

68
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,840
I was cool with sneakers,

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,920
right through towards the end of the
eighties when they started having like the

70
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:10,740
fucking Bo Jackson,
the Neon,

71
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:15,120
Deon fucking remember that
neon green and Neon pink.

72
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,970
Those fucking sunglasses to
second and went into that shit.

73
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:22,590
Those pastel colors and the
stupid fucking Reebok pump. Oh,

74
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:26,160
maybe if I put some more air in my
sneakers, I won't have white guy legs.

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,360
The Reebok pumps where we're as stupid
is Batman versus Superman there.

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,850
Alright. Okay Shirley.
Here we go. This cake walk.

77
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,440
Surely you've heard the term cakewalk.

78
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,240
Did somebody write a whole fucking
article on this? Good Lord.

79
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:50,710
Cut to the fucking chase. All right.
I'll read this as fast as I can.

80
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:54,520
Surely you've heard the term cakewalk
used to describe some sort of challenge or

81
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:57,460
tasks that is reckoned
to be pitifully easy.

82
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,150
Surely you have what you stop saying
that? Stop calling me. Surely.

83
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,040
Surely you have. Please.
Please don't lie. Good Lord.

84
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,270
Who fucking wrote this?

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,353
MMM.

86
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,920
The figurative definition has been
around since the early 19th century.

87
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,840
As long as the literal one,
in fact it appeared in print,

88
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,850
but did you know that the term is
actually pretty racist, racist, racist,

89
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:27,340
racist?
I'll bet you didn't.

90
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,750
What the fuck is wrong with this idiot
who this is such a classic, you know,

91
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:35,860
if you actually had to get a real job
writing, you wouldn't have one. You know,

92
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,530
everybody on the Internet fancies
themselves like there's some sort of

93
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:42,190
journalist, you know when
they're writing, this is just no,

94
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,240
you just fucking write in on a w.

95
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,890
Okay.

96
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,690
It's like acting in a web series

97
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,470
and you're upset. You didn't get nominated
for a fucking Oscar. Uh, nor did I. Okay.

98
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,250
Did you know it was pretty
racist? Um, I'll bet you didn't.

99
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,093
Okay.

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,331
What?

101
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:05,120
Because you don't know some shit and
that means everybody else does it and you

102
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,790
fucking cunt. I mean, I didn't
know it, but I'm a moron.

103
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,840
I really don't like this person.
Uh, he said nor did I. Okay.

104
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,600
That's the first humble thing this
person said, maybe you can come around.

105
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,470
Maybe I was wrong.

106
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,850
I still don't think I could drive
cross country with this person. Um,

107
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,110
nor did I until I looked into the origin
of the term and found out it had roots

108
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,973
in the,

109
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,500
okay.

110
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,730
I don't know how to say
this word. Antebellum south
of the early 19th century.

111
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,940
Can you just tell me
what the fuck it means?

112
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,630
I would started during this era of
firmly entrenched slavery in the states.

113
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,300
The cakewalk was a dance event
where slaves were invited
to dress up in the fine

114
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:50,740
clothes and took on the heirs
of the white aristocracy.

115
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,490
Oh, so this is like when the
Wayans brothers did white chicks.

116
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,950
What do they do? It? Is this
like the first def jam comedy?

117
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,960
They started doing the white gay voice.
I said,

118
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,190
get out in the field to do the
work that I should be doing.

119
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,130
And everybody starts flipping
out, dying, laughing.

120
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,500
The next slave coming to
the stage. Um, all right.

121
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:19,501
They were held in the plantation home in
the same rooms where the risk splendid

122
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:24,310
balls were held among white society.
Oh my God.

123
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,230
How much did those people
fucking stink back then?

124
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,240
Putting on all those extra
layers of clothes? No such
thing as deodorant. Right.

125
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,010
Just join you as one of those things
where you're washed yourself in the same

126
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:39,400
fucking trough. The God damn
horses drank out of, uh,

127
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,870
the cakewalk was similar. It was
a ball held for the slaves. Oh,

128
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,300
so this is a Christmas party.
I didn't know they did that.

129
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,770
Okay.

130
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,230
I didn't see that. And roots,
you know, it wasn't all bad.

131
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:55,231
Every once in a while they had look a
company party after 364 and a half days of

132
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,910
absolute horror than they would.
They let him in the house. Yeah. Hey,

133
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,250
sorry about all that other shit.

134
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,350
Would you like some pumpernickel
the wife just made it. Oh,

135
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:10,450
let's get him out of the house side.
They seem to be a little restless.

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,810
That's fucking nuts. Oh, what
an ugly period. The cake like,

137
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:21,250
you know, like [inaudible] parried
but you know Celeste ugly. All right,

138
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,380
let's continue. Okay. The
cake walk was similar.

139
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,040
It was a bald ball held for the slaves.

140
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,700
Couples promoted promenaded sorry.
Through the ballroom,

141
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,980
bowing deeply and frequently.

142
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,250
Chins and noses held highly aloft.
If you're going to tell me,

143
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,800
they finally gave him a fucking party
and they still were assholes about it.

144
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,390
The couple who performed
the best interpretation of
how the white folks did it.

145
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,480
One a cake baked one imagines by a slave.

146
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,100
I didn't imagine that stuff
put words in my mouth.

147
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,170
I would figure the white people after
all the fucking time. But yeah. Well,

148
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,670
you know what? Uh, I consider
we ruined their fucking lives.

149
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,260
I think we can make
them a cake once a year,

150
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,570
but we're only given it to one of them.
Jesus Christ.

151
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:11,570
Every time you think you've found the
depths of how evil that shit was, he,

152
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,140
you find another layer. Oh my God.
Another layer. Just like a cake.

153
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,210
Jesus. I'm an artist this morning. All
right. The cake walk looks similar,

154
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,340
but it was also very different.

155
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,970
It's intent was to emulate white
society in order to market or the Jesus,

156
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,140
there's a dangerous fucking gave me,

157
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:36,141
I told you this is like the first def
jam comedy and much the same way as

158
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,893
oh Jesus Christ.

159
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,700
Saturnalia the ancient Rome
winter solstice festival.

160
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,480
Oh yeah. Exactly. Watching
the same fucking way, um,

161
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,400
where the rules of social order were
turned upside down in the slaves and

162
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:56,360
laborers became the rulers
and Matt and masters attended

163
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,270
attend their servants.
Oh they did this in Rome.

164
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,590
This is just all fucking weird.

165
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,800
Can you imagine the tension during that?
So then the master's fucking

166
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,260
okay.

167
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,980
Tended to the slaves and you know, the
slaves wanted to be just as fucking me,

168
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:18,791
but then they were like,

169
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,030
well we got to kind of alligator arm this
shit cause it goes back to the regular

170
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:25,630
way tomorrow. And then I would
think the master be like, all right,

171
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,250
you want me to wade into that
sea of hatred towards me?

172
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,700
Um, uh, just keep an eye on
me. Please stay tight. Okay.

173
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,800
It's still the left side of my nose. That
means a, I'm fearing for my life. Uh,

174
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:46,801
the slaves involved did indeed mark
the ridiculously refined customs of the

175
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:51,280
aristocracy. Yes. And they surely
meant it, but during the cakewalk

176
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,000
they were allowed to mock them.

177
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,990
And by ruling over even the very event
that should undermine his authority,

178
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:05,140
the plantation owners, managers to
assert his authority. You know something?

179
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,870
I was in such a fucking good mood.
I hate this shit.

180
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,360
Okay?

181
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,000
It's a fucking cakewalk. Well, you
know what? I already clicked off.

182
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:14,710
So how does that mean?
It's easy.

183
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,390
What does that mean?
It's, it's a cheap laugh

184
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,810
and know I got to go back. I just closed
the fucking window. I got to go back.

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,790
So how the fuck did that?
Because that does not sound easy to me.

186
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,900
Being a slave all year and then doing one.
Did you get to do one fucking day?

187
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:36,640
We get to make fun of this.
The master.

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,150
It's not a cakewalk and struck
a difficult, right? Yeah.

189
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,143
Yeah.

190
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,471
All right.

191
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:46,460
As if its roots in slavery don't make
the cakewalk racially charged enough.

192
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,160
It transitioned in the menstrual show.

193
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,660
How did it transition into
making something easy of
the Jim Crow era or even,

194
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,260
or even worse?
Um,

195
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,240
okay.

196
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,700
Gone was even the power.
A lot of to the slaves.

197
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,450
Yeah.

198
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,160
By the mark and just have the original
cakewalk and stage reproductions of balls

199
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,821
of the balls.

200
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:13,821
White performers in blackface performed
as blacks who made sincere clumsy

201
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,970
attempts at emulating whites
out of a desire to be like them,

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,900
not to undermine them. Ah,
okay. And then it became that.

203
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,590
I still don't understand why it's easy.
The original cakewalk.

204
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,380
Okay.

205
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,100
Walks being local affairs. How the, you
know what? Fuck the fucking Internet.

206
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,080
All right.
Can I fast forward to this?

207
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,070
Okay.

208
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,670
Oh God, he use the word
apparently. There's no other word.

209
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:51,270
Alternative comics like to use more
than that apparently. All right.

210
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,100
Clumsy attempt.

211
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,340
So I thought the original cake walks
were being local affairs held in the

212
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,350
confines of the set southern plantation,

213
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:01,620
the minstrel shows traveling
as a matter of course,

214
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,350
it was later interpretation and it became
defined the concept of the rest of the

215
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,460
country in the world and
what the kids describe.

216
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:10,580
Perhaps it's a deep desire to stop being
so incredibly racist American society

217
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,381
as a whole.
The banner,

218
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:15,360
the racial basis of the cakewalk in favor
of it's simply describing something so

219
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,590
easy that just walking could
yield the reward of a cake.

220
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,580
There it is.

221
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,400
The definition is still vaguely racist.

222
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,080
Okay.

223
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,220
It isn't racist if you think that
definition means it's going to be easy.

224
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:34,550
You're not even being remotely vaguely
racist. You just don't know the history,

225
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,453
right?

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,290
Yeah. Jesus Christ. All right, well
there's that was fucking depressing. Um,

227
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,330
well fortunately I'm up here
in Canada where, you know,

228
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,160
they have all the angelic white people
according to Michael Morris, you know,

229
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:56,030
up here they're all a bunch of angels
and nobody has to lock their doors. Uh,

230
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,520
which of course we know that's true.
Just generally speaking,

231
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:01,250
people don't get along with
one another. Um, all right,

232
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,690
so that was an excruciating 15 minutes.
I don't know how you guys enjoyed it.

233
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,860
So anyways,
kind of fuck did I get onto that shit?

234
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,030
Oh, because yeah, I thought the whole, um,

235
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,250
okay.

236
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,850
I thought the, I thought this whole
trip was going to be a muffin dance.

237
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,350
How about that?
Can I say something like that?

238
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,090
That was going to be
a little muffin dance.

239
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,140
Did you know that the
origins of Buffett Dance,

240
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,280
um, you actually, our
pro domestic violence.

241
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,410
I bet she didn't.

242
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,960
Surely you've heard the term muffin
dance before. Please, please,

243
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,390
please don't tell me you have not.

244
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,390
Okay.

245
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,390
The origin of Muffin dance
comes from the early 19 hundreds

246
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,150
when women, when they
asked, can we vote to,

247
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:05,151
were forced to show their clams and
dance out of the voting booths as people

248
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,030
through desserts at the,
uh,

249
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,040
this became known as the muffin dance
because clamp indicated that their pussy

250
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:16,590
stunk and turn men off.

251
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,630
Later in 1929,
the great,

252
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:24,990
great grandson of Abraham Lincoln said,
I cannot tell a lie.

253
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,230
Some of these bitches clamps to stink,

254
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,680
but there's still reason to
make them do a muffin. Dads,

255
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,690
they should be allowed to vote too. And
all the guys said, yeah, you know what?

256
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:38,880
You're right.
And everybody had muffins.

257
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,090
So next time you used
the term buffer dance,

258
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,690
just know that you're
being vaguely sexist. Um,

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,920
all right, I'm sorry. Why am I doing
this? Why am I talking like this?

260
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:56,300
Why of why am I sitting here in this
fucking freezing cold hotel room?

261
00:15:56,301 --> 00:16:00,040
I can't find where the fucking heat
is. I'm saying in one of these. Um,

262
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,010
and I'm a red rum.
Um,

263
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,823
okay.

264
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,660
Well just one of those, you know, I like
old shit to a point, you know, I like,

265
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,110
I thought I liked had having an old house
until I fucking had to deal with it.

266
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,243
Okay.

267
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, all the bullshit of how on an old
house, old hotels, I kind of like,

268
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,000
I loved the lobbies, but the second
you fucking go up to your room,

269
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,590
you start walking down the hall.
You know,

270
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,710
you feel like you should be riding a big
wheel and you're going to come around

271
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:31,850
the corner, and those too creepy fucking
chicks are going to be standing there.

272
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,270
God dammit, that fucking movie
freaked me out. That movie still got,

273
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,280
it's still disturbing. That's just a
disturbing fucking movie, you know?

274
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,740
And it's not the fact that he
goes completely fucking insane.

275
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:49,741
It's just as a comedian watching a man
suffering through writer's block like

276
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:53,530
that, and having that woman
coming up who's face is
shaped like a fucking parking

277
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:57,430
meter, asking you how it's
going every fucking 20 minutes.

278
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,740
I love how they blame the
fucking hotel rather than that,

279
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,603
you know?

280
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,280
Yeah.

281
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,760
Why did I, would you say
she means well? Yeah,

282
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,870
they just were a bad couple.
I think that that's what it was.

283
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:14,430
And when they went down in society,

284
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,760
they could go to events and
they could sort of watered down.

285
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:20,400
They're awful relationship
by interacting with others.

286
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,680
And then once they just got,
you know,

287
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,310
let's say we'll just stay in there
at the fucking hotel, you know,

288
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,480
for the whole God damn winter.

289
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,590
I don't understand why they had to be
there to watch it. You know what I mean?

290
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,560
Like what do you, what are you going to be
doing up there? I mean, it's, it's some,

291
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,040
it's the level with which said, it's
going to fucking snow. No asshole.

292
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,880
He's going to go up there and vandalize
the place. If they come there,

293
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:50,180
it's cause they need shelter.
It was really no reason

294
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,430
for it,
you know?

295
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,840
And that was also a vaguely racist movie,
wasn't it?

296
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,433
You know,

297
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,810
seeing that reverse racist, that
white people will be like, oh yeah.

298
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,130
Oh the fucking snow's 50 feet
in the fucking air. Oh yeah,

299
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,910
I got to write a book. Yeah. Why
don't I fuck it? Go up there.

300
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,020
Y'All hang out there and I'll, I'll do
my own room service every fucking day.

301
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,550
I'll stay in room fucking

302
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,820
706 and every day I'll take a fucking
elevator all the way downstairs to the

303
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:27,540
kitchen.
How,

304
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,740
who the fuck would sign up for that free,
didn't have any sympathy for,

305
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,180
you know, I'm just fucking with
you. I think it's a great movie.

306
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,050
I'm just in a grumpy,

307
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,000
goddamn moved considering I going
to drive from fucking Ottawa.

308
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,070
Are we up to Sudbury?

309
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,320
And then right after the show I
got to do my travels all fucked up.

310
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,280
I got to drive over to fuck Detroit,
which is like a fucking eight hour drive.

311
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,153
You know,

312
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,060
it takes me back to the days when I was
doing college gigs and I remember one

313
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:00,840
time I had this gig and the upper
peninsula of Michigan, right?

314
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,880
Some fucking town up there that
began with an h. All right,

315
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:09,030
so like an asshole. I'm like, alright,

316
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,060
I'm in Michigan and I didn't
look on the map to see where,

317
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:17,470
uh, to see where, you know,

318
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:21,550
basically the fucking
college was at and I just,

319
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,610
I just flew right into fucking Detroit
and then I realized that the upper

320
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:30,520
peninsula as actually it's sort of,
you know,

321
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,290
it's the Dick of Wisconsin.

322
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,970
I should have flown into
fucking Milwaukee and driven up,

323
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,920
but I didn't,

324
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,920
I flew into Detroit and I had to go
drive all the way up the whole fucking

325
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:50,770
state. It was pretty cool cause
I got to drive over there.

326
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:54,520
Whatever bridge that is, the Mackinaw
bridge and whatever the fuck it is.

327
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:58,210
I'm trying to look it up right now, but
I can't remember the name of the fucking,

328
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,440
I think it was Marquette. Oh, he
started begin with an age maybe.

329
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:05,530
I was thinking Lake Huron.
I think it was in Marquette.

330
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,990
I did a fucking gig up there.
Yeah. And I had like a,

331
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,040
I forget what time my flight was,
but I had to basically,

332
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,860
it was an early morning flight in Detroit.

333
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:19,930
It was like a fucking eight hour
drive or some shit, seven hour drive.

334
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,380
And the show didn't start till nine I
was done at 10 o'clock and had like a six

335
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:30,740
or 7:00 AM flight. I can't remember. And
I just, I was just like, you know, ah,

336
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,020
goodnight everybody.

337
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,320
And I jumped in my fucking car and just
drove like a fucking lunatic after her.

338
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,320
Are you having done the drive?
Drove all the way back.

339
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,700
Just like nodding off.

340
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,340
Almost fallen asleep as one of
the dumbest things I ever did.

341
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,090
Just trying to save like the fucking
$50 change fee or some shit like that.

342
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,940
So you would think that
I would learn from that.

343
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,160
Okay.

344
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,420
Not Old freckles,
but this time we actually have a,

345
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,280
I got like Barnett confers you to
help me with the fucking drive.

346
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,240
Yeah.

347
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,730
Oh my God. Dude. Sudbury is

348
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,500
okay.

349
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,270
Yeah.
It's as high up as fucking

350
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,990
the upper peninsula.
Michigan.

351
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,910
What a fucking ass off for some
reason they're going. Yeah,

352
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:15,680
there's never really know
airports around here.

353
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,710
I don't know why we didn't just
take a couple of puddle jumper,

354
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:22,010
so I have no fucking, oh,
I know why. I know why.

355
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,550
Initially I was picking up a rental car
in Detroit and I was going to drive this

356
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,590
whole thing and then at the last
second they're like, you know,

357
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:30,670
it's a pretty long fucking
drive. So I said, hi.

358
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,260
Well we'll fly most of it and
then we'll do the thing, you know?

359
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,470
Then we'll get the rental car,
we get the rental car and fucking Ottawa,

360
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,550
blah blah blah. We'll do it one way. But
then I was still leaving out of Detroit.

361
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:44,330
This is so fucking stupid.
Oh, this is gonna suck.

362
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,510
But anyways, what will be
cool tonight I'm playing a uh,

363
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,410
a small, like a hockey arena
and a, I was going to be great.

364
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,880
Ask him to be fucking good time.
I did.

365
00:21:55,881 --> 00:22:00,440
I played one of those last night
here in Ottawa, Ell, civic center,

366
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,290
whatever the fuck it was called.
Uh,

367
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,100
anyways, this is, and what
the fuck I want to talk about.

368
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,140
I need something else I want,
I want to talk about,

369
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:10,670
but I got to read the
fucking advertising here.

370
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:13,100
I know this podcast is all over the place.
Okay.

371
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,130
I can't say it's a
fucking cake walk anymore.

372
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,310
Can't say the cake walk anymore
because now I know it's fucking racist.

373
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,040
All right, well actually I go,
I can't say it to you guys,

374
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,060
but I could say it somewhere else.

375
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,960
You know who's kidding who I'm going to
say I'm going to say it cause I've been

376
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:30,820
saying it my whole fucking life. You
know, it's just going to cut and that's,

377
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,930
that's how you book.
That's how you become an old person.

378
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,240
Or someone's going like grandpa.

379
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,570
Yeah.

380
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,170
Do you know the origin of that? Oh,
shut up your first year. Freshmen.

381
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,480
All right. You fucking concept. Been
around 80 years. Stop breaking my balls.

382
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:48,220
If I want to say 23 scooter, God
damn it. I'm going to say it.

383
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,820
If you know it was cute,

384
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,550
you almost kill your fucking grandfather
trying to get them to stop saying

385
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:58,380
something. All right, let me, let
me get to the uh, advertising here.

386
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,280
Oh, here we go. Oh, the old trunk
club. Trunk Club. Everybody.

387
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,300
Do you hate going to the
mall? Sure. We all do.

388
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,490
You surely you've been to a mall.

389
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,420
Surely you're not going to sit
there and say you haven't. Um,

390
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,220
trunk club shopping takes forever
and no one has time for it. Well,

391
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:23,240
people will enjoy it too. They
live for it. Let's go shopping.

392
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,320
It'll is fucking dope.

393
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,660
It just go down and they will sit
there and look at outfits. You know,

394
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,910
never once putting their ear up to the
shirt and hearing the crying child that's

395
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,720
sewed it together.
You know,

396
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:40,550
throwing out their old fucking clothes
just end up in the ocean or in some

397
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:44,820
hipsters back who pretends he
had the job you had. Right. Um,

398
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,980
shopping, you know, I just always drop
off clothes at goodwill. Who's kidding?

399
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:52,340
Who I still do. And I thought it went to
fucking homeless people and it doesn't,

400
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:54,950
it just goes right on their racks and
they turned around and they sell them,

401
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,340
which makes me feel good knowing that
they don't end up in a goddamn ocean.

402
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,830
Right. I ways. And now it's spring.

403
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:08,390
So you need pastel polos and boat shoes.
Right.

404
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,810
And it'd be nice to have your
own personal stylist too.

405
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,670
I think that it has to be a joke.
Nobody needs pastel polos and boat shoes.

406
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,130
I think that those should only be
for the upper 1% of this country.

407
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,113
You know what I mean?

408
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,650
It's for the robber barons and their
date rape his children, you know,

409
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,340
and they can walk around and won't be
great as you make an exclusive for them.

410
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,700
So they'll feel like, oh, look
at us. We are a cut above.

411
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,110
It will be like a status symbol.

412
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,730
But really what it is is it's a warning
for anyone that dates their children.

413
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,890
You know what I mean? It was set out and
wearing the scarlet a, the euro whore,

414
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,880
you just have those pastel colors.
Just be like, you know, it gives,

415
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,370
it gives the ladies a little heads up.

416
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,200
You know that there's going to be a
sense of entitlement coming at him with a

417
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:04,430
heart on, right? You got to give them
the fucking heads up. Jesus Christ.

418
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,620
Just trying to do my part here,
right?

419
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,290
Let me pour out a little wine
cooler for Edith Wharton here. Um,

420
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,040
and it'd be nice to have your own
personal style is too with trunk club.

421
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,820
You don't ever have to set a foot in a
store and you get your very own stylist

422
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:26,840
for free. Make it easy to look your
best and clothes that fit you perfectly.

423
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:30,920
Can't take by your own personal
stylist for free with Trunk Club.

424
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:35,030
Go to trunk club.com/burr
type in your measurements,

425

get your very own personal stylist.

426
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,550
A, they'll pick your clothes
from Okinawa. My God,

427
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,020
this is a muffin dance right here.

428
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:50,210
They'll pick your clothes from over 80
top brands and ship them right to you.

429
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:54,260
Do A, you keep what you like. Can you
send back what you don't in the trunk?

430
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,550
A trunk club.

431
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,930
You know what they're going to fucking
send these close to some maniac. Okay.

432
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,160
Some serial killer.

433
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:03,890
Cause you know they don't like to go
to malls either unlisted trolling for

434
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:04,880
victims.
Right.

435
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,820
And what's going to happen is they're
going to get confused and they're going to

436
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:12,290
go, you know, you know,
which is the fucking the uh,

437
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,290
I don't like this shirt
trunk in which is the one,

438
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,210
this stuff in the body and they're going
to fucking throw a bunch of shirts in

439
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,180
the bottom of a lake and they're going
to send her body back to trunk club.

440
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:27,140
I'm calling that right now.
Calling that right now.

441
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,850
Then they're going to do a first 48
about it. But when this trunk showed up,

442
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,010
they couldn't understand why they shirt
smelled so bad. I'm sorry. It's bad.

443
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,590
Trunk Club is not just another
way to shop online. It isn't.

444
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,190
Your style is takes the
time to your unique, your

445
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,160
unique look if you live in.

446
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,823
Okay.

447
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,550
It's just so funny about it.

448
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:55,310
I was just picturing somebody standing
in a mirror looking at themselves,

449
00:26:55,311 --> 00:26:56,810
trying to figure out, they look, you know,

450
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,450
you know that little thing where you
have your hands on your hip and then you

451
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,950
stick one foot in front of the other.

452
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:06,200
Like you're a horse answering a
question because she want some oats. Um,

453
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,570
and if you live in Dallas, Do York,
Los Angeles, Chicago, a, d c, uh,

Now wait a minute.

456
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:21,500
I thought the whole point was
not to go to a fucking store.

457
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,800

it off? Like a term paper. Oh God,

461
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,950

464
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,390

rapists with white pastel colors.

Sorry my voice is a lot of out of it.

470
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:16,300
I've been screaming my jokes for
three nights in a row. Oh God.

471
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,930

473
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,050
No more sweaty balls. Boo. Doo
Doo, Doo me undies me undies.

474
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,170
Skating down the fucking
canals here in fucking Ottawa.

475
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,550
You're on the canal.

476
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,270
You're wearing your Randy's with your pal.

477
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:42,080
Both your balls are really
fucking dry. In fact, again,

478
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:46,680
getting really chafed cause it's cold.
You me undies. We'll keep him warm.

479
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,430
Alright me undies. By the way, if
you ever skate the canal out here,

480
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:53,040
I've always been afraid to do
it. You know, I, I've done it,

481
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,390
but I was nervous when I did it.

482
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:57,570
I just kept thinking about the omen
like I was going to fall through and

483
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:00,870
everyone's going to be hacking at
the ice trying to get me out again.

484
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,330
The canals only a foot deep, you
know, it's really no big deal.

485
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,200
So worst thing that could happen
is you could get severe frostbite,

486
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:14,610
may have to remove both your
feet like in that movie misery.

487
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,440
Um, well in the movie she just fucking
breaks his ankles and the book,

488
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,030
she cuts off his fucking feet.

489
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,030
I love when they do shit
like that and it's just like,

490
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:27,850
okay so you've severed a major artery
and this guy somehow doesn't bleed out in

491
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,150
the bed.
Cause let me guess,

492
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,180
you tied your fucking
belt around his calf.

493
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,880
Does that even work by the way?

494
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,500
If somebody fucking did you see the
fucking redneck that blew his God damn leg

495
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,910
off?
Oh my God,

496
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,720
this is new fucking thing that
rednecks are doing. You know,

497
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,210
cause they just love shooting
stuff and blowing stuff up.

498
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:52,570
And as much as people you know,

499
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,140
who don't have their own spread
living in the middle of nowhere,

500
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,590
judge them somewhere in the back
of your head, you know, it's fun,

501
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,710
you know,
riding around on a fucking four wheelers,

502
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,320
shooting a gun on your own
fucking property. You know,

503
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,280
it's got to feel great. That's a level
of freedom that I, I've never heard,

504
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,720
I've never felt, you know, I live in
the city where there's noise ordinances,

505
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,400
you know, which basically noise on
my property should not carry over.

506
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,570
Like you can basically call the cops if
somebody splashed around that pool too

507
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:30,560
loud.
He's mocked the fact I don't have one.

508
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,720
Um, the cops go over, then he just
started beating people, right?

509
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,420
Or air quote, getting the
situation under control. Um,

510
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,490
Christ, what the fuck was I just talking
about? Oh yeah. Riding around, you know,

511
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,680
so I watched this,
this new thing that they do.

512
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,740
They take this some sort of explosives
and they put it in these old cars and

513
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:59,321
then hopefully they stand far enough
away and the fucking thing blows up.

514
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,020
Well, this fucking guy, alright,

515
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,510
redneck blows.

516
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,770
Look at this shit right here it goes.
Redneck blows himself up,

517
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,420
blows up house,
blows himself up in a bonfire,

518
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,650
blows up pigs almost blows his head off.

519
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,850
This is such redneck stuff.
Stupid redneck blows himself up.

520
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,560
A fire blows up,
blows himself up.

521
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,500
Boat Motor blows up.

522
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,690
Fucking rednecks and crazy blows leg off.

523
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,450
Okay,

524
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,050
let's see. Where is it?
Come on. All right. Yup.

525
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,720
And an American gun enthusiast. A.
Yeah, that's an all American in there.

526
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,270
American Georgia man loses leg f
for explosives filled lawnmower.

527
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,490
Um, I will link you that she
don't see his leg blown off,

528
00:31:56,491 --> 00:32:00,870
but you blow blow off his body.
But this guy,

529
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:05,460
basically, it's called, uh, I
hope I say it right Tanner. Right?

530
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,540
It's some sort of explosive and the new
thing that these rednecks too is they

531
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,374
fucking

532
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,360
okay.

533
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,790
He fucking, uh, you know,

534
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,210
you put it in whatever
vehicle in order to is,

535
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,210
it's really what's going on here with
these rednecks are starting to be a little

536
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:25,860
more classy, you know, after
all these fucking years of, uh,

537
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,170
you know, having a card die, they
just leave it on their front lawn.

538
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,990
Now they're getting rid of it. They're
blowing them up. So they put this Tanner,

539
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:34,240
right?

540
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,980
Whoever the fuck he saying this is
explosive and there's some sort of formula

541
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,870
like basically for every
such and such amount,

542
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:46,790
you need to be like a hundred feet
back. All right? So let's say whatever.

543
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:50,450
What we'll just say this guys, if he,
he's got a handful of this fucking Tanner.

544
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,540
Oh God. We're doing math now,
Bill. Alright. And he needed,

545
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,180
he basically needed to be about like,
I don't know,

546
00:32:56,181 --> 00:33:00,140
500 feet back and he was 40
feet away from this lawn mower.

547
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,960
Any fucking shoots the shit.
Right?

548
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,850
He fucking shoots ish.
And uh,

549
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,070
he blows the fucking thing up.

550
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,960
All right.
Listen to this shit.

551
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,190
Yeah. Somebody had to do
their fucking Dj remix of it.

552
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,070
Anyways, he's shooting and
he's shooting a lot more shit.

553
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:27,630
All of a sudden it fucking blows up and
then he's on the ground and you see it.

554
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,490
You just, you can't see anything. You just
at the camera's pointing at the ground,

555
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:34,130
he just hear him go, I blew my leg. Oh,

556
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:40,210
fucking unbelievable. I'm amazed
that he could actually say that.

557
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,450
I would just be staring at
the stop going. Ah. I mean,

558
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,030
well he's got to tell that story
for recipe. At what point does that,

559
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:52,960
can he laugh along with everybody else?
You know?

560
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,110
I bet he's considered like
a tragic, tragic figure now
and the redneck community,

561
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:05,070
you know, like he'll probably, you know,

562
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,240
at the next cross burning,
they let him light it.

563
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,600
He hobbles up and everybody
gives him a round of applause.

564
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,400
Like they're all fucking sad.

565
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,330
Like what happened to them with some
sort of a terrorist act rather than self

566
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:22,100
imposed fucking stupidity.
Jesus Christ, you know,

567
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,570
I feel bad for the guy,
but

568
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,880
okay,

569
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,470
the fuck are you doing shooting a
God damn gun at dynamite basically,

570
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:33,680
whatever the fuck it is
in a God damn lawn mower.

571
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,880
That's the fucking blade alone.
The shrapnel from that,

572
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,620
I gotta look this shit up.

573
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,380
Top 10

574
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,160
dumb ways to blow you out to
die. All right, let's see.

575
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:57,930
We'll go with that today. All right. What?

576
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,160
You don't want to hear your
march madness brackets,

577
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,950
top 10 dumb ways to die.
Uh,

578
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,010
there's always the opening the elevator
doors before the elevator gets there and

579
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:14,560
not looking and then stepping
in and falling to your death.

580
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,660
Yeah,

581
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,980
playing with guns.

582
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,130
I don't fucking know I or top 10
dumbest ways to die. Here we go.

583
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,550
All right.
Starving in a supermarket.

584
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,090
I don't even want to read that one.
Diving off a cliff,

585
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:35,800
but survive but die of shock from the
high price of your hospital bill. Oh,

586
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:40,100
Jesus Christ.
Oh Jesus.

587
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,880
I don't need to hacky jokes.
I have plenty of those. C'Mon.

588
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,850
10 absolute dumbest. Wasted. Die.

589
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,013
All right,

590
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,460
this is all going to be
clickbait horse shit.

591
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,880
Okay? You know what? Go
Fuck Yourself. He goes,

592
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:00,710
should be dying right now
waiting for me to read this shit.

593
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,890
Trying to kiss a reflection
of the moon in a lake.

594
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,320
All right? Somebody died doing that
and then I got to click another page.

595
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:08,801
You know what I mean?

596
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:11,830
Once he can have advertising on every
fucking page and somehow you can fucking

597
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:14,740
afford Twinkies this month. Go Fuck
Yourself. All right. So when it was,

598
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:15,574
just talk about the,

599
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,030
okay,

600
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,810
the Tory or so the first,
the first day we were in Windsor,

601
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,230
right across from Detroit and um,

602
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,140
okay.

603
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,610
It was awesome. Our upstate, this great
hotel and you can look right across the,

604
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:32,444
uh,

605
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,450
okay.

606
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,740
What are the fucker was, I guess
it isn't Lake Eerie, isn't it?

607
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,130
Okay.

608
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,910
It's just a river.
I don't know what the fuck you call it.

609
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,960
Is it a sound? Oh, the Detroit river.

610
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:49,190
And you see beautiful downtown Detroit
and Detroit never looks more beautiful

611
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,980
when you're not in Detroit when
you're across the fucking river.

612
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,270
Looking at it from Windsor. And I just
kept asking a bunch of people like,

613
00:36:56,271 --> 00:37:00,170
cause I'm going to invest, I want to buy
something in Detroit, I'm going to do it.

614
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,680
God dammit, you know,
invest back in America.

615
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,340
I think I totally believe in that city.
I know it's going to come back.

616
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,750
And I was asking people where to fucking
invest and they would just all laugh.

617
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:15,350
And you're like about 40 miles north.
Like nobody believes in it,

618
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:19,220
which is what's making me want to
fucking buy. They're even more, you know,

619
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,400
it's fucking dirt. God damn cheap.
It's gonna to come back at some point.

620
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,600
It has to come back.

621
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,990
Sit right there on the river.

622
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,260
I know the fucking Cleveland Cavaliers
guy bought up a bunch of fucking

623
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:33,030
skyscrapers there has got to,
you know,

624
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,260
he put like the people from Google
and one of them I have no idea.

625
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,020
Yeah,

626
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,990
but the shit is so cheap there. I don't,
I don't get how you fucking loose.

627
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,360
And I liked the idea.
You go in there, right?

628
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,110
You've fixed the fucking place up that
you buy and then you don't kick the

629
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:51,770
people out that live in there.
And then they got a nice place to live.

630
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,113
Right.

631
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,510
Maybe that gets them in a better mood.

632
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,970
Slowly but surely it just start turning
it around. I think any American, right,

633
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,920
what we should deal with
these fucking cities.

634
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:06,050
Cause God knows the government's
not going to do anything.

635
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:09,860
I don't think they can because they're
bitches to the fucking Federal Reserve

636
00:38:09,861 --> 00:38:14,750
bankers, right. I don't have any fucking
money. They're robbing Peter to pay Paul.

637
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,070
So I think with whatever money they let
us keep, we ought to just start fucking,

638
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:23,570
you know, buying up some shit
and Detroit, turn it around.

639
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:27,250
Don't kick the people
out, get it. Go on and get

640
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,700
okay.

641
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,560
Maybe then they could start
making American cars right. It get

642
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,250
start fucking with the,
the Audis.

643
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:39,070
And it's a fucking travesty that we
don't really have anything they can fuck

644
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:39,904
with those cars.

645
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,600
The fact that they're going to allegate
around the base level Cadillac,

646
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,130
the base level, Lincoln
Continental. Alright,

647
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,060
I'm going to pale in comparison to what
those maniacs in Germany are doing.

648
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,180
I mean, I don't understand why you
don't, you know, we could fucking do it.

649
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,250
I guess Buicks are selling like fucking
hotcakes. Is it? Is that a racist,

650
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,650
a racist thing. And then we'd kinks in
it, I think is racist. Hotcakes. Uh,

651
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,270
back in the day when they
were actually every 10 years,

652
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,740
let us slave have a birthday.

653
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,730
One of the things the slave owners would
do was actually heat up the cake so we

654
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:16,570
would burn it, burn their mouths
because they were that evil.

655
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,680
Here's another chapter of white
evil that you didn't know existed.

656
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,780
Um,
selling like hotcakes,

657
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,900
I guess hotcakes for pancakes back in
the day. And you know, God damn well,

658
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,320
you know, having pancakes
must have been a fucking tree.

659
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:35,470
Cause I remember back then when you
read the Tom Sawyer book, right?

660
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,543
Uncle Barry Finn,

661
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,680
it's fucking kids paint a fence just to
get an apple like that was considered

662
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:46,570
like a treat because all day long you
would just sit around even fucking,

663
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,960
I don't know if she went on shrubs.
I don't know what the fuck you doing.

664
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,450
So anyways, I'm, I want to buy them.
I want to buy something there and uh,

665
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,120
not become the fucking evil person that
boots the people out that are in there.

666
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:06,100
He just fixed the fucking place
up. It gives a shit, you know,

667
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,240
that's of course the people in
there then fuck the whole place off.

668
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,790
Then I would be upset.
You know how much that plastic,

669
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:17,770
because it was Jody do
something nice. Um, whatever.

670
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,780
Eventually I'm going to look into that.
Um, so we did with Windsor and uh,

671
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:26,110
we had a great time and Rosie was there.
So of course I smoked a cigar.

672
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,840
So you know, you know, I only
do two cigars a month now.

673
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,120
So last month I only smoked one.

674
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,440
February I had two and a half because
we started to smoke one and it wasn't

675
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:38,810
smoking well and we have got halfway
through and I'm like, it's fucking cigar.

676
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,700
Sucks. So actually smoked two and
a half. So I smoked two in January.

677
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,910
I fucked the fucking rain man right now.
So then four and a half, five and a half.

678
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:52,240
So I'm actually half a cigar
under my goal for this year.

679
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:56,590
So April 1st used to
already smoked a cigar.

680
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:00,370
So now I can only have one more or
technically one and a half more.

681
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,440
But I'm actually going to try
and get down to one a month.

682
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,590
And to be honest with you,

683
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:09,790
I'd Kinda like to go all the way to my
birthday in June and not smoke another

684
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:14,450
one. Right? Oh goddamn.
And I enjoy them. I enjoy,

685
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:17,590
I enjoy the fucking lifestyle.
I enjoy the whole fucking thing about it.

686
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:21,700
I love going in. I love picking
them out. I love the excitement.

687
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,480
I love the smell. I love the old
fucking chairs. You sit there.

688
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,860
I love that there's no fucking
young people there, you
know? And by young people,

689
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:33,980
I mean anybody 39 and younger,
I used don't run into, you know,

690
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,310
everybody's just chilling the fuck out.
Smoking a cigar.

691
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,110
I don't care what kind
of a maniac you are.

692
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,170
All these fucking kids that they put
on Ritalin and all this type of shit.

693
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,540
You just give these kids a cigar. Sam, sit
down, puff, you know, next thing you know,

694
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,580
you just, you thinking about it,
just think about how great life is.

695
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,150
There's some of us smoke a cigar.
That's how he's,

696
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,530
you start thinking about how
great it is. Great. It is.

697
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:01,130
He can enjoy the fucking day.
You start planning your retirement.

698
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,270
How the fuck are you going to get out
of this bullshit so you can just sit

699
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:09,560
around in whatever zen you've
somehow come into. I mean,

700
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,160
I swear to God,
if cigarettes make you feel like that,

701
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:16,730
I understand why people do that
shit is funny. But you know,

702
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,380
nonsmokers like myself,
you know,

703
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,600
I actually am a smoker now with
the fucking cigars, but, um,

704
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,160
okay.

705
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,800
You know,
he's always looked down on a structure.

706
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,660
People that smoked cigarettes and they
were huddled outside and all that shit.

707
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,423
You know,

708
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,270
I don't know. Maybe the, maybe they,
maybe they know something. I don't,

709
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,890
I'm not advocating smoking. I don't
know what I'm saying. By the way,

710
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,340
Canada, Windsor Airport, Jesus Christ.

711
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,110
What a fucking gem that is.
I love small airports.

712
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,440
There's nothing better than
that little ass fucking airport.

713
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:54,510
Then when I went to Toronto,
we flew into, we flew over, um,

714
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:59,500
the propeller plane. Jesus
Christ, if you sub Rosa, you
walk into that. He did. He's,

715
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:02,380
he's one of those guys. I don't, I
don't want, if he sees propellers,

716
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:07,420
he feels like he's a riding in
like a model t Ford, you know? Um,

717
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,910
I always just say to myself, I will,
it's, uh, it's going to fly better. Well,

718
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,870
we have much less of a chance because
there's less working parts here.

719
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:21,010
Perceptive. They go bad, you know, I
don't know. That's what I tell myself.

720
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:23,410
So anyways, um, we went to Toronto,

721
00:43:23,411 --> 00:43:25,840
we didn't fly into their
nightmare fucking airport.

722
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,180
We flew to the TR Toronto islands,

723
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:32,710
which I'd never heard of as a fucking
little ass airport there we get picked up

724
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,470
and we took a little fairy,
you know,

725
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,410
it's fucking hilarious
across the western channel.

726
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,940
It literally like,

727
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,830
we started to go and I started videotaping
it and by the time I pay and from out

728
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,040
my side window to the front window,

729
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:52,570
we had already gotten across to you
get across it in like 30 seconds. Um,

730
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,600
or they have a tunnel, you can walk
underneath the western channel.

731
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,270
We did that on the way back. It
was a nice little ass airport. Um,

732
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,900
after all these years of traveling, I
love a little mom and pop airport. Get in,

733
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,020
get the fuck out. It's
hilarious. She show up.

734
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,180
They still have the old
school metal detectors,

735
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:13,750
so you don't have to go through that
fucking radiation shower that for some

736
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,800
reason I just don't understand that.
So to stop terrorism,

737
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:21,550
you're going to give all
your countrymen cancer. Well,

738
00:44:21,551 --> 00:44:25,240
if we fucking kill everybody,
who they going to blow up?

739
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,880
Um, so anyways, how far into
this fucking town? 45 minutes

740
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,890
anyways, but these shows cannot, it
cannot have a bet going any better. And,

741
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:42,150
um, I've been working my
ass off in Los Angeles, um,

742
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:47,270
for a reason that I'm not allowed to
say yet for whatever fucking reason.

743
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:52,510
So I've been worried that I, I
can't, um, you know, I can't fucking,

744
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:56,010
uh, do stand up as much
as I'd like. But us,

745
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,080
I've been doing a bunch of spots,

746
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,610
like little 10 minute spots trying to say
shap I just do a little bit of my act,

747
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,010
even the jokes, I hate him.
Like Dad, I just fucking say it.

748
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:07,550
So you remember how it goes. And, um,

749
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,470
I could not be having more
fun up here, Matt. Just having
a fucking great time. Um,

750
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,080
just figuring out my act.

751
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,000
I even figured out this new way to trash
women that like isn't as fucking mean

752
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:24,330
as I used to do it,
but I still get to make the same points,

753
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,390
so I just don't come off,
you know,

754
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,540
was a complete fucking lunatic all the
time and I don't want to be that guy,

755
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,420
you know what I mean?
As much as you know,

756
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:36,360
something I'd realized I never finished
reading the me undies think that I,

757
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,720
you know. Okay. Whether you're
wearing a suit or sweats,

758
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,270
you spend almost 24 hours
a day and your underwear,

759
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,460
but instead of making a statement like
Superman's tights under his everyday

760
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,070
clothes, your underwear is probably
boring. [inaudible] about to change that.

761
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:53,790
Oh yeah. They're, they're about ready
to take your balls to the next level.

762
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,540
They're going to hang a little disco
ball, you know, it's called the third eye,

763
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,660
the third ball right out. If
you fucking nuts, you know,

764
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,490
can you imagine her excited face when
she sees a disco ball hanging off the end

765
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:09,260
of your Dick? Right. She
probably get that checked. Uh,

766
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:13,350
please include all of the following.
No Mo Madell is pronounced modal.

767
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,210
Every pair of me undies is made
from sustainable source modal,

768
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,770
modal fabric. That's twice
the softest cotton. Uh,

769
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,400
nothing can describe the fit and feel
of me undies. But once you try them on,

770
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:30,210
you understand why they're called the
world's most comfortable underwear.

771
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,770
Um, then if you don't love your first
pair of me undies, they're free.

772
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,880
No questions asked me.

773
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:40,080
And he says dozens of styles and limited
edition prints to help you make a

774
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:44,430
statement with your underwear.
Whether anyone could see them or not.

775
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,860
Remember Superman.
I don't like that joke.

776
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,440
I remember Superman. What did,
he's fighting Batman. You know,

777
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:56,400
somebody on Worldstar hip hop,
one of my favorite fucking websites,

778
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,160
you know, watch a people
funny vines, you know,

779
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:06,240
music that I'd, I'm completely not even
aware of. I get to learn about that shit.

780
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,990
And then, uh, to some of the most fucking
insane fights you're ever going to see.

781
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,350
And there's always a tipping point
when you watch fights on Worldstar.

782
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,710
Is this always the amazement?

783
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,120
And then somewhere it just starts to
become sad. If you just start thinking,

784
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,340
what is wrong with human beings?
Why do we do this shit?

785
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,930
Why can't we just go out to a fucking
McDonald's or a fucking dance club,

786
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,363
you know,

787
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:35,370
and not have like a 50 on 55 I do have
to tell you the respect I have for

788
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:42,250
someone that actually would go into one
of those modern day Braveheart fucking

789
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:44,170
things.
I mean,

790
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,420
I don't give a fuck how many martial
arts classes you've taken in your life.

791
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:54,880
There is nothing that they teach you in
those fucking classes other than to turn

792
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:55,930
around and run,

793
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,670
which you already know how to do when
you get in the middle of a fucking Malay

794
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,360
like that. It's just
inevitable. The fucking odds,

795
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,011
you know,

796
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:09,790
that's the fight version of being like
the helicopter gunner in Vietnam where

797
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:14,340
they had like a fucking a life expectancy
of two fucking weeks. It's just,

798
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:19,000
you're just standing there and you
know what's going to happen. All right?

799
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,850
You're going to, you're going to,
something's going to fucking hate you.

800
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:26,851
You're going to get knocked out and I
have to tell you the influence of MMA on

801
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:30,640
these fucking street fights.
Now back in the day,

802
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,670
I seem to remember when you
knock somebody out, that was it.

803
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:38,730
You didn't sit on their chest and throw
another 40 punches to their head waiting

804
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:42,590
for big John to come over in fucking,
you know,

805
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,960
usher you out of there. There's
no ref. That fucking shit.

806
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:49,570
We already knocked somebody out.
Then your boot him in the head.

807
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:54,580
I mean at that point that's like
attempted murder, man, you won.

808
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,460
You're knocked him out.
He'd come up and he'd do this.

809
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:00,250
You sit on that chest to do
a fucking speed back. They

810
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,940
fucking brutal. But anyways,
you know these me undies,

811
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,780
I'm going to get through this shipping
is free in the u s and Canada and you

812
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:15,760
save up to $8 a pair with me undies
subscription plan. I get the subscription.

813
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,980
You know,
it's like a fucking end zone dance.

814
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:20,650
I always thought it was cooler when
you fucking just scored a touchdown.

815
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:24,400
You flip the ball to the ref and like,
yeah, I'm going to be doing this all day.

816
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,890
If he'd knock somebody out. Yeah.
He just turned around like, yeah,

817
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:27,850
my job's done here.

818
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,350
You walk away like Clint Eastwood and
one of those drifter movies, you know,

819
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,560
if you sit on that chastity,

820
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,110
like you fucking kind
of spazz out screaming,

821
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:40,660
what did I tell you bitch?
You know,

822
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:45,220
with your voice goes up nine octaves
when your voice goes up like nine octaves

823
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:48,300
like that, you kind of betray your
bad ass. And this he kind of is,

824
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,750
you hear a level of excitement like,
oh my God, I can't believe I won.

825
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,110
That's what I always hear.
Um, having said that,

826
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:58,030
I wouldn't want to fight
anybody in those videos

827
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,810
and it's not even the fact
that I know I would lose.

828
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:05,710
I just know that after I was knocked out,
you do irreputable plucking.

829
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,720
I can't even say the word brain damage,

830
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,220
which is unnecessary fucking brain
damage. You're knocked me out. You want,

831
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,530
I'm laying there.
Okay.

832
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,630
My hands are pointing up into outer
space. Um, um, uh, knocked out.

833
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,800
You know why he got to go there
and knock my melon around more. Um,

834
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,470
if I was running for president, I
would bring that up. I see in America,

835
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,600
that goes back to when
you knock somebody out,

836
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,790
you walk away like Clint Eastwood in
a Spaghetti Western. Uh, all right.

837
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:38,600
Shipping is free and the U s and Canada

842
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,270
He's Christ like a two more
of these fucking things.
Dollar Shave club, everybody.

843
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:02,960
Dollar Shave club.com as a special
offer for new members who join today,

844
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,770
you'll get a free month of the executive
razor when you buy a tube of Doc Dick

845
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:11,880
Cavett, ECC, Shave Bada I'm
saying copies. All right,

846
00:51:11,881 --> 00:51:13,760
because that's how I been saying,
even though it's carvers,

847
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:18,080
I like saying Carvey scan. I'm a big fan
of Dana Carvey. Alright, so there you go.

848
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,870
This is the first time they've
ever done something like this.

849
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,670
And once you try dollar shave club.com
you'll become a proud member like

850
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:26,481
millions of others.

851
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:30,140
One reason is because they deliver amazing
razors right to your door for a third

852
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:33,620
of the price of what the Gri
razor corporations charge.

853
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,720
That means when you
joined dollar Shave Club,

854
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:38,480
you can afford to shave with a
fresh blade anytime you want,

855
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,560
which feels fantastic.
You'll get a free first class boy,

856
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:47,120
you get a first class shave when you
use the executive blade without hurting

857
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:50,180
your wallet. What is
the executive blade? Um,

858
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:55,181
another reason is that Dr Covey's easy
shave butter using it with the executive

859
00:51:56,181 --> 00:52:00,200
makes the blade glide gently
for the smoothest shave ever.

860
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,460
Dr Carver's shave butter isn't

872
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:45,710

873
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:53,090

lady or drop it in the mailbox.

880
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:19,243
It's that easy.

881
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,200
No wonder over 600,000 small businesses
are already using stamps.com.

882
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,320
I use.com whenever I send out one of my
fucking posters. You know it's funny,

883
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,450
I have a poster for this,
this tour,

884
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,720
the plowing ahead tour and it was
an old telly Savalas movie poster.

885
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,150
Right.
And you know,

886
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:42,900
I spent all this money having this guy
do the whole thing up and we had the

887
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:46,590
whole fucking tagline on it. You
know, it looks like an action movie.

888
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,500
Like I'm sitting there, but he was
telly Savalas was holding the gun.

889
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:54,230
I'm holding a microphone. We both
bald baldheaded right. And uh,

890
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,590
he had a casino.
All it should,

891
00:53:55,591 --> 00:53:58,270
I have like a helicopter and all
this dumb shit that I'm fucking into,

892
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:02,150
so it looks like this action movie.
Then we had the, all this fucking just,

893
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:07,320
you know, silly shit. Like they tried to
internet porn, they fished out the oceans,

894
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,490
but nothing could stop the
man with no answers. Right.

895
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,600
And then it was like this coming,
you know,

896
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:15,270
I was supposed to be
like this movie poster.

897
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,450
So I don't think the
casinos understood it.

898
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,560
They took away all of the, uh, the,

899
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,590
the words, whatever the fuck
you call it, all the texts,

900
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:29,280
they took all of it away and they just
have this standalone poster and now I

901
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:30,480
just look like a magician.

902
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,710
Like is he going to come in in a
helicopter and make a truck disappear?

903
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,180
Like it doesn't make any sense.

904
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:40,260
And I spent all this fucking money on
it and most of them are just using my

905
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:42,960
poster for my last tour,
you know,

906
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,660
when I had with what's left of
my hair grown out in a beard.

907
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:49,830
So I don't even look the same. It's
just, it's been a shit show. Anyways.

916
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:19,710
Was that verbatim enough?
I'm such a control freak.

917
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:23,370
I can't even handle people who've given
me money telling me what the fuck they

918
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:28,230
do. Um, 55 minutes. All right.

919
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:30,600
This whole day's getting away from you
haven't even read any of the fucking

920
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:33,930
questions and I haven't even talked about
the Bruins. How we're one point out.

921
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,890
We beat St Louis and
then we lost to Chicago.

922
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,130
Um, I of course didn't see any games
because I was fucking traveling.

923
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,010
Um, you know, it's funny,

924
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,020
I had like five or six country
Chicago fence talking shit. You know,

925
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,890
it's so funny. Last time we played them,
we beat them. I don't talk any shit.

926
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,880
Do I talk and he should know, right?
Hate these fucking people like these,

927
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:03,000
these whack a mole fans that you know,
oh we could you rose today.

928
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:06,330
Then they ducked back down. They'll
know where to be found. You know,

929
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:11,010
when you fucking loose like Chicago's
gun to do in the playoffs, you fucking

930
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,740
God damn.
Cons.

931
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,190
I actually liked the Black Hawks and
fans like that make me fucking rude.

932
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,820
Root against them. So anyways,
um, coming up this week,

933
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:26,890
my Bruins, my beloved Bruins.
All right, we are playing.

934
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,340
Our next game is uh,
uh,

935
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,300
where the fuck is that? I think we're
playing into, no, he played Carolina,

936
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:37,750
I believe.
I think we played Carolina next street.

937
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,160
I get the schedule right here.
Where is the schedule? All right.

938
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:44,590
We play Carolina on Tuesday.

939
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,630
It's at the TD bank,
north fucking Home Depot Garden.

940
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:53,320
Whatever the fuck they call
it. The Carolina in a tourist
sleep plays this tough.

941
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:57,520
They always match up. Well, there's always
a tough game. And then we have Detroit,

942
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,510
which is huge. They're one point
against the ahead of us on Thursday.

943
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,790
And then our last game is against
Ottawa on Saturday. All right.

944
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,360
So basically the two teams
in front of us are, uh,

945
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:16,150
Detroit and Philly both one
point ahead of us, I believe.

946
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:21,340
So the great thing is during this week,
Detroit and Philly play each other.

947
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,670
So no,
I think Philly's a few points that had,

948
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:29,300
so I'm just fulfilling to just when
the rest of the way out. All right.

949
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,470
I, at this point, I have
to root against Detroit.

950
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:36,520
I don't have anything against Detroit
other than their fucking country fans.

951
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,610
And they really are cunty fence.
You know what I mean?

952
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:43,780
The funny thing about them is they don't
realize that they're run is over and

953
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:47,230
that it's now all about Chicago and
La and they're wearing the crown.

954
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:47,960
You know what I mean?

955
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,180
For some reason Detroit is still
living off fucking Eisenman, you know?

956
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,350
I guess they won one last decade to
pot. Oh, actually they went to, yeah,

957
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:01,020
but you can just see, you can see
it in Detroit. It's over. You know?

958
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,020
It's something that I'm
going to experience with
Brady and Belichick are gone

959
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:08,170
and I'm going to be like, yeah, but
we're the patriots. It's like, yeah,

960
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:13,090
but that God, yeah, yeah.
They're wearing the same uniform,

961
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:16,630
but it's not the same. I'm fucking
with the, I actually love Detroit.

962
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,610
I love the franchise. I don't
like the fence. Um, you know,

963
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:26,500
and I've never been that way as I like
to think with all the success that I only

964
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:30,160
talk shit if people giving me shit.
That's how I try to be, you know,

965
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,520
I don't try to act like,
because my teams are successful.

966
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,370
That means somehow in my own
personal life, I'm a success.

967
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,010
Like some people do those.
You know what?

968
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,880
I'm really judging all black hawks and
red Redwing fence by half a dozen people,

969
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:47,530
which isn't fair. So, you know what,
good luck to all of you. And uh,

970
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,630
I hope to Bruins fucking pull it out.
And if we don't,

971
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:54,280
we got no one to blame but
ourselves just fucking good Lord.

972
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:59,530
What a fucking season up, down,
up, down, up, down, up, down.

973
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,640
That's what the fuck it's been.

974
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,170
Now I just need up for the last
two or three up just fucking nice.

975
00:59:05,171 --> 00:59:08,740
Three game winning streak and no
one will remember any of this shit.

976
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,400
Dan Shaughnessy is sitting there
with the fucking hard on being like,

977
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:15,430
I can finally write an article
about hockey that I understand

978
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,610
somebody blew it. Oh yeah. I could
write this all fucking day. All right,

979
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:26,090
let's get to the questions then. I got to
get the fuck Outta here. All right. Um,

980
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,010
the all star Cafe, uh,
on March 28 podcasts,

981
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:36,011
you briefly mentioned you were regular
muncher and Nia was a waitress.

982
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,930
The all state, not the all star. Uh,

983
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,730
for some reason he wrote all star up
here then all state before she got pink

984
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:48,731
slipped and now and now and the now closed
down Allstate cafe and the upper west

985
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:49,850
side.

986
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:53,060
I thought your listeners
might be intrigued to learn
that your meeting place was

987
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:58,061
also a meeting place for a young teacher
and her murderer in January of 1973

988
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:01,250
during a one night stand,

989
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:06,530
murdering a partner guarantees there ain't
no second night, right. Jesus Christ.

990
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:11,531
I didn't know that the grotesque multi
stabbing crime got so much infamous

991
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:16,961
publicity that the pub changed his name
from the Wm tweets to the Allstate.

992
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,200
The murderer inspired the
book and subsequent movies
starring the then scantily

993
01:00:24,201 --> 01:00:26,690
clad Diane Keaton also.

994
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:30,140
Apparently Kevin Bacon had
ones tended bar there too.

995
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,860
I wonder if they fired him also.
I didn't know that.

996
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,980
Jesus, that's fucking creepy. I don't
believe in ghosts or anything like that.

997
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,670
Not even remotely, but that type
of shit is just scary by the way.

998
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:46,640
I love hearing about history even as
much as I fucking that cake walk thing.

999
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:49,910
I was trashing that guy. I like
that type of shit. Um, all right,

1000
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:53,510
girlfriend bothered and annoyed
by sexy TV show character.

1001
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,600
Uh,
dear Billy blank balls.

1002
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:05,870
My girlfriend and I were recently watching
the new season of daredevil and we're

1003
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,310
enjoying it.
However,

1004
01:01:07,311 --> 01:01:11,200
one character electra
was introduced and uh,

1005
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:16,070
she bothered the hell out of
my girlfriend for reference.

1006
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:19,100
Electra is this character that is sexy,
provocative,

1007
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,960
and an all around Badass Ninja woman.
Electra is also like a

1008
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:29,300
weird sort of, isn't that that
mythology thing? What is the,

1009
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,180
what is that weird fucking
thing isn't sit down with,

1010
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,850
I'm not even going say
it because if I'm wrong,

1011
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:42,020
it has to do with some sort of creepy
sexual relations within the family,

1012
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:45,140
doesn't it? You know, daughter,

1013
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:47,720
father and then the other one,
his son,

1014
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:51,020
mother with a son kills
the dad or some shit.

1015
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:55,730
It's just fucking weird when I see
those types of stories actually start

1016
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:57,560
believing in Adam and eve.
Yeah,

1017
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:00,380
there was just two people and they
bagged and then they had this obsessed.

1018
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:04,430
She was fucking horseshit for a couple
of generations until we fucked ourselves

1019
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:08,660
up. Maybe that did up and maybe that's
why neanderthals and all like or whatever

1020
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:11,620
they are, the original cavemen, their
heads are all fucked up. Look, and

1021
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,900
it's because everyone was related.
Um, and who the fuck knows anyways,

1022
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,700
she was a cool character,
but my girlfriend hated her.

1023
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,050
I noticed that it wasn't anything against
the character since she couldn't tell

1024
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:28,050
me why she didn't like her
other than she just bothers her.

1025
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:31,590
Other people have told me that their
girlfriends slash wives are the same way

1026
01:02:31,591 --> 01:02:34,500
with electro when watching this
show with their significant other.

1027
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:39,060
I know it isn't just this character
because any female that is in a sexy,

1028
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:41,460
Badass role,
I've noticed women specifically,

1029
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:44,370
ones with both boyfriends don't like,
uh,

1030
01:02:44,371 --> 01:02:46,860
is this just some kind
of insecurity women have?

1031
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,990
Do they really dislike their boyfriends?

1032
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:53,520
Seeing someone that may be
sexier than them? Um, well yeah,

1033
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:57,120
if you fucking put it that way, they're
going to be annoyed. Okay honey, you know,

1034
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:59,370
I see that girl.
Look how much sexier she is.

1035
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:02,790
Then when she watched his fight club,
you know,

1036
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:07,650
does she say how much fucking much
better. Well, Brad Pitt's looking anyways.

1037
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:11,910
Are they worried that this fictional TV
characters going to steal me away from

1038
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:15,750
her? I am wondering if I should
say anything because quite frankly,

1039
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:17,250
it's starting to get on my nerves.

1040
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:21,930
She will root against the character for
no reasons besides the ones listed above.

1041
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,010
Um, I don't know if I
would just make her move,

1042
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,840
make her more pissed off though. Have
you ever been in a situation like this?

1043
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:34,350
Love the show and as always, go
fuck yourself. Here's the thing,

1044
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:39,330
one of the worst things you can do when
you get into a relationship with a woman

1045
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:45,110
is to start having your behavior be
dictated by just trying to keep them in a

1046
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:50,490
good mood. All right? I'm not saying
walk around and be an Asshole,

1047
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:53,400
but if you're not being a fucking
asshole and they're just being moody,

1048
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:58,140
fucking assholes, like you got to
call him out on it. Yeah. Like,

1049
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,180
and,
and this is another thing too,

1050
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:04,050
you got to treat them like adults
rather than treating them like children,

1051
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:08,010
which is what a lot of guys do because
physically was stronger than them.

1052
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,900
So you feel like if you
say anything to them,

1053
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:11,820
it's like you're yelling at a child.
You're not.

1054
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:16,020
Not only is that an adult and a lot of
ways they're more advanced because they

1055
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:18,450
can't beat the fuck out of you.
They have to go,

1056
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,640
they have to go with their mental,
right.

1057
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:24,360
That's why they can just manipulate
you like a fucking little puppet there

1058
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,690
because they can just play Jedi
mind games because they, they,

1059
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:30,900
they're not going to, they from
day one, they're like, all right,

1060
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:33,540
this fucking thing is going to be
stronger than me at some point.

1061
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,990
So I need to learn how to control
it. Just using my brain. Right.

1062
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,023
That's how you end.

1063
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:43,560
End Up holding fucking yard goes can
hook no woman's cells anymore. Right.

1064
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,100
They barely even cook.
So I end up at fucking brunch.

1065
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,950
This is what you've got to say.
Um,

1066
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:54,570
you just kind of just hit pause and just,
I would just be like,

1067
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,460
what is your problem with this character?
You're ruining the show for me. Okay.

1068
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:03,570
If look at, look at
daredevil. He's got abs.

1069
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:07,290
You see me acting like a fucking
baby about this. You know,

1070
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,020
you don't like the way you look.

1071
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,910
Go to the gym at the one she'd be
inspired by this fuck there. That's,

1072
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:17,820
that's what I feel when I, when I watch
a superhero movie other I the other,

1073
01:05:17,821 --> 01:05:21,690
other than like a, when the fuck is
his dumb horse, shit. Gonna be over.

1074
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,120
It always makes me feel like,
yeah, I got to hit the gym.

1075
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:31,440
I could literally sit there and watch
Thor who's probably a foot taller than me,

1076
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,110
a thousand times better looking
than I'm ever going to be.

1077
01:05:34,111 --> 01:05:37,740
And all that dude does is make me
want to go to the gym. But then again,

1078
01:05:37,741 --> 01:05:38,880
if you look at our roles,

1079
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:44,040
like all I need to do is earn enough money
where I can get a Ferrari in a toupee

1080
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,150
and next thing you know,

1081
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:47,760
I can bank some whore that's
spinning a fucking magazine.

1082
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:49,080
And that's basically how it works.

1083
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:53,160
If I drive the car in the
right part of the world, right?

1084
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:57,630
Drive around the fucking
French Riviera at Jesus Christ,

1085
01:05:57,631 --> 01:06:00,480
you have no idea what you're going to
be banging. They don't have that option.

1086
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,230
You know what I mean? They can't be
like, well, I'm a six, but you know,

1087
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:08,370
if I start making money I can go
get myself a Brad Pitt. You can't,

1088
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:12,180
Eh, you know what? You
can't blame society.

1089
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:14,190
You got to blame the
good Lord for that one.

1090
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:17,240
So maybe that's why.
Maybe that's why,

1091
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:22,800
cause no matter what she does, she can. I
don't know. I don't fucking know. Ask Her,

1092
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:25,620
but you know something I wouldn't be
on, you know, she's ruined in your show.

1093
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:30,180
You got to call her out on
it. Um, all right. Okay.

1094
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:34,830
Going bald. Dear Billy bald
cap. I'm 24 and I'm going bald.

1095
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:39,180
This runs in my family is both my
grandfathers were bald so I don't have any

1096
01:06:39,181 --> 01:06:43,620
sort of identity crisis about it and in
fact I'm leaning into it and we'll joke

1097
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:47,580
about it when appropriate. My question to
you is, when do I finally start buzzing,

1098
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:49,980
buzzing everything away?

1099
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:55,050
The last thing I want to do
is rocket George [inaudible]
kid cause stands a look.

1100
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,800
But we'd like to have a full head of hair
while I can before I look like I'm in

1101
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:01,380
denial.
No comb overs for this cut.

1102
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:04,560
My hair is thin but still
covers everything on top though.

1103
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:08,640
My Barbara did crack more jokes than
usual at my last, at my expense.

1104
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:11,220
Last time I went to get a cut.
No,

1105
01:07:11,221 --> 01:07:14,580
I didn't provide a picture because
this isn't a fucking roguey commercial.

1106
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:17,550
Given your experience.
I love to hear your input on what,

1107
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,190
when you pulled the
trigger to buzzard all,

1108
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,480
all the way and possibly
the input of the lovely Nia.

1109
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:30,130
What? Jesus Christ. What am I?
You're fucking stylist. Well,

1110
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:33,250
I think you know something.
If your barber starts making jokes,

1111
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,720
you know what I mean?

1112
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:38,800
I feel like there's not enough time left
on the clock for you to make a comeback.

1113
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:42,970
That's basically like now you line it
up and the dude across to you is talking

1114
01:07:42,971 --> 01:07:46,690
shit about how they're moving on to the
next round of the playoffs and you're

1115
01:07:46,691 --> 01:07:48,400
not.
So it sounds like it's already over,

1116
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,503
you know?

1117
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:52,830
I don't know, Dude, why? What am I,

1118
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:57,570
what kind of a fucking man asks another
man a question like this? Just fucking,

1119
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,433
you know,

1120
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:03,870
shave your fucking head or go get
a hair plugs or put Rogaine on it,

1121
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:08,760
or raw diet at different fucking cover.
I'll give a fuck what you do with it.

1122
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,110
What is my experience? My experience
was when I was just sick of it,

1123
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,460
I was sick of the slow and I
was just like, you know what?

1124
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,350
Let's just put this
thing out of its misery.

1125
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,373
MMM.

1126
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,810
And I gotta tell you, it's not nearly
as bad as everybody fucking thanks.

1127
01:08:28,811 --> 01:08:31,030
Who's kidding? Who? Everybody would
love to have a full head of hair,

1128
01:08:31,031 --> 01:08:33,340
but you know something.
I gotta be honest with you.

1129
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:35,590
Once you start buzzing your head,
it's kind of fucking awesome.

1130
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,210
You know what is great about having a
shaved head? You're always ready to go.

1131
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:47,320
I got to tell you, as much as I would
love to still have a full head of hair,

1132
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,260
I love the fact that
I'm always ready to go.

1133
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:54,760
All I gotta do is throw a shirt on,
splash a little water on my face,

1134
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:58,030
and you have no fucking idea that I was
laying in my sweatpants five minutes

1135
01:08:58,031 --> 01:09:02,380
earlier. Oh. Speaking of which, I'm just
kidding. I always make sure I get ready,

1136
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:04,023
you know?

1137
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,230
Okay.

1138
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,570
There was this fucking person,
you know, I went out, you know,

1139
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,900
I took some pictures with
people after the show and uh,

1140
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:12,813
yeah,

1141
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,880
these fucking people that have like,
this fucking guy comes up,

1142
01:09:17,881 --> 01:09:21,240
I can already smell them.
All right?

1143
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,930
And then he goes to put his arm around
me during the fucking picture and I'm

1144
01:09:24,931 --> 01:09:29,931
telling you like literally could make
paneer peel off the fucking walls was how

1145
01:09:31,081 --> 01:09:32,730
bad this guy's body odor was.

1146
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,480
And he's with other people and
they don't smell. It's like,

1147
01:09:36,481 --> 01:09:39,810
why don't you say something to them?
Because I'm not going to say it.

1148
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,333
Okay,

1149
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:45,250
you paid money to see me,
right?

1150
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,370
I gave you a show and then I come out
there and take a picture and then I tell

1151
01:09:48,371 --> 01:09:52,810
you, you smell bad. I wouldn't do that
to somebody, but Jesus fucking Christ.

1152
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:55,840
He was fucking hilarious about this
person too. I kept running into him.

1153
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:57,920
Okay.

1154
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,820
And then this person just loved to tell
a story that somehow involved, you know,

1155
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:06,380
lifting his arms up past his
fucking shoulders. Jesus. Fuck man.

1156
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,800
I never noticed how much you lift your
arms during telling a story until I ran

1157
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:14,300
into this,
this guy fucking reeked fucking rate,

1158
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,930
just completely fucking unacceptable.

1159
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,240
Well into his fucking
twenties and he's standing,

1160
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:22,580
he's got a couple of friends
with them who don't reek.

1161
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,460
Okay?

1162
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,310
Oh my God. You know, wish I bad. I wish
I had one of those old school fucking,

1163
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:30,700
you know, the spray on deodorant.
And as he was telling this story,

1164
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:31,310
I'd be like yeah,

1165
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,750
and just holding my nose and I would
just spray under one arm pit. No,

1166
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,940
keeps telling this story,
this spraying under the other one.

1167
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:42,910
And then I just hand them the
can't do the math there. Fuck. Oh,

1168
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,040
alright.
Psycho girlfriend.

1169
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,940
Um, all right. Okay.

1170
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:52,470
Psycho girlfriend. Uh, where am I? Okay.

1171
01:10:52,471 --> 01:10:56,460
So my girlfriend and I had been together
for about five years and lately I've

1172
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:59,700
been feeling the get engaged
pressure from her family. Well, yeah,

1173
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,830
I'm 23 and she's 21. All right,
let me rephrase that. Well, now,

1174
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:07,700
um, I thought you guys were older. Uh,

1175
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,040
we've been together since high school
and I haven't experienced much else

1176
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:15,630
besides, of course, the young
middle school, tug job girlfriends,

1177
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:19,860
I'm afraid of Sunday regretting missing
out on meeting a ton of different girls.

1178
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,150
Like all my buddies have been, I
mean, you're only young once, right?

1179
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:29,390
My girlfriend flips out on me about
watching porn because I'm thinking about

1180
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:34,260
other girls and she acts like I'm cheating
on her and half the time when we're

1181
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:37,620
out she thinks I'm checking out other
girls. Cause you probably are dude,

1182
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:39,870
because you want to cause you
want to break up with her.

1183
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,770
That's what I'm guessing.

1184
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:45,000
She's a drop dead gorgeous girl so I
don't get what she's so insecure about.

1185
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,770
But like I said,
she's crazy.

1186
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,940
She gets abusive with me and I just kind
of sit there and take it all the time.

1187
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:55,500
Um, she's Latina by the way.
Honduran and Nicaraguan.

1188
01:11:55,740 --> 01:12:00,150
She's got that wild temper. Um, all right.

1189
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:05,100
I was that considered racist to say that
Latina chicks are a little crazier than,

1190
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:09,180
than what? Unlike what pasty
drunken Irish chicks. Oh yeah.

1191
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,500
They're always so even killed

1192
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,120
what I asked for space.

1193
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:19,200
I woke up the next day
and my car was keyed.

1194
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:20,310
Okay.

1195
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:23,070
She claims she had nothing to do with it.
I love the girl.

1196
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:25,860
She's all I've ever known and
she's amazing most of the time.

1197
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:30,450
But I'm not sure if I can live like this
forever with their temporary jealousy.

1198
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:33,600
What would you do anyways?
Love the podcast.

1199
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:37,080
Thanks for the advice and go fuck
yourself. P s good luck with the home gym.

1200
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,430
Everybody knows.

1201
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:39,850
Yeah,

1202
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:43,540
you got no business in irregularly.
I'll go fuck yourself.

1203
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:45,580
I can not put us in a regular
gym. Oh, when you do what?

1204
01:12:45,581 --> 01:12:48,790
You're sitting here and you're a
fucking God. Damn. You know something?

1205
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:50,640
I actually had fucking,

1206
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:52,260
yeah,

1207
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,080
I actually had sympathy for it.
I was going to give you some good advice.

1208
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:59,760
You know what? Go Fuck Yourself. You
know what your problem is in this thing.

1209
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,840
You know, you, you're just,
it allowed it. You're young.

1210
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,780
I'm not going to be a dick to you. Okay?
Cause you're young. This is the deal.

1211
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:10,920
All right? You got yourself
a hot girl. All right.

1212
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,960
And you did not have set
up the relationship. She
fucking rolled all over yet.

1213
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,020
You're asking what I do in your situation.
If I was 23,

1214
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:21,840
I'd be doing what you were doing.
I'd be staying in the relationship,

1215
01:13:21,841 --> 01:13:26,130
wanting to get out, um, and
dealing with this bullshit.

1216
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:28,830
But I can tell you this right now.
Her looks aren't always going to be there,

1217
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:31,170
but she's always going to have keys.
You know what I mean?

1218
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:35,910
So that's what you're signing up for.
The looks go out the fucking window.

1219
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:39,480
You're marrying the fucking person
that this fucking lunatic. Every time,

1220
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:40,590
you know, if, God forbid,

1221
01:13:40,591 --> 01:13:45,060
your mailman is a fucking woman who's
younger than her at that point, you know,

1222
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,690
I th I don't know. I don't know.
I can do it was too wishy washy.

1223
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,200
I can't tell whether you
fucking want to be in it or not,

1224
01:13:55,650 --> 01:14:00,540
but I can tell you this right
now. Um, any woman keys your car,

1225
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:05,200
that's it. It's fucking
over. Okay. That is a,

1226
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,110
the level of being a
complete fucking psycho.

1227
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:13,010
A complete disrespect for
your own property and assign
that when she was a child,

1228
01:14:13,011 --> 01:14:16,820
she was never told no. The fact that you
would go out and do something like that.

1229
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,840
Yeah,
I dunno.

1230
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,650
It sounds to me like you want to go
fucking get some notches on your belt and

1231
01:14:24,651 --> 01:14:27,800
you're afraid that if you do and you break
up with this girl that she's going to

1232
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:30,530
fucking stab you.
Um,

1233
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,110
yeah,

1234
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:35,590
I dunno. I got claustrophobic
reading it if that means anything,

1235
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:38,230
but I'm a fucking lunatic.
Right? Sketchy ex-girlfriend.

1236
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:42,280
Hey you cunty Leprechaun.
Jason.

1237
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:44,440
Everybody's staring into
the red hat shit this week.

1238
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,860
Every once in a while I got
to give you guys shit to get.

1239
01:14:47,861 --> 01:14:51,160
Can you be a little more original?
I liked that Billy blank ball.

1240
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:54,310
That was fucking funny.
58 fucking, you know,

1241
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:00,780
fucking red head shops in a
row, but I get it. You know,

1242
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:04,300
I get it. You don't have an hour's
time. You can do a 10 minutes.

1243
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:09,160
Set your a showcase comic. Um, all
right. Hey, you cut g leprechaun.

1244
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:14,350
I am 16 years old and my girlfriend
is 15 today. She texted me,

1245
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:19,090
she texted me with a picture of
a tattoo asking if I like it.

1246
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:25,130
It is what it is. The date of her
grandfather's death. Personally,

1247
01:15:25,131 --> 01:15:28,400
I hate tattoos and thanks.
If she keeps getting them,

1248
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:30,440
she will look like a fucking phone book.

1249
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,340
I also think her mother is irresponsible,

1250
01:15:34,341 --> 01:15:35,960
spelled with a bunch of ease.

1251
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:41,740
He responsible for letting her
get a tattoo spelled with one ho.

1252
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,940
So young. What are your thoughts
about this and how, how,

1253
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:47,793
uh,

1254
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,740
what's your thoughts about this and how
she didn't tell me till after she got it.

1255
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,070
Thank you. I love your
shows and your podcast. Um,

1256
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:00,190
yeah.
All right.

1257
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:03,640
She's 15 she already got her first tattoo,

1258
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:08,920
which you got to do is close your eyes
and age or when is she getting the face

1259
01:16:08,921 --> 01:16:13,921
tattoo and the nose ring and the fucking
Olympic fucking rings in our ears to be

1260
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:20,650
different. Um, yeah, I,
I'm not into tattoos.

1261
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:25,030
You know, I think a certain
type of person can pull it off.

1262
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,830
Um,
and that's not 98% of the population,

1263
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:34,570
but 98% of the population for some
reason has tattoos. Now I don't get it.

1264
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:38,950
I feel like there's a certain level
bad ass dude in a certain level,

1265
01:16:38,951 --> 01:16:41,500
bad ass chick that gets tattoos.

1266
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:45,280
And when you meet him it makes
sense in it actually, you know,

1267
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,910
I dunno if I see a woman and she's
a bad ass and she has tattoos,

1268
01:16:49,911 --> 01:16:53,900
it actually makes them more attractive
to me if she's just some fucking dope,

1269
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:55,400
you know?

1270
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,060
And she has like some advice
column tattooed on the
back of her fucking neck or

1271
01:16:59,061 --> 01:17:03,320
some Chinese sign above her ass
crack, you know, symbol then yeah,

1272
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:05,990
it's just like Jesus Christ.
You know,

1273
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,160
like the amount of people
out there that sleeves

1274
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:13,840
like back in the day
when you got a sleeve,

1275
01:17:13,841 --> 01:17:18,520
I mean you were like some biker outlaw,
you know.

1276
01:17:18,521 --> 01:17:23,320
Now it's like you work at urban
outfitters, you know the biggest,

1277
01:17:23,321 --> 01:17:28,321
baddest thing about you is your fucking
music selection on your fucking iPhone.

1278
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,780
I have no idea. All I know is I got to get
a rental car in 10 minutes. If I don't,

1279
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:34,840
I'm going to be late to my show.
So this is the podcast for this week,

1280
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:36,880
the Monday morning podcast.
God bless all of you.

1281
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,210
I love when you guys trashed me in
the fucking emails, but yeah. Can we,

1282
01:17:40,211 --> 01:17:43,300
can we just keep, can you keep it
interesting for the reader here?

1283
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,450
I know I'm a red head. I know
the reason he jokes, but come on.

1284
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,730
What if I did that with my standup act?
Get Out,

1285
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,320
which had come out and see
me if I was out there. Go on.

1286
01:17:53,321 --> 01:17:57,760
Watch to deal with New
Yorker. No. Um, all right.

1287
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,460
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
