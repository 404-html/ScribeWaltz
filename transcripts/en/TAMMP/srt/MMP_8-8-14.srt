1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,590
All right. Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:06,150
It's bill burr and this is once again
time for a very special Monday morning

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:10,860
podcast. A, you got an extra one this
week. And as always, whenever I do that,

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,840
you know, it's not just going
to be me running my mouth.

5
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:16,670
I always have a great guest and
this time is no exception. Uh,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,050
please welcome for the multitalented,

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,270
the multi a business owning a from
a entourage. Jerry Ferrara, man,

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,930
I don't think there's any way I
could live up to that incident.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,720
He talks about the game. You'll
one of the guys that like, uh,

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,040
when I found out you won't you at will
co owner of that fat Soule yeah. Uh,

11
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,060
which is as great a
sandwich place out here. Um,

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,000
one I found out that you were one of
the co owners. I was telling my wife,

13
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,220
I'm like, see, that's what
most artists don't do.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,380
They have all their eggs in one basket.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,580
I love the fact that you're making money
outside of this fucked up business.

16
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:54,180
So I joke with my brother all the time
and it's like I hope one day when I'm in

17
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:57,150
my sixties you look back like you
know acting was great, we did great,

18
00:00:57,151 --> 00:01:00,780
but you know what, we really
killed us sandwiches. That's how I,

19
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,090
you know I ate there,
I ate there.

20
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:07,380
Cause the your slogan is that as soon
as sounds in and underneath that it says

21
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,450
we'll making sandwiches.
Oh my God,

22
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:12,570
the guy's of date when they hear it as
the guys at fat Sal's are going to die.

23
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:16,100
They had, they're proud of that slogan.
No, I laugh when we, me and my wife saw,

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,910
we laughed. We were like,
we got to try that place.

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,440
So of course I tried it
out and it's awesome.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,800
But I'm 46 so I can only
eat there so often. The,

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,530
I close my eyes when I drive past
some filing, want to look at,

28
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,890
cause it's on the way to the gym.
So it's like I drive home,

29
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,370
I got a pass and everyday I'm like you
just worked out. Don't blow it. Yeah,

30
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,750
it's on Fountain on Fountain.

31
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,190
Then you've got the big flat screen
TVs or he's got the game on. It's,

32
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,400
it's unreal.
It's like a,

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,850
for someone like me that's
literally a moth going to the light.

34
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,450
But the reason your here is um,
you actually,

35
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:50,370
you have a new podcast coming out called
a bad for bad for business. Yeah. It's a,

36
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,970
it's three weeks old and hit as bad for
business because I really don't know

37
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,630
what the hell I'm doing.
I've, I've, I didn't know,

38
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,150
I didn't know what the Hell
I've been listening to to you.

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,110
Obviously for awhile now and I've,
I grew up listening to sports talk radio.

40
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:08,280
I didn't have a TV in my room, so
like a radio was all, I had stern,

41
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,130
all those things. So I just have had
an affinity for radio my whole life.

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,360
Where did you grow up? Bensonhurst.
Brooklyn. So, uh, all right. Oh God.

43
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,260
What sport affiliations
are you [inaudible] here
we you want to know? Well,

44
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,840
you know Nick's obviously
no problem with that.

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,820
We saw that the next Guy Yankees. Hey
you, why you made the right choice.

46
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,580
Could you say now though? You can't
even really say anything anymore.

47
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:33,150
What could you say you w what do you
mean by that, Jerry? You're golden.

48
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,130
You're good. Oh, I thought
you were going to say that.

49
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:38,100
We're doing exactly what the fuck you
guys were doing with buying up everybody.

50
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,720
I don't think so. I don't think
so. Ah, Yankee we did. We didn't,

51
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,670
uh Oh seven and look,
the minute seven was a disgrace.

52
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,790
The minute we gave Jacoby Ellsbury money,
the it to me,

53
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,160
it's over the rivalry's over the minute.

54
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,090
It started with Damien a little bit
like that was the Yankee sign. Damon.

55
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,360
It kinda ruined the whole the whole day.
Always go your way though.

56
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:00,020
They never come our way there. We
sell throughout my life. I'll be

57
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,070
back to guys like Bob Watson.
There was always this guys,

58
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:07,240
we let go and you guys always sign it,
but I don't ever remember anybody.

59
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,370
You know,
even like an old Lou Pinella,

60
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:13,950
we never got anybody but got the old
Lou Panella or even like Mike Pack your

61
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,800
rule. Rick Sarone. It was really
an Indian like coming our way. We,

62
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:21,160
it always seems like they always end
up. Yeah. You might've got one guy,

63
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,500
Andy Hawkins,
who I remember the only Yankee,

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
and I remember he used to buy the helmets.

65
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,030
Carvel used to give an ice cream scoop
and the little mini batting hell,

66
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:28,864
I remember that.
Yeah.

67
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,560
And I used to watch the Yankee Games and
I'd write on the sticker and I put the

68
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,530
stats of the game on the back of a
sticker. I still have this one helmet.

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Andy Hawkins threw a no hitter
and lost to the Chicago White Sox.

70
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,650
Five errors for walks. They lost
three nothing. He threw a no hitter.

71
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,520
You were at that game? No, that wasn't
that. I was watching with my law of Karma.

72
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,190
I think it was on the road
against the white sox.

73
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,790
And I think Hawkins ended up being a
red sock for like a half a season out of

74
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,980
the bullpen. If that sounds like
the kind of guy that we'd signed,

75
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,370
he throws a no hitter and he's seen
Lucille beliefs beliefs back then.

76
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,870
At least back then we did. But um, I
dunno, we're, we're, we're playing off.

77
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,150
I've got to tell you that Johnny
Damon went, that was, that was brutal.

78
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,980
And even though I know he was the one in
Kansas City and then he was in Oakland,

79
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,490
Oakland, then we got them. So I understood
there was just something about like,

80
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:20,491
we finally beat you guys and that he was
such like the poster child of our team.

81
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,430
And then just to watch him go get a
shave and a haircut like the ring,

82
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,700
like he was going over his parent's house.
He went corporate almost.

83
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,500
It's like was wild shy.
He who had the,

84
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,230
one of the better beards
in hair on the red sox,

85
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,650
like he had his beard was phenomenal
and he had like seven rbis in that game.

86
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,590
Seven you hit the Grand Slam. Yeah,
yeah, like seventh grade. So yeah,

87
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,670
that ruined it for me. Like that really
hurt the red sock. Yankee rivalry. Like I,

88
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,100
to me it I,
my fondest memory,

89
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:51,790
the ending would be like Pedro Martinez
throwing Don Zimmer on the ground.

90
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,030
That was the word that it was that for
me growing up, that was the height.

91
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,780
That was the height. Did that piss you
off when that happened or did you want to,

92
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,070
it made me so angry and then
let me ask you this Jerry. What?

93
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:05,690
What the fuck was he supposed to do?
He's got this old guy running at him.

94
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,190
Alright, he's got, these are his options.

95
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,430
Know when either he runs
away from an old guy. Okay,

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,590
that's one. Two, he punches
him in the face. Can't do that.

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,390
Can Not 10 not through that or you
gently take them by the side of his head.

98
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,560
I feel bad now because he just
passed away. I know I didn't.

99
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:28,180
He just sort of guide them to the ground.
That's what he did. I paid on Monday.

100
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,970
He was in a no win situation.
There's no way on earth.

101
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,430
He comes out of that where it's like
page or you did the right thing.

102
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,990
He had no shot.

103
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:39,730
He was the minute Zimmer planted his
feet and charged Pedro Martinez was in

104
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:44,180
trouble. Still was not a a
what's in it was not a good mom.

105
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:47,080
So then football where you're
going to football giants, giants,

106
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,190
congratulate giants.

107
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:51,500
I remember the greatest day of my life
was when the giants beat the nine,

108
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:52,930
as in the NFC championship game,

109
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:57,931
the Leonard Marshall sack knocked Montana
out giants when and how much and in

110
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,310
his career. And then my uncle took me
to see home alone in the movie theater.

111
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,290
Greatest Day of my childhood.

112
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,150
Do you know Paul Versey? You
got to meet him. You guys.

113
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,610
He opens for me. A lot of guys. I
definitely see. I definitely know I'd,

114
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:17,170
I'd definitely know him. You like Paul
Versey with hair? I just did that for him.

115
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:20,680
If he's listening. Um, uh, you know
what's funny, like back in the day, uh,

116
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,690
when entourage was first coming off of
people who don't know, uh, Jerry by,

117
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,480
by name, uh, he played
turtle on entourage.

118
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:32,200
Do you know I actually
auditioned for that? Did you
rip that turtle? That's, yeah,

119
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,670
that's how wide the casting net was
before they were throwing darts. Yeah. No,

120
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:41,090
and they got you a totally made
sense. But, um, yeah, I was, you know,

121
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,990
not like I'm good now, but I was
really bad at auditioning back then.

122
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:46,600
And that was, that was, it
was a memorable, awful one.

123
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:50,530
I can't remember cause it was so bad or
because the show went on to be a hit.

124
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,140
So there was like the
first season and a half,

125
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:56,740
I'm watching it going like God every
time they'd say your character's name and

126
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:59,250
be like, I would just sort of think
about that bad audition going out.

127
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,790
I haven't been back. I have
not been back since. But uh,

128
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,720
what's the deal with that man?

129
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,300
I got inflammation here that
maybe there's going to be a movie.

130
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,410
No, no, we just, we just
wrapped a movie a month ago.

131
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:13,290
We actually had to postpone
shooting Kevin Connolly,

132
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,000
one of the guys who
plays Eric on the shell,

133
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:19,730
broke his leg while we were
shooting, doing what? I was
kind of applied of it. Uh,

134
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,660
I've actually now told
the story a few times,

135
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:25,180
but it was a party scene
at the beach. And, uh,

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,350
we had a cameo from Russell
Wilson, so, and I knew,

137
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:31,680
I knew this was going to happen.
They wanted to do a little montage of us,

138
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,460
you know, playing a little tackle football
on the beach. And I begged, they said,

139
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,870
let's figure out what we're going to do.

140
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's block it out a little
bit worse thing to do to,

141
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:43,660
to competitive below average athletically.
Guys see competitive day.

142
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,600
Oh yeah. Him and I is to say, Hey,

143
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:49,400
let's just turn the camera on and see
what happens. And sure enough, you know,

144
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,000
I go out, he drills me, he goes out and
attack on them. Like the third play.

145
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,730
It was actually the most harmless.
One of it all. I wrapped him up,

146
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,240
he like tried to dive and extend the
ball over the goal line and just his leg.

147
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,570
But we broke a broken two places.
Did you hear it? You heard it? Snap?

148
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,770
I heard something weird.
It wasn't like the Paul George awfulness.

149
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:15,670
It was not that, thank God. But uh,
I heard a little something. Did he,

150
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,310
did he, he didn't know. He popped up
and he thought he sprained his ankle.

151
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,020
Russell Wilson came over and said like,
you got the tie those laces tight. And uh,

152
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:24,700
he worked for like two days.
We're not knowing, just in,

153
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,420
finally he tapped as a guys, I gotta go,
I gotta go to a doctor and they x ray.

154
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,110
Like you have a broken fricking late.
He's in surgery the next day. What did he,

155
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,250
which, which bone,
fibula, fibula, surgeries,

156
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:38,610
screws and everything. So we got to
shut down from it, but the movie's done.

157
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,300
And I actually just saw an early
cut of it yesterday and it's,

158
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,910
it's actually good. Oh, I'm really
happy. I'm, I hate everything.

159
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,350
How do you deal with that
man? Like, uh, like I said,

160
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:52,030
the little stuff that I've done, I
immediately realized how little, uh,

161
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,980
just a little pow power you have
if you're just a performer. Like I

162
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,790
always hear a lot on set. Like, yeah,
it feels like it's going good. And then,

163
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,960
then there's always that. Yeah, man,

164
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,650
I hope to send comes together
because you have no idea. Um,

165
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,060
when you're doing it.

166
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,760
And I think more like the director
and the people who edit it,

167
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,710
they have an idea of the
direction it's going in.

168
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,780
But like I feel like if
you're just acting on it,

169
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,980
you kind of in this vacuum where you're
performing with the other people and

170
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,200
just hoping you're giving
them what they need.

171
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,220
I got a few things to say about that one.
I think it's like a game of opposites.

172
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,740
Anytime I've been on a set or we have,

173
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:28,980
whether it was like an
episode of entourage or even
a movie set of whatever it

174
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,880
is, when everyone's like, God, this
is great, this feels great, right?

175
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,900
Everyone's killing it. This is what
bill is killing it. Jerry's kill.

176
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,490
And then you watch it and it's Kinda eh.

177
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,710
And then I've been on set
where there's been times like,

178
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,980
I don't want to have any idea of this
shit's work is the weirdest shit we've

179
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:47,850
ever done. I, I'm like cross your fingers
and you watch it and it's the best.

180
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,220
It's great.
So you're not supposed to know.

181
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,520
That's the thing that's kind of
like in stand up the amount of time.

182
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,190
A lot of times you feel
like you're bombing,

183
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,350
then you get off stage
like God that sucks.

184
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:01,440
And then your buddies out in the crowd
going to people they would die laughing

185
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,560
because some nights you just can't,
you can't hear it. But I had an acting,

186
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:07,460
I have like a,
like I have total respect for uh,

187
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,900
any working actor cause that
just seems like the hardest,

188
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,700
I don't know how you guys get
to a point like how you get,

189
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,850
you get altitude in that career
because it's so fucking competitive.

190
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,650
Whereas like a comedian is difficult is
starting out is once you like build a

191
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:26,340
following, like say what have I went
to an Improv and I sold some tickets.

192
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:28,710
Like I don't have to re
audition now that's it.

193
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,990
At the next club it's like
okay this guy sells tickets.

194
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:33,480
So then you move up to this
next level and just, you know,

195
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,750
provided you keep getting
better, you know, you, you, you,

196
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,640
you have this thing and now you
have this thing like say, you know,

197
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,700
I go through you know,
periods without getting any acting work,

198
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,920
but I don't have to go back
to waiting tables and, and,

199
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,230
and all that type of stuff.
Did you go through a, uh,

200
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,730
did you have any like get something
really big early and then that just that

201
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:52,470
awful flatline for awhile.

202
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,850
My story is interesting and I'll give
you the quickest version possible,

203
00:10:56,851 --> 00:11:01,470
but you know, I saw how sick are you
telling them? No, no. Everyone know,

204
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,760
a lot of people think like that.
I,

205
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:07,020
I kind of just showed up out here like
some meathead from Brooklyn and like got

206
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:11,130
cast Nataraj right away. It was, you
know, four or five years. Now look,

207
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,330
that's a short amount of time. It's
very quick scheme. But Tourney,

208
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,530
young and competitive, it
felt like an eternity. And I,

209
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:18,960
I lived in this and you know,

210
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:21,420
in Burbank for 10 years I
worked at every restaurant.

211
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,510
How old high when you came
out in 19 and I came out here,

212
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,610
I did like three episodes
of King of Queens. I'm like,

213
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm staying as I never left. So you were
smart enough not to go to college? I did.

214
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,070
I did my six months at a,
at a college of Staten Island,

215
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:38,000
a very nice community
college back on the CSI.

216
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:41,740
He saying that big student allow colleges,
stupid Italians. We used to say, oh,

217
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,580
every kid who couldn't get into college,
they are now the schools.

218
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:48,120
It's actually a great community college.
I shouldn't really talk shit. But um,

219
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,520
I didn't have any great success.
I would always,

220
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:54,430
I would get an acting job that would
maybe last a month. I'd make like seven,

221
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:56,770
$8,000, which to me
was a million. Oh yeah.

222
00:11:56,771 --> 00:12:00,160
And I quit whatever restaurant I where
I'd live off that for as long as I can.

223
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,130
And I just would go months without an
acting job and they'd go beg for my

224
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,030
waitering job back.
And that was my cycle for quite a while.

225
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,950
But even then, even though five years
is quick too, it's pretty quick.

226
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:15,120
But to go through that for five
years. I mean this, this time,

227
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:17,290
like you know what they talk about
New York. If I could make it there,

228
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:22,150
I can make it anywhere personally.
This town for me is just way,

229
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
way more like it's brutal
week. Yeah. And brutal.

230
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:28,450
I always feel like New York,
there's always like,

231
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:32,110
there's an excitement to
that city where out here,

232
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,790
I don't know if it's just the topography,

233
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:38,110
but this is like desolate out here and uh,
that sun beating down on you.

234
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,060
There's no change of season. It just feels
like groundhog day. Just every hog day.

235
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,150
Sunshine phone's not ringing. You know, I,

236
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:50,770
and I can't get anywhere in my car
when it's the, when it's great.

237
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,030
It's the best town to ever live in.
When it's bad.

238
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,150
It's probably the worst ever,
ever live in.

239
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:01,720
And I always tell people
I was not offended,

240
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,540
but like I've got a couple of people
in the last whatever year to be like,

241
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,210
what's like the easiest?
Well, how you get into acting,

242
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:10,710
like what's the easiest way?
I'm like the easiest way.

243
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,740
That's how you're going to add.

244
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:16,150
You're going to pose the co there is no
easy way and it's designed to make you

245
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:20,470
quit. The whole system is
designed to make you say,

246
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,250
I can't do this anymore. I'm going
home. It's made to make you say that.

247
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,690
Well, let me ask you
this, being also an, uh,

248
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,090
a transplant from the east coast to
you. Uh, do you miss these coast?

249
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:35,800
Do you see yourself ever going back?
Are you kind of settling in out here?

250
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,100
I've had, I've had a couple of
different trajectories with this.

251
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,490
In the beginning I hated La, you
know, meathead from Brooklyn.

252
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,850
My accent was 10 times
worse than it is now. Uh,

253
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,320
then I guess as I got a little
successful too, I got the hot,

254
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,650
the whole good side of the town. The
weather's great. I grew to love odes.

255
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,690
Unbelievable. It's, it's, it's great.

256
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,690
You and I sitting here and you're
getting an iced coffee with Ted's Cory.

257
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:01,120
It's great. It's great. Recently though,

258
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,310
and within the last year I've kind
of gotten to the place where I'm 30,

259
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,020
I'll be 35 soon. You know, my
family's all still back there.

260
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:11,830
My nieces and nephews are growing up now.
They're like, you know, six years old.

261
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,630
They're starting to get that age where
I could do stuff with them. Like I say,

262
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:19,270
maybe I don't need to be here
11 months, a year. Maybe it's,

263
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:22,210
maybe it's nine and maybe I'd
go to New York for two months.

264
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,270
I'm starting to get to that point.
Maybe I go spend some,

265
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,300
some more quality time elsewhere.
Maybe I don't need to,

266
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,970
I'm built up enough where,
look,

267
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,940
if I really blow it at this point
I'm going to have to have a serious,

268
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,950
serious problem. Must to happen. Right.

269
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,740
So maybe I go spend some
time somewhere else.

270
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:40,920
I'm at that point now it's research.
I'm always jealous.

271
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,950
Weird jealousy in New York guys. Cause
you can go back to your hometown and the,

272
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:48,970
and it's still a big industry town. You
can't come on, give me a little, I go,

273
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,100
I would go back to the suburbs
of Boston now. I know that

274
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,000
they shoot some stuff up there, but it's
just like if I went back there like, uh,

275
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:56,871
like,
you know,

276
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:00,200
what I really miss most about living
in Massachusetts is just going to a

277
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:03,800
sporting event where I'm
not in enemy territory.

278
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,220
It's like I left in [inaudible] 95 I was
in New York through the height of the

279
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:10,520
curse of the paid. All of that
has a bad run for you. Yeah, yeah.

280
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,990
It was all of that. And, and,

281
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,050
and Aaron Boone and Aaron Boone never
took hold because the very next year like

282
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,150
Aaron Boone probably,

283
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,200
it definitely would have been worse than
Bucky Dent had the next year not happen.

284
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,840
Right. But what happened was they just
sort of toward the bandaid off like,

285
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:29,390
oh my God, that sucked down. We
want it, thank God. But where the,

286
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,550
the Bucky dent the bill Buckner thing. It
just, it just, it just kept like, I'm a,

287
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,850
I remember we were like,
I was,

288
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:39,500
I had a warehouse job and it was like
two and a half years after the game and

289
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:44,380
just one day in the middle of the summer,
I was just sake shaking my head and my,

290
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,740
my boss was, well, what's the matter?

291
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:47,540
Like he thought the count was off
when I had a little of this truck.

292
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,820
I was just like, dude, I still can't
believe we fucking lost that series.

293
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,190
And he laughed. The ultimate
delayed, don't know. I mean I,

294
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,440
the reaction and all that,

295
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:58,330
but just like years later you
were just thinking about it.

296
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,500
So it was so, uh, like,
I mean, I imagined it as,

297
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,950
as much as oh four would suck for a Yankee
fan because of all that other success

298
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:11,340
you've had and then you won one
afterwards. It's bad, but it's not,

299
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,320
it's not as like a like take like,
you know, I guess, uh, I don't know.

300
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:19,470
Cleveland fans or something like that
where it's just like there's just no light

301
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:20,490
has been no light.

302
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,150
That's blip. But now, now
there's, there's not light,

303
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:28,140
but at least there's a little hole,
a glimmer of light as poke through it.

304
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:31,440
Lebron and maybe Johnny Manzel.
But yeah, it's been, I'm open.

305
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,880
I hope he's going to be good. I wanted
all, I'm, I'm a board. I think it's great.

306
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,960
It's the new era and there's
some dinosaurs that are
going to hate on him for

307
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,970
awhile.
I think there's nothing.

308
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,120
No. What about his size and those
guys? All those guys who run around,

309
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:45,451
first of all,

310
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:48,390
nobody's going to be faster and more
elusive at the quarterback position then

311
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:52,440
Mike Vick. So if, if, if he can
get caught, he can get hurt.

312
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,610
That's the only thing that I would worry
about. But a, I'm actually a browns fan.

313
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,510
Uh, I, I, my parents and some
other relatives who lived in Ohio.

314
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:00,691
Oh.

315
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:04,960
So you legitimately roof for the per my
girlfriend's from Ohio and I just went

316
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:08,830
there for the first time recently.
And they are the most passionate fans,

317
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,440
obviously Boston and New York too.
I'm all Boston teams by the of the crowd.

318
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,560
Couldn't believe

319
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,610
I liked the bronze cause
my dad liked the browns.

320
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:19,970
He grew up in Ohio and in Michigan,
so every year is going to be there a year.

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,480
So he went, he went to like all
municipal stadium, saw Jim Brown play.

322
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,710
That type of thing is amazing.
So he uh, he's got this weird,

323
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,950
I have this weird thing with him where he
was a tigers in a Cleveland browns fan.

324
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,210
So I have like,
uh,

325
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,570
an affinity for both of them and a little
bit with the Redwings if they're fans

326
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,660
weren't such dicks all the
time talking all this shit.

327
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:42,710
Granted they have all those cups,
but um, so I'm actually, uh,

328
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:46,760
I'm hoping that that he's going to,
he's going to, he's going to do well.

329
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,760
One of my prize followers.
Twitter. I'm not good on Twitter,

330
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:54,880
but Johnny Manzel follows me and that
was one of my prize follower. I'm,

331
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:59,130
I'm most proud of of that follow,
um,

332
00:17:59,330 --> 00:17:59,911
where we actually,

333
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:03,480
me and my buddies when we went to go
see him last year to amazing rise to

334
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:07,650
Alabama when I was a fucking, it was a,
it was just a to go to a browns game.

335
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:11,100
I think I'm going to try to go October
12th. I think the plane is steel is,

336
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:15,210
I just want to go Whitney. I just
want to go see what that's all about.

337
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:15,871
Those fans.

338
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:19,980
I just can't believe how hard they show
up in route and they haven't won more

339
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:21,880
than five games and yeah,

340
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,560
that they're maniacs out there that you
would not want to walk out there with

341
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:29,220
the other person's no jerseys.
I'm going to go. Speaking of that,

342
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:34,050
how do you feel about like, uh,
attending sporting events out here in la?

343
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,410
I mean, I have, I personally,

344
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,410
I've not had the best experience
unless you show up wearing this shit,

345
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,370
which I'm never going to do.

346
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,510
I know I dress like a plain clothes
cop when I go to the game. Same here.

347
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,141
But like,

348
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:49,890
they just take it way too fucking
serious out here with is there's always a

349
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:51,210
little bit of that.
Uh,

350
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,900
you might get stabbed the
dodger games particularly,

351
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,470
or chargers. Oh, and they
just, shit I hear about like,

352
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:03,000
do some guy got shot at a fucking
40 niners Raiders preseason.

353
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,950
I've never gone to seasoned, get up
to any north kitten nor cal supports.

354
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:11,270
Like, I've never been to San Fran
yet since I've lived here. Oh, okay.

355
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,620
I've never been to oca. I need to
go. I want to go experience it.

356
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,840
The storied franchises
they have. Great. Yeah,

357
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,550
but you're not going into the black hole.

358
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,980
Lots of the Raider game wearing the
charger. Jai wouldn't, I wouldn't do that.

359
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,370
I wouldn't do that. Although
like I, I think the,

360
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:29,520
the rate of fence took a turn for the
worst when they started dressing up like

361
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:33,630
characters back in the day. The
crowding characters. Yeah. The crowd.

362
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,850
They all look like they were in
a biker gang and they would like,

363
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:38,850
legitimately scary. But now it's like, uh,

364
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,760
I'm not saying like there's a lot of
people in that stadium could fuck you up,

365
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:44,310
but you got that around the leak. But, uh,

366
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,220
until stupid characters man
with the spikes coming out,

367
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,050
they look like they should
be going to comic con.

368
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,980
They don't like the olive with the movie
weird science when like the motorcycle

369
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:55,960
gang comes in at the end, the CRAs
department, they look like those.

370
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,150
The guy that always struck me,

371
00:19:57,151 --> 00:20:00,990
I saw a one shot of a guy who looked
just like one of the weird science biker

372
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:05,040
guys at the end. Jesus Christ. Or do you
just took my, now I went back outside.

373
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,760
I do. I've been watching a
lot of the old movies. Um,

374
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,370
well speaking of speaking
of movies, um, dude,

375
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:14,640
you're like insane shape right now and a,
and I'm obviously,

376
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:16,770
I asked you when you came
in the second you walked in,

377
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:19,220
I had down written down here that um,

378
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,420
you just signed on to
play two time world champ,

379
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,390
Arturo Gotti in an untitled biopic,

380
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,540
which I'm so site that they're making
this a executive produced by Mark Walberg.

381
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,420
And the second you came in, I was like,
Eh, you already shooting the movie.

382
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,110
You just see this training
at this point I'm,

383
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,540
I'm trained now and I'm kind of getting
ready. I'm, I'm not in the full swing yet.

384
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,280
Like we're actually going
to go have a training camp.

385
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:42,150
I'm going to go up to big bear and do
that whole like 24 seven thing. No women.

386
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:44,850
And they'll read it. I'm going to
do my best. I personally don't,

387
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,100
there's only a level of shred I can get.

388
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,730
Like there's a on the mid drift re region,
I'm Italian and from Ben also,

389
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:56,230
I was born hundred five pounds. I, we may
have to Cgi some shit with that. I Dunno.

390
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,790
But uh, how tall are you? Five seven.

391
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,840
If I have on good shoes.

392
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,750
And you were two oh five two
oh four. And what, what is,

393
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,000
what is the weight when
you went to the doctor,

394
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,120
why when you went to the document, you
have to have fire and he says, listen,

395
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:13,040
Jerry, I love the show. I'm
not trying to be a dick,

396
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,200
but you need to get down to
what we were supposed to be.

397
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,870
I'm not like the normal for my height.
Yeah.

398
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,210
One the normal from my height's one
50 I thought that would be a win.

399
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,340
What the 1950s one four
five six and a half.

400
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:27,920
He was like one 51 55 you'll be normal.

401
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,110
And that's actually
exactly how it happened.

402
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:33,620
I went to take a physical to go do a
movie where it's like the Hollywood

403
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,060
physical and make sure you're not dying.

404
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,470
They literally make sure your heart is
beating and that you don't have any weird

405
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,370
outward things.

406
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:43,490
I do the blood pressures and they look
in your ear like my mom could do that

407
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:46,870
physical for me if she had to and the guy
thought he was being real thorough and

408
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,220
like this guy is looking for
something to like fail me.

409
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,690
And he put me on the scale and I just
turned 30 it's like a week after my 30th

410
00:21:53,691 --> 00:21:57,380
birthday and you know the doctor wasn't
trying to scam me. He's just like, look,

411
00:21:57,381 --> 00:22:01,250
you're, you're not in any
physical threatening life
all during that. You're like,

412
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:04,100
you're, you're young still, but you
know what, as you get closer to 40,

413
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:07,490
if you go on this path, you're going to
be faced with some problems. So start now.

414
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:12,080
It's way easier now than when you're
going, when you're gonna be 39 frosting.

415
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,350
And I just started and, uh,
it's been four. I'm 30, I'm
going to be 35 now and I'm,

416
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:22,250
I'm at one 51. I'm in
that range of, I guess,

417
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,510
the proper way for my short ass.
All right,

418
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,970
Galatians do. And how long did it
take you to drop all that? Just,

419
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,860
it's just nonsense.
Still going on.

420
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:34,410
It's been years and you're doing it
the right way. You're gradually, uh,

421
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,710
did you do it more diet or,
or working out?

422
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,440
Both. Both. But I mean to, I, at the
time I was still smoking cigarettes.

423
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:43,290
Still a smoking pot still.
I quit all that.

424
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Yeah. And that shit, by the way, I'm 46,
right around 40. Man. I'm telling you,

425
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,380
like there's this weird thing where at 40,

426
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:54,230
if you figured you started being
a knucklehead around 18, 19,

427
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,520
it does that tipping point where for
more your life you will be in a moron.

428
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,350
Then running around and riding your
bicycle as a kid out and all of that shit

429
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:07,790
that I'm telling you, it starts like the
sh the weight just fucking shut down.

430
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,890
And like, uh, all of a sudden,

431
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:13,360
just some of the conversations I'm having
with some of my friends, it's just a,

432
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,330
it's, it's what, what I mean,
unfortunately I never let
it get too out of control.

433
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:21,150
I'm about a buck 70 now. The worst I ever
did. I went about 20 pounds and dude,

434
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,540
it was all road. Fucking what? You
were up to one 91 I was almost closed.

435
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,530
I was closing on one 90. And
uh, this comic Keith Robinson,

436
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,530
I'm not going to say the
comics name that he called me,

437
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,290
but he was a redhead who was fat and
he called me him that day. And I,

438
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,230
and it just, it, it, it was funny as hell,
but it really stung me. And I was like,

439
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:42,740
all right,
I gotta go.

440
00:23:42,741 --> 00:23:47,480
Cause they're one of the running jokes
on this podcast that I think fat shaming

441
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:50,410
works. If you're in a, like I'm,

442
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:52,670
I'm not trying to get in trouble
and we can comment already bullshit.

443
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:54,650
But it's just like I do that to myself.

444
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,950
Like I'll be looking in the mirror when
I'm just want to go look what you did,

445
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:01,100
you piece of shit. And I just said nobody
should love you. You know, just fucking,

446
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,280
it gets me like I just,

447
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,150
I just have an unacceptable wait.
Like I'm not fucking going past this

448
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,160
buddy. I have a, I have a photo
album in my phone that's like my,

449
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:17,730
my workout photo album. It's all
old photos. Right? That really a,

450
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,060
I look at it and it's not even cause I
want to look a certain way cause I look,

451
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,810
it's only, it's going to be what it is.
But I'm not a pretty boy. I, I'm not,

452
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm not a hand, particularly
handsome guys. What it is
it here? Go Fuck Yourself.

453
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,980
You look great. I look at those two Oh
five things and that's where I'm like,

454
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:35,560
that shit ain't, it did like I don't
want to go to the gym that now.

455
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:38,400
Now we will you will,
you ought to shape as a kid or the no,

456
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:40,090
I mean that just happened
in your adult life.

457
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:45,180
I always like genetically we always
had like meat on our bones, you know,

458
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,780
we're short guys, even my brother too.
But like I plead every single sport.

459
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,160
I re,
I mean I,

460
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:55,090
there was not a day that went by in my
youth up until I moved out here that I

461
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:57,220
didn't do something that day.
Sports wise.

462
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,091
You know what's hilarious?

463
00:24:58,091 --> 00:25:01,270
You probably the only guy who have a
moving out to la in show business and put

464
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:03,030
on weight. That's fun.
Unless you did it for,

465
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,890
I mean, God, I'm craft
service got me. I just went,

466
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:11,891
I went probably from 21 to almost 30
where I did not do shit except fuck.

467
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:20,690
I mean I work when I smoked and I AA.
That's all I did. So when you, uh,

468
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,330
how old were you when
you booked entourage?

469
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:28,570
23 going on close to 24
and that ran for what,

470
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:31,880
seven, eight seasons. Eight
seasons spanned across the IHB.

471
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,450
L does it with a year and a half break,
so spanned across a decade, you know,

472
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,380
basically, yeah, almost a decade.
10 Years of craft service. I mean,

473
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,210
that's understandable.
You kidding?

474
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:42,440
And then you start making
a little bit of money.

475
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:46,100
You could actually afford to take
a lady out for a meal. It's, yeah,

476
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:47,330
you went off the rails.

477
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,990
What you used to think was a good
restaurant and then all of it, you know,

478
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:51,980
I used to be like,
you know,

479
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,990
guy go into the ground round was like a
big group and then I made a little bit

480
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:00,530
of money then what I thought was a good
restaurant. And then the second, you know,

481
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:05,210
I met my wife. Then it's just like, yeah,
like Jesus Christ, so fucking kill me.

482
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:05,940
She,

483
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,930
she goes on the Internet and she knows
where all the places are and all that.

484
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:12,650
She's a foodie how she likes tonight.
Yeah. Yeah. He's an idiot. Yeah.

485
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,710
Until the bill comes and it's just like
Jesus just didn't break a window if not

486
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:18,450
fucking worth runoff. We, yeah, we
went out the other and every once,

487
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,830
like once a month I go out and I and I,
uh,

488
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,810
will go out and it'll be just like some,
yeah, it's fucking brutal. They gave,

489
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,430
you can tell every stutter and we just
went out to a steak place the other night.

490
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:30,770
It was fucking delicious,
but the bill was

491
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:36,000
really annoying. Really to add to
people is like two 80 something.

492
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,840
There was, it was brutal.
It was brutal. And

493
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,460
I then I bring it up to her. I think
I brought it up to her. She got mad,

494
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,313
said it was tacky

495
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,960
when I was in Ohio,
when I was just in Ohio.

496
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:52,870
We went to a really nice restaurant and
uh, we went to the bar first and the,

497
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,030
or the round the drinks. So like four of
us and you know, I get the credit card.

498
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,120
I only had like 20 byline, like
20 bucks on me, my credit card.

499
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:01,500
It's like go and I'm waiting.
I'm like,

500
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:06,060
God is going to be a credit card
situation came $16 for like five drinks.

501
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:07,200
I'm like, oh my, Geez,

502
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:12,201
what it should be la women's 6,000
a $60 drink water at the minimum.

503
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,830
And I'm not a cheap guy,
but it,

504
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,250
that was [inaudible] that
used to be dive bars out here,

505
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,800
but all the fucking hipsters,
they take over every one of them.

506
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:24,190
Now the dive bars are more expensive,
upscale bars. Brutal. It's brutal. So I'm,

507
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:28,250
I want to make sure that I
don't, uh, I don't forget to
promote everything. So, uh,

508
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,450
let me this, this is, this is
actually just for me because, uh,

509
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,750
like I was saying earlier,

510
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:36,390
just as far as how you make
money outside of this business,

511
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,610
I just think that gives you such an
unbelievable amount of power where if you

512
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:45,210
have this income coming in, if the acting
work slows down just for a little bit,

513
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,310
like when they come at you and you know,

514
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:49,050
with the movie where
you got to be in drag,

515
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,810
you only have to do it if you
want to. Yeah. We're like,

516
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,970
you see a lot of these
guys now because uh,

517
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,510
I guess it's more before we talk
about the fat cells thing, like, um,

518
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,680
in your time in the movies,
like the last 10 years in the mood,

519
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,070
like the whole movie
industry now with the, uh,

520
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,790
I'm not even gonna say the name of the
websites. We can watch it for free.

521
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,650
It's like it's doing to the
movie business. What happened
to the music business?

522
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,010
100%. Yeah. So now like for you know,

523
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:15,720
people outside the business
listening right now,

524
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:19,110
basically how it works now is
who is that have the best chance,

525
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:24,111
correct me if I'm wrong or like low
budget independent things or those hundred

526
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,540
million dollar robot superhero movies.
The in between,

527
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,630
which is all the movies that we
probably grew up loving, you know,

528
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,930
the standby me's,
those coming of age kind of move.

529
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,590
Those in betweens are almost not obsolete.
Like we don't enjoy them,

530
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,850
but studios aren't making them right
cause they're businesses like two,

531
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:45,270
$3 million or less or a
hundred million or more.

532
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:50,271
And that in between gap is actually
proving not to be the least profitable

533
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:53,510
business. And I think those are the
better movies personally. But uh, you're,

534
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,290
you're absolutely hit the
nail on the head. Yeah.

535
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:59,920
Cause I was sitting there one night and
I saw like the probably like the 15th a

536
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:02,640
list movie star signed
on to do a TV series.

537
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:05,120
That's probably why all these TV series
is so unbelievable now. It's like,

538
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,670
it's like, it really is like the
second golden age of television.

539
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:11,790
Like some of the stuff that's out
there and I'm really far behind.

540
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,560
People keep telling me I got to see Fargo
and there's a, I'm where I'm reformed.

541
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,810
I'm on like season three of breaking
bad or you what's how far behind I am or

542
00:29:19,811 --> 00:29:23,940
yeah. And like season one, a house
of cards. I'm real behind. Yeah.

543
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:27,150
I started watching the killing.
I like that. What's the
first two seasons of that?

544
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,820
A house of cards. I watched the first
episode, I was like, I love this.

545
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,880
And then you know, my life got busy
and I haven't got back to that.

546
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,420
So pay attention for that one.
You can't, I'm like, yeah,

547
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,980
the popcorn and you got to let
you got to lock in on that one.

548
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,430
You can't really casually watch
house of cards. Absolutely.

549
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:43,840
So all these guys now you see like,

550
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:47,350
I mean you see half the cast of like a
boogie nights and all these movies I love,

551
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:52,240
they're all um, on, on TV now. So,
um, with it change in like that,

552
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,570
that's why I'm, I love this,
this move. I mean, and,

553
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:59,540
and you did the most riskiest thing is
essentially opening a restaurant, right.

554
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,390
And, uh, how did the, how did that all
come about? It came about because the, uh,

555
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,920
the Sao of facts,
owls is a real guy.

556
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:08,950
He's one of my best friends
I know from New York. Uh,

557
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:13,390
we always talked when we were young,
young, I'm talking 20 years old out here.

558
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,940
Like we need like an east
coast kind of place out here.

559
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,790
We didn't know what it was. And then
obviously, you know, he, and he's not,

560
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,250
he wasn't in the entertainment business.
So He's a mechanical engineer,

561
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:25,360
like builds buildings. And uh, he
kind of ended that part of his career.

562
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:29,500
And Him and another friend of mine came
to me with this whole plan. And look,

563
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,110
I don't know,
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas.

564
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,340
Like I don't know anything about the
restaurant business. Right, right.

565
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,860
I really genuinely, no, I don't cook.

566
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,600
I don't want to sit down and I eat.
It's exactly how that conversation went.

567
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,730
And you know, I, they,

568
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:45,890
they played another one it down someday
and sound's going to be a fucking jail.

569
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,530
Could show fuck you pay me.
No.

570
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:54,870
So I just, I invested in the two of them.
I said, guys, I don't know about food.

571
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,830
I know all restaurant, most restaurants
fail. But um, not that I feel like I owed,

572
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,010
but like if I can empower
one of my best friends,

573
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,570
cause I'm a lucky motherfucker right
now, if I can't give her a shot, why not?

574
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,090
I went into it saying I'm
going to lose every dollar. I,

575
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:14,680
so I wrote a check that I was
comfortable losing every cent of right.

576
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,920
And sure enough, the kid came through and
I look, I don't run the business right.

577
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,410
I'm not going there and making
sandwiches. I, I'm in on everything.

578
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:27,010
I know what's going on.
But they run that show and they were,

579
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,860
we just opened our fourth one in Austin,
Texas through,

580
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,310
you've got to update your
bio. You're killing it so
much. They told me you had a,

581
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:35,690
you had two locations, now
you've got four. Well you got to,

582
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:39,040
you had to be comfortable with if your
buddy knew how to build and design a

583
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,830
building that he could make a sandwich.
You mean, that's gotta be a joke. Yeah.

584
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:45,610
But he also built out the places because
of his background and the other guy,

585
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:48,520
Josh of fat Sal's who he's the one
that they came up with the were making

586
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,560
sandwiches over here. Right. You know,

587
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:54,010
he's been in the food industry his whole
life. So they were the team and I said,

588
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:54,281
I'm,

589
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:59,281
I'm betting on you guys because the first
one was at Ucla Westwood function and

590
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:04,090
I said, they have a great way of making
everyone feel like it's your spot.

591
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,440
Like you're a VIP.
I'm like,

592
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:09,220
these kids are gonna are gonna come to
hang out with you too. And sure enough,

593
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,920
I hate to say I told you
is I was right about that.

594
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,570
And then they took it from there. And
if just did you guys with that, uh,

595
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:20,320
that flooded, did anything come down your
way? Not Luckily, not ours, but I mean,

596
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:23,740
we certainly felt some of the effects
of it, but it didn't, it didn't hit, uh,

597
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,830
our spot. But, um, for people
listening, uh, all over,

598
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:30,460
there was a water main
break. Crazy, crazy.

599
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,240
Like one of those 10 foot pipes you
could drive a truck through. Yeah. Uh,

600
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,070
broke in, you know, it's not no big deal.

601
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,920
We just steal the water
here things and you know,

602
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,680
we have so much water in anyway.

603
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,570
So tell, tell me about this.
I'm, I'm jumping all around.
I'm scatterbrained here,

604
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:48,320
but um, so this Arturo
Gotti movie, uh, now is,

605
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:52,630
is this is going to be, uh,
it's going to go all the way.

606
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,170
Obviously you're going to go to the,
I don't want to ruin the end of the movie,

607
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:58,350
but I know how his life and, and, and,

608
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:03,190
and that should stay sorta like
open ended as to whether was it was,

609
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,990
it officially ruled like a suicide.

610
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,180
It was officially real a suicide.
Arturo Gatti, uh, at the,

611
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,920
after he retired,
you know,

612
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,760
he went to Brazil and
with his wife at the time,

613
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:18,990
they would go and sit and the kid and,
uh, he was found dead and the government,

614
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:22,680
their view ruled it, it was
ruled a suicide. She was,

615
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,740
his wife was actually in jail on trial
for the murder and she was not guilty

616
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,920
acquitted. And now she's
back here. Um, you know,

617
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:36,921
while we will not be able to literally
make the movie and say she killed him,

618
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,600
the goal of the movie
without giving away all,

619
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,320
all too much is if we tell
this guy's story correctly,

620
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,200
you as an audience member will be
able to walk out saying, does no,

621
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,200
no fucking way. He hung himself
with a pocketbook strap from the,

622
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,330
the staircase and ended up
under the island of the kitchen.

623
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,550
Like I have the reports,
it is mind blowing the,

624
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,470
the way they say it went down.
Um,

625
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,420
so this movies being made because his
longtime manager to Pat Lynch, great guy,

626
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,960
he's actually in the documentary
a lot. Uh, the w Gaddy Ward Tail,

627
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:13,640
the Hbo Documentary, that
Walberg Voiceover. And um,

628
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,680
the last man was that last century was
already the 90s, like [inaudible] 98. No,

629
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,230
I think it was there. It was early
2006, 2002 was the first fight.

630
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,480
And I remember I watched that fight live
was at Mohegan Sun, 2000 people there.

631
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:29,880
And Jim Lamp, we actually says in
the fight, man, he's like, man,

632
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,600
I bet you these 2000 people
did not realize they were
walking into and maybe the

633
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:37,300
best fight they'll ever see when
you were like, no, no he can't.

634
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,890
He was commentating the fight and he
was just saying he's looking around the

635
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:44,310
small little arena. 2000
peoples. I bet the 2000 pumps.

636
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,800
Are you watching it and I'm on a big
screen or you're at the front cause

637
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,300
Washington at home. Oh, okay.

638
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,720
Here probably on break from
working in Boston market stone,

639
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,770
probably watching the fight with
some Mac and cheese and um, you know,

640
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,820
some mark played Micky ward in the
fighter and it's a great, great movie.

641
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,040
And I love Mickey Ward as well.
And you know,

642
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,220
they weren't at a place really to
get into the gas rewards stuff.

643
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:06,540
So I think this is kind of,

644
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,800
that's why I think that's why mark wanted
to be involved is that's the next step

645
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:15,390
is showing that bromance, the ultimate
bromance of a Touro and Micky ward.

646
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,680
Right. And there's all those movies,
uh, boxing movies is, it's just,

647
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:22,310
I mean I'm a sucker for those. That to
me that's like the modern day western.

648
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:25,580
Like when I was a kid I Stories Watch
westerns with my dad cause he loved those.

649
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,660
And then I look at the rocky movies,
they started off good,

650
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:32,260
they got a little stick out, a little
crazy. But, but you know what's,

651
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,800
what was cool about the rocky,
all of them was the premise of each.

652
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,300
Like I, I love, I can't even
remember which one. There
was so many. I'm an expert.

653
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:44,850
Will talk to me. I got the Rusch one
was on that was a little ridiculous,

654
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,380
but the one where he's coming back
like he's lost all his money, uh,

655
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,010
that it's rocky five,

656
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,870
five Tommy Morrison.

657
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,750
Yeah.
And that what I loved about that,

658
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,830
I'm not saying you know when it
goes back to Philly. Yeah. And what,

659
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,310
and what I love about is just
the premise of it that they,

660
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,210
they age the character with Stallone.

661
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,550
Like I thought they did a really good
job and they kind of did like a good

662
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,550
trajectory of it.
I'm not saying the executed,

663
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,520
this is what you gotta do nowadays
because there's so many fucking people out

664
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:17,211
there that are going to take,

665
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:18,920
well you actually think
that's a good fucking morning.

666
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:23,330
I'm just saying like what the jump off
point for where they were going with that

667
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:24,860
too. That's hilarious.
You watched all of those.

668
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,080
Let's also take a moment and
realize one thing about how crazy,

669
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,950
how far we've come.

670
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,560
If we tried to make rocky one now at the
love story part where rocky and rocky

671
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:40,700
essentially rapes Adrian
when he has her at the house.

672
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,390
She tries to get out. He slams the
door and I need the famous shit.

673
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:48,110
Like he puts his arms up on the pipe and
the wife via, you won't let her leave.

674
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:51,200
She's trying to leave. She's
like, let me go. And he's
like, no, you will. You Go, no,

675
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:54,200
you got us. He basically date
rapes 80 doesn't let her leave.

676
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,950
There's a lot of that.
It's like, dude, let her go

677
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,430
that, uh, back in the day, I guess
I shouldn't be laughing at this.

678
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:05,910
It's just fucking, uh, just
the fact that that one,

679
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,613
what it wants,

680
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,620
we want you won the Oscar did it also
when I think it won best picture,

681
00:37:10,621 --> 00:37:15,090
best screenplay at, yeah. It was almost
a sweep. Jesus Christ. I forgot. Oh,

682
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:16,530
I thought that all that
shit was in the [inaudible].

683
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,100
Are you a set that little sports holy
itself where they'd slap the shit out of

684
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,050
him? Like I thought that
that was just in the 50s.

685
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,310
You a sports movie guy or now
some of them I like an I is,

686
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,500
if they're done in a way,
uh,

687
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,980
if they're not too cliched at this, it's
very hard at this point now it's like,

688
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,380
it's almost impossible. I didn't, uh,

689
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,810
I'll have issues like say that movie Rudy
loved the story, loved and all of that,

690
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:43,980
but when you saw the actor they picked
and then the end they showed the real guy,

691
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,770
you saw the real guy. And even though
he's small, you look at him like, dude,

692
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:49,710
that guy's a fucking animal man.
I would not want that guy running at me.

693
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,340
Like I can see how that guy had
a heart of a lion, but just,

694
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,150
you know,
hard.

695
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,550
I would have fought if they were making
that movie right now to play Rudy. I, we,

696
00:37:57,551 --> 00:38:02,440
I live in meeting Sean Aston head to
head battle. I would have, oh my lord,

697
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,180
I would just say your rights
for that movie. Absolutely.

698
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,220
Nowadays nowadays they're not.

699
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,920
That would be your one cycle I go is
Rudy every Halloween? That's my house.

700
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,430
When I get to put on Notre Dame Jack and
I hold a Bible. No you don't. Yes I do.

701
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,000
Ah Ha's my goto that and
Schneider from one day at a time.

702
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,990
Dude, see you. So you basically you
love acting the way I love stand up

703
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,900
100%.
Like I don't know about you,

704
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:29,800
but acting was just my
way into movies and TV.

705
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:33,340
I didn't know I could have easily been
an editor and I would have been almost

706
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:34,280
equally as happy.
Yeah.

707
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:38,170
I wouldn't have had a of cool
stories that I have now would acting,

708
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:42,700
but it was something in, in
TV or movies, whatever it was.

709
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:46,440
I just enacting was what that landed on.
Oh, speaking of that type of stuff, uh,

710
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,930
meeting all these people, uh, all those
years on all those seasons on entourage.

711
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:54,340
Who was your favorite guest star? Cause
you guys had some monsters on that show.

712
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,540
God, it's real. And I know people
always try to take a high road.

713
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:02,310
I didn't want to single out one person.
I'm not doing that handful, whatever.

714
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,910
Give me, I mean, I love,

715
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,960
I love James Cameron only because I think
he like legitimize the fake world that

716
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:15,100
we created. Like James Cameron on the
show was directing Aquaman. And so he,

717
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:19,600
like when he came on, he legitimize our
fake world are fake universe. But, uh,

718
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,400
I mean,
I loved like Bob Saget.

719
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,410
We had the whole cast full
house at one point a dice.

720
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,170
We had dice on their dice
was race was phenomenal. And,

721
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:34,180
uh, I never viewed, told me when I was
a little kid sneaking the dice tapes,

722
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:37,270
when my brother listening to him
that'd be acting when Andrew dice clay,

723
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:39,280
I would've punched him in the nuts.

724
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:44,030
Now people don't understand like
the impact that guy, how I learn.

725
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,500
I saw dice clay at the Worcester Centrum.

726
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,310
This is like where like the Celtics
could have done a home game too.

727
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,610
I was like second to last row in the
upper deck and he came out and destroyed.

728
00:39:57,491 --> 00:40:00,190
And in the end he did his
impressions and then I swear to God,

729
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:03,100
he played a drum solo.
I'm not even lying like this.

730
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,340
It was like he could do no uh,
no wrong.

731
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:10,160
And it's so hard now with all the internet
and all the fucking podcasts and all

732
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:15,160
of this shit for somebody to have
an impact and get that big and uh,

733
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:18,390
that's one of the, his son is one
of the best drummers I've ever seen.

734
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,110
Son Max you talked about you guys,

735
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:24,940
he told me his son is
on real on the drums.

736
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:29,050
Like well knock your head off
with the drums fit. There you go.

737
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,090
So we had an appointment. You
had so many cool. I mean the,

738
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,970
I always describe it like this.

739
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:37,420
Like we had one day on entourage where
I don't think any other show would ever

740
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:38,620
do this on the call sheet.

741
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,970
You 6:00 AM call at 6:00 AM we
were working with Sydney Pollack,

742
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,960
great actor, director, and then after
lunch or doing a scene with Kanye west,

743
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,380
it's like wherever are you
going to do in one day?

744
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,250
Are you going to do scenes with Sydney
Pollack in the morning and Kanye West in

745
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,280
the afternoon. It was, that was the one
of the coolest parts of that. So awesome.

746
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:00,790
How crazy is that Bob Saget. I
love him. I'm obsessed with him.

747
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,900
And he did something really cool. My
nephew, who's now watching full house,

748
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:09,310
my mom bought them all the DVDs. It's his
favorite show is five years old. He, he,

749
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,760
he wants to call me uncle
Jesse. He asked me, he's like,

750
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,910
I call you uncle Jesse instead of uncle
Jerry. Yeah, sure. So I tweeted that.

751
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,960
And Bob who, uh, Bob's facade,

752
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,730
he must follow me and the
row like DM me. Like, look,

753
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:25,270
if the kids ever in town bring him the
fat Sal's, I'll come me. And like Bob,

754
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,910
if you, if my nephew sees
the real you, he might,

755
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:32,620
you might see a first five year old heart
attack. I might just fall on the floor.

756
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:37,650
So I did a benefit was Saget
la last week and that guy,

757
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:39,260
he's out of his fucking mind.

758
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,530
He goes on stage and he starts wishing
the disease we're trying to stop.

759
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:49,700
He's wishing the disease on the club
owner and it's the funniest like five

760
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:51,620
minutes I've seen in a while.

761
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:54,920
And the crowds all like uncomfortable
in scorm is of course a couple of people

762
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:58,850
that get it, that he's just joking around,
but he goes up and he, it's fucking,

763
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,170
he just goes up and rifts.

764
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:05,050
So he'll talk himself into
a hole and he just, no,

765
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,990
he just keeps digging it. He doesn't try
to get out. He tries to, EIT goes out,

766
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,650
he tries to dig all the way through and
come out the other side down in China.

767
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,350
And that's what he did. He felt
them going and he just kept, he's,

768
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,150
he's out of his mind. This
was one of my favorite, um,

769
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,820
comics to watch because of that style.

770
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:26,660
And then also because of all the people
that watched full house and they still

771
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:30,270
think there's going to be this America's
funniest home. Yeah. But this guy, this,

772
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,570
that, yeah. This family sort
of like entertainment kind
of thing. Quick Bob thing.

773
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:38,120
And Doug Allen actually
said the creator of honor.

774
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:42,410
I said this on my podcast when, when
you went to Bob Saget to do the shell,

775
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,160
Doug wanted to play Bob as like broke,
like broke,

776
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:49,160
like live in somewhere and
blah. And Bob's like, Look Doug,

777
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,400
I'll do any one thing I won't
do. I won't play broke. Right.

778
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,540
Because I d I won't play. So Doug
was like, all right, well what about,

779
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:00,410
what would you like to have
sex with prostitutes? It's
like, yes, he died easily,

780
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,430
but I won't play Bro. He would
not play down on his luck.
Broke Bob. But he's like,

781
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:07,220
I love, yeah, why not? I'll have sex
with prostitutes. Yeah, of course.

782
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,500
Because he just, he just thought
it was a, they want to do it.

783
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:12,630
That was like his one. I'm not
playing bro. Cause that like, um,

784
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,200
it just doesn't fit with what I do.
That's also,

785
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:18,020
that's probably a smart move too because
it's so many people would think that he

786
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:20,780
actually did that where if you
just do the prostitute thing,

787
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,290
like as soon as comedy a little bit. I
guess like in if you, if you know him,

788
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,210
you know,
you don't really take that seriously,

789
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:28,220
but you may be kind of wonder in
the back of your mind like, wait,

790
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,440
maybe now he's great, you know? Oh Jesus,
all these memories are coming back. I,

791
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,320
I was,
uh,

792
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,160
I was walking my dog and there's a
house that I walked by that you guys,

793
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,940
I didn't even realize I was watching a
rerun and you guys shot without Ralph

794
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,800
Macho there. Oh God. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yes, yes. I'm Dylan too.

795
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:50,750
Yeah, that goes. Um, and of course,
you know, Ralph was hilarious and uh,

796
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,350
every time I swear to God, like I, I've
walked by that thing like 15 times.

797
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:57,380
Every time I go by it. Like nine
times out of the 15, I'll be like,

798
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:00,590
we asked them to do the [inaudible] stood
right in the best way to do the crease.

799
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:03,230
Shut us down on the crane
kick. What does that, oh,

800
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:07,700
the famous Daniel Larusso crane chick at
the end that he hits January. We said,

801
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:11,380
well, you do the cranky. He's
like, no, I won't do it. And
you only asked once, right?

802
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,220
Oh yeah, yeah. Out The respect. Of
course he asked me once, he says no, we,

803
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:19,221
we really tried to never make anyone
uncomfortable view if a cameo came on,

804
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:23,480
like they really had control of
what, how far they want it. Yeah.

805
00:44:23,481 --> 00:44:26,060
It was never done with like,
you're in on the joke.

806
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:28,200
We're not trying to make
you look like a dick if,

807
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:31,560
if you're uncomfortable either don't
do it or we'll change it. Doug,

808
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:35,970
Doug was always great about that. That's
awesome. Well, I, I had an awesome time.

809
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:39,240
A finally getting me, I know
I met you briefly, but uh,

810
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,430
I'm really happy for
all your success here,

811
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:44,700
but we didn't really get to talk
too much about your podcast. What's,

812
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:48,630
is it just you? Is it going to be like
another, uh, it's, it's just me, but I do,

813
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:53,000
I do have guests, uh, a lot of the
heavy sports gunky guesses. You know,

814
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,270
I'm trying right now not to, because it
is the dog days of summer and you know,

815
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:00,350
there's no football, there's
no hoops. So I'm real.

816
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,410
I'm every time I every show at some
point I say I'm not going to talk about

817
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:07,830
supports because the minute,
you know October comes around,

818
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,920
it's probably going to transition
into that a lot. Oh absolutely. So,

819
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:15,570
but we're doing some fun sports things.
Uh, we got like the Sports Academy Awards.

820
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:19,380
I'm doing this one thing where we're
going to like do the best sports movies

821
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:23,250
never made so, and I want my
audience cast. Listen to that.

822
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,490
Well I would love for you,
I'd love to get your take on this too.

823
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:31,410
Don't we're going to cast the
86 mets that move. Oh Geez.

824
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,130
Let's cast. But I'm dumb. Say
I'm doing that one on the,

825
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:39,150
on the shell next week. I think when
we cast the 86 mets, little teaser,

826
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:42,360
you know Darryl pardon himself,
he was a little younger,

827
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:44,010
would have been a great Darryl strawberry.

828
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:48,630
I got the best dow strawberry who
is a little teaser with this way.

829
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,820
To me it's a genius call.

830
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:54,390
I don't know how you're going to react
and only because of what he looks like

831
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:55,530
now.
Okay.

832
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,870
Dave Chappelle is dow strawberry
cause he's chat right now has a knee.

833
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,090
The pictures I've seen of Chappelle,
he's like, yeah, yeah, huge.

834
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,050
I saw Seattle. He is, he's like a big boy.

835
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:12,290
I can see him cross the room at this
point. I would cast him as Dao. Oh.

836
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,980
But we get, have fun with
it. We could have, I mean,

837
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:17,790
Lenny Dykstra who's going to play Lenny
Dykstra Mooky Wilson, Dwight Gooden,

838
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,960
Sherry Carter on the Hernandez. He's
bringing up some bad memories. You know,

839
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:25,040
I wish we wish we didn't
play them in 86 his,

840
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,050
I really would have enjoyed that team
more because I saw so many things on that.

841
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:33,600
Just the unbelievable like this, the
level of talent that was on that team was,

842
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:38,550
was, was insane. And uh, you know,
obviously what happened when we ran,

843
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:41,940
until we had those fuckers beat, uh, that
book too, if you ever want to read it.

844
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,800
I watched that so little, I don't
even remember the names. Like,

845
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:49,860
I can't even remember who was the guy
who ran across the home plate and he put

846
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:54,660
his hands on his helmet like Lima Zilly.
Why did I think it was night?

847
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:58,360
I'm thinking maybe it was,
maybe it was night. My initials.

848
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,190
Mine is telling me Mozilla, but
that's not a fact. So the hind,

849
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,940
the bag Wagner had everything fucking
show that forever. It may be nice,

850
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,040
still love Vin Scully,

851
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:11,760
but every once in a while
when I'm watching the Dodgers
game listening to him,

852
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:11,971
he was,

853
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:16,971
his voice will get up into that register
and that's all I'm sure you imagine if

854
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,740
that APP and now with social media,

855
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:24,741
what the hell that would that would
set social media break Twitter if that

856
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:28,650
happened right now Twitter would
have to shut down there, whatever.

857
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,190
I don't know anything about technology,

858
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:33,780
but whenever they use that shit would
break. If bill Buckner happened right

859
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,600
now. Oh, and he like bill Buckner and
actually back then before social media,

860
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:40,630
he had to leave. Yeah.
Boston. And He, you know,

861
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,780
he was upset and he talked about it too.
And I was kind of like a,

862
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:46,960
I felt bad for him on one level, but
on another level it's like, dude,

863
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,370
you know what? What do you eat?
We haven't won it. And this long.

864
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,300
What'd you think was going to happen?
It, it hit a pebble or something.

865
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:59,050
I don't know. It's like, but you know when
it's a little slow roller, what do you,

866
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:02,080
what do you think? Did he
expect compassion? I don't know.

867
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,210
Did He really expect compassionate?
I know you,

868
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:07,960
she gets compassion for his fucking Bob
Stanley. That's who should give him,

869
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:08,351
he said,
son,

870
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:13,180
I'm a fucking card every week that he took
that off of him or whoever was, I see.

871
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,910
I haven't literally have never, I
never watched the game again. Go.

872
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:17,710
There was no reason to go there.

873
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,730
One time I watched some highlights and
we had that Calvin Sheraldi in there and

874
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:26,470
it was just single single, single,
don't go through it. It was,

875
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,270
it was the sickest day to start
getting cold sign on and no,

876
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,780
but it's fine because we won all
these championships, but it's,

877
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,500
there's just something about that
one. That one hurt. That was,

878
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,430
cause I was 18 when that happened.
That's when bill Buckner happened.

879
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,310
I was 10, so I didn't even, I mean,

880
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:44,740
I didn't even know that we had one
at that long and I didn't even,

881
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:47,680
I knew the Yankees had won
some championships, but I
was too young to get it.

882
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:51,520
But by [inaudible] 86, I
got it. And uh, you know,

883
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:54,900
you'd think the Celtics won it that year.
Patriots went to the Superbowl,

884
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:58,030
we got the shit kicked out of us,
but it was looking good for we've,

885
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,160
that was foreshadowing are this, this past
tenure. We kind of got it all at once,

886
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:06,220
but um, but anyways, hey, I'm,
I'm really happy for you man.

887
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:10,210
To all the success in like in the
highest compliment mount of, you know,

888
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:12,510
back in the day, you know, it
was, it was really hard to,

889
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,570
to go from a television show where
he was so known as a character,

890
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:19,300
especially if they had like a nickname
or something like that to then to be

891
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:21,790
going on to doing the stuff to get to
when you're playing this Arturo Gotti,

892
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,120
I think it's going to lead to great
things. You've got all these sandwiches,

893
00:49:25,121 --> 00:49:26,650
places you could kill an end.

894
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:29,470
You've got a podcast and I'm helping
you promote it on my own podcast.

895
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:32,960
She wants about bad for fucking
business. That right there. I cannot

896
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,260
thank you enough though for having me.
I've been a, I've been a fan for quiet.

897
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,230
I actually, when I, when I met
you that night, the nic screening,

898
00:49:39,231 --> 00:49:41,960
we saw a screening for the
Knicks. Val Is, Oh, I, uh, uh,

899
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,250
Michael Michael Rag Rappaport still need
directed and which is great by the way.

900
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,340
It's, it's awesome. What's it called
again? Uh, when the garden was Eden. Yeah.

901
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,580
Which is based on a book,
right? It's based on a book.

902
00:49:52,581 --> 00:49:56,120
When the Knicks were actually good, which
I don't know. See, it's similar to you.

903
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:58,550
Like you're, I'm like that
with the Knicks. Even like,

904
00:49:58,551 --> 00:50:01,520
I just have no idea that they're just
losers to me. But you weren't sure.

905
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:04,220
We'll know for Pat Riley those, the
early enough, but yeah. Well, you know,

906
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:09,020
losing game game six and sevens and the
rock is, John's stock's going to for 17.

907
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:12,770
The joke was John Stocks start to shoot
himself after the game, but he missed, oh,

908
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,270
you know,
it was a,

909
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:17,660
that was my gen Patrick Ewing missing
the finger or Reggie Miller scored eight

910
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:22,310
points and 20 sound. I feel your pain. Oh,

911
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:26,500
sorry. But I'm glad I want to be your fan
long enough. You got those fucking scam.

912
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,110
So yeah. But anyways, I hope,

913
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,880
uh, what little I could
do on this podcast, I hope
makes bad for business. Uh,

914
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,450
a big hit out there and uh,
congratulations on this.
A Turo gaudy thing, man.

915
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,600
I can't wait and I'm going to hit,
you're a fat cells pretty soon. Oh,

916
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:42,290
you're a VIP now bill. All right, Jerry.
Thanks a lot, man. Thanks man. Alright.
