1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,210
Hey, what's going on? Oh, hey,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,650
it's bill burn. It's the Monday
morning podcast for Monday, Monday,

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,510
March 23rd, 2015. How's it going?

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,520
How are you doing? Hopefully, hopefully
you're hearing this thing on time,

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,290
if not sooner. Last week I, um,
I recorded the thing on Sunday.

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:30,291
Then of course I brought the wrong
fucking why so I couldn't upload it right.

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,000
And then fucking I do my Thursday one.
My Internet just sucks in my,

8
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:40,050
I don't know what's going on, like in
my neighborhood. Right. They don't want,

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,680
you know, when they put those trees
up, it looks like a weird looking tree,

10
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,770
but she can't really tell unless you look
at it and it gives you good internet.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,810
All in my neighborhood, they don't
want that. We know one kid in a fixed,

12
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,870
the Chegg, we did the Winch Cape
and your neighborhood. Right?

13
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:55,980
So we don't have one of those.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,450
So my internet sucks a big bag of dicks.

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,710
So what I have to do now,
it just keeps getting worse by the week.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,520
And, um, I don't know if this
is part of some other bullshit,

17
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:12,540
some big conglomerates buying up bandwidth
and all this shit where they try to

18
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,420
squeeze me down the fucking little
porthole. They want me to go down.

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,580
I don't even know if that's
under the same category.

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,440
That's just some shit that I heard
walking by a TV in an airport. All right.

21
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,810
So don't hold me to that.
Um,

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,590
all I know is now whenever
I do my fucking podcast,

23
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:33,150
what I have to do is I then have to jump
in the car after I uploaded and then

24
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:37,800
drive down to a local Starbucks
and I got to stand there,

25
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,730
you know, eating a Muffin, waiting for
the fucking thing to upload. Actually,

26
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,960
I'm not, I don't need an I not
eating a muffin. Alright. Oh,

27
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,300
Billy Gym rat, Huh? Oh, Billy squat face.

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,170
I'm going to the gym now for
fucking two weeks. And um, you know,

29
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:02,120
I fucked up yesterday.
A buddy of mine's parents were in town.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,180
We went to this Greek restaurant like
a fucking horse. And uh, you know,

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,360
it's just, it's just fucking
my age. You just can't do that.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,210
You can't deny that negates two
days of working out. But uh,

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,710
I'm still going to the gym.
I'm holding steady. I was at,

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,130
I was one 77.8 starting off at one 84.

35
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,820
I dropped seven pounds almost of
fucking lot more like six pounds.

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,360
And uh,

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,320
I'm not stopping and I'm going to keep
saying this because if I don't tell you

38
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:35,190
guys this, you won't hold it to me.
Hold with me. You won't hold me to it.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,290
I got to get down to a buck 62 the last
time. Oh, whatever. Fucking waited.

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,690
His wife finally have a flat stomach or,
you know what I mean?

41
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,580
What I've always said,
all right,

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,640
there's standing up flat stomach,
there's lying down flat stomach,

43
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:55,080
and then the ultimate shape is
sitting down flat stomach, right?

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,040
The ultimate truth is when you sit
down and you look down, that's,

45
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,430
that's the fucking shape. Your rent.
And I got to tell you, I don't like it.

46
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,350
I don't like it at all.
So you wouldn't know by my coughing.

47
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,900
I haven't had a cigar in a fucking month.
And I like it.

48
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:14,650
I think I'm done with them for awhile.
I'm going to, I'm a smoke one new years,

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,610
my birthday and then like that big
college game I go to every year and then

50
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,740
that's fucking it.
You know what I mean?

51
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,390
I had this fucking cough for
like a few weeks, you know,

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,880
it was some sort of throat infection,

53
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,030
but I mentioned to the guy that I smoked
cigars and he took his little fucking

54
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,880
mirror and he was looking at the side
of my tongue for cancerous lesions that

55
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:35,470
immediately I'm just like, what
am I doing? What am I an asshole?

56
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,610
What do I get off smoking a cigar? Like
I just figured out the fucking economy,

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,120
you know, like I just, uh, you know,

58
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,350
carved a path towards world peace.
I have,

59
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,090
all I did was come up with more hateful,
hurtful, misinterpreted material.

60
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,870
That's all I've done. I don't
deserve a cigar. Um, so anyways,

61
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:56,800
I've been going to the gym.

62
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,120
I've just decided that going to the
gym is part of my day. All right.

63
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,110
It's not a part of my day that I
like, I don't like the gym, you know,

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,790
you know fucking sign they had on today.
Remember that song? Y'All ready for this?

65
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,910
Bap, bap, bap, bap. Not a fucker
thing. Y'All ready for this?

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,980
I'm going to start seeing my stupid
a dubstep shit. I fucked as it go.

67
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,380
Y'All ready for this Dan?
Nana,

68
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,440
Nan Nan and I can't remember how it goes.

69
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:28,441
It's like it always pleases fucking
awful keyboard and then it stops at some,

70
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:31,930
Duke asks you, are Y'all
ready for this? You know,

71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,720
we play dad, they played Herbie Hancock.
They'll brocket, which you know,

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,790
I actually appreciate that song,
but I mean,

73
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,450
I just don't understand why the
music has to be so bad. So anyways,

74
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:47,620
I was going to the gym and I'm walking
to my car. I'm just muttering like,

75
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,260
I don't want to do this. I don't want
to do this. I don't want to do this.

76
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,040
And it turned into, I don't want to
do this. I don't want to do this.

77
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,330
I don't want to do this. But the
second I do this, it's over. All right,

78
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,720
second, I'm done. It's over.
That's what I just kept saying.

79
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,850
I don't want to do this. I don't want
to do this. I don't want to do this.

80
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,780
But the second it's done,

81
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,970
it's over and I'm fucking walking up
the steps to my gym outage and I knew

82
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,800
people fucking walking out of the gym too.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,530
I'm so jealous of them that they had done,
you know,

84
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,660
and people coming out of the gym,
they were in a good mood.

85
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:20,200
They hold the fucking door for you
and shit. Big Smile. Hey Ho. Hey Pete,

86
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:24,160
you work it out on right people fucking
dragging ass walking into the gym.

87
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,780
They fucking opened.
They don't even look back at you.

88
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,290
They do everything with slam the
fucking door in your face, right.

89
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,150
Then you walk up to the
counter and he said,

90
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:36,151
little spunky perky little chick day
with their fucking pony tails pretending

91
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:39,460
she doesn't realize that she's of
dressed like a whore. You know,

92
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,820
like something you'd order.
You know what I mean?

93
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,700
What's with the fucking whore theme here?
You know,

94
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,800
I can't just show up with the hair
like an adult. Okay. This is how much?

95
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:51,291
Eight the gym.

96
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm actually taking it out on this person
and she probably didn't look like that

97
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:57,100
at all, right? I just fucking hate
it. And then you go over to the map,

98
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,130
you're going to go stretch out. And what
happens every time you go over there,

99
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,310
some content is fucking and by con male
or female has sweated on the fucking map

100
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,450
and didn't even wipe it up. And even
if they did wipe it up, you see that.

101
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:12,420
You're like, well what the fuck
am I laying on here? Right.

102
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,280
I should know wore shorts.
Gross.

103
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,410
So,
um,

104
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,720
I dunno, but I haven't been in the
gym a while, but the gym etiquette,

105
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:24,670
I don't know what the fuck happened.
You know the deal,

106
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:27,670
like if you're using a machine, you
use it, then you stand up, right?

107
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:30,430
You sort of walk around a little bit
in case somebody else wants to use it.

108
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,230
I was doing legs today, legs and
edge, right? This fucking asshole.

109
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,110
I do a set of the things, you
know, you're sitting down,

110
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,930
you bring your fucking feed up
whenever you call those things.

111
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:43,360
And then I go over to do the ones where
you're doing the back of your legs.

112
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,320
And then I do the squat machine.
I'm going back again to the first one.

113
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,720
It's called doin a little cycle
there, right? One, two, three.

114
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,590
The quote was called BDP, right?
You got fucking three of them.

115
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,250
And I go back to the first one and this
is fucking jerk off finishes his set.

116
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,750
And then he's just sitting there staring
down at his fucking iPhone, you know,

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,630
and I didn't say anything because
the last time that happened,

118
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:10,050
I said to this lady, I said, Hey,
can I work in? She's like, oh ha.

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,410
And then say, I got my earbuds. I'm like,
can I work as set in? And she's like,

120
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,760
I only have two more. And
she just puts it back in. Ah,

121
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,890
I wanted to give her a fucking flare chop.
Right.

122
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,240
Right over the top of her fucking
breast assists, which you can't do that.

123
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,140
Get through that. Now they're out of
the house. They got jobs, they can vote.

124
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:34,290
It's fucking over. Um, there was a time
when they weren't even allowed to Jim's.

125
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,673
Um,

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,220
I don't know what he's,
I don't understand that person.

127
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,310
I don't understand the person that's
still uses the fucking stair master.

128
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,040
This fucking guy gets on. Right.
And you know those people,

129
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,110
when they get on the stairmaster
and they stand on it,

130
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,630
what happens is the fucking thing
starts going down to the ground.

131
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:52,330
That's when you supposed to step,
step up onto the other one.

132
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,720
They let it go all the way down to
the brown ground with both legs.

133
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,130
And then he'd just go meet me like
little step, little step, little step,

134
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,390
little step.
They're not doing anything.

135
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,680
And then they're just fucking like
clinging to the top of the machine.

136
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,110
Like they have boat capsized
and they're waiting.

137
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,530
They're waiting for their
turn to get yanked into the
coast guard chopper. Right.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,873
It's just so,

139
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,870
and they'll fucking beyond the thing
hanging on it for like 20 minutes.

140
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,640
And it's like, dude,
you didn't do anything

141
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,380
other than make your arms go to sleep.

142
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,090
Oh I, I'm lashing out everyday everybody
cause I fucking can't stand it.

143
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:33,590
I'm so fucking mad at myself that I've
gotten myself into this fucking position

144
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:36,920
that I'm going to have to go there for
like two and a half months just to,

145
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,870
just to be acceptable looking.
I'm telling you, dude,

146
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:45,620
you eat your way in and out of
the gym, man. I swear to God. Oh,

147
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,690
belly fat face did a fucking number,
man,

148
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,670
the holidays and then that fucking world
tour actually did well on the world

149
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:55,100
tour. I was fucking hitting the,
uh, that was hitting the gyms.

150
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,710
I could just make a huge difference.

151
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,920
And then I went to New York and
it was just a fucking shit show.

152
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,010
You know what I mean?
You know, you get drunk.

153
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,790
All pizza tastes good when you're
drunk, you don't give a fuck. Right.

154
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,020
Go to those goddamned Delis,
get a bacon,

155
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:15,050
egg and cheese had fucking
two in the morning. Oh, that's
good, Bill. There you go.

156
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,350
We think that's going on right to your
fucking man titty. A freckled can't.

157
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,800
So I did that for, I dunno. I Dunno.

158
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,720
I don't even know how long
it started in November,

159
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:25,580
right before Thanksgiving I started,
you know,

160
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:28,190
you just start shifting around in
your chair and you feel it. Ah,

161
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:31,110
you're putting on a little weight there,
Bill. When are you going to do it?

162
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,840
Hello? Go the gym or want more. Fritos.

163
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,150
I was stuck in it.
The sugar,

164
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:41,590
salt addiction and had me when I
was writing on F is for family.

165
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:42,850
We have Frito Fridays.

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,740
We get a big giant bag and these fucking
awesome sandwiches. And it was great.

167
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,300
It was great until now. Now that
I'm on the elliptical, so, um,

168
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,940
I actually go into the gym and this is,

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,620
I actually to get an hour's worth the
cardio. If you're a Stephen Adler fan,

170
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:03,740
you can listen to basically, um, I list,

171
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,840
I don't know if I already told you this.
Well,

172
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:08,770
this is what I do when I have to
knock out an hour of cardio. Um,

173
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,100
obviously the towel goes over the timer
because I don't want to fucking look at

174
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:16,660
it.
And I put on civil war,

175
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,950
the only track that Steven played drums
on in the use your illusion albums.

176
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,280
And then I just listened appetite from
front to back and I basically look at it

177
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:30,490
this way. He got an hour, right?

178
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,550
Break it down to 15 minute quarters like
a game civil war into fucking welcome

179
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:41,950
to the jungle. And then
somewhere in a, it's so easy.

180
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:46,540
You got your first 15 minutes cause
civil wars along fucking song. All right,

181
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:50,680
it's like seven minutes Assam Shit.
What we've got here. All right.

182
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,350
And then you figure your next three,
which are a night train.

183
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,420
It's so easy.
And Mr Brownstone,

184
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,370
that takes you almost up to a half hour
and all depends on when you press play,

185
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,490
then you're into paradise city.

186
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,910
My Michelle to the Games have
forward then paradise city,

187
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:13,450
my Michelle and think about you.
All right.

188
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,160
Then you'll get coming up on 45 minutes.
You're in the final fucking stretch.

189
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:21,880
Then all it is is a sweet child.

190
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,530
You crazy. Uh, what's the other one?

191
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,790
Anything goes and then you'll warm down
is a rocket queen and you fucking done.

192
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,700
That's all I do and I'm getting sick
of that cause I keep fucking doing that

193
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:40,840
every God damn day and um,
I'll just have to sweat.

194
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:43,630
You got to have like a classic album
that you just like everything wired a

195
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:48,070
fucking wire and the musicians in the
band didn't put out some bullshit 40

196
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:48,761
minute album.

197
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:53,761
They actually put out a good
like 50 minutes of music and um,

198
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,230
I dunno at that point you're throwing one
of the fucking song and you're good to

199
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:00,360
go.
My born you with this shit.

200
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,910
Well that's how fucking
bought am at the God Damn Gym.

201
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,090
What's it with these meatheads
that walk around the garlic,

202
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,500
a gallon of fucking water.
Then they never sweating either.

203
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,400
They walk around,

204
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:15,990
they got that tape handle on it walking
around like a fucking ape. Right.

205
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,980
Is that what they're
going to drink all day?

206
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:19,690
I don't understand why they're doing that.

207
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Although I do appreciate the beautiful
Leis and the spin class when I walked by

208
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:29,200
with a little half shirts on, that's kind
of Nice. Before I walk into the misery,

209
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,000
the fucking gym, no one I'm doing chest
that day and there's no fucking way.

210
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:34,641
The Bay, Oh, you know,

211
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:39,641
it was another fucking country move is
the guy who uses the bench for the bench

212
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:45,001
press to do like ab work and tricep dips
and then he just fucking sits there and

213
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,093
this,

214
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,200
yeah,

215
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,050
everybody goes for the fucking
weight bench. Nobody does squats.

216
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,960
You know what I mean? Go do your fucking
ab work on the squat machine. You can't.

217
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,030
Right. All right. That's
it. I'm done bitching.

218
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,910
Okay.

219
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,450
All right. And then we'd go,
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, Bill.

220
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,260
Why did you do this to yourself?

221
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,230
You know, it's funny when
you, as I put on weight too,

222
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,850
I always go and putting on
weight and putting on weight,

223
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,210
and then I don't want to get on the
scale because I don't want to fucking see

224
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:13,320
what I already know. But if I just
get on the scale the second I felt it,

225
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,100
I'd feel disgusted halfway down the road
instead of being all the way down the

226
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:17,934
fucking road.

227
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,340
So anyways, that's it. I'm
done. I'm done. Fucking

228
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,290
done. Fucking rag and at this point, um,

229
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,340
okay.

230
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,460
Oh mean that fucking hand sanitizers
always out at the fucking gym heads.

231
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,620
He's Christ.
I'm not a gym guy.

232
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:36,710
I just don't fucking like are they going
to want to just file that fucking guy

233
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,270
watching Duke uh,

234
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,560
San Diego state right now and
that oca for whatever his name is.

235
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,800
He did that power Saul thing where
he dunks the ball, first of all,

236
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:46,820
he's like nine feet tall.

237
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:51,230
So it's like me Dunkin on a nerf hoop
and he dunks the ball after a fast break.

238
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,790
And, and what does he do after
he dunks the ball? He does
that stupid Yellen. Yeah.

239
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,573
Okay.

240
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,960
I think you ought to get teed up for that

241
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,090
technical foul for being a Douche.
What are you doing?

242
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,630
Quit acting like you're in
fucking brave heart. It just,

243
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,340
it drives me up the fight.
I don't know.

244
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,790
Yeah.

245
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,350
They never did that.
When I was a kid,

246
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,840
Larry Bird would fucking hit a three
pointer to win the game and I though stick

247
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:19,640
his, you know his index finger in the
air like, yeah, there you go. Number one.

248
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,520
It's over.
He just back pedaled down the accordion.

249
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,790
Ah,
okay.

250
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,320
Like he says, you know, half man, half
fucking, I dunno. We'll the beast.

251
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,870
Is that the right animal?
Oh Jesus.

252
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,110
This is all the misery of you're listening
to a sore old man who realizes he has

253
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:45,850
another two and a half months of fucking
work in the gym and he's ready to quit

254
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,770
right now and go get himself a cupcake.

255
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,900
By the way, I'm going to hand to the
Greeks, man, they've got great food,

256
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,640
don't they?
But I will tell you this,

257
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:00,070
they cannot make a dessert
to save their fucking lives.

258
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,850
Oh fuck you with the honey.
Jesus Christ.

259
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:06,850
Why don't you just take a honeycomb and
roll it in flour and throw it at me?

260
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,330
It's just,
it just tastes like ass.

261
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,980
It's like they take wallpaper and they
layer it up with honey in the middle of

262
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:19,390
it. That's what fucking Buck Lavaca is a
via however the fuck you say everything

263
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:23,380
else though. Outstanding. Maybe
that's where I need to live.

264
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,450
Maybe I should go move to Greece.
I'd never get dessert.

265
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,070
Not Cause I don't want it. It's
because they don't make a good dessert.

266
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,050
And then I would be
cutting those calories out.

267
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,800
Then I could finish my dinner and after
I was done dinner and they'd be like,

268
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,680
do you want, do you want dessert? I'd
be like, no. When they go, no, no.

269
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:43,240
I don't know when they walk away and
go like, I just did something amazing.

270
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,620
Yeah.

271
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,920
Does that work for you? Well, I
don't give a fuck. It works for me.

272
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,540
What's with your attitude this
week? Huh? What happened to you?

273
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,600
What'd you do this weekend that
makes you feel so God damn important?

274
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,100
Did you fill out your brackets?
Um,

275
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,330
so anyways, chases Christ.
You know what this is,

276
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:08,290
is I have so much shit I have
to fucking do today and uh,

277
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,500
and study for my fucking examine
the bubble guys. I'm in a bubble.

278
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,220
I don't know when I'm taking the test,
but a for the helicopter license. But uh,

279
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,280
I am in the bubble right now on testing
every day that e six B is my fucking

280
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,070
bitch right now.
It's my bitch.

281
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,040
I that thing I fucking couldn't stay in
that little stupid computer thing with

282
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,950
the God damn wheel. And after a
while, once you start figuring out,

283
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,940
you really appreciate the
genius of whoever it is that
came up with that thing.

284
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,960
I'll tell you, whoever came up with that
thing, if he did it while TV existed,

285
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:41,350
that's one of the smartest human
beings that ever lived, you know?

286
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,820
Yeah.

287
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,090
I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm
going to say a man is the person that came

288
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:46,571
up with that.

289
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:50,740
And the only reason why it wasn't a woman
was because of you fill in the blank.

290
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,810
You fill in the blank with the excuse.

291
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,360
Okay?

292
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,260
Because we're not allowed to play
with paper during that decade.

293
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,403
Okay?

294
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,600
This has nothing to do with sexism.
This has to do with me.

295
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,470
I fucking hate going to the gym. Don't
let go into jail. I don't want to do this.

296
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:10,910
I don't want to do this second. I
get it done. It's fucking over. Um,

297
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,540
anyways, what else?
Jesus Christ my Bruins.

298
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,230
A fucking rip in my hat out right now,
you know.

299
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:22,920
Right when I thought they were putting it
back together. We've got the capital's,

300
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:26,190
we got Ottawa, we got big games and
we just fucking lose all of them.

301
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:29,650
I haven't even seen the auto a game. I
was working that night and I just, I,

302
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:29,821
you know,

303
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:34,770
I followed the Bruins on my phone and I
just kept seeing how anytime there's 10

304
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:39,270
goals in a game as a pretty insane
game, I have it on. I have a DV Ad,

305
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm going to watch it as much
as it's going to kill me,

306
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:46,110
but even last night we fucking lost
and over time to the fucking, uh,

307
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,840
Florida panthers in Ottawa one against
and now like, I don't know, I mean

308
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,240
Stan exam, but we're like the AC
by the skinning skin of our teeth.

309
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,500
Um, I dunno. Oh Shit.

310
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:05,780
Were playing Tampa Bay right now
or coming up? You got a fucking,

311
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,840
Tampa Bay is tough too. Ah,
cool. My kindle, we don't,
we don't have it this year.

312
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,840
I thought we were getting hard.
I thought we were going to be right.

313
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:17,841
Bruins face lightning with one point
lead for second wild card in the east.

314
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,060
Jesus Christ. I still think
the winter comes from the West.

315
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:29,110
What do you guys think?
Still think that better. Um,

316
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,480
speaking of hockey,
I was hanging out with Joe Barton,

317
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:34,750
Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend
Joe Barton neck and um,

318
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,730
he said gun to his head,

319
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:40,840
he was picking the Blackhawks and
he said maybe Saint Louis Blues.

320
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,910
I don't want to misquote him, but, uh,

321
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:46,210
if you want to hear the best
hockey show that I know of a,

322
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:50,520
you got to listen to his, uh, his puck
off podcasts, Joe Barton, nick, uh,

323
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,160
it's one of my favorites. And even
though he'd fucking rip the Bruins apart,

324
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:58,750
I couldn't argue with a lot of what he
was saying. But, um, I think this week,

325
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:02,050
rumor has it and he might be going
at his own Pittsburgh Penguins,

326
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,710
so we'll see what happens with
that. But, uh, but anyways,

327
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,430
this is the Monday morning podcast.
I do one of these every God damn week,

328
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:13,930
and then I check in on you on
Thursdays. That's how it works. And, um,

329
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,700
if you'd like to donate to this podcast
without having to give me a fucking dime

330
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,070
and feel good about yourself,

331
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:21,510
Sam,

332
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,920
you're going to Amazon rather than going
straight to amazon.com just go to my

333
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:26,491
website,

334
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:30,180
[inaudible] dot com click on the march
page and then click on the Amazon link

335
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,900
and they give me credit for driving
traffic to their website. That's,

336
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:38,760
it doesn't cost you any extra
money. No nothing, no Nada,

337
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,690
no nothing, right? So if you
would like to do that, uh,

338
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:45,090
I would really appreciate it.
And with that,

339
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,480
let's get to a little bit of advertising
here for this week. All right,

340
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,460
trunk club, everybody, Trunk,

00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,331

344
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:05,890

your style and size. Yeah. God
can only imagine those questions.

349
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:27,700
I like to tell the world that I'm off
for something, but I'm kind of shy.

350
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,150
That's a no name Izod
if I ever heard of it.

351
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,740
And then they assign a real
person who helps to style you.

352
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,090
They email you a list of clothes,
they recommend a sending you.

353
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:43,960
You approve them at no cost to you.

354
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:47,900
new clothes to your doors. Try
them on, keep what you want,

355
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,110

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,250
It's a better wardrobe.

357
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,430
And then you could pick out yourself
in minutes that I mentioned.

364
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,910
Give me a fucking break if you're not
going to charge me for the shipping.

365
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,590
For the box or the stylist. Yeah, it,

366
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,590
you just put all those charges in the
shirt. All right, let's keep going.

367
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:36,590
Only pay for the clothes you keep. No

No malls. Just great clothes.
Handpicked for your style. Um,

369
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,960
they're claiming that I used it. I have
not used it, but I got to tell you,

370
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:47,870
if I was younger, I would use
it. I don't need to use it.

371
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:52,490
I already have a woman in my life. It's
fucking over. I, this is for guys, right?

372
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,860
You're going out there,
you're striking out. You know,

373
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:56,750
you thinking it's your opening line.
It isn't.

374
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,910
It's the fact that one of your side of
your college is standing up and the other

375
00:21:59,911 --> 00:22:01,700
isn't and you need a brand new shirt.

376
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,360
Trunk Club is to get your trunk
Outta your fucking closet,

377

a fucking little elephant. Dick.

378

Going in and out of something that you
enjoy feeling the experience of, of,

379
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:14,480
of course, all of this and
consensual one. It'd be wonderful.

380
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:18,370

Okay?

385
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,640
No, that's not true. You put
clothes on and go see people.

386
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,440
You don't have to go outside
to get shaved. You know,

387
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,040
you don't have to go and you don't
have to go to the post office.

You don't have to buy
razor blades anymore.

389
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,480
You don't have to go shopping for clothes.

390
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,000
Funny and pitch pissed the
people off at nature box.

409
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:55,270

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,650
What's the gym today? But I'll tell you
I had a rough one. You know Jesus Christ.

432
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,920
Okay?

433
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,090
Why do I do this to myself?

434
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:23,470
What is it that makes you just you and
you know you're gaining weight just makes

435
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,120
you knock it on the fucking scale,

436
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,240
okay?

437
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
It just makes it worse.

438
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,470
If you're sitting there right now and
you know you're putting on weight and you

439
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:34,040
don't want to step on the
scale, do yourself the biggest
fucking favor right now.

440
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,870
Stop listening to this podcast.

441
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,230
Go in step on the scale
and see what the damages.

442
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,540
It's going to be a dope beat.
Fucking San Diego state.

443
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,040
They pulled away in the end
one way 19. Um, you know,

444
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,930
if you don't do it now,
you just going to keep going.

445
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,020
You're going to keep going further and
you're going to be as miserable as I am

446
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:58,420
right now. Fucking miserable. Um,

447
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,670
yeah, Jesus Christ. Why
did I do that to myself?

448
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,510
Jesus Christ. It looked like the fucking
Michelin man. I hide it. Well though,

449
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:08,811
I'll tell you,

450
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:12,400
you're going to hide a good 25 pounds
of fucking absolute shit with a fucking

451
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:16,030
button down shirt. You know that. Well,
that's what I used to say. It was your,

452
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:21,010
you're in sport coach shape, buttoned
down, shirt, shape, tee shirts, shape,

453
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,290
wifebeater shape,
no shirt shape.

454
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:29,610
And then the ultimate is no shirts
sitting down in shape. That's right there.

455
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:33,450
That is the deep be in shape pyramid.
All right.

456
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:37,680
Now and right now I am somewhere between,
I'm like buttoned down, shirt shape.

457
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,390
Um, I'll tell you, you really
want to discuss yourself,

458
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,160
you know,

459
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,130
cause you really gotta be disgusted with
yourself before you finally work out.

460
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:49,960
I find this is what you should do.

461
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,470
Stand shirtless in the mirror,

462
00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:57,670
looking at yourself with a pair
of dad jeans in suspenders.

463
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,490
Okay. And, uh, the level discussed
you'll have for yourself,

464
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:07,360
you'll be dragging your ass to
the fucking gym. Like I, I am. Um,

465
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,040
and I, I apologize for how country
and be in this week. Um, anyways, um,

466
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,420
I'm heading back east,
coming up here in a little bit and um,

467
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,990
that's just one. If it's this,
it's still snowing in New York.

468
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,970
Is it melting or their ice dams?
Is the world ending back there?

469
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,813
MMM.

470
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,320
I have no fucking idea. I hadn't
back. They're coming back to as soon.

471
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:36,250
I just gotta hit the gym for the rest
of this fucking week and then I'll go to

472
00:27:36,251 --> 00:27:40,870
New York next week and everything will
be fine and I'll be back there with all

473
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:45,871
the fucking animals that I used to drink
with and eat pizza late at night with.

474
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:48,400
And I'm just going to have to fucking
somehow plow through that shit.

475
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,560
But anyways, you don't want to
hear about that shit. Why don't we,

476
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:54,040
why don't we go fucking take a quick
look at some, uh, some world news,

477
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,810
some quarreled news, some
news from the quarreled. Um,

478
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,010
yeah, it's always, I never
go to a u s uh, new sites.

479
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,430
I try to stay away from those fucking
things cause I always hear all that shit

480
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,520
anyways, if I don't hear it on the
news, I hear comedians talking about it.

481
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,750
So I like going to fucking Algebra.
Xera I like checking out.

482
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:15,220
See what Al's talking about.

483
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,690
Son of Ukraine's ex president
drowns in a Russian lake.

484
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,700
The youngest son of Ukraine's,

485
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:27,810
former president Viktor Yanukovych.

486
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,170
You're know fit. What a fucking
great name you'll Milkovich Vick.

487
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,010
Viktor Yanukovych sounds like a
fucking hall of fame. Defensemen. Um,

488
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:38,630
has died after his vehicle,

489
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:42,650
punched through the ice near
the Russian Mongolian border.

490
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,190
The fuck was he doing all the way over
there and associate of the deposed

491
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,830
precedent set. I'll depose the
guy got booted. What did he do?

492
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,020
Did he stick a cigar?

493
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:58,880
And somebody taught on Sun set on
Sunday that the 33 year old victor,

494
00:28:58,881 --> 00:28:59,350
Ian,

495
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,590
you know Kovich who had the same name
as his father was driving at the time of

496
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:04,424
his death.

497
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,530
Russian authorities have not identified
a driver who died on Friday when a mini

498
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:14,531
bus carrying six people smashed on thin
ice on Lake Baikal or confirm reports

499
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:21,050
that it was your Nocca bitches son. The
five passengers survived. Wait a minute.

500
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:25,520
Are you talking about this guy was
driving a bus? How the fuck are you,

501
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:28,190
the son of the president,
you're driving a bus carrying six people.

502
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,020
He must've been the rebel of the family.
You know,

503
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,080
it didn't want to follow in his
dad's footsteps and fuck this.

504
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,450
Yeah.

505
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,440
I'm going to go drive the fucking
hurts shuttle just north of Mongolia.

506
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,093
Is that what he did?

507
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,710
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking way to go.

508
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,030
I'll tell you what I will never always
amaze me is when fucking Ted Kennedy went

509
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:51,880
into that Damn Lake.
You know what I mean?

510
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,760
You'd think the weight of his giant head
alone. I mean that guy's head is like a,

511
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,980
was like a safe, I saw that guy
shook his hand one time. Um,

512
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:04,920
it's a long story right after I shook
Bill Clinton's hand, I was standing, um,

513
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,570
we're standing on the side of the road
in Boston and a buddy of mine wanted to

514
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:14,250
go down and see it. He's like,
all the presidents coming down,

515
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:15,690
let's go look at the fucking motorcade.

516
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:19,680
Me and this other fucking friend of mine
who was a total pothead and we could

517
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:23,790
give a shit. We were bleary
eyed. We went down there and uh,

518
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,230
Clinton came down the street and he
just wanted to see the motorcade.

519
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,950
And right as he was coming to drive by us,

520
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,560
the motor came dipped
down this fucking alley.

521
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,260
And then we're looking at a buddy
going, yeah, that was great, dude.

522
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,850
They fucking made a left turn.
And I,

523
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:38,790
we didn't see it and I got Nada and
i's going in there and make a speech or

524
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:42,090
probably being there for like an hour.
I'm going to go get a slice of pizza.

525
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,400
You guys want anything? We were
like, Nah, we're good, we're good.

526
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,900
So the dude who wants to see the motorcade
goes off to go see if get a fucking

527
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:52,350
slice of pizza. Me and the pod had a
fucking standing there not giving a shit.

528
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,560
All of a sudden the crowd
starts going nuts, right?

529
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,350
Going fucking crazy.

530
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,620
And the secret service guys were
behind this police get barricades.

531
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:04,090
Tell everybody, put their hands up,
keep your hands up all day and job.

532
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:06,250
We can ship. Keep your hands
up. They're like freaking out.

533
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,870
And all of a sudden he comes all slick
Willie walking up the fucking street high

534
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,500
five and people while the,
the,

535
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:18,370
the wellies limo is driving slowly along
next to him with the fucking door open

536
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,310
and walking right behind
him was fucking Ted Kennedy.

537
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:27,540
So a I high five Bill Clinton when he
was president before Monica Lewinsky.

538
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:30,630
This is his first term, right? Soft hands.

539
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,970
Soft like fucking,
I dunno what creepy.

540
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:40,600
Soft fucking hands.
Little hands. Little soft.

541
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:45,520
Fucking baby grows hands. But he did
have long piano flame playing fingers.

542
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,960
It was not a good experience.
It was getting who I didn't
want to be there. Right.

543
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,980
And then Ted Kennedy can want to
high five him and the sheer size,

544
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,390
the sheer mass of the guy's
head. I literally went, whoa.

545
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,780
You couldn't fucking believe the fact
that get that guy, his head was so big,

546
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,980
he never should have had a full
head of hair just other than this,

547
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,960
the sheer like surface
area of it that just,

548
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,410
even if he had a full head of hair,
it's not going to be a full head,

549
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:14,460
but that fucking head.

550
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:15,870
Yeah.

551
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,690
I'll tell you right now. Thank God that
guy didn't go bald, man. Jesus Christ,

552
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:21,720
that would have been us. That would
have been something to look at. Um,

553
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,820
so I shook his fucking hand and Jesus
Christ, he just looked like, you know,

554
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,340
yeah,

555
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,260
I know he was sober at that point, but
that guy, that guy lived a fucking, he,

556
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,920
I'll tell you know the rough one. You
know, fucking lost three of his brothers,

557
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,590
the thing that happened to his
sister and the whole fuck crazy.

558
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,750
And he goes in the lake, he
killed somebody. Oh my God.

559
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,880
Can you imagine his fucking
wife sleeping next to him?

560
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:51,440
How much does that guy talking to sleep?
Hi You, I had nothing to do with that.

561
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:55,160
Huh? I came in on the drag.
Huh? Jack it down. Get down.

562
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,520
Um, yeah, that's brutal. Anyways,

563
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,910
so then Bill Clinton
jumps in his fucking car.

564
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:06,260
Ted Kennedy jumps in with them and they
just fucking take off and everybody's

565
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:09,730
like, no, never just sort of walks away.

566
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,470
And then like all of that
took maybe like 17 seconds

567
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,920
and then everybody was gone and the whole
fucking thing was over. It was like,

568
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:23,070
it never happened.
And then we turn around and it comes,

569
00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:27,130
my buddy coming up the street,
biting into a slice of pizza and navigate,

570
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,150
he bites in and then he like stopped mid
bite and he looks around and he goes,

571
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,370
ah, fuck. He's like,
did I miss it? He goes,

572
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:43,350
did I miss it? And I
go, yeah. And I go, uh,

573
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,630
I shook his hand,

574
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,320
just watch go. He came
walking up the street. I,

575
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,820
I shook his head and my
buddy goes, no, you didn't.

576
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,110
And then he looks over,

577
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:03,111
I look over and there's my pot had friend
whose like galloping in a circle and

578
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:07,050
he's just jumping up and down as
he's galloping and he's going, okay.

579
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,020
I shook it twice.
I shook it twice.

580
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,060
Ah, you could have seen the
look on that dude's face.

581
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:20,030
He was so fucking disappointed. We
didn't even tell them about Ted Kennedy.

582
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,173
MMM.

583
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,100
Anyways,
so there's that story.

584
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,400
There's that story for you.

585
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,933
MMM.

586
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,720
So anyways,
baseball season is starting up.

587
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm wondering what my red sox
are going to do this year.

588
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,490
They went out and they spent
a bunch of fucking money.

589
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,580
Yankees haven't spent any money, man,
they're in a weird place right now.

590
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,290
Um,
but

591
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,720
I'm excited for baseball this year.
I hope it goes the way it did last year.

592
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,010
I'd like to see more
Baltimore, Tampa, Kansas City,

593
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,470
maybe Cleveland, you know,
Milwaukee. I liked all those,

594
00:34:56,471 --> 00:35:01,240
all those fucking teams. You know what
I mean? I like, uh, I like seeing like,

595
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,380
you know, I like to see the Padres do
something. Somebody different, you know,

596
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:08,830
I like what the Dodgers did
last year too, but um, you know,

597
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,870
it's Kinda hard to be a fan of
a team that goes out and blows,

598
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,080
spends all the fucking money.
I know it's legal and that type of shit,

599
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:16,150
but it's just the way
that they run that league.

600
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,540
They should do it more like football,
which I hope they're doing.

601
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,680
And I hope last year was not like
this anomaly. Did I say that right?

602
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:27,550
I lost confidence as I was saying.
That's why I went. Anomaly anomaly.

603
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,520
Um Oh good, good. All the
Guy Clark Kellogg is going
to act out a basketball shot.

604
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:36,310
Thank God. Oh, here we go.
Yeah, do it. And your wing tips.

605
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,080
Now it comes the other guy.

606
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,740
Now what you want to do is pivot here.
Now you see if you do that,

607
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,090
that's called a travel.

608
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:44,830
Okay?

609
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,770
Like this. Does anybody learn the game
of basketball right here? Like you don't,

610
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,380
fuck did I just say the game of
basketball? Like a Michael Jordan?

611
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,743
MMM.

612
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,370
Oh Jesus Christ. Why do they do this? Who?
The person that came up with this like,

613
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:58,671
you know,

614
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:03,000
let's get half a football field in here
and have these old guys get down to

615
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:06,110
there. Three point stance. Hey, low. Well
why can't we do that with basketball?

616
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,000
That's what I love about hockey.
They don't,

617
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:11,120
they can't do it when they go out
there with street hockey sticks.

618
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:13,683
MMM.

619
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,610
It's so dumb. Why do they wear suits too,
by the way? They're fucking pro athletes.

620
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,340
Okay. Just get them there in
their sweat pants and t shirts.

621
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,420
Okay.

622
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,070
What's with the habit dash

623
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,670
I, you know something. I am like

624
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,020

I don't think I've liked one thing yet.

podcasts and I'm putting Audi. I got,

626

My wife and I have a longer commute on
Mondays and Fridays and a couple months

658
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,870
ago she said,

659
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,650
how about you write in and ask bill
if he can do another one on Fridays?

660
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,060
I told her not to get greedy and that
we're lucky the man hasn't retired yet.

661
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,540
Jesus am I that old. Lo

Love you. Love Nia. Thanks again.
Couple of commuters from Ontario.

665
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,510
Nice. Ontario, Canada. Uh,
you, uh, you maple leaf fans.

666
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,410
You know who else is in
Ontario? Toronto. Ontario.

667
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,440
Okay.

668
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,260
I already forget. What the fuck
is. Quebec. Which providence
is that in? Not Quebec.

669
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:27,180
You idiot. I mean Ottawa is
Ottawa and Quebec or Ontario.

670
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,380
I Dunno.

671
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,130
But I do know it's the capitol and at
the fucking river freezes over and you

672
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:34,430
could skate to work. And I've been
there. How about that? Is that,

673
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,940
isn't that enough for you? Um,
well thank you for listening. Um,

674
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,710
I'm actually looking at a Toronto date,
possibly in the fall. It all depends.

675
00:39:43,711 --> 00:39:47,760
I've got a little bit of acting
work. Alright. Oh Billy Shakespeare.

676
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:52,500
It was going to do possibly another
movie or to, uh, later on this year.

677
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,090
And uh, oh, I want to thank everybody
who went out to go see Zam beavers. Uh,

678
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,270
please continue to see it. Uh, got
a lot of hilarious emails about it,

679
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:01,410
saying that it was funny.

680
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,450
It made fun of Zombie movies and had
respect for it and they actually jumped

681
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:10,500
like three or four times. It was
legitimately scary. A lot of nudity in it,

682
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,360
you know, old school
fucking horse shit. Um,

683
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,380
once again directed by a Jordan Rubin
stand up comic that I started out with a

684
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:21,710
long time ago. So a that always
helps. That helps me out. You know,

685
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:26,130
if shit that I'm in does well, so thank
you guys for checking it out. And um,

686
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,370
if you don't get a chance to
check it out in movie theaters,

687
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:33,040
please a download legally.
Um,

688
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:37,770
so you can see more raw
movies about rodents in farm.
It's to turn into zombies.

689
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,900
Um, by the way, I watched it again.
You got to see Sam Rockwell and moon.

690
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,060
I swear to God, you got to
see that fucking thing. I'm
not a big Scifi guy and uh,

691
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:51,510
it was so good a knee and I were actually
saying that we want to watch more

692
00:40:51,511 --> 00:40:55,140
Scifi.
So if you have some good Saifai um,

693
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,310
am I slowly turning into a fucking what
does that, what does that think? Comicon.

694
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,220
Am I gonna be one of those people?

695
00:40:59,221 --> 00:41:00,990
I'm already dressing up
like drummers and shit.

696
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,210
What's the difference between
that and dressing up like Spock?

697
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,220
Okay.

698
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,520
I don't know. All right.
Woman in the warehouse.

699
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,360
I love when I get letters from females.
I never get them on this thing. Okay.

700
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,110
Woman in the warehouse. Dear
Bill, I'm a 27 year old. Yeah.

701
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,080
And I work in a warehouse in
Philly. Hey, good for you.

702
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:23,520
I used to work in warehousing.

703
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:24,660
Okay.

704
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,070
It's one of my favorite fucking jobs
I ever had and I always said that if I

705
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,610
wasn't going to get older and I wasn't,
I wasn't

706
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,680
going to turn 30 someday.
Um,

707
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,370
I would have stayed there forever
because it was such a fun fucking job.

708
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,860
Whose physical?
You got a good workout in.

709
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:42,980
Everybody that worked in the
warehouse was either a class clown,

710
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,730
a struggling musician,
uh,

711
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,830
a fucking drug addict.
It was,

712
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,260
everybody was a character out there
and they were all fucking, yeah,

713
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,680
hilarious.
I loved,

714
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:57,490
I never understood wanting to get into
the carpet area and get yourself a little

715
00:41:57,491 --> 00:42:01,540
Michael J. Fox, you know, what was that?

716
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,430
Sick commies, family ties, dressing
up like him with your Goddamn loafers,

717
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,670
you know, acting like you're
in there making decisions.

718
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,690
The decisions have been made
for you. You know, you go in,

719
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:18,210
you sit in your little half
a fucking office and you
and you act accordingly. Um,

720
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:18,870
he says,
I,

721
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,900
she says I work in a warehouse in Philly
and involves some manual labor and I

722
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:26,130
like it. It's just part time. Um,

723
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,410
as I'm getting my master's in English,
they like,

724
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:32,140
what are you working at a ups
that was the big thing back then.

725
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:37,141
$8 an hour to fucking work harder than
you'll ever work and your life on loading

726
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:42,691
those trucks fucking thing heavy as 70
boxes and then you have like an entire

727
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:48,250
exhaust system that job's a motherfucker.
I'm the guys in the warehouse, so cool.

728
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:52,990
But they always act like I'm going to
rat them to HR if I hear them make jokes

729
00:42:52,991 --> 00:42:57,040
about women, et cetera. What can
I say to end this? Any advice?

730
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,050
Um, well, first of all, your cool
if you don't mind that they do it.

731
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,930
Do you have to understand,
um,

732
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,530
that's the climate right now is that
if you make any sort of any joke,

733
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,360
if you say anything about
women other than, you know,

734
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:19,940
we'll, I'll tell you it's a damn shame
that more women don't, blah, blah, blah.

735
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,530
If you say anything about women,
the way you say hello to him and he,

736
00:43:23,531 --> 00:43:27,550
all they have to do is just say that
you're making them uncomfortable. Um,

737
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:28,181
and next thing you know,

738
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:32,050
they're losing their job and then they
have this fucking creepy sex thing on

739
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:36,970
their fucking resume,
sexual harassment or some shit like that.

740
00:43:36,971 --> 00:43:41,840
So, uh, I dunno if I hear them
make any jokes about, well,

741
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,640
what can I say to end this?
Any advice? Um, you know what?

742
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:48,050
I wouldn't get involved in it.

743
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,360
Okay.

744
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,120
I wouldn't get, I don't know why
you want to get involved in it.

745
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,870
I don't know why you want to open
that Pandora's box. No Pun intended.

746
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,830
Just stay away from it. All right? Don't,

747
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:03,100
you're going to get them in
trouble or worst case scenario,

748
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,090
you're going to be one of those
people. Oh, I'm totally cool then.

749
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:09,900
And then uh oh well I'm not with that.
How could you say that? And then you go,

750
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:13,320
actually yeah, go to HR. And I'm not
saying you're one of these women,

751
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:17,340
but you are a woman. So you know
what I'm talking about. All right.

752
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,890
Talking about the old bait and switch
with the hoo ha there. So stay away.

753
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:29,220
Don't go fucking, you know, don't
go over there. Bite in the apple.

754
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,960
All right. The parameters have been
set by a bunch of fucking people.

755
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:41,710
Bitch moaning and complaining
and people adhere to those rules.

756
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:46,120
So every one of those guys by you
opening the doors saying, guys,

757
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:49,690
I don't care if you fucking talk
about women in a derogatory way.

758
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,660
You're opening a door for
all of them to get fired.

759
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:56,950
So it seems to me that you want to be
one of the guys and you want to be cool.

760
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:58,300
So if you want to do that,

761
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:03,460
then just fucking respect the fact that
they're respecting you and don't pick at

762
00:45:03,461 --> 00:45:06,990
that scab because you're going to
get it demond trouble. All right.

763
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,570
They go, um, well too.

764
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,400
That makes me a god. It makes me wish
I was still in my twenties. Again,

765
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,900
there was nothing better than that.

766
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,010
You worked in the warehouse all day and
once a week you played softball against

767
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:25,840
some other fucking warehouse. And at
the end of the game, UAVs the best.

768
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:28,690
We used to go to this
fucking, uh, you know,

769
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:32,830
a Massachusetts like every
other town just has like,

770
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,880
you know, they have placed that
claims, they have the best bar pizza.

771
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:40,810
So it would almost be like a small pizza
that you get at some chain thing. And,

772
00:45:40,811 --> 00:45:44,350
um, we had the place where,
where I was at, which I'm
not going to say the name of,

773
00:45:44,351 --> 00:45:46,840
cause I don't want fucking bunch of
people going there. So when I go there,

774
00:45:46,841 --> 00:45:50,980
I got to stand in line. But, um, we
used to go to the original location.

775
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:54,070
It's since changed in, of course
people bitched and moaned. Okay Dude,

776
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,270
all the original flavors in those
old, on your oven. Right. You know,

777
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,750
um, it's like, no, it isn't.
All your memories are there.

778
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,560
Your grandfather took
you there and you're sad.

779
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,390
So now you can say the
pizza doesn't taste as good.

780
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,640
They fucking literally moved
like 20 fucking minutes
down the street. All right,

781
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:14,850
grow up. Not even that. It's like a
fucking six minute drive. So anyways,

782
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:17,580
we used to go there afterwards and uh,

783
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,900
oh it's the fucking best.
You worked all day,

784
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:25,800
you played softball and he just
slam like fucking six beers,

785
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,920
eat a pizza
and then drive home.

786
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,000
Cause it was the fucking eighties, you
know, drive home buzzed, which was stupid,

787
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:38,140
but you know,
and a pass out,

788
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:39,610
wake up and do it all over again.

789
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,633
MMM.

790
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,240
I always enjoy, I enjoy manual
labor jobs that are inside. I was,

791
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:50,470
I did not enjoy manual labor outside
just because I would get sunburned like a

792
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:52,810
motherfucker. But, um,

793
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,210
I did like driving around what
people when they will plow a plowing,

794
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:01,030
plowing driveways and going
out and shoveling snow. But a,

795
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,960
you really fuck up your back.
That's how Larry Bird, same thing.

796
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:08,500
Larry Bird blacktop, his
parent's driveway. And you know,

797
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:12,940
that little stupid little stick fucking
handle thing that's built for a guy my

798
00:47:12,941 --> 00:47:14,560
size. He was like six, 10.

799
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:15,910
Okay.

800
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,570
Bent over at the fucking waste doing
that. His back was never the same. But uh,

801
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,190
whenever I hear that Shit,
I don't know.

802
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,190
It makes me happy that I have
a job where I don't have to

803
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:26,940
fucking lifted anything.
You know, it's funny,

804
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:29,950
I was making fun of Bill Clinton's
fucking soft hands. I have soft hands.

805
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:33,640
The only cows is, I have on my hands
at this point is from doing pull ups.

806
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,530
Oh, Billy soft dance. All
right. Uh, repeat television.

807
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,560
Hey Bill. I watched TV like every other
American and citizen of the world.

808
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,620
I watch a lot of Seinfeld
and Simpson reruns.

809
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,400
I was wondering what
shows you wrote shoes,

810
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,600
what shows you're a,
you're able to watch over and over again.

811
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,070
Also what shows could you watch as
a kid that were before your time?

812
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,970
Oh, what I, that I, I was not mature
enough to watch over groundbreaking.

813
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,890
Um,
last a great question.

814
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:15,550
Let's see what shows can I watch over
and over and over again? The Simpsons,

815
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,570
you already said them.

816
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,480
MMM.

817
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,650
Let's see.
You know what it is,

818
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,210
there's not a lot of them
because I really got into sports,

819
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,260
you know, in my teens. So they were,

820
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,890
I used to watch family
ties. I would watch, um,

821
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,060
I would watch cheers.

822
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,030
I tried to watch the Cosby show,

823
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,560
but I couldn't stand his wife on
the show when she would do that.

824
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:50,980
Stupid joke was she knew we'll clear
it's going to do this and then clear the

825
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:52,030
clear.
My hated the thing.

826
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,270
And then I hated that overly cutesy
shit he would do with the kids.

827
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:58,480
Like it was a Jello commercial. And, um,

828
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,230
but I did like the show when I would
actually give it a fucking chance.

829
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,420
I liked the show. Um, but I, I dunno,

830
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,620
I just,
there was just,

831
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:11,620
they was such a goody goody f it
was like the fucking Brady bunch.

832
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:15,120
I just can't get into that shit. You
know, it means it's good. He good. He,

833
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,190
his family ties was, I at
least liked it. Michael J.

834
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,470
Fox character was kind of a dick.
He was like a Republican,

835
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:24,070
which I thought was different, you know.
And that was probably another awful one.

836
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:27,970
I can't remember, I would
say, but the shit that I
actually go back and watch, um,

837
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,260
it's just all shit from
my childhood. Um, I like,

838
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,780
I'll watch an episode of chips now.

839
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:38,650
I love watching ships whenever it
comes on because I live in la now,

840
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:43,030
so I try to guess which highway they're
on, what, which one they're filming.

841
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:44,260
Okay.

842
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:48,460
Um, which one they're filming
on. I'll watch Charlie's angels.

843
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:51,070
I guess that was ahead of my time.
I will watch Charlie's angels.

844
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,033
MMM.

845
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,560
Beretta, which was considered
really violent swat. The rookies,

846
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:02,360
$6 million man. Um,
those were all the show.

847
00:50:02,361 --> 00:50:05,360
Happy days. I spoke to one
corn ball, one that I watched

848
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,140
and then I would watch reruns
of the monkeys. I saw every
episode of the monkeys,

849
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:15,820
every episode of the Brady Bunch. Uh,
and then I watched all the Westerns,

850
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:22,040
bonanza, big valley.
What's the one with the,

851
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,050
the guy would fucking the rifle man.

852
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,740
Stupid son used to always call him Paul.
He used to drive me nuts.

853
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,860
Fucking do with cry like every fucking
three episodes. I couldn't stand him.

854
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:32,723
Batman.

855
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,210
Okay.

856
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,740
Jesus Christ. I've wasted a lot
of fucking time, didn't I? Yeah,

857
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:44,970
mostly shit back then. But then in the
90s, I started doing standup in like 1992.

858
00:50:44,971 --> 00:50:49,800
So I never even really saw Seinfeld. I
just remember hearing about it. By 93,

859
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:54,090
it blew up and everyone was talking about
him was on the cover of rolling stone

860
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:54,924
and shit.

861
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:59,930
But I didn't really watch it until it
came into reruns because then it came on

862
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:03,480
during a time where I
could actually see it. Um,

863
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,390
what do I watch now? I watch archer, uh,

864
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,480
I watch last man on earth.

865
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,710
I Dunno now in the TV
watching is different now.

866
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:20,990
So He'd go on Netflix and
you're like Binge Watch.

867
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,390
Like I still haven't started better
call Saul. And I know that, you know,

868
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,420
maybe next week when I go on the road
I'm going to watch the pilot episode in

869
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:31,250
the second one,
I have every other one tape.

870
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:36,251
What happened to me was that show started
when I was overseas and I forgot to

871
00:51:36,411 --> 00:51:39,140
set my fucking DVF. So, uh,

872
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:43,670
I got to get caught up in that
old Joey roses is in it. Joe Doe,

873
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:46,730
Rosa where the SOM Dan and
there's something, something.

874
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,890
So a lot of people have been asking me,
hey bill,

875
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,230
are you going to be on better call Saul?

876
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:54,260
And this is what I'll tell
you if you guys keep watching.

877
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:58,070
I have a good feeling that eventually,
cause it's a prequel,

878
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,520
the closer he gets to meet and Walter
White at some point I might drop at my

879
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,760
character might come back. That's all I
know. Okay. I'm not in the writer's room.

880
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,670
I have no idea. So, uh, if you
could, if you could keep watching it,

881
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:15,080
I'd appreciate it. Listen to
me is, I haven't even started.
I'm starting this week.

882
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:17,660
All right. That's my promise
to you and I'm going to keep,

883
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
no,
I did.

884
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,580
Um, all right, thanks. And Go
fuck yourself. All right. Camping.

885
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,260
Hey Bill,
you ever do any serious or casual camping?

886
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,840
Is that something you
think you could do you,

887
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:35,990
but is that something you think you
could Nia into? You mean talk Nia into,

888
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,230
um,

889
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:41,250
I've gone on some field trips as a kid
and recently with friends and I'm trying

890
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:43,650
to help my girlfriend to go.
She's hesitant.

891
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,260
I assured her it would be warm weather,
camping,

892
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,970
that'd be swimming and smores and all
that, all that stuff. Thoughts on camping.

893
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,170
Um,

894
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:57,360
and whether a chick should just relax
for a weekend without a curling iron.

895
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,060
Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, always one. Yeah.

896
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,830
Say that. Um, the y
camp, no, I respect it.

897
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,930
But, um, I think I went camping once.

898
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,900
I told this story before I met this
chicken at college and she's like,

899
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:14,590
we were going camping and
I was like, well, I want to
hook up with the ASL. Yeah,

900
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:19,210
I'll go. And, uh, I don't
know what happened. I seen
all, I'm out there, I'm like,

901
00:53:19,211 --> 00:53:21,520
fucking 30. I'm hanging with these
college kids. And I was like,

902
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:22,990
what the fuck am I doing out here?

903
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,450
We got hammered and nothing ended up
happening. And I think I puked in a tent,

904
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,290
which means I did puke in a tent, but
I'm embarrassed. So even years later,

905
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,970
I had to say,
I think I puked in a tent.

906
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,030
Um,
so that's my experience.

907
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:44,970
Um, I don't know. On my bucket list is
getting mauled is not on my bucket list,

908
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:49,510
so I'm not into like, I would
go camping if I had, uh,

909
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:53,100
a fucking glock in a rifle.
I would do that,

910
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:57,330
but I don't like that shit
where I'm sleeping in a tent
and then a bear comes up

911
00:53:57,331 --> 00:54:01,090
and smells my food or something and then
looks at the tent and can smell me and

912
00:54:01,091 --> 00:54:05,460
not the tent. And me become like
a fruit roll up or a burrito. Oh,

913
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:09,720
Billy burrito. And that thing just
starts biting my head. Fuck that.

914
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,370
Fuck that. Um, but I do respect people
that actually go out there and, um,

915
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,820
no out of fucking rough
it and live off the land.

916
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:21,240
You know what you state of the art
tense in your fucking heated socks.

917
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,680
But as far as your girlfriend
not wanting to go, uh, why maker?

918
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,790
Why maker? She's going to be miserable,
which is going to make you miserable.

919
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:33,540
Why don't you just have that be the thing
that you do that's just separate time

920
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:36,900
from her absence makes the heart grow
fonder and then you guys come back

921
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:39,930
together. Why don't you, why don't
you just do that instead of trying to,

922
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,660
trying to talk her into that shit.

923
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:45,160
And I would never try to talk
my wife into that stuff. Uh,

924
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,480
I've asked her a couple times and she
has no fucking desire on any level.

925
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:54,960
She's a city girl. She does not
want to go fucking being a tent.

926
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,810
You want to rent a house by a lake,
you know,

927
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,010
with windows and doors and a fireplace.
She's all about it. But you know,

928
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:06,480
as far as like going out there eating
beans with a knife out of a fucking can

929
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:08,760
yet. No, she's not into that. All right,

930
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:13,140
let's read the last couple of advertisers
here and then we'll wrap up the thing

931
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:13,980
here.
Um,

932
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,890
what do we got here? Oh, dollar

933
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,510

about dollar shave club.com.

The company that delivers amazing
raises for a few bucks a month.

936
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,250
I know a razor that costs
a few bucks delivery,

937
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,690
a great shave also seems too
good to be true, right? Well,

938
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:40,860
listen up, but you really have to do

an idiot to keep over pay.

944
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,170
I'm a massive, I hate this
paragraph. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

bye.

949
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:21,220
It's phenomenal. If you're still

954
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:36,850
man,
of everything that I've advertised,

955
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:40,470
that's the one thing
everybody is going crazy for.

956
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:44,620
[inaudible] and I have not
had one bad tweet about it.

957
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:49,540
Everybody has said it's awesome,
so I can really stand behind that product.

958
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:53,710
Man, I don't know why nobody thought
to do that sooner. Fucking brilliant.

959
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:57,010
I do remember years ago that somebody
came out with a thing that would sharpen

960
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:58,180
your razors, your, your,

961
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:02,950
your razor blades so you wouldn't have
to throw him out and that thing came and

962
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:06,580
went really quick. I think they got
bought out by like Gillette or something.

963
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:09,520
I would guess it's like, dude,
don't fucking sell that thing.

964
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,860
You're going to cut into our profits.
So they just went up and you know,

965
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,600
just slap the guy in the face with a
bunch of hundreds and the dude probably

966
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:20,590
took it, you know. Anyways,
oh, Kansas is playing.

967
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:25,460
This is my fucking team. I don't watch
a lot of college who, but Kansas. Uh,

968
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,310
one of my bucket list things is to go
to a home game out there in Kansas. Um,

969
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,680
oh, nice. I'm almost done here.

970
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:35,680
I'm watching this fucking game
they played in Wichita state. Oh,

971
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:40,300
it's a little in state rivalry
here. Eight to five, Kansas early.

972
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,310
Um,
stamps.com everybody,

973
00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:46,060
when you think about the best
time to go to the post office,

974
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:49,990
you're probably guessing before work,
after work or during lunch, wrong.

975
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,350
That's when it's most crowded.
Everyone's going at the same time.

976
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,950
What you need to do is
call in sick from work. Uh,

977
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:59,620
the truth is there's no convenient
time to go to the post office.

978
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:03,340
That's why you need stamps.com
with stamps.com access.

979
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:07,360
You can access all the services of
the post office right from your desk.

980
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:11,740
You can buy and print official US postage
for any letter or package using your

981
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:15,820
computer or printer.
Then just hand it to your mail carrier.

982
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:20,910
It's so easy and I saw
you, I stretch. I ran.

983
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:25,870
Now Sean de Grasse. Um, and unlike
the post office stamps.com is open 24,

convenient for you. I use stamps.com
I use stamps.com dot, dot,

986
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,830

to send out all my posters,

987
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,150
which I'm going to do right now.

988
00:58:40,151 --> 00:58:44,800
I'm actually looking at the first draft
of the Billy Bible belt poster. Uh,

989
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,630

991
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,690
whoring myself out,
um,

992
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,870
selling those things after every
show from my big southern tour.

know I'm going to gain 10 pounds in this

00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:05,040
tour. The amount of fun that I'm going
to have and a about a week out, um,
